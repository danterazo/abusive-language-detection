An overview in the nutshell

The following suggestion for entry by the """"Bubbleblaster"""" that kept deleted may read better when dispersed in the pertinent sections in the main article, rather than a recap at the end.
 
(""""Everytime I hear the word """"culture"""", I reach my revolver"""" Herman Goering)

He lost his father at age 7 and was taken out of school to live at a village at age 8. He was beaten sensless by his tutor at age 10 and was taken out of his new school again. He failed to achieve cumulative average score for his favorite school he always dreamt of, at age 17. He was arrested when 24, interrogated for days and put in solitary cell confinement for two months. He was 25 when sent to exile. When his colleague associate and close friend that is one year older than him was declared a hero by the association that he was serving, nobody noted him. When he was fighting to save cities from foreign occupations at age 30, his hometown fell to the enemy. His superior lobbied for him to be sent away to get rid of him when he was 30. He was left idle at his new location and could not get paid for months. He was in a hospital in Vienna for renal treatment confined to a bed for months lonely when he was 37. When returned to work, the army he would command was disbanded. He was fired by the Minister of Defense at age 38. He owned no civilian clothes to wear, no money saved and had to borrow a coat from a friend. An arrest warrant was issued for him the same year. A death order was issued for him when 39. He became the President of the Turkish republic when he was 42. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk read 18 thousand volumes of books in which over 200 000 lines are highlighted. Tens of thousands of sidenotes were entered. When found with red weepy eyes, he said his only worry was burning eyes which he took care of yards of soft fabric he'd ordered by his side to dry his eyes. He put his signature under the biggest changes and revolutions of his time. His farewell was equally impressive and touching with the last words of ‘.. and peace be upon you..’ in the morning of November 10, 1938 when Turkey was just waking up.""",0

Since the corners are affected by the move F like

F = {1, 2, 3, 4} {5} {6} {7} {9}

the sequence FRBL does

FRBL = {1, 7} {2, 4} {3, 6} {5, 8}

that is, four 2-cycles so FRBL2 will return the corners to their original combination (ignoring twists - for now).  For the edges,

FRBL = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12} {4, 10, 7}

a 9-cycle and a 3-cycle.  The lowest common multiple (LCM) of a 9-cycle and a 3-cycle is a 9-cycle, hence the edges will be returned to their original combination by FRBL9 (ignnoring flips).

The LCM of a 2-cycle and a 9-cycle is a 18-cycle hence 

M = FRBL18 (72 moves)

is required to return both corners and edges to their original combination.  However, if they do not return with the correct twists and flips (haven't checked, can't be bothered, too much effort, but I seem to remember - from my now highly unreliable memory - that when I actually tried this move over 30 years ago it did twist and flip) then the sequence will have to be repeated to correct this.  Twists are 3-cycles and flips are 2-cycles.  The LCM of both is a 6-cycle, hence

M6 = FRBL108 (432 moves) = {∅}

A tediously long sequence but obviously much less than a complete solution since only 432 different positions are achieved. [[User talk:Spinningspark|Spark]]''' """,0

For the record, this Indian boy is a troll or was trolling for fire (BR, this reminds me of OH-6 flying low deliberately to draw for enemy fire), look at his comment and you'll see. Note that I have a very low tolerance for trolls and vandal, so as such I have been the target of such imbeciles from the start of my wiki-career. BR is well aware and can vouch for me that I have a secret-admirer/stalker/impostor out there who would actually stalk and harass those editor(s) who harass me while imposting as me, what I'm doing is nothing less than trying to deflect that from the Indian boy should he carry on with harassing me and then getting that secret-admirer/stalker/impostor to latch on his tail instead. Yes, I may have been a wee bit mad at that moment when I commented to him but I'm not stupid. Him, on the other hand, is just plain stupid for going down that path until eventually that secret-admirer/stalker/impostor reacts to him. What are we to do then? Lastly, the Indian boy had actually picked a very convenient date (end of our one month mutual interaction ban) to revert my edit so I'm fully entitled to be mad at him for being an moronic/insensitive jerk, especially at the condescending tone in his edit summary during that particular revert. Tell me now, does it take two hands or one to clap? In honour of that interaction ban, I've stayed away from him for one whole month (to the letter and the spirit of the law that requires of me but he did so only to the letter) and yet at the end of it, he has the galls to come pick on my edit? Come on, how oxymoron can that be that he is indeed trolling by all account? And both times, he goes to ANI, he doesn't have the courtesy to post an ANI-notice on my page, tell me now if that is not trolling? Forgetting twice?

 I appreciate you looking for a WP:3O, but I really don't think it was needed.

At least one other administrator was considering unblocking, so you were hardly alone in your thoughts.  As you've stated before, should there be additional problems, they can be reblocked.

David Ernest Duke (born July 1, 1950) is a former Louisiana State Representative and former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.

He has made a number of unsuccessful political bids for higher office, including run for the Louisiana State House, Louisiana State Senate, United States Senate, United States House, governor of Louisiana and twice for president of the United States. In 2002 he pled guilty to tax evasion and fraud charges. He is a long-time New Orleans resident and the proud father of Erika and Kristin Duke. 

Youth & Early Adulthood, the Klan and first campaigns

David Duke was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to David H. & Maxine Duke. As a Shell Oil engineer his fathers frequently moved his wife, David, and his sister Dotti to numerious locations around the world. The Duke's spent a short period of living in the Netherlands before they settled in Louisiana. Young David became interested in the white nationalist movement at an early age and joined the Klan in 1967. Duke went on to study at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and in 1970, he formed a caucasian campus-group known as the White Youth Alliance. That same year, he made himself known even more by demonstrating in swastika regalia to protest William Kunstler's appearance at Tulane University, LA. He was involved in the campus ROTC, until he was kicked out due to his radical beliefs. In 1971, he went to Laos to teach English to Laotian military officers and serve on cargo flights for Air America over the course of ten weeks.

Duke returned to LSU, graduating in 1974. He became notorious on campus for wearing a Nazi uniform, Ku Klux Klan apparel, and swastika paraphernalia while picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of the birth of Adolf Hitler. The year of his graduation, he was elected Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He attracted attention for trying to modernize the Klan and turn it into a modern nationalist political force. For example, he changed the title of 'Grand Wizard' to 'National Director' and sported a conservative suit as opposed to the traditional white robe. 

In 1976, Duke sought a seat in the Louisiana State Senate as a Democrat. In 1978, he left the Klan and two years later formed the National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP). In 1987, he conducted a direct-mail appeal using the identity and mailing-list of the Forsyth County Defense League, in Georgia, without permission, which League officials described as a fund-raising """"scam"""" (detailed in The Rise of David Duke by Tyler Bridges). In 1988, he ran in the Democratic Party primary for President of the United States. After a dismal showing in the Democratic primaries, he appeared on many state ballots as the nominee of the Populist Party and received  approximately 25,000 votes in the 1988 general election.

Using the pseudonym Dorothy Vanderbilt, Dr. Duke published a self-help book for women titled Finders-Keepers in 1976. The publication gives advice to women regarding vaginal exercises, fellatio, anal sex, and anilingus .  The manual is no longer in print and hard to find, however “The Picayune”, a local Mississippi newspaper, managed to find a copy and trace the trail of it’s proceeds to the original  author via the publisher.

In the 1980s, he was heavily involved in gambling and stock market investments, which were covered by the Times-Picayune, as well as by others. Columbia Journalism Review, THE PICAYUNE CATCHES UP WITH DAVID DUKE Attitudes of Mississippi college students toward David Duke before and after seeing the film 'Who Is David Duke?' The Nation, Republicanizing the Race Card

In the latter years of the 1980s, Duke sought to revamp his appearance by undergoing plastic surgery, and also shaved off his moustache following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives.

In 1984 David Duke and wife Chloe Hardin were divorced. Hardin then moved to West Palm Beach, Florida to be closer to her family. There she became involved with Duke’s childhood friend, Don Black, whom she married several years later. [http://www",0

 WikiMarkup 

Wikipedia has it's own special """"language"""" called """"WikiMarkup"""". It is very important, therefore, to know a good deal of it when you begin to write an article.

 Links 
 External links 
An external link is a link that goes to another website, besides Wikipedia. They are formatted like this: [Name of website goes here].
For example: [http://www.google.com] becomes . 
To display alternate text for an external link, type [Name of website goes here Alternate text goes here]. Note the space between the website's name and the alternate text.
For example: [http://www.google.com Google search engine] becomes Google search engine.

 Internal links 
An internal link is a link that links to any page within Wikipedia. They are formatted like this:[[Name of page goes here]]
For example: [[Giraffe]] becomes Giraffe.
An internal link can display alternate text through the use of a pipe character """"|""""
For example: [[Giraffe|A long-necked animal that lives on the plains of Africa]]. becomes A long-necked animal that lives on the plains of Africa.
Normal text can also be blended into a link.
For example: I like [[Giraffe]]s. becomes I like Giraffes.
Internal links can link across namespaces.
For example: [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]] becomes Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.
They can also use Pipe tricks.
For example: [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|]] (note the pipe character before the two end brackets) becomes Neutral point of view
For example: [[Orange (fruit)|]] becomes Orange.

 Redirects 

A redirect is a page that, if accessed, sends you to a related page automagically. For an example of this, see Gill net. Note how at the top of the page it says (Redirected from Gill net). Voila!
For example: #REDIRECT [[United States]] redirects whatever page it was on to United States.

I couldn't even guess how many genera there must be in total. Mus only accounts for a miniscule portion of the richness and diversity of the animals we call mice.

 POV statement which couldn't be salvaged 

I removed the following statement from the article, hoping that someone will rewrite this.
""""Former CIA agent John Stockwell, who was stationed in Angola while working with the CIA, argued that the CIA murdered 10,000 Angolans by arbitrarily warmongering.http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4068.htmhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c35COXObeo8""""

Reasons I think it's POV:
""""arbitrarily"""" - Please elaborate, and explain how this is relevant to the article
""""warmongering"""" - I think this term is rarely appropriate in an encyclopedia, and certainly not here.  There are many other better words.
The 10,000 figure isn't even mentioned in the article itself.  So, if it's not important or noteworthy enough to put there, why does it belong in a broad article about the country?
The 10,000 figure appears to come from his recollection.  Since when do we rely one person, an activist at that, to be the sole source for a casualty estimate?
The U.S.'s involvement is more of a side note here, and does not really fit in with the rest of the description of Angola's history.  In another article about, I don't know, CIA activities in Angola, maybe, but not here.

Dear BK:

Thank you.

However, this has soured me, and I will cure myself of my wikiaholic behavior. I quit. They've achieved their victory, and Wiki will lose my modest contributions.

That being said, I think you should look close at what they edited, and come to your own conclusion. They gutted whole articles.  This was WIKISTALKING and they went FAR beyond what they complained about. This was search and destroy, pure, simple and unvarnished. It was a clear abuse of power. I will not abide an abuse of power, and will not let this rest without their being brought to justice  they are bullies, and this was wrong.

I for one would not stand silently and idly by while the Wehrmacht makes the Jews disappear into the railroad cars.

Moreover, their actions showed an intent (and attempt) to bully me into silence about their misconduct. It was a cover up.

Accountability in this system is important. Those who abuse their powers do not deserve to be trusted to hold the reins. They deserve the severest sanctions, and should be stripped of administrative privileges.

What they did here was very destructive of the goals of an organization that depends on the good will and volunteer efforts of contributors.

RJ, I can see why you'd like a legitimate source like that for a photo for the same reason that we require information be verified by RSs in the text. However, the problem I'm seeing is that it strikes me as simply not feasible. If a photo appears from a reliable source, that photo is going to be copyrighted by that reliable source. There's no way we could claim fair use in that situation. In my experience, almost all non-fair use images are either user-generated, taken from a Flickr (or something similar), or have had their copyright expire. If we limit images to those from reliable sources, we pretty much limit ourselves to only fair use images and images of historical subjects. I think that is simply unreasonable. User-generated images and images released under a free license have a role to play on Wikipedia. I think it is up to us as editors to determine that role. In the examples I gave above, do you find it inappropriate that the articles use images with unclear provenance and/or that are not reliably sourced? If not, why not? My point here is that the question """"Says who?"""" could be asked of pretty much any user-generated image or image taken from Flickr, and I don't see why this article is being held to a different standard.
And I haven't tried very hard to argue for its inclusion because I don't think it's that great of a picture. I just disagree with the grounds on which it is being excluded, namely that we need some form of legitimization for the image. I agree that we should have some method to determine whether or not this photo (or any) accurately represents the subject. I don't think we need to get the photo from an RS to do that because I think that places far too high a burden. I think it is up to us, the editors, to determine whether an image adequately represents the subject. Do I think relying on someone else to say, """"Hey this is me being a hipster"""" is sufficient? Of course not. I, personally, judge the photo based on my own knowledge of hipster aesthetic, and the ironic mustache and flannel shirt are enough for me. While neither of those elements is mentioned in the article, I don't think it should be too hard to find an RS or two that mentions them in connection with hipsters.    """,0
"Right-o about Jesus fulfilling the Law and the Prophets. However, He directly went against the Jewish leaders of the day, and what Judaism is today as well. Jesus established new doctrines as well as affirming old ones. Christianity's doctrines are indeed based upon Jewish ones, but the differences are so large that Christianity could never be classified as a form of Judaism, in any respect.

For instance, Jesus is regarded as Messiah by mainstream Christianity, but not by Judaism. In mainstream Christianity, Jesus is worshiped as God, while in Judaism Jesus is labeled as a heretic.

Those are just two (very large) differences. How then could Christianity ever be classified as a Jewish sect? It's like a tree and a seed, the tree springs up from the seed, and is the direct result of the seed, but isn't the seed itself. (  )",0
"""
Yes, it is implied, but I dislike implications within a definition, even when they are correct. And I believe a general reader may share the sentiment, or even get confused.

Decades ago, before computers, it was important to make simple equations even simpler. To that aim, static equilibrium was used in some accelerating system problems, of course with the inertial forces included (the approach was credited to dAlembert). A simple example would be to determine maximum acceleration of a motorbike for a given friction coefficient (no limitation on engine power). When solved in the accelerating frame in which the center of mass was at rest, one could use torques about any point (as both static equilibrium conditions apply) and achieve minor simplifications in calculation. As I recall, one would casually refer to that accelerating frame as """"the motorbike CM frame"""". Why not, the meaning was perfectly clear, and what authority might there be to forbid such usage?

That being said, I am aware of the fact that relativistic particle collisions are best described in inertial COM frames. Some authors call them """"COM systems"""", as e.g. in the Sears and Zeemansky College Physics. (They even claim that """"COM system"""" is a relativistic generalization of """"CM system"""" - people will use various conventions.)  """,0

The reason we have cited the report regarding the Bangladeshi Law Ministers comments about Drishtipat's partiality toward the Awami League is because Drishtipat themselves [] put the Law Ministers comments and their response together under the heading ' Drishtipat response to the law minister's allegation' on their site. If the organisation itself felt criticised and responded, then it is hardly controversial to presume that it was Drishtipat that the Law Minister was talking about. I'm sure Drishtipat knew their own position and intentions better than the moderator (Ragib) on Wikipedia!

Besides in Bangali politikospeak, the governing party of the day rarely criticises an opponent by name. For example, when the BNP were in power, they would use oblique language like 'a certain party is causing violence in Bangladesh' with reference to hartals. Everyone would read between the lines and know that they are criticising their main opponents the Awami League. It's hardly rocket science.

To continue the Smith story, I found the book Men Against the Mountains, by Alson J. Smith (1965). I would have preferred Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the West, by Dale L. Morgan (1953), but my local library didn't have it. Because both books were written prior to the 1967 discovery of the """"lost"""" journal, they both contain some errors in particulars of the 1826-27 travel route that were corrected in Brooks' book (1977). Facts were established earlier, however, for J. Smith's 1827 return to California and the completion of the expedition at Fort Vancouver.

I found that J. Smith visited San Jose, Monterey and Yerba Buena, California before heading north up the Sacramento Valley. The Alson Smith book doesn't give the exact route of travel from San Jose to Monterey, but it seems unlikely that the expedition passed through my home turf in Santa Cruz County (my original question). They probably used the more established El Camino Real by way of Mission San Juan Bautista.

"And now for some... amusement 

After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

The rise and development of the Haskalah, or Jewish enlightenment, was different in Western Europe and Eastern Europe. In the West, an attempt was made to strip Judaism of its national character, and label it merely a """"religion."""" The motivation behind this was to defend recently acquired political rights; and in particular, the new idea that Jews were citizens of the European """"states"""" in which they resided. In retrospect the giving of political rights to Western European Jewish residents was contingent on their ceasing to be Jews in the traditional sense; or in any sense at all. The “reform” movement, started in Germany, was an attempt to give religious imprimatur to these developments; including rejecting the re-establishment of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem; and thus naming synagogues “temples.” In the East, the Haskalah led to secular Jewish nationalism (e.g., Chaim Zhitlowsky's ideas); of which Zionism was just the most successful and consequential. However, even in the East, there were assimilationists who wanted to dissociate themselves from their heritage to gain approval of gentiles. The “Jew” that is the subject of antisemitism is an artificial construct of the Roman Catholic church; and has no connection to flesh and blood Jews. It was an attempt by Jews to distance themselves from the chimera of Christian theology that later morphed into racism, (invented to attack newly acquired Jewish political rights in Europe), that Jews were attempting, perhaps understandably, to distance themselves from. Even in America, there were references to “Hebrews” instead of “Jews”; in an effort to seek approbation from gentiles; and distance Jews from Christian mythology. (It should be noted that America’s, (i.e., the United States, but not Canada’s), offer of citizenship was genuine and not a quid pro quo.) So your reference to 20th century Hungary was out of context, unexplained, un-encyclopedic; and therefore, inappropriate. That is why I deleted it. talk """,0

"Strawberry Panic! outline 

First let me say good job on listing all those problems with the article and I'll get right to them. However, there was at least one thing on that list that I don't exactly agree with. In the Strawberry Dorms section under the Seven mysteries subsection, it is called Seven mysteries because that is what the students at the school refer to the phenomenon as. Later, we find that there are in fact 12 seperate stories but only seven are known to each student, hence the name. Finally, only 8 are listed because those were the only 8 of the 12 presented and there will never be any more; it was purely an aspect of the anime and I highly doubt they'll touch upon it again. Listing what was given to me was all I could do. Also, adding an {{incomplete}} tag wouldn't do any good since aside from the cleanup (which I can do myself), no more information from the 4 missing mysteries or the ones not explained with ever appear in the series. Setting aside the fact that the last 5 listed aren't explaind and can't be explained per there is no information to fill them in, I would rather not like to take them out since they're still prevalent to the Seven mysteries subsection to the Strawberry Dorms.",0

"Way I see it, people who say the Sherman is a very good tank, are seriously overestimating it. I mean come on, it was nicknamed Ronson for a reason you know. Any tank that has to maneuvre around at close range to the sides and rear of an opposing tank to score a kill is definitely not good. The only notable good Sherman at the end of the war is the VC Firefly, but because US Ordinance doubted the 17 pounder could be fitted onto the tank, it was manufactured in limited quantities. 

The only notable features of the Sherman was that it was produced in large quantities, had a mechanical reliability that beat the T-34, and came with better secondary equipment such as FM Radio and an elevation gyro-stabiliser.

Not to mention the extremely sad stories behind it. Once, a Sherman maneuvered around a building to hide from a Tiger tank. The Tiger shot at the building, and the shell went right through and penetrated the Sherman's turret. There are also tales of German tanks who take out two aligned Shermans in one shot.

"""==Additions to Origins: The Subjects==
I feel that it would be effective, either in its own section or within Origins, to expand on the audiences that ethnographic films are geared towards.  The article now seems to focus well on the aesthetic and historical context and the scientific research and study that can be done.  However, it is only slightly mentioned through  """"Nai, the Story of a !Kung Woman"""" on how the actual subjects or indigenous tribes react-to and can utilize this film.

In order to expand on this topic, I was thinking of a rough statement like this would be ideal:

Indigenous tribes and people often have clearly defined practical reasons for participating in ethnographic films.  Such reasons include creating a record of their lives for future generations, warning authorities of potential problems, exchanging cultural information with other cultural groups and educating dominant cultures.Aufderheide, Patricia. Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007.  An ethnographic film by indigenous creators can also concentrate heavily on a particular movement towards indigenous activism.  The way an activist approach is accomplished is when filmmakers approach the issue with a tactic of openness, which ultimately no longer makes the camera a transparent object and instead an actor on stage that is allowed to be lead by its subjects.Aufderheide, Patricia. Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007

Well thank you. I am glad that at least you can really look at existing articles, and realise a mistake has been made somewhere and apologise for it, and for that, I shall rest my case. As for the part over the assumption of good faith, perhaps I may just remind, that your introductory comment in my talk page, as well as the revert edit summary you provided are just as inflammatory and a reflection of bad faith to me in my books, and you may similarly wish to reflect a little on how you conduct your edits. To revert another purely due to the """"unnecessarily terse edit summary"""" is simply unacceptable in wikipedia. If you have an issue with my comment, talk it out in the relevant talk page (and I would prefer it to be either in the article's talk page itself or in a more centralised location. This is not some kind of a you vs I issue alone. Others should know what happens in the background too. This is a community, remember?), not revert out of emotional displeasure or just to make a point. That you are """"suspicious"""" of my edits based on past experience in other articles does not vindicate your current action. It speaks of nothing but very bad faith, so you may perhaps do good cleaning up your backyard first before telling others what to do (reminds me very much of global politics for some reason. D).

My comments are unbelievably inflammatory? Well I am sorry, but I do happen to be someone who usually speaks my mind, and I dont mince my words. You will have to get used to my bluntness, I suppose, as much as I have to get used to your behavior as well.

No one said anything about it after this change? Well I did, and almost immediately. I dont see any avidence of the continent order being switched back and forth at any time of its edit history, and I certainly do not see anyone commenting on the pre-existing alphabetical listing for a good 14 months straight even when NA is CO's home continent.

So now that we know just what exactly is being """"standardised"""" here, are you going to apply them to the three articles you created? """,0

In a different remedy revised earlier, the new remedy was entered with the current date and vote total, and the original remedy was placed into a collapse box.

""":Kleene (re his (1952) Introduction to Metamathematics) would disagree that metamathematics isn't a topic for mathematics. But Minsky (1967) seems to agree with you, never mind he's not too convincing with his """"intuitive argument"""" using appeals to """"intuitive arguments"""". In his discussion of """"an effective procedure a.k.a. algorithm"""" (his definition, in fact) he says the matter is subjective:
""""Different people may not agree on whether a certain procedure should be called effective. Perhaps there are processes, we might suppose, which simply cannot be described in any formal language, but which can nevertheless be carried out, e.g., by minds. One might even argue that those important, but still mysterious, functions which make minds superior to all presently known mechanical processes must, by their intuitive nature, escape any systematic description.

""""Turing discusses some of these issues in his brilliant article, 'Computing Machines and Intelligence' [1950] .. they amount, in my view, to a satisfactory refutation of many such objections."""" (p. 107)

Minsky goes on to state:
""""One cannot expect to prove Turing's [his name for the Church-Turing] thesis, since the term 'naturally' relates rather to human dispositions than to any precisely defined quality of a process. Support must come from intuitive arguments..."""" (p.108)

Boolos and Jeffrey (1974, 1999) are more constructive:
""""Although this thesis ('Church's thesis') is unprovable, it is refutable, if false. For if it is false, there will be some function which is computable in the intuitive sense, but not in our sense. To show that such a function is computable in the intuitive sense, it would be sufficient to give instructions for computing its values for all (arbitrary) arguments, and to see that these instructions are indeed effective....To show that such a function is not computable in our sense, one would have to survey all possible Turing machines and verify (by giving a suitable proof) that none of them compute that function.... Then if Church's thesis is false, it is refutable by finding a counterexample; and the more experience of computation we have without finding a counterexample, the better confirmed the thesis becomes."""" (italics in original, p. 20)

""""Thus, the sun always rises because the sun has always risen."""" Truth by enumeration: animal logic. Bertrand Russell would have a field-day. At least Boolos and Jeffrey offer us a """"road map"""" of how to go about approaching the problem. But they fall into the same trap: they are asserting that if a computational procedure isn't mechanical then it must be intuitive. Say what? that the world of computation is divided into two mutually-exclusive sets: """"the intuitive"""" and """"the mechanical""""? Sure sounds like dualism to me ... intuitive 'minds' with 'souls' vs 'brains'made of gooey mechanical stuff ... interesting... most (but not all) philosphers of mind have given up on 'souls' ... maybe here is how one disproves or proves dualism? To wit: 

What would be interesting would be if someone could prove that the truth of the Thesis is formally undecidable in any construct whatever, """"intuitive or otherwise"""" forever unknowable to man or machine or God. One little [dualism] difficulty: what the hell does 'intuitive' really mean? [maybe that God is punching holes through the 5th dimension into our 4-D space-time, and is seeding minds with """"notions"""" (but not mechanically altering them in the process)?] 

I would call this sort of discussion a 'foundations of mathematics' debate, and therefore an open topic in some domain or other. Whether its 'philosophy' or 'foundations of mathematics' I don't know. I think they are the same.  wvbailey

great, but what I meant about weakest link is that I don't see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources I've seen, have you got a source that place's something called """"post-industrial"""" in the context of the history of noise music? (I'm presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the 'post' tag).

Unless the sources are good on this, it's too divergent, in my opinion, to include right now. Some of what might be called post-industrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesn't warrant inclusion. You might as well do a section on death-metal and its precursors, but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward; especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as """"noise music"""".

Personally, I think it is perhaps a stretch too far to start covering any kind of music, or any composer/artist, that might have dabbled in a bit of noise making, and I don't think that is what should happen with this article, unless the claims are sourced, and that's why I mentioned already that we should try and stick as closely as possible to what the main sources dealing with the historical use of sound/noise in music have to offer. We now see a number of artists (for example Jeff Mills) being redefined as a post-industrial musicians?? and the sentence throws in the year 2000 despite the fact that Mills has been associated with techno for 20 years now. I find this kind of redefinition without strong sources problematic.   """,0

Response Thank you for your concern. However, from where I sit, it isn't my """"good faith"""" that is at issue here. It's the good faith of the AfD initiator and his fellow instigators that is at issue. After all, I didn't write the CTMU article. Tim Smith did, and I don't know Mr. Smith from Adam. 

Suffice it to say that I consider myself to be somewhat knowledgable regarding the topic of that article, and rather than let Wikipedia readers be deceived, disinformed, and otherwise steered wrong about it, feel a responsibility to edit any part of it which I know to be erroneous or malicious in nature. All of my edits to date have satisfied this criterion. 

In addition, you should know that even if I wanted to introduce myself to you - and as it happens, I feel no such desire - I certainly wouldn't do so in any way that might advantage people whom I consider to be hostile, untrustworthy, or despicable, no matter how hard and hypocritically they try to blend into the Wikipedia community. Needless to say, that includes some of those involved in this AfD.

Notability of Division Kent
 A tag has been placed on Division Kent requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

 Reply to your question 

I'm curious as to why you (Mister Hospodar) conclude that everyone who disagrees with you (that is, everyone you've encountered on Wikipedia thus far) must be part of a nefarious conspiracy, and why they must be """"paid"""" by their """"bosses"""" to """"police"""" these articles. Leaving aside the various behavioral policies violated by such repetitive accusations, do you think alternate explanations are possible, if not likely? For example, is it possible that people edit these articles out of a desire to create a serious, respectable reference work - one that treats discredited claims honestly as discredited claims, rather creating a false impression of ongoing scientific debate? Could these nefarious editors possibly be motivated to contribute their free time to ensure that potentially important medical information here accurately reflects the knowledge of scholars and experts in the field? MastCell Talk 

In reply to the above question, I will state that NO, there is no other possible explanation for editors who take down within 30 minutes any edits that disagree with their agenda without considering the logic or validity of these edits, many of which edits greatly improve the articles in question; whose arguments funnel always into the same tired arguments and bullying, all of which adhere to a fixed political agenda and specific types of censorship; who are on call seemingly 24 hours a day for years to revert any edit which they think is damning to their agenda; who spend countless hours creating specious, illogical arguments and trying the time-worn tactic of  invalidating their """"opponents"""" with name-calling and fringe accusations; who ridicule and demean everyone, including established scientists, who disagree with their agenda; who are clearly not clever or informed enough to be operating on their own, say, as AIDS scientists or researchers who merely want to help the world with their knowledge; and who police a number of pages all related to the concerns of pharmaceutical companies, slamming alternative therapies and spreading disinformation about diseases.

"No, I'm not a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs' Office.  I'm not a member of the Mormon Church, either. Yet I have the right to feel offended when someone says every single Mormon man is a misogynist who sees every woman as a baby - making machine.  I have the right to defend law enforcement officers against the charge that their hard work consists of gossip.  Maybe they never solved the Kupcinet case, but their hard work has made the world safer for you and me and our parents.  If I were defending an extremist like a Ku Klux Klan member, then I would understand you pointing out that I ain't in the Klan.  But sheriffs aren't extremists.  Some make mistakes and commit crimes, but they are highly regarded by crime victims who get the satisfaction of seeing their tormentors get locked up.

You point out that newspaper articles reporting Dr. Harold Kade's egregious mistakes, one of which put an innocent man in jail for five months, say nothing about Kupcinet, therefore they aren't relevant to her case.  If the articles said he was a careless driver who got off work one night and then crashed his car into a truck carrying tissue samples to another lab for analysis, thereby making that person's death a total mystery, then your point would be valid.  An accident that Dr. Kade might have caused when he wasn't on the timeclock tells us nothing about his competence while he was on the clock.  We know he was on the clock when he put an innocent man in jail for five months. We know he was on the timeclock when he screwed up another case that was unrelated to that unfortunate man.  Therefore his screwy actions while he was working are relevant to yet another mysterious death that he was supposed to solve but didn't (Kupcinet). At least he didn't solve it to the satisfaction of those gossip queens known as sheriffs.  If they didn't cut open her dead body, then they knew nothing, right?  The woman's father didn't see the autopsy, either, and he actually was considered a gossiper by some people, so to hell with him, too.  Right ?

With your cockeyed logic, I can add a comment Richard Nixon made about Robert Kennedy's alleged relationship with Marilyn Monroe to the articles about Kennedy and Monroe, and anyone who adds a few words about Nixon's dishonesty can get banned from Wikipedia for 48 hours.  Nixon did, in fact, make a brief comment about Kennedy-Monroe when he was interviewed for 60 Minutes in 1984, ten years after he resigned.  Video and audio of it exist, but I, for one, never will add it to Wikipedia.  If I did, Wildhartlivie would want a footnote citation that identifies the producer of the segment and what he ate for breakfast on the day it aired.  Someone else would remove it on the basis that as long as it had nothing to do with China, anything Nixon said about others' flaws was a lie. That's good enough for me, but you're just going to say Watergate was a separate entity that had nothing to do with Kennedy or Monroe, therefore Nixon could have said they were both transsexuals and that's legitimate. 

Let gullible kids who read Wikipedia know what that great man said about an emotionally fragile woman he never met.  Your logic is cockeyed.  Unlike Monroe, whose autopsy was performed by a relatively competent doctor named Noguchi, Karyn Kupcinet was permanently screwed up by a klutz. Deal with it.  If you keep banning his klutzines, maybe you can delete the entire article about Jack Kevorkian. How do you know your body will be treated fairly the next time you visit a medical doctor ?  You don't.  If you're dead you don't complain.  Deal with it. Life sucks. People screw up everywhere, even in a room full of fresh corpses.",0

SMOS """"More"""" template
Hi Art, the problem with the extra linefeed with the More template was due to a misplaced  tag on the line after the last part of the template code, which allowed the carriage return at the end of the template code to be included.

 Question about number of edits 

Hello, since the welcome message to my talk page came from you, I presume you're the person I should turn to with any questions.  I notice that every time anyone makes a change in an article, the old and new versions are stored in the history page.  I'm not terribly computer literate, but it seems that that would take up a lot of space, and I presume Wikipedia doesn't have infinite webspace.  If I see an incorrect comma in the third paragraph, a spelling error in the fifth, an incorrect link in the sixth, an incorrect date in the eighth, and unclear wording in the thirteenth, does Wikipedia prefer that I do one big edit so that it will have only one new page to store, or is it okay to save as I go along?  Are the individual versions in the history page deleted after a certain length of time?  I've been editing my user page, and just wonder whether I should leave changes until I have something big to change.

Thanks

 (Butting in here, again, as people ask more interesting questions on Mel's talk page than on mine).  Ann, firstly, diskspace is so incredibly cheap that you could type flat out for your whole life and you wouldn't fill a drive that cost 100 euros;  so don't worry about diskspace.  This issue of what to do in an individual edit is one purely for the convenience of other people who are reading it.  So if you're doing a bunch of fairly trivial tweaks (fixing grammar, spelling, formatting, etc) then do all of those in one go (and give an edit summary like """"various grammar and spelling tweaks"""".  If the article needs tweaks and also need a higher-level change (adding or removing a big chunk of text, fixing some wording that you thing is seriously incorrect or misreading) then do the trivial fixes in one edit, and the other fix in another (with an edit summary like """"removing nonsense about Father Dougal"""").  So (in summary) make changes based on what is a logical unit, not what's convenient for the software.   (talk | contribs) 21:35, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

And what do """"quanta"""" and """"cosmology"""" have in common?  Energy.  To simply categorize physics as """"the study of everything"""" is imperceptive.  When modeling sand falling into a pile (or nuts sorting in a jar) a physicist doesn't really care about the identity of the particles at hand, just certain """"bulk"""" properties that relate to its energetics.  The chemist tries to understand how the material composition in turn generates those energetic qualities, but then usually isn't capable of formulating the dynamic description of what happens when it's shaken (or spilled).  A physicst usually could care less about why niobium is better for a collider than copper, just that it is.  And chemists don't just care about chemical elements and compounds, there is a whole field of chemistry dedicated to monitoring interactions of nuclei with nucleons (nuclear chemistry)  still matter.  As a point of culture, chemists tend to focus on the diversity of matter and how that affects interactions with energy and physicists focus on the unity of energy, and how that affects matter.  Physical chemists very nicely bridge this  they put quite a bit of energetics while still caring deeply about the identity of that which is being studied.  While the duality may sound a bit contrived, there is definitely some truth to the statements, and while not perfect, it's more meaningful than what's there now.""",0

 RE: Tables

"""== plants ==

I find the first sentences of this article very strange. I don't think vegetarians primarily eat plants or that it's synonymous with herbivore. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, honey, and yogurt, are not plants. Even plant parts is a bit of a stretch. Is flour a plant? My understanding is that vegetarians do not eat meat.   
It looks like an accurate description to me. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, beans, and flour all come from plants - I don't think it's necessary to eat the whole plant to be considered to be eating plants. Plants aren't even mentioned in the first sentences of the article.  
I see that mention of plants has recently been removed. The word vegetarian obviously indicates a plant-based diet.  
A nut may come from a tree, but it is not a plant. See dictionary. Yogurt is not a plant. Honey is not a plant. Fruit is not a plant. You seem to be confusing the meaning of words, which is problematic for someone working on an encyclopedia.   
I think you'll find that trees are plants. Foods that come from plants are plant-based foods. It isn't rocket science.  
The article seems have been clarified which is helpful. Clearly there is a difference between a herbivore (a moose or cow for example) and a vegetarian that eats plant based foods like nuts, fruit and sometimes non-plant based foods dairy. Cheers.   
I removed a newly-added sentence in the intro saying """"Some vegetarians eat eggs and fish"""" because the very next sentence says exactly the same thing.   

I removed """"focusing on plant-based foods"""", since a diet of solely dairy products and eggs, while unhealthy, would technically be vegetarian. Simply put, not all vegetarian diets """"focus"""" on plant-based foods. As per the citations, vegetarianism is really just defined by what it excludes, not what it includes. -  
It would only be true of certain forms of vegetarianism, so the plant-based nature of the diet needs to be included.  
What about fungi? They aren't plants are they?   
Fungi are fungi, not plants. Sigh... vegetarians... '' (T↔C) 
Correct, they are not plants. Just in case anyone is still confused: nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, and flour are all plant-based foods; they come from plants. Honey, yogurt, other dairy products, and eggs are animal-based foods; mushrooms and yeast are fungus-based foods; and algae (including edible seaweed like kelp) are none of the above. Also for the record, I'm vegetarian. -  
(response to Michig) I don't understand your logic here. If some vegetarian diets do not focus on plant-based foods, then would it not be inaccurate to make the blanket statement """"vegetarian diets focus on plant-based foods""""? -  
Can you seriously imagine a vegetarian diet without plant-based foods? The lede should summarize the article, and if you read the article it discusses plant-based foods all the way through it. The Vegetarian Society's definition: """"We define a vegetarian as someone living on a diet of grains, pulses, nuts, seeds, vegetables and fruits, with or without the use of dairy products and eggs. A vegetarian does not eat any meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish or crustacea, or slaughter by-products."""" Doesn't that sound very plant-based to you? The plant-based foods are the fundamental part of the diet, with some'' types of vegetarians also adding dairy and eggs.

"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE

a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?

b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. 

c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.

d. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.

e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.

Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.

So now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.

Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.

So GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.

I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.

While some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.

Now I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.

Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.

Now Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.

The fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.

9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.

2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.

So 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.

My site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. 

Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due",1

"Dammit people, at least let me talk. I believe Thrindel is not editing these pages on the interest of creating a neutral page that informs about all aspects of this comic and its creator. By checking his history and that of these pages you can see that he quickly and simply removes any criticism about either. His knowledge of wikipedia's rules seems to be extensive, but then why have they only edited pages relating to CAD? The nature of his edits, as it has been said, smacks of self interest. I really don't see the need for proving that he is who he is, but it is pretty obvious. For example, posting that he is Buckley on his user talk page will get you banned from the cad forums and Buckley's blog. I'll save you some time Tim, you've already banned this IP.  And this isn't hard to believe since he claims to make a living off income from his comic. For example, in this talk page he suggested that the fact that there are CAD gamer pictures available on xbox live. Those cost money, which means someone is making money. This is not article worthy and the thought of using wikipedia for free advertising would just be low. Ask people a million times to buy them on the cad site, but not here. When money is involved it's completely understandable for him to try and quell any criticism within his power, but this is wikipedia, not a fan site, and defiantly not a site to be edited by the creator of the comic. Leave this page to be edited by the rest of the world to edit. In conclusion, I believe there is an obvious user bias here. There is room for both praise and criticism on the page, if you can find good sources of either that is. Here is one thing I have noticed about the latest comic (although I fear it falls under original research and could not be posted): http://images.google.com/images?q=home+depot+shopper (fifth picture) and http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/comic.php?d=20080321 This confirms one thing I already knew: Tim uses blurred images copied hastily off of google image search for his backgrounds.

 the period dealt with spans approximately mid-2013 to September 2014. This is an indication it may not meet criterion 3a. - As far as I can see, there is not a lot more to say about this young lady so far. While taking in interest in people who are famous because of their parents and because of who they date eludes me, it is no reason to fail criterion 3a.
 Daily Mail may not be a reliable source - There are a couple of references here that could be argued do not come from what is usually considered reliable. However, it is accepted in """"tabloid"""" topics to include """"tabloid"""" sources. Otherwise, Wikipedia would only consist of articles on people The Guardian writes about. Yawn!

However, these things should be adressed:
 Nowhere does it actually state that Wright and Penn are famous actors. That is however necessary, because otherwise one might easily ask why this person deserves a Wikipedia article in the first place.
 The archive links in the references are inconsistent. The style you should use is the one in reference #1 (Link to original page, publiser, archived from and then """"the original"""" as the link). This can easily be achieved by using the cite web template.
 However the first reference is not a good example alltogether, since it makes no sense that the page is from July 28, 2014 and it is stated that it was retrieved on July 19th. Please look into this.

From a purely WP:LEAD point of view, the article has several sections devoted to cores and the requirement for ferromagnetism is stated prominently.  It is a reasonable summary to have the ferromagnetic core requirement in the lead.  The argument that not all ferromagnetic materials make good cores is irrelevant to the statement that all cores must be ferromagnetic.  This is the logical fallacy of denying the antecedent; all A are B is not invalidated because some B are not A.  That some new material for cores might be discovered that is not ferromagnetic is WP:CRYSTAL and also irrelevant, certainly not encyclopaedia worthy.  I am not convinced that there are any genuine electromagnet applications of air-cored solenoids.  The solenoid in its actuator role has a metal armature which is effectively acting as a core.

"Heaven of God 
For the atheist anarchist, the subject is Heaven, and it is religion, moron> I saw your kind at University, go feed yourself in the mountains.

To understand Heaven, then God must be understood:

 1. God is the all powerful supreme being of the Universe.
 2. Universe is defined as everything that is seen and unseen, and defined as everything known and unknown. Any concept of a multi-universe shall be defined as the mathematical subspace where there can be many subspaces, but only one Universe. A mathematical subspace is a subset of dimensions that does not have to include all other dimensions. The subspace we exist within can be a subspace of a larger subspace. The subspace that includes all dimensions is the Universe itself. The Universe itself is a subspace that includes all dimensions.
 3. God is either above the Universe as the creator, or part of some subspace of the Universe, or both above and part of the Universe. The fourth condition that God is not part of the Universe, and God is not above the Universe negates God's existence; therefore, the fourth condition is not considered a valid condition of God.
 4. God is supreme over the Universe. It is God's creation and obeys God's rules. Each rule can be obvious or non-obvious, and each rule can be hidden or allowed to be known.
 5. God has the ability to create and destroy energy. Without such a thing, then the Universe simply exists and is eternal and everlasting with no known explanation of its ability to exist; there can still be God as a supreme being of the Universe in such a condition, but God's energy ability is changed to the ability to manipulate energy without the ability to create or destroy energy.
 6. God is smart, is intelligent, is wise, has knowledge, is a creator, is good, is benevolent, has mercy, and has understanding. God has these abilities that are significant as the supreme being of the Universe.
 7. God expects God's creation to do well, since as a creator, then the Universe was created for God's purpose and enjoyment; therefore, life elements of God's creation, such as people, are expected to improve their own condition for their benefit and exercise wisdom, understanding, and knowledge when possible to exercise such thingsintelligence is good.
 8. Because God is supreme, then Heaven and its rules of existence are defined by God.
 9. God not only deals with people of Earth of our Sol system of the Milky Way galaxy, God is a supreme being that can interact with the entire Universe in whole, or God can interact with the Universe in part; therefore, God truly understands some of the issues and survival strategies of life, and this implies that God may be truly forgiving and God may expect certain behavior for the improvement of ourselvesto survive and prosper is important.
 10. It is always believed that God likes people, so help from God can be asked by petition for help or intervention using prayer.
 11. God likes to be acknowledged from God's own creation, so it is good to acknowledge God as the benevolent intelligent creator of the Universe.
 12. Love God. Love is a survival strategy of people that helps to define society, family, nation, benevolence, and many good things of life. Be who you are as a person and love God, and God is expected to understand this as love is part of the defining qualities of people.

God has created the Universe and has the ability to define Heaven in any way. Each person can get a personal Heaven, or Heaven may be a interaction for people, or Heaven may be a combination of both personal and interaction of people. Heaven is always defined as a good place; but, a personal Heaven can also be a personal Hell tailored to your life, attitude, and existence where God could give us, by observation, an environment where the individual prospered. The personal Heaven and Hell would be much like an metaphorical ant farm that is designed for ants, but you would not expect things like body building equipment in the ant farm, and the ant farm would function in a way ants survive, and this can be bad news for people who were ruthless where their environment was ruthlessness as a survival strategy (visit a zoo and see how the environmentshowever limitedare tailored to the different animal species).

God can define Heaven in any way, and Heaven is defined as a good place, but as a supreme being God can allow many things, and maybe God might include a body building set for the metaphorical ant farm, so the possibilities of Heaven are expected to be many, if not endless possibilities. God is benevolent in Heaven and the possibilities are many. Love God.",0

"""::: Cparker, I don't know what you did after 2006, but if anyone else has this kind of issue, I would suggest you consider the lap band instead. It does not require the drastic re-sectioning of your organs that is done in roux en y/gastric bypass. In the surgery, you lose more than a foot of your small intestine that you can't get back and that is necessary if it is connected to the stomach in its normal position; the area where that connection originally occurred is closed off by sutures; the area of your stomach that is stapled creates a bifurcated stomach that cannot be reopened - it is completely irreversible. This is a complete and permanent lifestyle and physiological change that should never be taken lightly. See my comments in other comment sections on this page about about the difference between your pre- and post-surgical life. You will be on a diet for life - you will not be returning to your prior eating habits, and as I mention above, you may not even want to. Your tastebuds will change. Your nutritional needs will be re-prioritized. You still have to actively pursue the weight loss - it isn't that they cut your stomach down and you eat what you want and lose weight - that is not how it works at all. You will be nauseated after the surgery - mine lasted for the two and a half months during which I was on pureed food only - I begged people to pray for me, it was so bad, but once I was back on solid food, it went away. That may have been unique to me. There are many problems that occur with everyone, but some will be unique to you. My program made me do 6 months of supervised 1,500 calorie a day diet and exercise (as much as I could with other conditions hampering me), and prior to that my PCP and I tried a similar program ourselves. So there is no """"trying it out"""" - you are either in the program or not. But I can tell you, after almost a decade of obesity caused by medications I take for other conditions (and to be honest, exacerbated by over-eating for the first time in my life, also a side-effect of those meds), I have lost about 55 lbs. in the 5 months since my surgery. Seeing the scale keep going down and down is a good feeling. With the surgery, it happens quickly at first and then slows down, with the lap band it's just the opposite. Make sure you are totally informed before you make a choice, and choose your surgeon and their program wisely. Do your homework. Plus, they have screening methods, also, to make sure you are not wasting their time. You will be given a psychological evaluation - similar to having plastic surgery - to make sure you understand the risks, the benefits, the amount of involvement you play in your weight loss journey, and if you are ready for it.

In any religious battle, the first rule is to never question the viewpoint you're defending.)

 Instead, what if we ask a different question:  how do transistors work?

 In explaining the transistor effect, if we drill down through various ideas, we find a central concept:  when the base terminal injects charged particles into the base region, there is no way for the motion of those particles to influence the other charged particles being sent out by the emitter.  There is no mechanism by which the base charge-flow can directly affect the emitter's charge-flow.   Yet if we inject a tiny base current, we obtain a huge emitter current!  The hfe parameter is no illusion.  Base current obviously does control emitter current.  How?  It's because any change in Ib absolutely requires a change in Vbe... and Ie is determined by Vbe because Vbe determines the thickness of the depletion layer.   Base current can control emitter current through a multi-step process involving Vbe and the depletion layer.  Charged particles injected by the base do in fact influence the charged particles sent out by the emitter.  They just can't do it directly.

 So is a transistor controlled by current?  Yes, if by """"controlled,"""" we mean that the emitter current can be changed by changing the base current.  Is it """"controlled"""" by voltage?  Yes, if by """"controlled"""" we mean that the emitter current can be changed by changing the value of Vbe.  And those people who choose one side or the other can fight forever about the """"right answer.""""  They'll almost come to blows over the One True Path to transistor enlightenment, since their own viewpoint is obviously good and true and right, while the opposing side are all a bunch of worshippers of Darkness and Confusion whose blasphemy must be ridiculed.  After all, young students could be misled from the One True Path!  Think of the children!  )

 On the other hand, it's hard to become a victim of either meme if you laugh at religious wars.  But that's a very difficult habit to develop.  Instead, it's easier to become a devout """"Current Believer"""" at the start.  But then the mental grip of that meme is shattered by encountering the competition.  So you become an outspoken """"Voltage Worshipper.""""  With luck you'll eventually be immunized against both, yet accept both.  The """"Transistor Zen"""" practitioner is free to view BJTs from both viewpoints, switching back and forth as needed, while seeing the duality as an illusion and rejecting the notion that a single best answer can exist.

 Well, in a perfect world it would depend on the sourcing. As it stands? You could say it goes both ways. The fact that it was undisputed before 2004 or whenever could mean that Larry Sanger was the co-founder. It could also mean that Jimbo didn't see it that way but didn't want to be a dick until things got strained between them. It could be that Jimbo didn't CARE as long as Larry was helping Wikipedia, but now that he's running Citizendium and is making all these loud noises about how his will be teh bettars, Jimbo sees no reason to allow Larry a false prop.

Stone Censors
I don’t know that I’m wrong; in fact, I’m quite certain that you and AuburnPilot are in the wrong. You can censor me and block me all you want – you’ve got the power – but you can’t make me confess to wrongs of which I am innocent. Not yet, anyway. And you can’t make me say that you’re right, when you are as wrong as hell. It’s about time somebody talked back to you.

“If you were to discuss your edits, you won't [sic] be in this position right now.” (Since I had already discussed my edits, physicq’s statement above is a case of “a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood.”)

That’s funny peculiar, because wikicensors with the correct politics somehow never have to “discuss” their “edits.” They just go and censor people with whom they disagree, and then demand that the censees justify the worth of the censored passages or links or footnotes. And guess what? The censees’ explanations, no matter how well-founded and eloquent, are never sufficient to make the censors change their minds. Once an editor realizes that nothing he says will have any positive effect on the censors (or should I say, """"commissars""""?), he would be a fool to waste his time and energy trying to change that which cannot be changed. That the censors continue demanding such arguments is because they have a sadistic glee for wasting other people’s precious time and energy.

In case an open-minded (but perhaps less experienced) reader should suspect that I am just engaging in bluster, I had already made my argument in my previous entry on this page (which AuburnPilot has archived in a handsome tan box at the bottom of User_talk:AuburnPilot under the uncivil category, “spam”) for why the footnotes and links I inserted were legitimate, but physicq aka physicq210 derided those arguments as a “polemic, complete with fallacious personal attacks,” and mocked my criticism of his abuse of authority as “whining.” In one case, I pointed out that the external link that AuburnPilot defamed as “spam” and censored, was a classic magazine article related to the  Racial Profiling Hoax.

(Speaking of which, Wikipedia's Racial profiling article is hopelessly POV through the censors’ deleting of links to articles debunking the hoax, and inserting of links to fraudulent “literature” such as thoroughly debunked work by the ACLU.)

In the case of a footnote that AuburnPilot also defamed as “spam” and censored, he cut the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the  Duke Rape Hoax, which was published by the most brilliant, reliable magazine on the Web, VDARE.

BTW, AuburnPilot asserts that the sources in question are not “reliable” or “verifiable,” and do not maintain “neutrality.” Aside from the fact that thousands of Wikipedia articles are transparent political propaganda, or no more than love or hate letters to certain public figures (particularly entertainers or athletes), AuburnPilot has misrepresented the Wikipedia rule on neutrality. There is no requirement that every source be neutral (as opposed to reliable and verifiable), only that every Wikipedia article be neutral.

WP:NPOV

“All Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by a reliable source. For guidance on how to make an article conform to the neutral point of view, see the NPOV tutorial.”

As for “verifiablilty,” the VDARE source has over 100 hyperlinks to supporting documentation from newspapers, magazines, TV and radio news organizations, and legal filings; if that isn’t “verifiable,” then nothing is.

Now, I ask you. If I have already made my best argument for including the aforementioned links and footnotes, and physicq aka physicq210 responds by misrepresenting what I said, claiming that I have made no attempt at supporting my position, and referring to my defense as “whining,” what possible reason could I have for continuing such a charade?

Plus, why should I be on the defensive? If I were dealing with fair, reasonable people, that might make sense. But fair, reasonable people would not do as AuburnPilot did, and first censor my edits, and then demand I justify their value on the talk pages. (And physicq would not have responded to an edit war by throwing in with AuburnPilot, immediately blocking me, and charging me with “disruptive edits.” That alone is proof of physicq’s unfitness as an administrator.) No, AuburnPilot would not have censored my work, but would have asked me on the talk page why I thought it belonged. No, strike that. He would have hit the links and read the articles in question.

There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.

Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.

Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

Hopefully we can work together to keep our exchanges constructive and find common ground.  

To be clear about my beliefs, please realize that there is third side to this conspiracy 'coin'.  I am on the third side of the coin.  It is the side of this argument who can look at the facts, sources, evidence, and context and see that both the claims of chemtrail theorists and those of the counter-theorist are dubious. None of this can be done if the terminology is not precisely defined.  My personal opinion is (and I have a degree in this field) is that we have the paranoid-delusional theorists arguing with the regular-delusional counter-theorists.  

Let us step back and neutrally state the facts.  If you are on one of the other sides of 'the coin', we need to talk about POV. The topic of my research CBW is difficult to approach without those one the other sides of this 'coin' accusing my of being on the opposing side.  I am afraid to state the known historical facts because but each side believes my idea is the POV of the other. To keep the entry neutral, the nuts point of view needs to be defined, dissected, and dismissed however, I am concerned that both sides are nuts. Please consider this when reading my posts, reviewing my edits, or reverting.  I am no chemtrail theorist and am (highly) offended by such accusations. I support neither claim.  

Let us differentiate the has happened from what is happening. This topic cannot be approached with out it. Thank you for letting me set the record strait.",0

I don't think that my statement was """"uncivil,"""" but that is your opinion, which you are entitled to. Like most on-line conversations, words can be misconstrued when the recipient of those words can not hear the tone and inflection of which they are stated, or in this case, the intent with which they were written. You are wrong to think and assume that my sentiments are “uncivil.” I was merely trying to point out that this individual who is not, in fact, a resident of Garden City is not an authority of the village. I do not claim to  know every minute detail of the history of Garden City, however, being a life-long resident, there is a certain level of familiarity that I have that this other individual does not, and could never have.  Unlike those of us who do live here, how can he discredit the statements that residents make? Upholding copyright laws is one thing, but to question the validity of our villages traditions and folklore is something that must be chastised. Read the published books about Garden City, talk to our village historian, maybe even pay a visit to the Garden City Historical society if it is that important to comment on and edit this article. But until then, I would limit those corrections to basic grammatical errors and Wiki style.

 IRWolfie's question 

Kozima wrote, """"The products of cold fusion phenomenon (CFP) observed by Miley et al. [Miley and Patterson 1996] are tabulated in Table C6.1"""". That table lists the kinds of atoms that Miley and Patterson reported finding in microspheres that had been used in a Patterson Power Cell. At the top of Kozima's page 148 he uses the abbreviation TNCF and he defines that term on page page 192 as """"trapped neutron catalyzed fusion"""".

Using TNCF to refer to the transmutation of nickel into copper seems appropriate because the nickel is being transmuted into a heavier element (copper) and that is an example of nuclear fusion. However, using TNCF to refer to the transmutation of nickel into lighter elements is a bit misleading because such transmutations are actually examples of nuclear fission, not fusion. In contrast, Miley has used the term """"fissfus"""" to describe the transmutation of nickel into a heavier element (copper) and lighter elements (chromium, manganese, iron, and cobalt). The term """"fissfus"""" is derived by combining the """"fiss"""" from fission with the """"fus"""" from fusion.   """,0

"How telling of WP processes that all the reviews I cite of the discussed effect are ignored by the above commentators, while they seek to justify themselves by freely imagining rebuttals of the cited evidence. What a farce these juveniles make of Wikipedia. Yet I happily leave to their juvenile arguments their blind-sighted conclusion. Why? Because if the readers of WP are of the same stock as these juvnile editors, then the information I have offered is evidently too complex for them to rationally consider. Also, my short foray into WP editing has evidenced that WP is no place to offer psychological knowledge that does not stick, prima facie,  to Newtonian physics; here, psychological knowledge must stick to the classical world like peanut butter does to bread. Let us leave these juvenile retarders of scientifically appraised and communicated findings another decade of their Punch-and-Judy approach to public communication of scientific knowledge. Science will progress, as always, without the contribution of such self-appointed protectors of self-obvious truths, and such puppets of the mythical fundamentals of human knowledge. Rodgarton",0

 Wondering If You Could Help... 

A couple of months ago, I created a page for the """"Original"""" Clark Sisters, an American close-harmony singing group from the 1930s and '40s, that was fairly well-known at the time.  As an announcer at a Jazz radio station, includng being the host of a """"Trad Jazz"""" show, I have some pretty extensive knowledge of this genre of music.  I properly referenced the article, and provided appropriate links to and from other related pages.  All in all, I think I did a fairly good job, considering it was only my first real page construction.  

So, along comes this editor from the U.K., (""""Seddon""""), and marks the thing for """"speedy deletion"""".  Before I can even find out about it, the page is gone.  Then, when I try to ask him about it by posting on his talk page, he totally ignores me.  In the first place, I can't understand how a U.K. editor is even ALLOWED to edit a piece on U.S. music; secondly, if he is allowed, why is he allowed to place his questionable judgment above mine?  I am hoping that you can help me restore the page, so that I don't have to go to all the trouble of re-creating it, at a loss of several hours of my time.

 Politecnico di studi aziendali legal status 

The Federal Administrative Court (TAF) decided that exist in Switzerland - national - basically two forms of recognition for colleges. This is, on the one hand, the recognition of a university as a person entitled to benefits under the Federal Law of 8 October 1999 on support for universities and cooperation in higher education (Law on Assistance to universities, LAU, RS 414.20), on the other accreditation in accordance with Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Federal Government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector (RS 414 205). Both the recognition according to the LAU is accreditation are awarded solely as a result of an examination of the quality (art. 11 cpv.3 letter. at LAU; Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Confederation and the University Cantons on support for universities and cooperation in higher education). The recognition according to the LAU is aimed at the provision of federal subsidies and is the responsibility of the Federal Council (Art. 12 para. 1 LAU), accreditation, by contrast, is conferred by the Conference Swiss University (art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the federal government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector) and is a mark of quality, which does not confer on its holder the right to a federal financial aid (see. FF 1999 243, 355), (judgment of TAF of August 13, 2013 B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 10 et seq.). Accordingly, the mere exercise of a university is not subject to authorization and is based on the freedom of science and economic freedom, as stated in the preamble of the now decayed authorization of the State Council on 14 February 2006. ISSEA sa is then free to confer titles, without that this requires an estimate accreditation or recognition subsidies and must be considered as recognized by national law (judgment of the TAF of 13 August 2013, B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 11). The CRUS, is not responsible neither for accreditation or for recognition under the LAU and the list developed by this authority can be at most a working tool, not expounding this list legal effects (judgment of the TAF of August 13, 2013 B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 13Equni (talk)  Recognition and university accreditation in Switzerland: rulings clarifying The legal issues on the real value of the recognition and accreditation University in Switzerland have been resolved by some judgments of the Swiss Federal Courts.

The Federal Court Ammnistrativo with judgment B-1567/2011 of February 8, 2012 has confirmed that the university accreditation is a simple quality mark Optional without any legal consequences.

 Land Day   /Jewish Exodus    

The background of the former is completely skewed, as you note. The latter article is premised on a wholly ideological POV attempt to establish a symmetry between the expulsion of Palestinians, and the far more, and much later (generally) exodus of Jewish communities from the Arab world. The Arabs did not encourage Palestinians to leave. Zionists strongly encouraged the Jewish diaspora in the Arab world to make aliyah. As it stands, of all I/P articles, the Jewish exodus registers as the one which narrates almost exclusively an Israeli/Zionist POV. Quite remarkable. This is how Shlomo Ben-Ami puts it, in his review of .

In October of that year, on the eve of Operation Hiram, which led to the expulsion of many of the Arabs of the northern Galilee region, Ben-Gurion declared, """"The Arabs of the Land of Israel have only one function left to them  to run away."""" And they did; panic-stricken, they fled in the face of massacres in Ein Zeitun and Eilabun, just as they had done in the wake of an earlier massacre in Deir Yassin. Operational orders, such as the instruction from Moshe Carmel, the Israeli commander of the northern front, """"to attack in order to conquer, to kill among the men, to destroy and burn the villages,"""" were carved into the collective memory of the Palestinians, spawning hatred and resentment for generations. 

There are only two points on which Morris' splendid analysis falters. He is unconvincing in his attempt to pardon some of Israel's original sins by creating an awkward symmetry between the Palestinian refugee crisis and the forced emigration of 600,000 Jews from Arab countries and Iran, which Morris quotes Israeli leaders as calling """"an unplanned 'exchange of population.'"""" Regimes hostile to Israel were not alone in getting Jews to leave; envoys from the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, and from the Jewish Agency were working underground in several Middle Eastern countries to encourage Jews to go to Israel. More important, for many Jews in the region, the very possibility of immigrating to Israel was the culmination of millenarian dreams. It represented the consummation of a quest to take part in Israel's resurgence as a nation. No matter how painful the memory of their eviction or how humiliating their second-class status in Israel, these new Israelis never sought to return to their lands of origin. By contrast, the Palestinian refugees were forced into the wilderness of exile with no guarantee of a new national home and no prospect of returning to their native land. The yearning for return thus became the Palestinians' defining national ethos. 
Morris' characterization of the conflict of 1948 as an Islamic jihad against Jewish-Western infidels in Palestine is also unpersuasive. It is true that the figurehead of Palestinian nationalism at the time was the fanatically religious and viscerally anti-Semitic mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini. And Arab discourse during 1948 was occasionally peppered with the rhetoric of holy war: the Syrian author Vadi'a Talhuq's book A New Crusade in Palestine, published on the eve of the Arab invasion, compared the war to the liberation of Palestine from the crusaders. Yet Israel in 1948 was no tool of the West. On the contrary, it could not have won the war without arms shipments from the Soviet bloc. The socialist nature of Israeli society at the time prompted Egypt's prime minister, Mahmud al-Nuqrashi, to define Israel as an agent of """"atheism and nihilist Communism."""" And the Zionists' Arab enemies were hardly under the control of Islamic movements. They were all ruled by decadent conservative elites who paid nothing more than lip service to Islamic values and the religious hysteria on the Arab street. Broadcasters and agitators rallied the masses under the banner of a holy war against the nascent Jewish state. But the Muslim Brotherhood sent only one battalion to fight in Palestine. It was ill-trained conventional armies, not Hezbollah-style guerrilla units, that led the Arab assault in 1948.

I was recently picking through Japanese books critical of SGI at the Harvard library and I was surprised to find so many smears and guilt by association arguments.

JANZEN* Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 Communicated by Gordon H. Orians, April 29, 1994 (received for review January 3, 1994) [].

I suggest the connection between the concern over global warming and extinction be returned to article based on this passage:

The causal influence of annual variation in climatic temperature on cohort sex ratios in this population of painted turtles serves as a clear empirical example of the biological impact portended by rapid global temperature change. This study demonstrates that the demography of populations of species with temperature-dependent sex determination may be directly sensitive even to modest deviations in the local thermal environment. These results are entirely consistent with earlier work on a nesting beach of endangered loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), wherein 87-99% of hatchlings from the rookery in each of 3 years were females because sand temperatures at nest level were high (39). If such strongly female-biased cohorts lead to highly skewed adult sex ratios, then the probability of population extinction may be greatly enhanced.

Is there really """"westerners"""" listening to Cantopop?  I doubt the sentence """"To western ears,..."""" is NPOV.

The article fails to mention the composer 顧家輝, singer 仙度拉, and their song 啼笑姻緣 which overturned the preception that Cantopop as a second grade Music (i.e. for old uneducated person only).  And it was Sammy Hui who finally pushed Cantopop to overtake Mandarin pop as the music of choice for HK youths.  
Yes no mention at all of the Gu Gaa-fai,Wong Jim collaboration. No mention at all of the popularity of TVB TV theme songs, while everbody else was sticking their own lyrics onto somebody elses music these two, seemed to be the only people producing original material.

 No problem.  I bet you have the chance to listen to the most popular Cantopop songs but not the best.  I will get the same preception if I listen only to Madonna or Britney Spears.

 Tones 

I heard that Cantonese music differs from Mandarin in that Mandarin respects the language tones in the melody, but Cantonese doesn't. Is it true?
 

 Good Cantopops do respect the language tones in the melody, as all Chinese dialects are tone-sensitive. What you heard is a recent disaster in HK music, beautiful face is more important than singing skills and so songs become less important.  But there are still many real musicians care about the tones and the melody. 

Cantonese is more tonal than Mandarin.  Mandarin only has 4 tones for each pronunciation, but Cantonese has at least 6 tones according to most dictionaries.  Some author even claims there are 9 tones in Cantonese.  Even though written Chinese can be pronunced in Cantonese or Mandarin, but the sound differs so much that you cannot sing a Cantonese song in Mardarin nor vice versa.  Many popular tunes get both Cantonese and Mandarin lyrics which are totally rewritten and sometimes with unrelated subjects.   20:31, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Yes but Mandarin has a more pleasant rhythm when spoken with natural darkness and light and this translates into songs pleasnter on the ear.I've heard people talk about Cantonese as sounding like a machine gun on the ear. 

And, how do Cantopop artists deal with music piracy? 
 

 Cantopop artists deal with piracy using the same technique as European or American artists, i.e. virtually nothing they can do!!! 

 But I was under the impression that in HK and Canton, media piracy was much much higher than in Europe or America. But there still are Cantopop artists. Are the economic models different? Do they resort to corporate patronage? ...  

 Curious: How did you hear that """"height"""" in Cantonese areas?  00:40 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)

 I meant South China in general, but it should affect Cantopop. My source is Slashdot . Ehem. I think I read something in Wired of Bruce Sterling finding dirt-cheap pirated media there, but I don't find it. I though tit was common knowledge.  

You have some of the most popular cantopop stars e.g. Joey Yung and Twins going on TV and saying how poor they are and asking their fans not to steal their livlihoods.And yes they do resort to corporate patronage of a sort.In the Joey Yung interview I was referring to, she claimed that she was making no money on her albums, but that she still had to produce albums to keep herself in the public eye and maintain her fanbase. With a large enough fanbase she can make money on personal appearances and concerts.For example Jade Kwan has recently been booked by a chain of bars, in the mainland, for a dozen or so 20 minute mini-concerts.Furthermore if you are popular enough you can make money through endorsments.There isn't a single reasonably attractive female cantopop singer who isn't e",0

The only query I have is that Boxing News uses a hyphen in the new weight divisions; """"light-welterweight"""" etc. Some boxing books type them they same way also.

TheShadowCrow's argument for the WBC not using caps was that it's not an English speaking org, when his example, the diabolical WBA, isn't either. What an absolute idiot.

TheShadowTard comes along making a complete mess of these records and pages, then after I revert his clumsy edits, he comes sniveling to the admins' talk pages claiming it's ME who's attacking the pages. What a complete and utter lying hypocritical spastic. He knows nothing about boxing.

If you know what's good for you, and for wikipedia, you'll all realize your embarrassing errors and revert every bit of vandalism you've all done in making a complete mess of the following boxing pages;

Nonito Donaire
Vic Darchinyan
Roy Jones
Manny Pacquiao
Floyd Mayweather
Erik Morales
Marco Antonio Barrera
Juan Manuel Marquez
Arthur Abraham
Andre Ward
Vitali Klitschko
Wladimir Klitchsko
Sugar Ray Leonard
Thomas Hearns
Marvin Hagler
Timothy Bradley
Sergio Martinez
Jane Couch

But, you're the admins. As long as you actually realize that user TheShadowCrow is wrong and you're siding with vandalism, and it's too late for you to change, that's good enough.

Kind regards, UkBoxen

Speedy deletion of Lyall Brooks
 A tag has been placed on Lyall Brooks requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

"Regnerus Study: Criticism 

Previous versions of this article unnecessarily multiplied references to criticism of the New Family Structures Study. 

First of all, this article is ostensibly about the Witherspoon Institute, not the New Family Structures Study, and it does not make sense to devote so much space to one study in what is otherwise a small article about an organization that has done many other things, as mentioned in the earlier paragraphs. 

Further, there is already a reference to the fact that the Study received criticism, down toward the end of the article. That same sentence also refers to the fact that many scholars also voiced praise for the Study, and thereby gives much more balance than the earlier discussion of criticism.

The fact remains that the Study was published by a peer-reviewed journal and was conducted at a major research university that has not condemned it. Some people voiced concerns to the same university that the study had not been conducted properly and the university found that the concerns did not merit further scrutiny. This Study has received the same vetting that countless other academic studies have received, including ones that came to very different conclusions.

In short, previous representations of criticism in this article about this Study were unnecessarily long, presented the Study in a very biased light, and made this article into a forum for voicing opinions that is properly handled in the academy through the methods of peer review and institutional review that the Study already passed. By ignoring those very processes of review such discussion does a disservice to Wikipedia's readers and suggests that the critics have a problem with the academic review processes as such, not the New Family Structures Study itself.",0

 You People... 
...Are hoping, begging and wishing for previlages, respect a title that you did not earn, go by on your own and are not deserving of.  You did not build the US, you had the Spanish Empire and it failed, not you come here by crossing the border and by boat.  Stop fooling yourselves.  BEFORE the first Spanird came to the Americas, they already had black blood and Asian blood in them!  This is why they are darker.  This is why on the paintings from the Colombua period they had yelolow hues, dark hair, curly hair and full lips.  Yeah, Isabella was red, but Spaniards were never one type of European to begin with.  On top of that, as the Moors got defeated (not actually kicked out of Spain altogether), more Europeans came into the mix and reintroduced whiteness.  NOW, the mulattoized peoples still remained as it is today, especially in Portugal, France and Italy.

Once the Spaniards came over here, mixing was let loose, UNLIKE the rule in the USA!  See, the US was operating on whiteness and a white 'purity' concept.  You guys were operating on being greedy and grabbing land and not knowing what to do with it.  You mixed with the natives and the Africans.  It is more than clear.  In fact, it is so clear that that is all you see.  Only after the US established itself as THE word power (and broke down Spain's empire.  How come they did not do it to France..?), THEN you people started trying to think of yourselves as white.  That only increased as you immigrated to the US and it broke your hearts when you found out that you were not white and landed in the ghetto.

If you sad mixed people don't get it by now - AMerica does not settle for mixes or those who cry about being white, you are or you are not.  If you have noticed in US history and society in general, Spain and Portugal are hardly if ever mentioned in a context with Europe.  You ask the average American where Portugal is they can't tell you.  They may have heard of some people (usually black) calling themselves Portuguese, but have no idea where or what Portugal is.  Spain less so, but white is not associated with Spain.  Even Europe is hardly associated with Spain.

All of this BS about you guys being more pure than American whites is just that - BS.  People know that you are hispanic.  You don't - you can't fool anyone.  Only very few of you look like a 'no questions asked' white person.  I can understand your pain, since many Greeks and Italians are regarded (not exactly accepted) as white, even though clear non-European/African traits are visible.  I guess you would ask """"if they can be white, then why should I not be?""""  Good question, but you people are not doubt mixed and recently.  Italians and Greeks may not have a direct black parent, but you can look at them and see that African beneath the surface.  Some African is on the surface more than the white is!  

Sadly (for those of you with white dreams that is), you are lumped together with the rest of your latino brothers.  Just because things are not going well n ALL of those (so much land and resources) countries, you want to come to the US and get a free ride as whites?  It does not work as easily for you as it may work for others.  One, you ARE NOT coming from Europe, so there is no built-n perception of whiteness based on Europe alone.  Two, you are mixed!  You need to review the history of the US!  Once you do (the 20th century alone will do), you will see that you need not apply as white.  Only the absolute whitest (dying your hair blond or red does not fool anyone for your information) need apply.  You just can't come to a country and get a free ride.  You have ALL of Latin America, instead of making something out of that, you want to come here and try and be white.  No, no.

I still cannot believe how many Puerto-Ricans, Dominicans, Chileans, Argentines and so on truly believe themselves to be white.  I met a femle who thinks she is white.  I keep telling her it is only in her world because it is not in anyone elses.  Spain IS in Europe, but despite popular thought, not all Europeans are white.  You can do your best to lie about the Moors, lies about African savery in Latin America and lie that there was even race-mixing going on, it does not change history and biolgy.

Also, I was already well aware of the hispanic trick of calling white people Anglos, meaning """"your type of whites as opposed to my type"""" which whites don't care about.  You are not seen as white, you are seen as hispanics.  This is why you are (along with Italians and other black mixed Europeans)quick to (try) and be 'racist'(renegade mulatto is more like it) against blacks, thinking that it pleased whites and that it somehow makes you feel white in your mind.  Being white does not mean being a racist.  White is an American (USA) thing.  Most Europeans never thought of themselves as beinga part of a white people.  It is",0

A clear example is in Arvanitika: v14 claims (correctly - I wish I knew how many speakers there were left) a range between 50,000 (Newmark) to 140,000 possible speakers (1977 Trudgill and Tzavaras). v15 comes up with 150,000 (2000) without a clear attribution (what happened in 2000) or an explanation of how a language in clear decline increased in numbers. Moreover v15 creates a new category of 10k speakers of Tosk Albanian for the region of Epirus; this is now separate from Arvanitika despite the fact that the page on Arvanitika still includes the reference to a Northwestern Arvanitika dialect from v14 that could only have referred to the region of Epirus. There is a clear inference (from the text as well) that the inclusion of this new category is related to the political issue of the Cham expulsion (and the claims about """"Orthodox Chams""""). Finally the very concept of what these numbers mean is in doubt. The north of the village of Andros is mentioned for Arvanitika: bilingualism in our families ended with our grandparent's generation. Extremely few among our parent's generation could converse in Arvanitika - the rest retained a few words or curses and our generation still has those (if at all). To portray the area as Arvanitika speaking is so misleading that it can only be done on purpose.

There are published books (in Greece - by leftist Greek journalists and amateur historians) that refer to figures around 200k (or even more for that matter) for Slavomacedonian speakers in Greece (again based on some dubious definition); large agenda-driven figures can also be found for Vlachs and Arvanites - since FPS, Taivo and Jim62sch and the rest of the gang are such experts on Greece I leave it as an exercise to them to locate these sources and at least put a fig leaf on. Until then use of non-existent census figure in Ethnologue makes a mockery of the academic standards they so passionately purport to be trying to uphold.""",0

 Wikipedia:BRD 

In your future dealings with editors on articles please be aware of the above policy that says you should discuss any changes after your bold change has been reverted on the article talk page. In other words: 
 You being bold. (which is great).
 Me Reverting because unless they are resurrected by magic zombies are not paranormal creatures in the traditional sense. 
 You should of Discussed.

Please bear this in mind in future. This is so that you can fully justify your reasoning behind the changes, and are not caught up in pointless edit wars going back and forth and then you yourself cannot be accused of edit warring. Look forward to working with you.   ✉  

 I have read other rules where they say if it is done multiple times, then be discussed. And I have seen several main editors, who I'm sure you would know if named, who dodn't follow BRD at all.
 And I wasn't going to discuss my edit on Warm Bodies the second time round because I put it back with sources I found for it. If you weren't happy with that, then I would have discussed it.
 But as you seem happy with it now, as you haven't reverted it, then there isn't any problem.   

Just because they don't, doesn't mean you shouldn't. Old saying, """"do as I say not as I do"""" comes to mind. In other words, do as Wikipedia says, not as other editors do, and you can't really go wrong. 
It's not a case of being happy with it, I just don't want to edit war over it. I do not believe that it is classed as """"paranormal"""" the lead needs sorting anyway as there are far too many genre's listed in the opening lead.   ✉  

 The idea of free will also comes to mind. Like I said, if it was reverted a second time I would have said why it should have been included on the talk page. I'm not going to waste my time. I added an edit in and then later found a source for it. Paranormal romance is currently the only genre there with a source. As we are using our own opinions on the page, you don't believe paranormal romance should be included as there are too many genres, l well I personally think """"fantasy"""" could go. The story is focusing more on paranormal romance than it is on the fantasy, it is inspired by the love story Romeo and Juliet.   
Good idea. I'll get rid of it. A source isn't usually needed for every genre. I will also transfer a copy of this conversation to the article talk page. Just so other involved can par take.   ✉  
 Woops, just realised I moved this over to my archive. Meant to only move the two dormant posts.   
That's cool. I thought it was something like that so I replaced it.   ✉

"""==Author's comments==

I posted the following comments on the userpage, but moved them now to this talk page with minor edits:

The following changes are suggested:

 Mark """"Requests for Adminship"""" as historical, and open the new process, """"Sysop Applications.""""
 Replace the standard three RFA questions with the six questions shown below.  
 Question 3 - how the applicant intends to use the sysop tools - is similar to old question 1. 
 Question 4, asking for the applicant's article writing experience, is based on old Question 2. 
 I have removed old question 3 about conflicts with other users.
 Questions 1 and 2 are added to establish minimum criteria.  Only one user (Lustiger.seth) who failed these criteria has become a sysop in the last several years.  Having these criteria on the application should eliminate the need for WP:NOTNOW closes to premature RFAs.
 Questions 5 and 6 are added to establish the candidate's character for honesty.  Why this wasn't done years ago after the Archtransit scandal is hard for me to understand.  Disclosure of material negative information should be expected of all applicants.
 Remove the old system of voting """"support"""", """"oppose"""", or """"neutral"""" with a reason in your vote.  Instead, vote """"support"""" or """"oppose"""" without giving a reason.  Then, if you choose to give a reason, you may comment in the """"Concerns"""" section or on the talk page of the Application.
 This change will reduce the """"pile-on"""" effect of oppose voting.  Normally, in old RFAs, support voters vote without saying much, whereas oppose voters write long comments.  The oppose votes are disorganized insofar as oppose vote number 13 may refer back to oppose votes number 2 and 6.  The cumulative effect of oppose votes with long reasons is to say """"we hate you.""""  
 The new model removes this asymmetry.  You can still oppose, but you can't say more in your oppose vote than a supporter would say in her support vote.  The cumulative effect of bare support and oppose votes is """"some of us like you, and some don't.""""  To the extent that reasons for opposing the candidate need to be explained, the voter can explain in the """"Concerns"""" section.
 No """"neutral"""" votes.  If you don't want to vote, nobody is forcing you.  Neutral votes are pointless.
 We can decide later what a passing score should be.  For now we can allow bureaucrats to use their discretion as they currently do.

The following features will be maintained from the old RFA process:
 Bureaucrats decide the outcome after a 7-day discussion.
 A nominator may praise the candidate.  That is probably the one positive aspect of old RFA that is worth preserving.

Responding to your message:
First, I believe that the thing you implied is not true. I don't know of any commonly-accepted policy or guideline that tells people to log in before making wholesale or substantial edits. I think this is a notion of your own that you're using (in good faith) to discourage this editor from contributing.

As I understand, there is for protected and featured articles which the San Francisco article is.

I assume 64.81.57.93 is a newcomer and not an established user. Someone who's made less than 60 edits fits my concept of a newcomer. Someone who has no welcome message on his or her talk page also fits my concept of a newcomer. (I just went and added a welcome message using .) What you wrote in the edit summary was not in the spirit of welcoming newcomers to the project, which is what the guideline I cited is about.

I think this is your fault as far as jumping to conclusions. The user has made over a 100 edits since February of last year and many to the San Francisco page. Certainly not a """"newcomer"""" under any objective evaluation, and more of a casual editor probably. Not sure why you added the welcome message either when the user probably had one back in 2008, and deleted it.

Furthermore, if this person is going to editing pages for here on out, then this helps my case as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account%3F

You do not need to reveal your offline identity, but having an account gives you a fixed Wikipedia identity that other users will recognize. While we welcome anonymous contributions, logging in under a pseudonym lets you build trust and respect through a history of good edits. It is also easier to communicate and collaborate with an editor if we know who you are (at least, who you are on Wikipedia). It is also easier for veteran users to assume good faith from new users who take the effort to create an account (and you may well become a veteran user yourself some day!). You may well be afforded a great deal less leeway if you do not go to the trouble of making up a username.

This is especially true for a user that edits quite often a featured and/or protected article.

I'm also worried that you're trying to communicate with this user via edit summaries, which are easily missed, even by experienced users with watchlists and all. If the edits he or she is making aren't constructive, you should explain why on the user's talk page, focusing on the nature of edit itself instead of the (to me, unimportant) detail that the person who made it was not logged in.

This seems to be little more than a campaign of intimidation. Some editors use wikilawyering as a way to intimidate other users with whom they do not agree. This is at least a question of not AGF and of refusing to accept that Wikipedia works by compromise and consensus. I have seen this pattern of Wikilawyering from an editor called Lukas19 (who reported me repeatedly to WP:PAIN and constantly described my good faith edits as """"vandalism"""", but none of this came to anything, though it was stressful and I had many sleepless nights), it is very intimidating.

However, I have to say I do not read the first paragraph the same way Graft does, I see no non-sequitor.  The subject of the first sentence is not inherited traits (that is in the predicate) and the subject of the second sentence is not fact versus theory (which again is in the predicate.  The subject of the first sentence is """"evolution"""" and the predicate provides a definition.  The subject of the second sentence is evolutionary biology - the field of academe that makes the study of evolution its object, and the source of just about all the contents of the article.  The third sentence goes on to tell us about what we learn from evolutionary biology.  This progression (define a subject, explain who studies/has expertise in it, then elaborate on this field of study) makes perfect sense to me.

See WP:NFF for more specifics, but unless there becomes in-deph discussion on the production (and I've seen what's out there and there isn't enough) then we have to wait till the film is released.

 Re:  O'Neills of Puerto Rico 

It was already discussed and decided to merge the O'Neills of Puerto Rico article into O'Neill dynasty, see Talk:O'Neill dynasty.  The Puerto Rico article was simply copied and pasted into the dynasty article, with the exception of the list of military service, so you are mistaken if the Puerto Rico article contained """"far more content"""".  There seems to be no encyclopedic value to the list, however, and that was why I excluded it.  Many families have had numerous members join military service, but that does not warrant entry into an encyclopedia.  If there was greater research on the more important individuals, then I would have kept it.  Of course, you are welcome to edit it, but unless more information is included than simply a list, I doubt there will be consensus to keep it.  [tk]  """,0

"Silicate weathering 

The weathering page needs to treat silicate weathering.  Could those who know add a few words about this? Silicate weathering is a global sink for CO2.  During global ice ages across geological time, silicate weathering is reduced when ice sheets reduce the amount of continental crust exposed to weathering.  The resulting rise in atmospheric C02 is thought to be one factor for bringing the earth out of an ice age (and, of course, setting us up for the next cycle).

"I do not agree with any of your statements. (1) There is no such thing as an *infinitesimal*. (2) 1-0.999... is not an infinitesimal, it is an indeterminate real value greater than 0. If this shocks you, why does it not also shock you that pi is also indeterminate. You can only approximate pi. (3) Therefore 1-0.999... > 0. 

Tango: There are infinitely many numbers between 0.999... and 1 - check the archives and you will find a clear example. You are incorrectly assuming that the limit of a series determines a number. If you insist on defining a number by a series (in fact this is circular), you must be consistent: what is the limit of any irrational number defined as a Cauchy sequence? You do not know, therefore you cannot use this definition. Furthermore, the apparatus for comparing numbers in decimal form must be consistent. You start wih the most significant digit in the representation and continue the comparison until you find two digits that are not equal. Having 0.999... = 1, contradicts this method. You must also remember that it is impossible to represent all numbers in any radix system. Most numbers can only be approximated. And if this is so, why would anyone foolishly insist on having 0.999... = 1? 98.195.24.26",0

Question from Bishonen: an injunction for XAL?
Oops. I didn't realize that the Bogdanov Affair affair had made it to RFAR; I just blocked XAL for the third time for unrepentant personal attacks. 72 hours. Should I unblock her so she can respond to this RFAR? I'd appreciate it if she could get an injunction against editing anywhere else, though (especially not on Talk:Bogdanov Affair), for what would have been the duration of the block. I'm not happy about all this vitriol she spreads, and, from past experience, I'd expect it to be worse now that I've gotten her worked up with a new block. Bishonen | talk  PS, re Snowspinner's request above that XAL along with other users be banned from editing the article: she never has edited it. Never edited any article on wikipedia. I want her banned from the article's talkpage.

For what it is worth, I support this motion. XAL has contributed nothing to the discussion, in stark contraindistinction to most of the other users like Igor or rbj or ybm, and often stirs things up. Maru (talk)  
Also from an outsider: XAL appears to only rant and to only rant on one topic (user:YBM, whose letters are sequentially one after hers, like IBM and HAL), and to contribute nothing but a negative  an anti- point of view. Thus, she seems to have come to us from some outside web fight and longterm flamewar. Since coming here, she has demonstrated the grace, understanding, curiosity, and equanimity of a wounded hyena with rabies. Geogre  

What do you know about all that but what I told you specifically, like HAL, and did you read my settlement proposal at all? no did you read the answers being made to it by your idiotic friends rjb and maru?

You don't know about fact as yu don't know about the scientific methods.
You are rants. You speak on an arbitration where you are most unwelcome with the same empty sind as you pass your idiotic sonnet and your fat ass: happy of your ignorancy and passing the marshmallow.

This arbitration is about the reality of an organisation having build up this whole affair since nov 2003 up to today, and known as the postsituationists group, under the direction of Jean Pierre Voyer, directing the actions to be taken in close cooperation with YBM.
The rest is rant and superficiality.

It's been a frustrating set of compromises, believe me. I've had people that wanted me to use the website name as the work field, and others that thought it the website was a publisher. I still believe that the organization that issues the chart in the first place should be treated as the author, and I finally removed that field from the citation because there was a very loud campaign from people that just couldn't understand that corporations can legally be treated as people. Use of italics was another set of arguments, and there was a large segment of people that believed that the chart names themselves were things that we could rewrite to suit our tastes.

 PREP vs. Quick Count 

The text of the article suggests (and states overtly at least once) that the PREP and the Quick Count are the same thing. They are most definitely not. 

The Quick Count (""""Conteo Rapido"""", as opposed to the PREP, """"Programa the Resultados Electorales Preliminares""""), was a statistical sampling model of several polling places. It was meant as a statistical tool of prediction. The results from the Quick Count, which were made public some days later, showed that the statistical tests showed Calderon as winning in all three, but in two of them the difference was within the margin of error and in the third it was only barely outside. It was because of this, as per prior agreement, that the IFE declared the race too close to call (the prior agreement was that the IFE would either state which candidate was projected to be the winner based on the Conteo Rapido, or ask for a couple more hours to collate more results, or declare the race too close to call). The Quick Count was not the PREP. As it happens, the final tally agreed with the Quick Count results.

The PREP on the other hand is the quick dissemination of full results as reported by the district electoral councils to the IFE. There is no statistical component to the PREP, as opposed to the Quick Count which is an entirely statistical analysis of results.

See for example , in which Ugalde speaks of making the results from the Quick Count known, and whether the tecnical committee felt it would be possible to determine the electoral tendencies at the time.  Another note is in:

The real issue here is that OFSTED reports are primary sources, just as the Crested report is a primary source. We have a situation where editors are each trying to interpret these primary sources and adding their own spin in line with their own opinions. It's really neither here nor there what I think or what Fmph thinks, it is how the primary sources are interpreted in secondary sources that counts. We effectively have original research here where editors are try to interpret these reports themselves and cite from them selectively and not setting the reports in the appropriate context. To answer Sailmfadhley's question, OFSTED reports do sometimes get reported in local newspapers, usually if they receive an outstanding rating or if the school is put into special measures. I can't find any newspaper reports relating to the inspections at Woodleigh. It tends to be the worst-performing schools that attract the attention of secondary sources. For The Ridings School for example it is entirely appropriate to quote from OFSTED reports as they were widely cited in the national press. There might well be a need to cite the latest inspection report but in this case the most recent report is rather brief and focused on issues like flooring, bathing facilities and the general state of the accommodation rather than the education of the pupils. We don't normally include information about such matters in school articles. This is also not by any means a typical OFSTED report. All the OFSTED reports for this school have a much narrower focus than the usual OFSTED reports as they are concerned primarily with the boarding provision and the related health and safety and child welfare issues which in itself offers an unbalanced view of the school. Normally independent schools get inspected by the Independent Schools Inspectorate, but I cannot find any recent report from the ISI.   18:04",0

 The house in question is in Bethlehem according to two gospels and a prophecy.  
 Although the place of birth is disputed (and, I think, it is generally thought the original gospels had him being born in Nazareth) the passages about Mary and Joseph staying in a house/stable relate to a supposed trip to Bethlehem.  
 Bethlehem is a long way from Nazareth

Either the story should say Bethlehem, or the stone is some sort of crib from a house in Nazareth, or the myth itself is based on an alternative historical version (I was going to say inaccurate, but given we've already got two contradictory and both disputed accounts of possible event it's all a bit of a matter of opinion anyway!)",0

Okay, here's what you need to do to prove a point on Wikipedia and to request a positive change. Look back at the history of revisions on the Beat Generation page back to between the summer of 2006 and the fall of 2008. I literally created the entire section of the page called """"cultural context"""" and wrote most of it. I wrote the section now called """"writers""""  which I don't believe is accurately named, but that's another issue  as a section called """"usage"""". Look at the Allen Ginsberg page. My intentions are positive; up until my antagonization of Tao, I have been cordial and have worked in a postive direction for over four years. What I want is the truth. What I want is accuracy on pages. That's what drives me in situations like this. Blocking me is not working toward the end of improving Wikipedia. Please actually listen to me  and I mean actually listen to me. Don't scan. Read carefully. I urge you once again, read the """"Formal argument edition"""" entry and the """"get down to business entry"""". Please actually read it. If I'm wasting your time, you are not doing your actual job and your blocking becomes meaningless  what if a police officer threw someone in jail and then claimed he didn't have the time to do the investigation? That would completely invalidate the judgement, especially when so much of the evidence in this case has been completely ignored. You claim I was dishonest in creating my sockpuppet; I was nothing but honest. Your claims demonstrate a lack of concern to find the actual truth in this situation, so I urge you, please, consider the actual truth carefully.  This is a genuine appeal because at this point I think the blocking represents a total absence of justice. I promise to not attack Tao or anyone else ever again and comply by the rules. Being blocked was fun but it got boring quickly. Now that that motivation is gone, I have no motivation to try to get blocked again. I swear to you. If you do your job, actually read what I'm saying, and consider this very seriously, I believe you'll find there is no good reason to block me beyond the original punitive length.

Canadian Ethnic Studies Journal,  Spring, 2001  by Monica Boyd,  Doug Norris]:

 """"At the close of the twentieth century, """"Canadian"""" has become the fastest growing ethnic origin group, up from 0.5 percent in 1986 to nearly 4 percent in 1991 and to 31 percent in the 1996 census of Canada.

Using unpublished tabulations from the 1986, 1991 and 1996 Canadian censuses, this paper traces temporal shifts for a cohort of the Canadian-born age 25-44 in 1986 (and age 34-54 by 1996). We find that most of the increases between 1986 and 1991 in """"Canadian"""" ethnic origin responses are accompanied by intercensal losses in British origin responses. Between 1991 and 1996, increasing Canadian responses went hand in hand with dramatic losses in both the British and French ethnic origin counts. In some provinces, notably the Prairie provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, shifts also occurred out of other ethnic groups.""""

 Yep.  This is one of several cases where the vast majority of the time the pattern is met, it is indeed vandalism.  (I suspect something like 99% or better, but have no actual data behind that, so it's really just a guestimate.)  There are a small number of cases on this and some other of the bot's criteria that are actually false positives.  The error matches a vandalistic pattern, but is actually not vandalism.  In general it has been decided that this is a small enough price to pay for the good that the bot does in rapidly reverting the rest that are indeed vandalism.  In general the bot is supposed to run in Friendly mode, where it will not edit war.  This means that if you get hit by a false positive, just make the edit again and remove the warning from your talk page.  The bot should not revert a second time on the same edit.
 As for refining, that's tricky.  What was there about those two edits that a bot, a computer program, could have used to identify them as not vandalism?  Sure, the bot could be programmed with the very specific examples of those two edits, but the next time won't be exactly the same.  If we told it that """"CITATION NEEDED"""" was not vandalism, then the next time they used """"NEED CITATION"""", or """"CITATION REQUIRED"""" or """"FACT CHECK"""", then the bot would not catch it.  We cannot anticipate every single way someone might make this mistake.  The radio station edit is even more tricky.  And what about the edits that have nothing to do with citations or radio stations?  We would need solid criteria that would allow the bot to tell that one all-cap edit is vandalism while another is not.  And I for one have no idea what we could use.  New ideas for improving the bot are welcome, but in this case we need very specific ideas for rules that will help a bot tell the difference.  The bot is stupid, and only does what it is programmed to do, nothing more.  It cannot make judgement calls edit by edit. -  """,0

Also, whilst marriage is legally,in some places, equally available to same-sex or hetreosexual couples, not everyone believes that in religious terms the two unions are equal. The view of those people also deserves to be respected as well as other views. I have therefore qualified the term 'marriage' with 'legal'.",0

 Well, since we're making a list, individual bootlegs don't need to be notable themselves, but I know what you mean, we need some standards for inclusion. As with the sketchy nature of bootlegs themselves, we need to make sure we included only actual bootlegs (I mean """"bootleg"""" in the traditional sense of the word). Generally, I would say if we can find enough information to write a short paragraph or so on it, then let's include it. Most of the sources for this information is going to be found on personal sites of collectors and not really verifiable, so I would say for every inclusion we should have at least two independent sources. Unless... you got a book on Who bootlegs. I tried to track down my friend's, but he couldn't find it. (

I'm sure you've found these sites already, but these are what I've been using.

 http://www.xmission.com/~legalize/who/boots/index.html <- Hasn't been updated in forever. Mentions The Who: The Illustrated Discography as his source, which I believe is what my friend's book is called.

I still need to do some research, before I starting putting together an article, so feel free to start it. I'm gonna try to get a hold of that book. I might just go an buy myself a copy.

 Corm Capital SPEEDY Deletion 

Dear Darkwind (!),

This page is not unambiguously promotional and definitely does not deserve deletion! The page was NOT created by Corm Capital! That said, reading it and now that it has been created, its purpose is not about promoting Corm Capital but giving a different perspective on the company. Corm Capital is a company with over 1 billion USD in private funds and extremely well established in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA). Furthermore, S&P;/Bloomberg conducted in-depth research on the company, its subsidiaries and senior management before including it in its ultra-selective S&P; Capital IQ database (public link available at http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=238637949). And the list goes on and on...

Bottom line: Corm Capital is a company founded in 1998 with private funds over 1 billion USD and extremely well established in MENA. Having not created this page but having stumbled upon this deletion message, I strongly contest the deletion of this article on the grounds that Corm Capital DESERVES to have a Wikipedia page on it like so many other smaller, less interesting and less established companies that have one. If the content is the problem (I noticed that the description was a taken from our website), PLEASE allow my team some time to arrange it according to Wikipedia's guiding principles.

Also, please note that my grandfather's Wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Corm) has been online for years and has been visited by thousands if not millions of people (my grandfather is in most offline encyclopedias). I personally guard his page when """"incorrect"""" material is inserted in his Wikipedia page so I am well aware of Wikipedia's SPIRIT and GOVERNING PRINCIPLES.

Please trust my sincerity with regards to this deletion matter and please feel free to suggest steps you recommend I/Corm Capital take in order to avoid such an undeserved action (your warning page is impossible to understand!).

I have been a staunch supporter and promoter of Wikipedia for the last 10 years.

Once again, I urge you to remove your deletion of the Corm Capital page to give time to my team to write a """"Wikepdia friendly"""" page.

Kind personal regards,
Charles David Corm""",0

Perhaps it would make sense to move some of the stuff from Terrorism against Arabs back here, if we came to having 2 distinct articles once again? For instance, Lord Moyne was not much of an Arab (though they were his favorites, I guess), so his assassination by Stern gang belongs more to Israeli terrorism Uriyan

 Facts about Israel (note that many of the statements on this page are disputed)

With all the due respect, I don't think this link should be applied on this page, for several reasons:
 It is not about Israeli terrorism, but about general Israel-bashing
 It contains mostly incomplete and partial information. For instance, the green Palestinian number plates was something they asked for. Israeli Arabs have regular yellow plates, and because of that are sometimes targeted by Palestinian gunmen.
 Many of these statements deserve a proper discussion, in Wikipedia, not out of it.  Uriyan

The USS Liberty incident is generally thought to have been an Israeli mistake.

 The USS Liberty was a US Navy ship. It was flying a Navy ensign. It had guns on it. Since it wasn't civilian, engaging it at sea does not have anything to do with terrorism, and has no place on this page, which is about terrorism. Uriyan

 Uriyan

This sentence has been removed from the article about Kach. """"They have also organized murders and beatings of Palestinians in the U.S.""""
 Really?  Who?  

I too am curious about this claim. It is so vague and undocumented that it does not belong in the article. Can someone provide specific claims, and a few sources for us to check out? Also, I do not understand what this has to do with the government of Israel. I agree that it is theoretically possible for a few fanatic right-wing American Jews to carry out such a thing. But (A) there is only a vague allegation being made, and (B) this has nothing to do with the Israeli government, nor the pre-Israel proto-state in the British Mandate of Palestine. We can't simply lump all crimes done by Jewish people into the category of """"Israeli terrorism"""". All crimes committed by Arabs considered Palestinian terrorism (No.). 

Unless these acts were committed by agents of the government of Israel, why are they listed as """"Israeli terrorism"""" instead of """"Jewish terrorism""""?  ~~

I'd tend to agree with Zoe here about the title of the article being wrong. Since it's so """"controversial"""" coming up with a universally-acceptable definition of """"terrorist"""" vs. """"freedom fighter"""", maybe we should just have """"Violence against Israelis"""" and """"Violence against Palestinians"""" pages, or some such?

 Such pages exist (at least for Palestinians), but nobody bothers to update them. It's much less sexy than """"Israeli terrorism"""". 

Then maybe this should redirect to """"Violence against Palestinians"""" (after moving the content of this page & its Talk there, of course)?

The page I had in mind was Palestinians killed by Israelis, but I support leaving """"X terrorism"""" pages, because of the difference between spontaneous violence and pre-calculated killing, which is terrorism. 

Actually, I was thinking of very neutral titles (such as the """"violence"""" ones above), chucking in all the text from any non-NPOV-titled articles scattered about (they can be smoothed out later) and redirecting to the neutral-titled articles. It should make NPOV easier to maintain. I'd lose the """"terrorism"""" pages entirely in the process (dumping their text & talk into the new articles), as we're never going to agree on which acts are """"terrorism"""" and which are not (and you know we're not, yeah?). If the articles just give the facts then we can leave """"terrorism or not?"""" decisions up to the readers.

 Having considered the concept, I support it. In the text itself, we would then have the freedom to describe which actions exactly can be considered terrorism and by whom. 

(bloody hell, did we just agree on something, Uri? Will wonders never cease?)

 Yes, we did agree, and I'm glad at it. I hope it'll be a good beginning for tomorrow - I've got to log out now.

"Civil Constitution of the Clergy
The Roman Catholic Church was the dominating religion until the Revolution of 1789, when the revolutionaries sought to overthrow not only the monarchy and its supporters, but also the whole social and political system, including the Church. Although the Church survived the revolution, according to the ideology of the new republic it could no longer remain a separate estate with its own possessions. Therefore, the new government confiscated the land and assets belonging to the Church and auctioned them off to help resolve the financial problems that had led to the revolution. The state also attempted a huge restructuring of the Church hierarchy and demanded that the clergy swear allegiance to the French government ahead of the Church. Only a small percentage of priests complied with this request, but nevertheless this attempt to bring the Catholic Church under state control can be seen as the beginning of the development of secularism in France.

As a description of the events of 1790, this lacks both neutrality and accuracy. The National Assembly did not conduct an entire revolution of the structure of society; they confiscated Church land to pay the national debt. (If they had, what would have been left for the Jacobins of 1793 to do?)",0

"Rajarata was abundant due to regular wars for the Rajarata land. Sinhalese kings tried to re established Rajarata, but they weren't allowed by Pandyan empire. They had full control of the Sri Lanka in 1450. They got real opportunity after 235 years from the Tamil invasion. That time people adjusted to wet zone so it is possible that descendants of the engineering families didn't had the practical knowledge to rebuild the dry zone hydraulic system. It wasn't that much simple. Even British couldn't understand how the system works. 
So clear major reason is they were adjusted to a another system. Also non existence of expert knowledge to rebuild the system could help to not to go to dry zone again.  But clearly it is not enviornmental issues. It was run more than 15 centuries.
I don't see Magha is irrelavant here. Magha doesn't mean only Magha. He couldn't do all the things alone. He was supported by his army.
Even king didn't had child army had children. Those are the people who came to Jaffna.   

 pre History of Jaffna kingdom 

Jaffna was part of Rajarata before the collapse of Rajarata. Some people trying to say there was independent kingdom (convergence) Jaffna. But how there can be a kingdom without people ? People came with Magha's army. So due to what it could survive from the power of Rajarata ?   

 Starting point of Rajarata 
Magha is not the one who established Jaffna kingdom. Magha is the last king of Rajarata. People accept Magha as king as they couldn't find any royal blood at that time and Magha was Nissanka Malla relative. Also sinhalese power was very weak at that time due to regular providing of strong armies to assist Pandyan to servile from Cholas. Due to this Veera Pandyan a Pandyan prince who get help from Sinhalese and couldn't servive chola powers invaded weak (unstable due to internal conflicts for kingship) Pollonnaruwa. Then Kalinga Magha (Sinha) invaded Rajarata with army of Tamils. There was a battle Magha defeated Veera Pandyan. Magha was accepted as the king. But it wasn't sure whether Magha was controlled by his army chiefs. Armies destroyed Buddhist stupas (may be to find treasures). Also there wasn't way to feed large number of army. Therefore they expelled Sinhalese from north.
People go against the king (as they did to Mahasen) and fight against king. Magha had to abandon the Rajarata. This army wasn't big as previous chola armies. Previous occasions Rajarata rulers completely expelled previous chola invaders and those who wished to join  king was also allowed ( vellakkara group). But Magha's army had good support from Pandyan (It is not clear why Pandyan betrayed Sinhalese as Sinhalese regularly provided armies to survive from Cholas). Pandyan was just near Jaffna and able to respond very quickly. After repulse of Sinhalese Magha's descenders had to accept they obey Pandyan King. Pandyan ruled/assist jaffna with military family called as Aryachakravarthi. But in 1323 powerful Muslim empire destroyed Pandyan capital and captured the king. After Pandyan was ruled by Muslims. They didn't care to assist Jaffna. At this point Aryachkravarthi him self made as the king of Jaffna. 
It is not right to say Magha as the establisher of Jaffna kingdom. He was the king of Pollonnaruwa but after his death and tamil forces was expelled from Rajarata core areas to Jaffna they were under protection of the Pandyan king. So Arachakravarthi established the Jaffna Kingdom",0

"""::::::Agreed, although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. I was concentrating on the Polish attitude here, as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. Obviously, if the article is to be written from a supra-national perspective, at least the Czech experience needs to be included. Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was """"betrayed"""" in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland. 

That said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea. While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war, I think that the article's focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue. After all, there were dissidents in Germany and the Soviet Union, too, who were harbouring grudges towards Western politicians because of their appeasement policy.  19:06, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Marble Hill
Mifren,

Somehow you and I seem to have developed an unproductive relationship. I do think that your edits are good faith even though I disagree that the most recent ones should be included, yet I can't often assume good faith with your talk page edits. To accuse an editor of having ulterior motives, dismissing arguments as """"simplistic opinion"""", or accusing them of outright ignorance is generally regarded as disruptive, and to accuse Peripitus (one of the most level-headed editors I have come across) of the same things is completely unreasonable. You clearly have considerable passion for Marble Hill, but please remember what the purpose of Wikipedia is. There are plenty of ways you can contribute positively to the article without resorting to unreliable sources for which you have a clear conflict of interest.

this page needs to be split into religios and secular........ then lets see how many secular things can be written about the word???

U talk about this word about what other people use this word for , you really don't know what the word means.

"Comment - 'Station' as a word essentially means 'a fixed point'.  I'm not sure of the exact definition in the past, but it pre-dates railways by several centuries.  'Battle stations' as a term dates back some considerable way, and naval vessels in their correct patrol areas were said to be 'on station' in Nelson's time.  I believe it is derived from a Latin word meaning 'still' (i.e. 'stationary').  'Railway station' as a term goes back at least as far as 1825, while 'train station' was not recorded for over a century after that, nor were 'petrol station', 'power station' or 'bus station'.  One important consideration is how widespread a term is.  Is it a 'railway station' in Australia, India, South Africa or any other country where the British built the railways?  Finally, the term 'train' may be incorrect when referring to modern passenger railway vehicles.  Under some definitions, trains are exclusively loco-hauled or push-pull.  Most modern passenger vehicles are multiple units, and thus not 'trains' under these definitions, because there is no locomotive.128.240.229.3",0

I agree with you that Mansfield probably wouldn't object to the label. He's willing to write a book about manliness, after all! ) But I don't think I'm being oversensitive. I've seen a concerted effort by numerous editors on the Wikipedia to stigmatize various Bush administration officials, and it often involves linking together Leo Strauss, neoconservatism, and the War in Iraq. At one time, I thought the Wikipedia guideline on biographies of living persons required that the subject of articles """"publicly identify with the belief in question"""" (at least I thought it did although I can't find the relevant passage now) and I assumed that's why the comment in the article said """"Mansfield has self identified as a Straussian."""" So when I downloaded the interview and it turned out that it did not substantiate the claim, I changed the language without changing the substance. There are so many conspiracy theories out there about Leo Strauss and the War in Iraq (see G-hits for the search terms [""""Leo Strauss"""" War Iraq]) that I tend to be vigilant with notable students of Leo Strauss, since the word """"Straussian"""" has been highjacked by critics and used pejoritively. Is there a reason you feel strongly about using the word """"Straussian""""? I don't think being a Straussian is anything to be ashamed of, but I don't like to see the Wikipedia being used for POV pushing by people who misunderstand Strauss. Thank you for the civil reply.

Comments

I liked it.  Rare is an article which is not only well documented but also interesting.  

I'm a stickler for comma use, so I went ahead and fixed three small errant commas in the article.

As to content, I would raise only two points.  At note 64, you say something like this: """"There was an attempt to assassinate the king.""""  Rather than saying """"There was . . .,"""" I think a better phrasing would be to use the actor as the subject and an action verb.  That is, """"A group of landowners attempted to kill the king.""""  Is it known who was behind the attempt?  

Second, I see that some other people have commented about one-sentence paragraphs.  I wonder if a correction of that did not produce the paragraph at note 71.  that paragraph begins with the topic sentence saying that brewing was becoming popular in the area.  Then, the whole rest of the paragraph has to do with witch trials.  Were those things linked in some way?  Perhaps cut the first sentence free again and add a follow up line about the volumes of beer that were being brewed or something.

I hope these comments are not too pedantic.  I'm new to peer reviewing anything.  Also, I am totally in the dark about formatting for notes, so I've not even attempted to weigh in on those.""",0

Should the games listing come out of the main page and instead go to somewhere like RPG/RPG Listings?
Well, there are also listings in the subgenre articles, so I think we should merge them.  07:28 Jan 16, 2003 (UTC)

I think the more useful distinction is between Role-playing games and Role-playing generally. I'm taking the latter from this page and making a new page just for the more general case.

Also note that I use """"role-playing"""" as the generic term more commonly linked to psychological uses because it is so cited in Webster's New World College Dictionary. Moreover, I am adopting the """"role-playing game"""" usage (hyphen between role and playing) in order to follow that convention and because it makes sense grammatically (hyphenate compound adjectives modifying a noun). 

However I am thinking that """"role-play game"""" follows common usage better than """"role-playing game."""" But I'm not going to redirect the page now, anyway (Dec. 26, 2001)  

No one I know of (and I know lots of gamers) says """"role-play game"""".  It's always """"role-playing game"""", and I am sure that's the most common usage.   

Not to sound like a nerd or anything, but White Wolf is not, strictly speaking, a role-playing game. They are a publisher. Their role-playing game universe, World of Darkness, encompasses between 5 and 12 or so (depending on how you count them) role-playing games... OK. I'm really not that much of a nerd... OK.

Isn't Battletech more a table-top war game and not an RPG? I have never played it, but isn't there Mechwarrior, which is an RPG based on Battletech's world?  07:24 Jan 16, 2003 (UTC)

Battletech was purely wargame, then Mechwarrior was made to turn it into an RPG, however they are basically the same thing, Mechwarrior is like AD&Ds; Player Handbook and BattleTech rules are simply the rules for combat, battletech being more complex than AD&D.; Battletech is notable from other RPGs in that correctly played one's character is as mortal as all the enemies one fights, so usually you die. Its basically a wargame where the units have stats which change over the course of a campaign, and most people generally have the commander of their forces represent themselves, thus, an RPG and a wargame. Also its common for the GM or DM to be replaced by a classical referee and then the players, instead of playing as a team, go to war with each other. 

Battletech was a miniatures game, based on Japanese anime, in the """"mech""""  genre. Later a set of rules was developed that allowed one to play a mech pilot in an ongoing campaign. Battletech was published FASA, which is now out of business. Along with Battletech FASA also published games such as """"Behind Enemy Lines"""" (World War Two skirmish game), """"Shadowrun"""" (cyberpunk/'magic returns' roleplaying), and """"Earthdawn"""" (fantasy roleplaying). At present both Battletech and Earthdawn have found new publishers.

For a list of RPGs I recommend trying the Yahoo and Google directories You will find listings for literally hundreds of games. Have fun.

Finally, when I have it composed I will be uploading an essay on roleplaying games, and why they really aren't games at all. At least not in the traditional sense of a game as something with victory conditions and competition among the participants.

Hope this finds you all well. 15:14 Feb 9, 2003 (UTC)

 What is a """"scalar force""""?  

At the start of the current article there appears a list of pointers to other article, and the last item on the list says """"For the scalar force that appears in polar coordinates, see the article on polar coordinates"""". I checked the article on polar coordinates, and the word """"scalar"""" doesn't appear there. So, what exactly IS a """"scalar force""""? And why does the article point to another article for explanation of something that isn't even mentioned in the other article? Surely something is amiss.63.24.61.29  
Of course, you are correct in pointing out the absurdity of a """"scalar"""" force. This pointer should be removed altogether, but I have only edited it to remove the absurdity. The history of this article shows that this pointer was a concession to a long, drawn out battle that apparently exhausted all parties and led to this compromise.   
Any single dimension is a scalar- a scalar is simply a single number. There's nothing absurd about a scalar force any more than there is about a scalar acceleration. What is 9.81 m/s^2?- () WolfKeeper (Talk) 

I don't understand the """"corrected"""" version. The acceleration component that it refers to (i.e., the one that arises in stationary polar coordinates) is explicitly described and given the name """"centrifugal force"""" in countless reputable references, including:

(1) """"An Introduction to the Coriolis Force"""" By Henry M. Stommel, Dennis W. Moore, 1989 Columbia University Press. 
(2) """"Methods of Applied Mathematics"""" By Francis B. Hildebrand, 1992, Dover, p 156.
(3) """"Statistical Mechanics"""" By Donald Allan McQuarrie, 2000, University Science Books. 
(4) """"Essential Mathematical Methods for Physicists"""" By Hans-Jurgen Weber, George Brown Arfken, Academic Press, 2004, p 843.

 This has been pointed out previously, with the relevant quotations. I don't think there can be any dispute of the fact that this particular acceleration term is indeed among the terms that are called (in contemporary reputable sources) centrifugal force. Needless to say, it's entirely a matter of convention as to what names we give certain terms appearing in certain equations, but since Wikipedia articles are supposed to reflect verifiable facts from reputable sources, I can't see any justification for excluding this particular fact from the article. I think any discussion of the contemporary (let alone the historical) concept of centrifugal force is incomplete if it doesn't include this. 

There are also other concepts that go under the name """"centrifugal force"""" but that are not yet mentioned in this article. And conversely, there are lots of things discussed at length in this article that are only indirectly related to the concept of centrifugal force. I understand that much of this material has been added as part of a tutorial on general physics being given to placate some of the editors here, but ultimately I think it detracts from the readibility and relevance of the article. 

Overall I think the present article has evolved into a lengthy set of notes that various people have made as they clarified in their own minds certain aspects and implications of the centrifugal force, as they responded to challenges from certain other editors. Sort of learning on the job. That's a commendable exercise, but it doesn't make for a very coherent article, and frankly, the",0

Second, if the first does not apply, does it feature a major appearance by characters or settings strongly associated with the Final Fantasy series. Kingdom Hearts does, since about half of the major NPCs are from the series. Ehrgeiz does, since it has several playable characters (one of whom is actually on the cover of the game) from Final Fantasy VII. Secret of Evermore might, as well: I was under the impression that the appearances were more along the lines of brief cameos that integral roles, but if someone wants to argue otherwise, I'm listening.

Strong oppose .  The Serer Niominka are part of the Serer ethnic group.  Failure to recognise that would be a failure to recognise the diversity of the Serer group.  Even Becker commented on this diversity (See: Charles Becker. """"Vestiges historiques, trémoins matériels du passé clans les pays sereer"""". Dakar. 1993).  Not only are they group together with the Serers because they speak Serer, but they also have Serer culture etc. Every one even in the Senegambia refer to them as Serers and they see themselves as Serers.  Is just like saying the Ndut and Safi etc who speak Cangin languages are not Serers ethnically.  Sometimes people use Niominka as a shorthand, but I don't think we should deny people their Serer heritage.  Indeed, by referring to them as Serer-Niominkaa, we recognise both their Serer heritage and Niominka.  To call them just Niominka would be denying them their Serer heritage.  Many scholar refer to them as Serer-Niominka just as Serer-Njegeme, Serer-Siin, etc.  (See:   Dennis Charles Galvan. The state must be our master of fire, p38. Also: Leonardo Alfonso Villalón. Islamic society and state power in Senegal, p51; African economic history, volume 25, University of WisconsinMadison. African Studies Program, p32).  Most of the confusion regarding who should be called Serer is to do with the various cangin languages and Serer Sine.  The Serer people however are not confused and they see themselves as Serer ethnically even if they speak a different dialect or language to other Serers.  It is normally outsiders who tend to divide the Serer into compartments rather than just letting them be.  The Serer Associations of Dakar as well as the Serer community have been trying for years to fight this division of the Serer group by outsiders.  No one is subsuming anyone.  Serer-Niominka culture is recognised and celebrated within the Serer group just like Serer-Sine, Serer-Njegheme etc.  The reason for this is, because it is Serer culture period.

I marvel a bit that even my attempt to DISCUSS this issue gets censored repeatedly (by anonymous censors who do nothing on Wikipedia save delete THIS). Must even the DISCUSSION of this issue be censored and not allowed to exist? I'm a longtime reader and fan of Dan Savage, but he IS a distinctive columnist with a distinctive style. Must even a DISCUSSION of that uniqueness  which goes unmentioned in the article, due to phony NPOV considerations  be rigorously censored?

"Using Low Speed Limits & Cameras to Discourage Motoring 

I've been told that you're a leading proponent of the theory that the safety of cyclists and pedestrians is best improved by getting people to use these modes of transport instead of their cars.  Like you, I think it's often necessary to force the issue by making driving so unpleasant, frustrating, delay-ridden and unsatisfying that motorists give up and use better forms of transport (no matter how inconvenient they may be).  I agree with you that extremely low speed limits rigidly enforced by camera is the best way of doing this, and I also agree with you that the rise in deaths caused in the short term by these measures is nothing compared to the millions of lives which will be saved when private motoring has been restricted to the most important people (like you and me).  Of course we have to lie and pretend that the measures are there for short-term safety, but it's necessary to do so, and society will thank us in the end.

  Recently, I have removed (07-2014) Hamas from the list of terrorist organization on the article War on Terror.

The election victory of Hamas in the Gaza-strip allowed the party to rule the power on to the Palestinian people since 2006. Also the Hamas party is doing charity works for the poor, disabled and children. I can not believe that this party still has not been removed of the list of terrorist organization by the United States, European Union and Japan. This party deserve a chance to rule together with Fatah to maintain a Palestinian unity.

There are two problems  with Jza84's sumarizing language and overall conception of this page.  First, in terms of dividing territory geographically, there is no """"merely"""" involved.  Territorial division is a serious and often deadly issue.  Moreover, Brits tend to be more tolerant of the mixing of cultural, ethnicity, and legal issues because they live without a written constitution.  Jsa84 could learn from this attitude.  The second revealing problem with Jsa84's language is that Jsa84 underscores geographically as if this modifier is going to clarify anything. The discpline of geography is made up of several branches and, until you specify whether you mean political geography or other kinds of geography, you haven't resolved anythingyou haven't even begun.  This page is one of the more inconsisent pages available, and not just internally, but in relation to other pages that deal with consitutional and cultural issues in the United Kingdom.  I recommend that Jza84 begin to accept the help of others in the Wikipedia community.  Otherwise, these pages will continue to look confused.  Dylan Hunt

 i forgot 

I forgot to tell you many things in my other, long, discussion subject, here is one of them (because you say directly and indirectly that you have no interest in the historical truth, but in favouring the roman empire because you are a fan of it, as you explain here on your page):

Besides, never ever no way no how in the whole history of the roman empire, the romans (esspecially in the catastrofal financial situation in Rome, when the empire was on the virge of colaps because of it's lack of money!) never waged costly and long battles against other nations in order to force those nations to accept huge gold tribute from Rome, so those nations can """"built and strenghten their fortresses for future attacks"""", like you, history falsifiers, argumented the roman tribute payed to the Dacians in 88 AD as well as in 102 AD, when the common sense men asked you """"how come those wars were won by romans if at the end of them the romand had to pay anual tribute to the dacians?"""".

And you started to buulshit that that money was """"for building and strenghten the fortresses/defences"""", going so far in your bullshit that for the following war (AD 105) you, as roman empire fan and as such automatically history falsifier), as reason for this roman attack/war on Dacia, you mentioned again the invading romans as """"the good guys""""😉, and the dacians as """"the bad, cut trouths, robbers, dacians""""😉, which were """"justfull punished by the romans"""" in this """"punitive"""" war against the dacians IN DACIA, because """"the dacians used the money received from the romans after the last war and used ut for.. building and strenghten the fortresses/defences""""(!), so for exactly what they were suppose to use it, according to your own afirmations!! Duuh! 

So the roman empire did not invade other countries to demand """"protection money"""" (tribute) from them to not invade them again(tipical italian culture/maffia), but they invaded the world TO PAY anual tribute to those countries??

I do not know what medication do you use, but you obviously forgot to take it for a long time.

Well, you are a roman or a roman fan, so it's understanable that you have no clue what so ever what are you talking about. You are focussing on 1 thing only: Praising the cut throuts romans and presenting them as """"the best and most civilised people in the World"""", which invaded, masacred, robbed and enslaved countless nations and civilisations, because... """"they were the good guys, period""""😉.

Also enjoying throwing women and children (plus everybody actually) alive to wilde beasts to eat them alive in the arena (Damnatio Ad Bestias), was another obvious sign of the """"roman civilisation""""😉 which you admire so much, and which thus also says much about you, who and what you are.

Nor have I made a legal threat.  First, I am not among those three people who participated in that visit to the BLM protest.  I have never known any of these people.  I would not be the offended party, in any case.  I've never even lived in Minnesota, or been there in over 30 years or so.

I think WP rules allow us to express concern that the cite of a vague assertion that somebody """"heard the N-word"""" is problematic from a WP:BLP standpoint.

Aminz, moving the article specifically will not really clear the misconception. People who don't want to believe the figures are the same will always do that. But in Wikipedia, we can use the actual name for Isa as the Islamic figure that exists in his own importance. It doesn't mean that if a figure also exists in Christianity too that this figure becomes only an article based on the perspective. Isa in his own self can have an article just like Yeahua and Jesu that do exist. It's not simply one perspective of that same person, it's a different belief and the entire reason why the articles is here in the first place. It isn't simply a fact that because a figure exists in two religions that we can not have the real name of the figure being used as the name.

FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION
Dr Philip Opas (defence lawyer for Ryan, recently deceased) made it public knowledge that he did not, and would never endorse Richards book The Hanged Man, because the facts surrounding Ryan life and case had been manipulated. The book was published 35 years after Ryan's hanging - only after almost every person directly involved in the Ryan case had died, making allegations by Richards impossible to retort or confirm as fact. Richards tried but failed  to bluff Opas to support the book by signing it inside the front cover, """"To Philip and Stella from Mike Richards"""". But it's no surprise that the highly intelligence and most experienced Opas was not easily fooled by anyone. The book became a toilet item.
It's ironic that User:Purrum promotes and contributes to the Ryan article from two books, which not only contradict each other, but have also been exposed to contain lies.

 Second time of asking: do you know which player is being wrongly attributed by Bluemoon with the goal that James claims in his book Tommy Booth scored in the Anglo-Scottish cup game against Sheffield United? Can you also give me the page reference so that I can include it in a footnote?  I would also like a page reference for the Honved UCWC cup tie team line-up so I can include that in the footnote I've already written which you need to validate against James and let me know that you agree with it. I got a little ahead of myself in writing that particular footnote. I claim in it that James has Book playing in the game with Booth taking no part in the match. I happen to know that to be true because I saw City play every home game that season. That obviously doesn't help me with the away fixture at Honved but I definitely do remember him being out during one of his main seasons during the period I was a regular in the Kippax due to his having an operation on his knee to fix his cruciate ligament. Booth, Doyle and Oakes were almost regular fixtures in the team at that time, playing every game, so his absence from that mighty midfield triumvirate (and Heslop taking over the CH role) is something that I do still remember 45 years later, although until this issue came up to jog my memory I would not have been able to pin it down to the autumn of 1970. I'm surprised I even recall it after so long a period, but Google is your friend once you know what you are looking for, so I have now found a few articles out there that prove he could not possibly have played in that game. But that's all by-the-by; the footnote isn't about my own uncitable knowledge and fond memories. It addresses what Bluemoon states versus what James states in the book, and I have no idea what James states until you tell me. But if it is not in line with what I have already written then we have a big problem! Finally, to round things out, could you also send me a page reference for """"Der Bomber""""'s appearance in the Barnet game and I'll add that to his footnote in the same manner as I included your page reference for the Coventry City match (which I was also at) in Paul Power's footnote.

 Vandalizing 

At first I wasn't even aware that the order of the first three bouts on the mobile version of the website was different from the official version. I found out through him sending me an image of the official website. Since it was only an image, I checked the website just in case and was shocked to find out that that was indeed the order that they had on there. I did not and still do not have any proof that the mobile version of the website is """"outdated"""" as he stated. When I made the edits (prior to my knowledge of mobile being different from the official website) I chose to not change or add a reference because When I clicked on the already present website reference, it automatically took me to the mobile version, being that I was using my mobile device to make the edits. Due to prior research of the fighters involved in the first three bouts and common knowledge of the sport, all common sense and logic led to me believing (like I always did) that the order of the bouts on the mobile version was the correct one. As soon as I found out the mobile version and official version were different I re-edited the page to rearrange the bouts to the most logical order and changed the prior reference from the official site to the mobile. I was never aware that you guys didn't accept mobile versions of websites with more logical information as references until I read his complaint and your response.

"""" A bright line exists on edit warring, known as the three-revert rule (3RR). If an administrator has not acted already by this point, then action is very likely, especially if a report is made to the noticeboard. Policy forbids edit warring generally, and editors may be blocked if they edit war, with or without breaching 3RR. """"

I commend  for taking the actions he did.  The subsequent complaints Malke made, and his promise to cease his activity in order to get unblocked a few days later, are a matter of record on his user talk page.  Malke has since deleted the notifications, but they are viewable in his talk page history, and make interesting reading.

After Malke's block on August 19, 2009, I decided I needed to take a step back.  For the past ten days I have busied myself with other Wikipedia subjects.  I now return to this page.  I suggest we talk a bit about what happened, and I also suggest we take a look at what happened here this month, edit by edit.  It continues to seem clear to me that Malke was editing with obsession towards an agenda; his obsession got him in hot water with the admins.  Soon, Wikipedia policy is going to change, as many here know.  I'd welcome some reasonable discussion, and renewed work on the article.   

On closer examination of the history pages of the main article, it appears some of Malke's biased edits, through sheer volume, are still in effect.  I propose going through every edit of his, see exactly what changes of his have survived, and put back all relevant, sourced material.  Once that is effected, we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements.   

Having just returned to WP from an extended absence, I am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article, but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave WP more than a year ago. I recognize Malke's concerns. Material that is added back should strictly follow WP:BLP, ie., it should be directly relevant to Rove, not defamatory, and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources.   

Malke's concerns were one thing, his methods another.  Admins blocked him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule, but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material, and as the admins noted (to quote directly from Malke's talk page history, since he has since, for obvious reasons, deleted all reference to his blocking):

"""=== Bringing Edits to the masses (The Latin Rascals) ===

Hall and Oates out of touch; the edit dub had to be one of the most
memorable tracks for me in the history of editing. The Latin
Rascals became superstars with rockstar status. Listening to their
edits; you never knew what was coming next; they were frenzied but
on time. They were the first editors I remember playing with speed
(slowing down voices/phrases) They seemed to be on everything from
radio(ktu,kiss fm and hot 103.5 and hot 97.1) club music to hip hop
(king kut; Run Dmc King of Rock) and pop. They produced many hits in
the club/freestyle genre; appeared on movie soundtracks
(disorderlies) and appeared on television (the music show second
generation with andy panda and tony moran) produced a hip hop
platinum album (the fat boys) became succesful artists (bach to the
future; arabian nights) and world reknowned remixers. Out of the
pack (omar santana; carlos berrios, chep nunez, etc...) these guys
did it all. Albert Cabrera appeared on Ktu solo and what he
accomplished with a pause button was nothing short of amazing. I'm
still in shock at some of the things I heard done; this coupled with
the ability to do megamix medleys seperated him from the bunch; when
he paired with tony moran things got crazier. The remixes they did
with Little Louie Vega on vinyl (information society's running)and
the exclusive mixes (called hotmixes specially made for bill lee the
on air personality who requested they do special versions)were
incredible; two of them appeared on cutting remixes; dont' break my
heart and let me be the one. The radio only version of Jody watley's 
I'm lookin for a new love was insane!!!!!!!! So was the
cover girls show me and Noel's silent morning; these were radio only
remixes that never appeared on vinyl. I only heard Little Louie Vega
play them when he rocked hearthrob nightclub in nyc. If anyone has
access to them; I wish they'd post them up. These were definitley
staples in the art of multi editing and remixing. Eternal props
and much respect to The ultimate duo The Latin Rascals!!!!!!

I would recommend trying to limit your list to some
(likely) forgotten names in strictly the tape cutting trade,
or very prominently focussing on cutting up masters,
because the ones we know, like Cabrera, Berrios etc.
well, everyone can mention those...

Also, not all DJ's do impressive cutting.
If we're gonna mention each and every person
who has cut tape once, where do you draw the line?

Remarkable is that this 12 inch does not even credit them
anywhere, even though everybody knew, if only from their
peculiar dark 'sound', that Cabrera and Moran had touched it ;-)

Yes, but it might have been 1982 when Jellybean and Baker
tried out their first versions of 'Confusion' in the Funhouse club.
It usually took quite some time back then, for the world to hear
those tracks, or have them available as a release on vinyl.

Also interesting;
http://www.record-producers.com/roster/arthurbaker/biography.html

And I found:

[Jonathan Scott] """"In early 1984 I spoke to a member of New Orders sound crew
who mentioned a Confusion mix he 'had heard' that was basically an unreleased
Arthur Baker/Jellybean project mixing the basic elements of 'Confusion'
with parts of Freeze's 'IOU'. [...] I have been told that it surfaced
on a dub-plate (acetate) and was produced in a New York cutting house.""""

Reportedly, a mix of Confusion/IOU used to be played a lot at the Hacienda around 1984/85.

 http://www.mediaradar.org/mcdowell_kanin_credible.php links to an interview where McDowell admits to research into false rape reporting.  theforensicexaminer/Gross (used in article) cites the 1281 sample size number, and the link to how it is possible that some people misquoted 556 has been quoted as: 

The discrepancy in the size of the dataset can perhaps be explained by the wording in the CfMR article which implies that the 556 case dataset was an earlier study “cited” in McDowell’s 1985 paper, not the main subject of it. The difference in percentages between CfMR and mediaRADAR might be explained by CfMR citing McDowell correctly, while the 60% figure was obtained by someone just adding the 80 “false” cases to the 256 “inconclusive” ones and calling them all false. (http://www.feministcritics.org/blog/2009/04/20/claims-about-mcdowells-research-into-false-rape-allegations-are-not-credible-noh/)

 but the mcdowell section (here) didn't include a 60% claim.  It included the 45% claim. No reason to throw that out.  We should use the 1281 sample size. One reason that the study is often attributed to McDowell and Hibler is their 1987 book """"Practical aspects of rape investigations"""" http://books.google.ca/books?id=iV398oA5DdsC&pg;=PA181&lpg;=PA181&dq;=charles+mcDowell+practical+rape+investigation&source;=bl&ots;=P2Yt9i_z6y&sig;=R-ezsxhzIw3KPJYGnybSBJp2BX8&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=0_59T8SGI6Xd0QGRoPTHDg&ved;=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q;=charles%20mcDowell%20practical%20rape%20investigation&f;=false , and so likely published there.

"""Hi again. I do have this in the back of my mind and am aware of it. Apologies for being slow getting back to you.

It's a really hot day here in the UK after a series of hot days and my mind is not working clearly. I'm not sure what you're asking me. I think you're talking about Category:Beverage companies, and how breweries end up there. At some point that has been organised thus - Category:Beverage companies - Category:Alcoholic beverage companies - Category:Beer and breweries by region - Category:Beer and breweries in North America - Category:Beer and breweries in the United States - Category:Beer and breweries in Alabama. The brewing companies are contained within each """"Beer and breweries in Foo"""" cat. What you are proposing is the same thing as already exists, but separating the companies from the brands at a low level, and then having two cats - one of products and one of companies, running side by side up the tree. What I am saying is that is not needed and is unwanted. We'd like to keep the beer and the brewery together in the same multi-purpose cat. Beer and brewery are often related. Bass and Heneiken, for example, refer both to product and company. Where possible we deal with both product and company in the same article, though with notable examples we will split off the product into its own standalone article. 

Would you ping me when you respond, otherwise this might drift a bit. '''''' *YES!

"Cited sources? I looked in Category:Abnormal psychology and in Abnormal psychology and I didn't find any cited sources to support the inclusion of non-psychological articles in psychological categories. Category:Sexual and gender identity disorders is a sub-category of Category:Abnormal psychology. Gender identity disorder, which is listed in DSM-IV Codes, is in Category:Sexual and gender identity disorders. Related subjects and articles such as Transsexualism are not directly psychological subjects defined in DSM-IV Codes and hence don't appear to belong in either of these categories. If they did, they would belong in Category:Sexual and gender identity disorders, not Category:Abnormal psychology. The fact that a suspected sockpuppet of a permanently banned user was inserting the parent category in an apparent effort to insult and demean transgendered people doesn't make it a valid category for the articles to be in.",0

no content
an infobox can be  contentthe one on Keenan Davis  just needs rewriting in sentences. Please check WP:CSD for the actual criteria for speedy deletion. '''''' ( talk ) 

Generally, a biography should have content about biographical information on the subject (not just player stats). Statistical information, such as date and place of birth, information on historical significance (N/A here), pictures, and information on accomplishments is usually accepted as the content of a biography on Wikipedia. What we have here are some of Keenan Davis' NFL stats. The page should be written from his childhood/early years up to how he got into the NFL and what he did to get there (such as being in minor leagues), like any normal biography.

I understand your point on how infoboxes can be content, but in this situation what we have is a biography with just NFL stats. How can we consider that a biography?   

 A1/A3 tag for NBEO 

Hey, MrScorch, I just wanted to let you know that I declined your CSD nomination of the NBEO article.  You nominated it under A1 (no context) and A3 (no content), but the article isn't really that close to meeting either criterion; it's pretty clear what the subject of the article is, and it isn't actually empty.  If there are other reasons to delete it (there certainly may be), feel free to bring it up at AfD, but just having little content or no references isn't enough for CSD on its own. Thanks,  ⚇♔

"""::I believe there was a lengthy study done by the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation & Enforcement Pittsburgh office and the State of Pennsylvania in the early 1980s which determined (1) extinguishing the fires was probably not technically feasible, and (2) it would cost more to try and extinguish the fires than it would to purchase all properties in the town. Hence, Congressional relocation funding. So, the bottom line was money, and questionnable technical feasibility. The study is probably cited in the hearings for the funding legislation.
Keep in mind there are hundreds of miles of old underground mines under Centralia, too deep to strip mine from the surface, too many surface openings to plug, and the smoke and steam are lethal to humans and other living things. That's why people needed to be relocated: living in Centralia is hazardous to one's health. And when coal is burned, it loses 90% of its mass, so the ground above often subsides, opening new pathways for air to enter and fuel the fires.

 Freedom House comment in introduction 

I deleted a paragraph in the opening of the article; this was promptly re-inserted by another user.  The text is: """"Israel is a democratic republic with universal suffrage that operates under the parliamentary system. According to the international data reported by Freedom House, the degree of political rights and civil liberties in Israel makes it the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, consisting of a multi-party system and separation of powers"""" 

I believe I had good reasons for removing it:

(1) The very same text - verbatim - is repeated later in the article.  This is reason enough for deleting it from the opening.  Without citing chapter and verse of Wikipedia policies, obviously a well-written article cannot be repetitious.

(2) A conclusionary statement about civil liberties is ipso facto a value-judgment.    This is obviously going to be endlessly controversial whatever the country involved (see point (3) below).  It is churlish to place this kind of comment right up there in the introduction.  Common/significant views about political rights are much better dealt with (less tersely) under the Government heading. I myself do not seek to contest the view that Israel has a high degree of political freedom, so if you disagree with me, deal with the point I make about the reasonableness of reporting this sort of evaluation in the opening of *any* country article.

(3) Where the very same text appears in the Government section, it is immediately followed by a contrary viewpoint, which the author(s) of this section thought was equally significant: """"Conversely, the research group Minorities at Risk (MAR) characterizes Israel's system ...""""  This gives a nice indication of how controversial the Freedom House opinion is, or at least appears to be to other Wikipedians.  Indeed, I'd like to ask: does the person who reverted my deletion of the same text from the opening think that its stupid to allign the Freedom House statement with opposing viewpoints (maybe because the Freedom House statement is 'incontrovertible', or whatever), and if so why did he/she not remove the 'Minorities at Risk' comment from the Government section?

(4) The text is a quote from Freedom House, which is widely regarded as a US-lead, organisation operating to promote a particular policy programme.  The Times (hardly a fringe opinion) has described it as an """"outpost of American soft power"""": .  Unlike, say, the Human Development Index there is hardly any global consensus support for its reports.  Giving its views such decisive prominence - treating them as the bottom-line on the country's political status by placing them in the opening - seems unencyclopaedic.  

I suggest that unless consensus forms against me on this, I should remove the offending text from the introduction.  There's presumably no objection to the same text being under the Government section (as it currently is - as well).

Hello again. I'll respond to your note on my page a little here. First of all, I don't have a negative attitude towards the Romans, or the Greeks, or the Macedonians or anyone from Western antiquity. I'm really not that interested in Classical history beyond basic knowledge. What I AM interested in is keeping the wiki clean.

As far as having the article locked, it was put into what's called """"semi-protected"""" mode. In semi-protect, anonymous users cannot edit the article, and neither can newly  registered accounts. This is to prevent vandalism from occuring - people putting in nonsense or swearing for no reason, that kind of thing. By the time you read this note you should have had your account long enough that you can now edit the article. I will warn you that trying to put in uncited material or stuff that goes against the manual of style will probably be deleted again, although not by me.

Another suggestion would be to use the Apollo discussion page to air your concerns. Two of the five wikiprojects that have staked a claim on Apollo ( Wikiproject Classical Greece and Rome and  Wikiproject Mythology) are known for their accuracy and attention to detail. They can probably give you reasons for why the content looks like it does. 

One last note, if you want to leave me a message again, please to it here at this link to my talk page, rather than on my main user page. That way I get a note telling me you want to talk to me, rather than having to wait until I stumble across your posting. Either way, good luck.   talk """,0

Rossville, Staten Island - As part of an ongoing edit war,  has been arbitrarily reverting all additions of external links to the article as """"removal of spam"""". These external links, which had been part of the article since it's creation, are not spam, and were unjustifiably removed. One external link links to an article about the 150th anniversary of the oldest Roman Catholic Church in Staten Island, which is located in the neighborhood. Another external link links to a website created by a former resident who describes what it was like to grow up in the area before it was built up. It seems to me that this Philip Gronowski character, who has recently been resoundingly rejected in his candidacy for RfA, is not making legitimate revisions based on the rules of Wikipedia, but on his own interpretation of what is """"spam"""".

 User:Slrubenstein and other's falsifying and defamatory edits 

User:Slrubenstein who obviously does not like the word 'theory' (and didn't like the article from the beginning) has repeatedly edited the article adding falsifying terms like 'proposal' instead. Nowhere does Carotta """"propose"""" or """"claim"""" anything. Already in the Introit of his book Jesus was Caesar it is clearly stated that: To anticipate the result: Jesus proves to be Divus Iulius, the deified Caesar, passed down in tradition. The word he uses for this finding is 'disclosure'. So it is wrong to write he 'proposes' or 'claims'. 'Theory' was therefore the best compromise, but the respectable User:Slrubenstein and other distorters don't like that. It should be noted here that User:Slrubenstein has not bothered to explain and discuss on this talk page why he egomaniacally altered the status quo and threatened other users who maintained 'theory' with blockage which was later carried out. He has not answered the questions raised by someone above concerning his problems with this article either.

Now this excellent User:Slrubenstein has even gone so far as to """"protect"""" (i.e. block, prevent editing) the article altogether. I think everyone involved in this or just reading here should seriously ask themselves whether User:Slrubenstein who canvassed against the article, voted for stong delete and most emphatically defamed the author as """"crackpot"""" (this might be actionable), is the right person to further work on this article let alone be an admin in control of it.

User:Rbreen who also voted for strong delete and who has already been convicted of lying and destorting scholarly statements above, now thinks he is the appropriate authority to judge on Carotta's undeniable and never before denied classical scholarship. He obviously knows better than reputable scholars like Piñero, Canfora, Kavoukopoulos, Simon and others. Here's your typical Wikipedia editor.

Nothing new can be said of User:Iblardi either. He helps wherever he can to degrade the article and defame its subject.

User:EALacey is not even capable (or is he not willing?) to correctly translate the word """"Wissenschaftsparodie"""" into English. The correct translation is """"science parody"""". Another typical WP editor, it seems.

 Racism, Noble savage, Orientalism and Araby 

No flaming intended, I just want balance to come to this subject.  Explain to the world, how putting Greek homosexuals on a pedestal, is in any way, shape, or form, NPOV.  You know, Greek scholars on the matter paint homosexuality in a different hue than outsiders who romanticize the subject (e.g. Oliver Stone's Alexander (film)).  They see homosexuality as existing all over the world and in all eras.  To portray Ancient Greece as some buggery paradise is prejudiced and ignorant, just as if they were all claimed to be paragons of heterosexual machismo.  Gay Greeks are your Wandering Jew.  Whenever I watched Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess, homosexuality did not come to mind.  Perhaps the slash fiction community would rather Hercules and Xena """"get nasty"""" with their traveling companions, but that's beside the point.  You can't always have it to your fantasy or ideal, simply by calling other people """"narrow"""".  So far, you've succeeded in stereotyping Greeks as rabid homosexuals.

Iranian Villagers
Halstead et al. reported that some Iranian villagers with very little animal product intake (dairy once a week, meat once a month) had normal B12 levels. None had megaloblastic anemia. Their average B12 level was 411 pg/ml which was quite high considering their diet. The authors speculated this could be because their diets, which were very low in protein, allowed for B12-producing bacteria to ascend into the ileum where the B12 could be absorbed. They also speculated that because they lived among their farm animals and their living areas were littered with feces, they picked up enough B12 through contamination.

Halstead et al.'s 1960 report was in contrast to Wokes et al.'s 1955 report  in which numerous British vegans were found to have neurological symptoms of B12 deficiency.

Conclusion
B12 production by bacteria in the small intestine is possible. Some vegans can ward of overt vitamin B12 deficiency, and even mild B12 deficiency by remaining cautious. Now people like mihaiam may choose to doubt all these scientific findings hinging on their favourite anti-vegan blogs.

Page protection
Keilana, can you please explain why you have semi protected the page Huma Abedin ? You have stated vandalism which is clearly not the case! Please see Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard where the matter is being dealt with ! Can you explain your actions ? I understand I am new here but it was one of the first pieces of information i have cont. to wikipedia there has been no decision made, I can not understand your actions !

Having now had the rules for vandalism explained to me I believe you have abused your power as my contib. clearly dosent fit any of the terms ? I ask you to reaccess your actions.

The decision was made at Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Huma_Abedin_.28edit.7Ctalk.7Chistory.7Clinks.7Cwatch.7Clogs.29. Its common practice during an edit dispute such as this for an uninvolved admin such as Keilana to semi-protect the page to reduce the intensity of the dispute. In any case, from the tone of Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard#Gossip_magazines_as_reliable_sources it seems that semi-protection was the right call to stablize the article while discussion continued there and on the talk page of the reliability of sources. MBisanz talk

You clearly statd vandalism as your reason for the protection i would not you made no contibution to the talk page and sort no concensus from you action! I will also ask you to explain you relastionship to those who have sort to remove the information ? I would also like to know why you have changed you id ? thanks I will be adding this information to the talk page and any were else i find help ! I also note you did not add the fact the matter was being listed to protection page to the talk page of the article ?

I did not create the name of the page in regards to gossip mag tittle had you read the info you would understand Hillary Clinton was interviewed for the article.

To request unprotection, please go here Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Current_requests_for_unprotection. To ask for Keilana to be examined(?) I'd wait for her to respond here, and if your not satisfied, there is the Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard. I leave the personal inquiries for Keilana to answer is she desires to. MBisanz talk

Hello, Sorry I couldn't attend to your concerns earlier. I semi-protected the page (here) because of the reasons stated there. As it is election season in the United States, articles about prominent political figures such as Mrs. Clinton are particularly vulnerable, hence the protection. There was a dispute over the reliability of sources, and I protected the article to cool the dispute. Protection isn't an endorsement of the current version, I have no ulterior motive. (see here for protection policy/information). In general, an admin doesn't need consensus to protect a page when a dispute is ongoing. Is there a problem with my administrative actions?

Let me give this an example, let's say I'm talking about the 2004 US Presidential Election. Suppose I say this:

""""Only 60 million Americans (out of the 300 million Americans total) voted to re-elect President Bush."""" 
This sentence is technically true, and it is technically factual, but it is also misleading and unfair to President Bush. The sentence implies that while only 60 million supported the President, the other 240 million didn't vote for him. This is technically true, but it's totally unfair and misleading. The fact is, most American's don't vote, and the majority of those 300 million were """"undecided"""", not """"opposed to Bush"""". And as we know, Bush was, in fact, the most popular candidate. So to say """"60 million out of 300 million total supported Bush"""" is simply very, very misleading even if every word of it happens to be true.

The Catholic Church example is a good one, but I'd like to point out several key distinctions. First off, its an old enough institution that a separate History of the Catholic Church article exists, which makes the main article in reality The current status of the Catholic Church or maybe A summary of the Catholic Church, this is not the case for the NRA. We have a single article that is trying to address its entire history along with its cumulative activities, so the Lead needs to reflect that. Second, with all of the various controversy involving the Church, none of it mentioned until the last paragraph. Third, it's Lead 1st sentence is fairly generic simply stating that its the largest organization of its type and how many members it has. I would be fine with something similar, """"The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is a nonprofit organization with 5 million members."""" But quite frankly, that seems too simplistic and not terribly descriptive or informative.

Furthermore, if we take a clinical look at what they do today, its a variety of things that range from publishing and multi-media (television, internet, etc.) to training and certification programs to historical preservation along with lobbying and other political activities. So to describe the organization in the 1st sentence using any kind of phrase that includes """"gun control"""", gun rights"""", or the like is just bad writing and purposely ignoring significant parts of the article, hence my original suggestion for the Lead first sentence. At the very least, I don't see why the first sentence can't just be generically descriptive. Maybe something like, """"The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is a nonprofit organization that primarily serves as an advocate for firearm related issues and activities. Originally founded in 1871 in New York by journal editor William Conant Church and General George Wood Wingate to promote marksmanship within the United States military, the organization has gone through several transformations as well as expanded its purpose and goals. In the 21st century, it has become one of the largest and most influential lobbyist groups in Washington D.C. as well as a large, multi-title magazine publisher, an advocate for hunters, outdoorsmen, and the , and one of the largest firearm training and certification program operators in the U.S.""""

That said, I will try to find other examples, but given this list (:Category:501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations) it does not seem difficult to find an article with a Lead first sentence like I've described. By the way, I'm advocating for a rewrite of the ENTIRE WP:Lead, not just the 1st sentence. I think that Policy is fairly clear, but IMO to adhere to it properly in this case Editor's need, to quote the WP:Lead page, a specialized understanding of the subject in order to write it in a NPOV manner that a non-specialist will understand.

Third World Comments
I also fail to see how his comments about third world countries belongs in the controversy / criticism section.

He's basically saying that third world countries are...well...third world countries.

Bin Laden / Ahmadinejad Comments
Gibson isn't accusing Democrats of modeling themselves after Osama or Ahmadinejad, which I admit would be controversial if he did.  He did just the opposite, in fact.  He seems to be accusing the duo of modeling their pronouncements after standard talking points of the Democrats.  This is a far cry from comparing Bush to Hitler, for instance.  

France / Hip Hop Culture and the School Shoooting
His comment saying no one would care if France were nuked might be considered controversial, although it's proven not to be his """"nappy-headed ho's"""" type career damaging statement.  Every section in the criticism section has created NO RIPPLE outside of the highly partisan sections of the blogosphere, aside form his comments on the school shooting (which was mentioned in a small circulation hip-hop magazine).

For the sake of comparission, I'd like to cite Chris Matthew's June 26th edition of """"Hardball"""", where Ann Coulter was a guest.  After saying he was """"deeply concerned"""" about people who think like Coulter, many of the members in the live audience cheered.  This caused Matthews to exclaim, """"My God, is this 'Deliverance'?"""".  I personally criticize Matthews for comparing people to inbred hillbilly homosexual rapists (and not giving them a chance to defend themselves).  Yet, I'm not putting my criticism on Matthew's page.

"""NatureBoyMD, Macman202, Tony Fox:

I have considered your disrespectful comments towards my Scholarly Review article and, now that the Christmas holidays are over, I am obliged to let my anger with your remarks be known. I shall start with you, NatureBoyMD. NatureBoyMD, you reffered to my article as dubious. This is ironic, considering that you as a person are quite dubious. When I read your opinions of my article, I scoff at you. Your argument is so ill founded that I cannot even take you seriously. It is quite obvious to me, and all the memembers of the SGAS, that your dissatisfaction with the page citations is not an indication of the article's """"dubiousness"""", but rather an indication of your ignorance of Goosebumps and literature in general. If you think people need a citation as to where the camera in Say Cheese and Die came from,, then you need to understand what is common knowledge and not. For instance, If i were to write that the sky is blue, of that the earth is round, or that MACman202 has no idea what he is talking about, most reasonably intelligent humans would agree with such widely known facts. Such is the same for Goosebumps and R.L. Stine. When I say that the plots """"are masterfully formulated"""" or imply that R.L. Stine is brilliant, the majority of people recognize that the two statements are widely known facts. 
As for you MACman202, any notion what so ever that you have the ability to recognize fine literature """"has to be one of the most laughable things I have ever heard"""" (NatureBoy, I included quotations in the last quote so that you, always one to want a citation for the obvious, will know that I quote this MACman202 himself). MacMan, it is quite bold of you to assume that there is so scholar behind my article. Perhaps you should stick to editing the Simon and Garfunkel page on wikipedia. I am sure you are quite familiar with it already.
Tony Fox, you and NatureBoyMD seem to be on the  same page as far as your inability to recognize common knowledge is concerned. To me it seems that you label anything you do not agree with as a """"peacock term."""" I find this most repulsive, as I, like most free thinking, intelligent people believe that speech should not be censored because someone does not agree with it. You can take comfort in the fact that you are not the only one guilty of this unjust censorhip. MACman202 and NatureBoy are just as guilty. Each of you should devote, as I have, your mind to understanding the beauty and brilliance of Goosebumps. When you feel that you have researched Goosebumps as much as I have (it is very unlikely that you ever will) then you may suggest alterations to my scholarly review. Until then, your comments are not welcome, and they certainly will not be tolerated any longer. 

Sincerely,

Sources on Medieval Croatia

Early medieval Croatian history fits the concluding line to the old jingle: the more you study the less you know. When I was and undergraduate studying Balkan history I thought I knew quite a bit about Croatia; but as I study more about Croatia, one by one """"facts"""" that I knew before turn out to be dubious, based on questionable sources or no sources at all. Most of the existing literature in western languages on medieval Croatia is extremely poor; and frequently it is marred by nationalistic bias.

Much of the information about medieval Croatian history comes from later (seveneenth- and eigteenth-century) narrative histories. These were written by enthusiastic people but ciontain a mixture of fact and legend; and since many of the documents they based their works on are now lost, it is extremely difficult to judge wheter their information came from reliable source or not.

Pages 33-34

One of Ladislaus's most significant achievements was the occupation of Hungary's southern neighbour, Croatia. ... The small kngdom, born in the tenth century, streched from the Kapela mountains to the Adriatic sea, its center being Biograd, located on the coast.

...
King Demetrius Zvonimir, who, not being a member of the ruling dynasty, obtained his throne throug election, asked Pope Gregory VII fo a crown in 1075, and, in return, declared his kingdom as a papal fief. After his death, Ladislaus laid claim on his realm by the right of his sister, Zvonimir's widow, and had no difficulty in taking possession of Croatia in 1091. He bestowed the new kingdom, together with royal title, on his nephew, Almos, son of Geza I ...

I further entertained myself reading yet another great discoveries of contemporary Croatian historians (soc.culture.yugoslavia) ....

The exclusive revelation is the result of """"scientific"""" research by Croatian historian Dragutin Pavlicevic, and found its place in history books. The Split newspaper """"Feral Tribune"""" reveals that Pavlicevic authored a chapter entitled """"Croatian Indians"""", included in the second grade history textbook, shedding new light on the history of native Americans and their ties with Croats, """"one of the oldest nations in Europe"""". He affirms that in North Carolina """"a tribe has been living for more than 4 centuries differing in the color of skin, hair and facial features from other tribes"""". According to the same historian this is not surprising because the members of these tribe """"have the noble blood of ancient Croats from Dubrovnik in their veins"""". Mr. Pavlicevic also speaks about the Mateo Indians, named after their ancestor Mateo - a Croat named Mate. """"In his work, Dragutin Pavlicevic stresses that he estimates that presently there are more than 2 million Croatian descendants throughout the United States"""", states the Split newspaper.

I have no problem with including the fact that Israel says the reason was contact with Hamas leaders below (which is hardly considered a very strong or sensational accusation, as they are the governing party there and considering the fact that Norwegian conservative politicians also have meetings with Hamas, and having contact with Hamas is hardly considered any more controversial than meeting their Israeli counterparts in the Israeli government).",0

The point the article makes is that different names are used: popular language calls this thing """"singular they"""", linguists call it """"plural anaphoric they"""". Sure, it's the same thing.
I'm not sure where you get the idea of indeterminate number """"shifting"""" to indeterminate gender. I, for one, agree with you, there is no such """"shift"""" in English (unless it lies a long way back in the history of English pronouns, but that's another, and long, story). The article, however, at least as I read it, also agrees with us. It asserts there are two types of indeterminacy, either or both of which can be marked by use of they. Where does it say one """"shifts"""" into the other?
Regarding your sentences, you have constructed them such that all have indeterminate gender. The first, however, could clearly apply to 0, 1 or >=2 people, so also has indeterminate number (or is plural, per Givón). The key thing is that all your sentences involve universal quantification over the domain (or restriction) of a variable: for all people or students x in X, your sentences assert something that is true for person or student x. Because there is a plurality of x in X, Givón and other liguists, call usage of they, in constructions such as yours, plural. Because each x is a singular person (in the first sentence a hypothetical person), ordinary people, like you and me, call this usage """"singular"""". In fact, though, these constructions are distributive (one assertion to each of many people), which is why grammatical number cannot be well defined. There is no specific reference, so singularity or plurality can't be derived from a referent in the usual way. The constructions have either generic reference, or no reference at all.

I assure you I am not playing games.  This is quite an important point.
SlimVirgin did raise the issue of tautology and I addressed it by saying that we need to write about welfare in the context of non-human animals.  You seem to think this is an impossible task, since we are human.  I reject this idea.  We can write about many non-human things.  Obviously, our ability to know about the welfare of a dog (for example) is limited by the fact that we are not dogs, but that does not change what animal welfare is.

I need to go over this again, but this is what I can see so far. Please check. Thanks.    
 Introduction says that the Pola was assigned to the 3rd Division before the Matapan action, but the narrative says she was in both the 1st Squadron and 1st Division. 
 It is not clear if 1st Squadron and 1st Division mean the same thing. If Division is a sub-group of Squadron, please clarify.",0

On 28 May 2011, actress-director Sondra Locke turned 67 according to Yahoo! News ,  ABC News , the Associated Press , Leigh Valley News , and The Boston Globe ; this directly correlates to her being born on 28 May 1944. Her birthdate is 28 May 1944 according to MSN movies , the Internet Movie Database
,  and the Notable Names Database
. Many
printed publications erroneously list her birth year as 1947. The
Middle Tennessee State University yearbook from 1963 has a photo of
her  appearing in a production of Arthur Miller's play, The
Crucible. If born in 1947, this would make Locke a 16-year-old
university student, an unlikely scenario. Locke's age is stated as 45 in this 1989 People magazine article , correlating to a 1944 birth year. As of August 2011, Locke is 67 years old according to public records ,
correlating to her being born in 1944.

I don't understand how this could be disputed. It is quite obvious that Ms. Locke lied about her age when she began her Hollywood career in order to get roles.",0

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

We are students at the Jerusalem College of Technolog, Israel, currently studying Management and Marketing Technology.
In the curriculum, we are participating in a course called  """"Technological Forecasting"""".
In this course we are researching the technology and marketability of Stereoscopic Vision (three-dimensional TV without glasses).
We would greatly appreciate if you could help us by answering several questions on the subject (we saw your contributionto the relevant article):

• Do you think that Stereoscopic Vision technology is viable and worthwhile?
• What are the chances of this technology penetrating today's market, and the chances for future success?
• Who are the competitors? Are there substitutes technologies?
• What are the advantages and disadvantages of existing Stereoscopic Vision technology?
• With which market segments will this technology make the greatest inroads?
And finally, we would appreciate if you can share with us some of your ideas and general thoughts about the future of this technology.

We greatly appreciate and thank you in advance for your time and any assistance you may offer.

 Okay, then let's turn it around: I don't know what your professional background is, but let's say you are contributing to an article fully in line with your profession, and you'll literally see dozens of users engaging in edit wars reverting not only your own edits, but also well-informed edits made by others - all this going on for a couple of days. That's exactly when you guys (i.e. ADMINS) you should have a careful look: I'm not the problem, at most I am a symptom of it, because I was trying to be part of the solution by pointing out the aforementioned issues. The quality fluctations of that particular article have been severe, it seems that there's a huge mess of people editing without any relevant background knowledge whatsoever. This has nothing to do with elitism: wikipedia (or any encyclopedia) cannot just thrive through people without any domain expertise. And other users have been highlighting these issues, too - but were ignored because their criticism also affected wp admins. Really, you cannot expect high quality articles if the people """"writing"""" it are merely acting like robots adding refs to articles that they don't understand, let alone briefings that they never watched in the first place. Regarding the term jackass, just look at the Jackass article, it describes fairly well what's going on there, just because there's huge public interest in the event, which attracts countless people who don't even bother getting informed in the first place, and rather prefer edit warring instead. BTW: I am not trying to talk common-sense to you, like I said: I don't care about this account and/or IP being blocked or not - not even if it should not be temporary. The real issue here is lack of quality, and lack of wp admins enforcing rules to ensure a higher degree of quality. And this problem will persist regardless of this particular account/IP/person being blocked, inactive or deleted. This seems to be a severe case of Dunning-Kruger's.

Hi Pterantula,

The encyclopedia entry requires attributions and references.  For example, the studies of the """"effects of Landmark Education"""" is from the third-party surveys.  If, instead, the encyclopedia entry were to have customer testimonials instead, they could be struck on grounds they are not verifiable.  (We've gone around in circles on that many times as well.)

As well, the 20 points of critique are all against Landmark Education (with rebuttals in many cases).

As for litigation, I am aware of five outbound cases:

Pre-emptive warning

1) Traci Hukill """"The Est of Friends"""" (1998, pre-emptive warning, no suit filed)

Actual litigation, outbound

 Elle Magazine   (1998, LE achieved no result)
 Cynthia Kisser  (1997, LE won retraction)
 Margaret Singer (1997, LE won retraction)
 Rick Ross       (2005, LE cancelled suit for product disparagement)

There are about three inbound cases (against LE):
 Stefanie Ney (court ruled in LE's favor)
 Been versus Weed (2002; 10 claims, 3 settled, 7 dropped;  LE was a cross-defendent)
 Tracy Neff (1997, sexual harrassment, settled out of court;  LE lacked a """"sexual harrassment"""" policy at the time and got pulled in on this)

Does anyone have anything more than this from LE's inception in 1991 (14 years ago)?  Litigation regarding """"est"""" should be on the """"est"""" page.   For a company with $70 million in revenue and over 800,000 customers of the Landmark Forum, this is a tiny amount of litigation.

WP:SYNTH
An RfC was just closed at Talk:Climate change denial#RfC: Must the word 'denial; occur in every citation for climate change denial?, and it is interesting to read the closing statement there, in that it reflects community consensus about some aspects of when to use or not use sources about a topic without violating WP:SYNTH.   
The concluding statement says the term """"climate change denial"""" may be used if the source """"implicitly states they fall into the general group.""""  It has no relevance to anything discussed here.  It certainly is not a loophole for """"synthesis"""".    
I don't think anyone is looking for """"loopholes"""". I'm not arguing for any kind of slavish devotion to that discussion here, just for editors to take a look, and to think about it with an open mind. I think that the closing statement makes some good points about common sense.   
There is nothing """"slavish"""" about the devotion.  If most sources say the motivation of the terrorism is secular, then we cannot say it is religious and call it Christian terrorism.    
 I was saying that we don't have to follow that other page slavishly. And that other page isn't talking about situations where most sources say something is unrelated. If you are interested in what it does say, then you can read it. If you don't want to read it, then don't. Everything here does not have to be a WP:Battleground.   
As I have noted before, unless reliable sources attribute some religious motivation or aim,  I would not say Wikipedia should attribute such a motivation or aim.  If the sources ascribe motivation to irredentism, economic or other attribute and do not ascribe a religious aim, then it does not belong here.  Note the discussion just closed at Climate*.*  where the result was basically """"no consensus at all"""".  Cheers.   
Not sure what you mean, but I linked to a discussion where the closer said there was a consensus. I'm not going beyond what the closing statement said there.   
The issue has come up in articles about terrorism and about ideology.  Different writers may use different terms to mean the same thing or the same terms to mean different things.  Generally, in peer-reviewed literature, the terms used are defined and we can say that one author who defines """"Christian terrorism"""" as terrorism motivated by Christian belief and another who uses the term """"Christian religious terrorism"""" with the same definition are referring to the same thing.  However, another author who uses the expression """"Christian terrorism"""" and defines it as ethnic terrorism where religion is part of ethnic identity means the same thing as authors writing about """"religious communal terrorism"""" carried out by Christians, or """"nationalist terrorism"""" between different religious groups.
Can you provide a single source that should be included based on the opinion expresses in the climate change denial RfC?
  
I'm so tempted to just reply """"yes"""". And I really would rather not get into a wall-of-text over things that we will soon be discussing at the mediation. But let me try to clarify why I linked to that discussion. This isn't about definitions of """"Christian terrorism"""" in my view. It's about what the closing statement there said, that just because a particular word is not used explicitly in a source, does not mean that the source does not apply to a page – editors can use common sense to examine the context within the source. Thinking back to the discussions about the Lebanon section (now made somewhat moot by the Schbley source, that examines in detail the Maronite Monks), there was discussion of whether it was SYNTH to consider a United Nations source, because it used the word """"genocide"""" instead of the word """"terrorism"""". I'm pointing out that there is now some precedent for using common sense in evaluating the language of such sources, in context. If you or another editor sees common sense in that instance as indicating that genocide is not terrorism, that's still a discussion we can have. So that's why I provided that link. I'm not about to rewrite the Lebanon section on t",0

 Review comments 

I took a brief look at the article after the recent peer review was closed. Here are a few comments for improvement - these are things that woulkd be a problem if this were up for WP:FAC or even WP:GAN.
The lead is five paragraphs but WP:LEAD says the limit is four paragraphs.
The lead does not summarize the article well - my rule of thumb is to include every section in the lead somehow, but the Munic Crisis, his marriage and children, his children with other women, and his death are not in the lead
WP:MOSQUOTE says that all direct quotations need to have a reference (even if they are in the lead)
To be free, most historic images need to have been published before 1923 or their source must be given so clearly that it can be determined that the image was published without a copyright notice or its copyright has expired. Images like File:CAL CAM2 DH4 Nov 4 1926.jpg were clearly taken after 1923, and lack the information as to sources that allow any sort of determination of copyright status.
Or how is this image not still under copyright - published in 1927 at the earliest File:CharlesLindbergh-RaymondOrteig.jpg?
The relevant policy for WP:FAIRUSE images is WP:NFCC, every point of which has to be met for an image to be used under fair use guidelines. I often ask myself three questions about fair use images: 1) Does the image increase the reader's understanding of the article's subject? 2) Is the image discussed in the article itself? 3) Is the image used merely for decorative purposes? NFCC requires minimal use - all of which leads to me to ask: How do two separate Fair Use covers of """"WE"""" increase the reader's understanding / meet minimal use?
MOS says not to sandwich text between images - this does so in several places.
I read Mosely's biography of Lindbergh years ago (it is cited here) and read WE as a kid. This seems to me to under play Lindbergh's isolationism and at least the perception of him as an appeaser / possible Nazi sympathizer. 
The language in the lead at least seems needlessly convoluted - look at what the page Lindbergh says """"Charles Lindbergh (1902–1974), first pilot to fly solo non-stop across the Atlantic"""" then look at how it described here """"As a 25-year-old U.S. Air Mail pilot Lindbergh emerged suddenly from virtual obscurity to instantaneous world fame as the result of his Orteig Prize-winning solo non-stop flight on May 20–21, 1927, made from Roosevelt Field[N 1] located in Garden City on New York's Long Island to Le Bourget Field in Paris, France, a distance of nearly 3,600 statute miles (5,800 km), in the single-seat, single-engine purpose built Ryan monoplane Spirit of St. Louis."""" The facts are all there, but it is so comvoluted that if you don't already know what Lindy did, you might miss it.
What makes """"Charleslindberg.com a reliable source? See WP:RS
In short, before you worry too much about the language, there is a lot of other stuff to fix here.
Hope this helps,   ><>°° """,0

"The origins are very obscure. The Bedouin Arabs, who were the original followers of Mohammed and responsible for the first islamic conquests in Syria, Palestine, and Persia, were a nomadic people who lived in tents. In the cities they conquered they began by converting old buildings, and christian churches became mosques; in damascus a pagan temple transformed into a Christian church was incorporated into the Great Mosque (706-15). The earliest and one of the most beautiful of islamic buildings is the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem, built as a sanctuary (not as a mosque)[there's some debate about this] on a circular plan (685-705, but much altered later, especially in 1561 when the exterior was cased in Persian tiles and the interior lined with marble). The first minarets were converted church towers in Syria, and that built a Kairouan, Tunisia (724-7), is modelled on such a tower. True to their nomadic origins the Umayyad rulers preferred desert residences to town palaces. Several survive in ruins - Qasr al-Hair (728-9); Mshatta near Amman, Jodania; and Qasr at-Tuba in the Wadi Ghadorf near Amman. In plan these groups of buildings were derived from Roman frontier stations. Both religious and secular buildings of the period incorporate elements which were to become distinguishing features of islamic architecture: The horseshoe arch, tunnel vaults of stone and brick, rich surface decoration in carved stone, mosaic, and painting. During the Umayyad period the mosque took its permanent architectural for, dictated by liturgical needs - minarets from which the faithful could be called to prayer; a wide courtyard with a central fountain for ablutions, with surrounding colonnades to give protection from the sun; a large praying chamber, marked externally by a dome (as a sign of importance) and internally by the mihrab or niche indicating the direction of Mecca, towards which the faithful must turn in prayer. The last survivor of the Umayyad dynasty became the founder of the Emirates at Cordoba in Spain, where the early style of Islamic architecture was brought to perfection in the Great Mosque (786-990)
Under the Abassids who surplanted the Umayyads in 750, Persian influence began to dominate the Islamic world. The main achievements in architecture were the foundation of the new capital at Baghdad, built on a circular plan (762-7, now largely destroyed) and, slightly later, the smaller city of Raqqa, Syria of which little survives except its richly decorated gateways. It was at this period that Islamic architecture began to depart radically from Hellenistic and Byzantine conventions. An elaborate court etiquette, derived from persia and contrary to Bedouin ideas of informality, was introduced, and palaces were designed for the new caliphs on more formal and grandiose lines, e.g. the palaces of Ukhaidir and Samarra in Iraq. These large buildings were run up very quickly; stone was abandoned in favour of brick and there was much use of decorative stucco. The main C9 achievements were the great mosque of Kairouan, Tunisia (836); the mosque of Bu Fatata, Susa, Tunisia (850-1); the Great Mosque of Samarra, Iraq with its strange ziggurat-like minaret (c850) and the very well preserved mosque of Inb Tulun, Cairo (876-7). Buidling materials were usually rough but dressed with intricate geometrical or floral surface decorations in painted stucco, mosaic, glazed tiles, or shallow relief carving. Local traditions influenced the decorative styles in various regions (See Indian pakistan, persian and turkish architecture)
''In the original nucleus of the Islamic world the most notable later mosques are those a Tabriz, Persia (1204), Cairo (Mosque of Sultan Barquq 1384) and Isfahan Persia (1585). Most of the earlier religious builings, including the Masjid-el-aksa and the dome of the rock in jerusalem, were also altered and more richly decorated in these centuries. In southern spain a local style of great oppulence was developed; it's principle monuments are the Giralda tower, Seville (1159) and the Alhambra (1309-54)",0

"Cleveland Street Scandal 

James Pope Hennessy, Queen Mary's official biographer, spoke to many people then still living who actually knew Prince Eddy (see his posthumously published book of interviews), so his statement that Eddy's private life was 'dissipated' must be taken as gospel (as too must his statements with regard to Eddy's intellectual slowness). Hennessy knew what he was writing about, and indeed, died at the hands of rough trade. His close friend James Lees Milne, who was bisexual, and with whom one can presume he would have shared the more unpublishable results of his findings, wrote the first frank biography of Lord Esher, the grey eminence of the Edwardian royal court who was pederastic, and who kept a folder of letters from parties about the scandal. Both Lees Milne, and later Theo Aronson used it for their respective books which touched on the scandal. To suggest that Andrew Cook's thinly argued book settles the case with regard to PAV's possible involvement in Cleveland Street is utterly ridiculous.",0

I removed the fluff/nonsense about """"resonance"""", which has little, if anything, to do with how a soundboard works. Resonance is a specific aspect of sound mechanics which has to do with the frequency of maximum amplitude of a system. What happens with a soundboard is actually much simpler: it has a larger surface area than a string alone, and therefore can move a larger volume of air, hence a higher volume of sound. +ILike2BeAnonymous 

The term """"amplify"""" is definitely true when it comes to the soundboard.

 I need your help 

       Dear Luna Santin,

       First of all, I want to say, you are the only administrator that has shown any respect to me, and for that, I come to ask that you help me overcome this outstanding prejudice directed toward myself by the many pompous admins that continue to block me and harass me unfairly. While I have made mistakes in the past, I assure you I am committed to only contributing to wikipedia. 

       I am angry because the last time I was blocked was completely unfair. I was issued a warning because I posted """"I love you"""" on two users talk pages. While they took this as a joke, I took it as my try to make peace with these people that i felt wronged me in the past. I'm sorry if """"love"""" is considered a joke around here. While I tried explaining that I should not be warned for something like this, they decided they did not want to hear the radical idea that they were exerting their overzealous attitude towards me, instead of being responsible admins. As a result, they decided to keep me quiet by blocking me for a week. While on this ban, they decided to accuse me of having a sockpuppet, because this user claimed he was me in an edit. Everybody knows a sockpuppet would not admit he is one in his own edit. Since they foolishly thought this user was a sockpuppet of mine, they extended the block to 1 month, to further keep me quiet. I, obviously finding this as unfair, decided to request an unblock, because an accusation that has no actual evidence is no reason to extend the block. Since this was a way of me speaking out, they rejected and even protected my page, which is why you may not be able to respond on my page until the user decides to unprotect it. 

       I hope you can get back to me, and really help me out. I feel mistreated, and, as a person that cannot stand unjust people and a person that fights for what is right, I want to fight this, so that this whole mishap is solved. If you can help in any way, that would be appreciated. I know that I might even get blocked again for writing this letter, since it involves me speaking out against the almighty admins, even though what I am speaking out against, is wrong.

We go nowhere like that
Comment. I don't feel ready to back the one or the other position here. For the time being I feel a bit closer to Dhan's position but from a different point of view. I just want to point out two things:
According to a Greek historian, Paparregopoulos, some hellenized Phanariotes families, like Ghikas' family, had lost their Greek identity in the 19th century. This fact seems to justify the use of """"predominantly"""", since in indicates one thing: In the 19th century not 100% of the Phanariotes families had a Greek indentity. Maybe they were 99% but even this 1% justifies the use of """"predominantly"""". I can live without this word (I can also live with the word!), but, if Dhan wants to add it, I cannot prevent him (at least, according to my logic).
If we accept that 99% and not 100% of the Phanariotes were Greeks, this does not affect at all the traits of the Greek War of Independence, as Miskin has said. Ok! Not 100% but maybe 99% of Phanariotes played a role in this war? What does it change? Nothing! A big fuss for nothing! 
I'd like Dahn to further substantiate and back with additional sources his arguments. What about some Googlebooking?! Everybody could do that, in order to reinforce one's arguments.

Observation duly noted, with this response...

It isn't just that """"elements"""" of French's affidavit is based on other people's stories,  the fact is he swore that """"all facts and statements contained in this affidavit are true and correct.""""  And that included second and third-hand gossip about Kerry's military record in Vietnam.  This guy is  an officer of the court; I find it hard to believe he didn't know what he was doing. 

As to his claim about Kerry lying on MTP in 1971 about his unit being engaged in """"atrocities,"""" let's consider what Kerry actually said:

 SEN. KERRY: There are all kinds of atrocities, and I would have to say that, yes, yes, I committed the same kind of atrocities as thousands of other soldiers have committed in that  I took part in shootings in free fire zones. I conducted harassment and interdiction fire. I used 50 calibre machine guns, which we were granted and ordered to use, which were our only weapon against people. I took part in search and destroy missions, in the burning of villages.  All of this is contrary to the laws of warfare, all of this is contrary to the Geneva Conventions and all of this is ordered as a matter of written established policy by the government of the United States from the top down. And I believe that the men who designed these, the men who designed the free fire zone, the men who ordered us, the men who signed off the air raid strike areas, I think these men, by the letter of the law, the same letter of the law that tried Lieutenant Calley, are war criminals.   

Those sorts of things took place, and were documented as taking place - and in fact were mostly SOP. Even SBVT member William Garlow found  Hoffmann's tactics distasteful . French is not being truthful, or is at best being disingenuous if he simply doesn't think these things should be referred to as """"atrocities,"""" a term that Kerry was quite clear in qualifying. 

And compare French's description of Kerry's """"mutiny"""" remark with what he actually said:

 The fact of the matter is that the members of Coastal Division 11 and Coastal Division 13 when I was in Vietnam were fighting the policy very, very hard, to the point that many of the members were refusing to carry out orders on some of their missions; to the point where the crews started to in fact mutiny, say, """"I would not go back on the rivers again"""" ... 

A little different from claiming that he said """"crews at An Thoi were involved in amutiny,"""" isn't it?  We know for a fact that there was plenty of disgruntlement over SEALORDS policies (read Brinkley, for instance), and officers did refuse to carry out some of Hoffmann's orders .  Is Al French prepared to say no crewmembers ever refused to go back up certain rivers or on particularly foolhardy missions?  We know for a fact the lack of air support was so bad that RF/PF forces  refused to go on patrols without helicopter support.   French is knocking down his own strawman.

""":In an interpreted language your source code is read in command by command by a software tool, which is called the Interpreter and executed.

What ? Command-by-command ? No interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays. Taw

 From Interpreted Language/Talk 
 
some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime

Could you elaborate ? Taw

Every time a perl script is run, Perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code. At least, this is the usual way of using perl, although it's not the only way. Zundark, 2001 Dec 15

You mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code ? Taw

 I believe it's compiled to bytecode, much like Java. As of perl 5.6 (version?), it's possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step. I think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well, but I'm not as sure about that. Indigo Perl (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don't necessarily have the Perl interpreter installed.  They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms.  Wesley

 Old Interpreted Language article 

An interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required.

It is often a mistake to refer to a language as either """"interpreted"""" or """"compiled"""", because
most languages can be implemented in either way, and some languages
(like Perl) are compiled at
runtime but behave as if they were interpreted.
Other languages, like Java, may be partially compiled into an
intermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled).
Some languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation.

An example of an interpreted language is JavaScript.

Is Java interpreted, or what? 

The Java programming language article says:

""""The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.""""

The Java language is compiled, always.  It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language.  It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine).  I think the Java language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better.  LDC

Yes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is IMHO incorrect; every language that has an """"eval"""" statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code. AxelBoldt

Way too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of """"compiling"""".
It is used in two distinct meanings, as in:
 compiled to machine code (or assembly)
 compiled to byte code/parse tree/some other internal representation

I think it's wrong to call languages that use the second way """"compiled"""". In such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use - no language uses line-by-line parsing nowadays, all """"compile"""" source to some form of internal representation.

Quote from FOLDOC:
     Compiler

     A program that converts another program
     from some {source language} (or {programming language}) to
     {machine language} (object code).  Some compilers output
     {assembly language} which is then converted to {machine
     language} by a separate {assembler}.

  Lebanon: Catholic Villagers attack and vandalize Baptist Church
Posted on 29 August, 2006

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” 

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” 

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” 

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” 

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” 

The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajaltoun had the",0

Disputes of content review
 Does M. Vickers use one sided only information, as it was reported by Alexikoua?
 Was there any usage of the """"Cham"""" term, before the 20th or 19th Century?
 Was the cham eviction specifically ordered by British liaison to EDES, Col. Chris Woodhouse?
 Where is the citation of  Τρίτου, Μιχαήλ. Τσάμηδες: Επίμαχο Πρόβλημα Ελλάδος και Ορθόδοξου Εκκλησίας Αλβανίας. Εκδοτικός Οίκος Κυρομάνος: Θεσσαλονίκη, 2003. In which he reports that the Muslim Chams of Thesprotia come from native Christian Greeks of which for different reasons and at different times converted to Islam.
 Why is Kollias an unreliable source whereas Vickers is one?
 Are the refs used to create the Map of Chameria WP:RS? And why are they self-contradicting?
 Is a definition and Synonyms of the Word Cham in Babiniotis dictionary enough to use as the definitive source of these statement:
The name """"Cham"""", together with that of the region, """"Chameria"""", is of uncertain origin. It may derive from the local Greek hydronym Thyamis (Θύαμις in Greek, Çam in Albanian) or from the ancient Thraco-Illyrian tribe of Sameis
 Why isn't this included in the article:
 Albanian Cham units also played an active part in the Holocaust in Greece. Mazower, Mark. Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941-44. Yale University Press, 1993, ISBN 0300089236.

"Britain's strategy of turning Germany eastwards to destroy USSR

Hey, I want to add in the view that Chamberlain's strategy was to turn Germany eastwards to destroy USSR. That view seems to be missing here. 

...And by this date, certain members of the Milner Group and of the British Conservative government had reached the fantastic idea that they could kill two birds with one stone by setting Germany and Russia against one another in Eastern Europe.

In this way they felt that the two enemies would stalemate one another, or that Germany would become satisfied with the oil of Rumania and the wheat of the Ukraine.

It never occurred to anyone in a responsible position that Germany and Russia might make common cause, even temporarily, against the West.  Even less did it occur to them that Russia might beat Germany and thus open all Central Europe to Bolshevism.

This idea of bringing Germany into a collision with Russia was not to be found, so far as the evidence shows, among any members of the inner circle of the Milner Group.

Rather it was to be found among the personal associates of Neville Chamberlain, including several members of the second circle of the Milner Group.  The two policies followed parallel courses until March 1939.  After that date the Milner Group’s disintegration became very evident, and part of it took the form of the movement of several persons (like Hoare and Simon) from the second circle of the Milner Group to the inner circle of the new group rotating around Chamberlain...''

They intervene in any Balkan history and politics related  article, pushing Greek POV, launch edit wars,  and repeated reverts of  vandalized by them versions, permanent deletions, block users, merges and redirects to deletetion of undesired new articles. Their main target is to distort all articles lelated to  ISLAM, TURKEY, REBUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, BULGARIA, ALBANIA (CHAMERIA), THEIR MINORITIES IN GREECE AND THEIR HISTORY.

Quicksilver, you can speculate about indígena, but until you find some other notable source which puts forward this proposed derivation, it should not be included.

Surely native spanish speakers themselves would not get confused between """"indígena"""" and references to the East Indies (""""las Indias Orientales"""").

The categorization is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Yes, members of the Church are often known as """"Mormons,"""" but that is the nickname that a lot of people call them by. The Church says that the official term for these members is """"members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.""""

Of course some people think that's rather long to say, so the church acknowledges that people will often call the members just """"Mormons."""" Nevertheless, that remains as only a nickname for the church and part of the official name of one of the books of scripture, The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, because of the prophet named Mormon who abridged the original writings. The only other official names with """"Mormon"""" in them are the book Mormon Doctrine and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. As for members themselves, reference to them as """"Mormons"""" remains only a nickname.

So you say that the official info box text is to leave it without nickname quotes. So what? Why shouldn't we ammend that official policy so that it makes room for that type of labeling? And so what if there is """"no need"""" (<- those are the """"you're saying it, not me; and not that I believe you"""" quotes right there) to change it? That doesn't mean there would be anything """"wrong"""" (as you'd probably say) with adding them, does it? They are not errant. They are not like adding an apostrophe to a word where none belongs, in an attempt to form a plural! They are good to show outsiders the difference between the official church name and the nickname. What's so """"sinister"""" about that? I say we change WP:Mormon's rule about it. Why not? Well, of course that would require a concensus, but why would people have to be so opposed to it?

What about the intro. of Donny Osmond? That uses quotation marks to set apart his nickname of """"Donny"""" from his real name, Donald Clark Osmond, in the form of """"Donald Clark 'Donny' Osmond."""" So there. Why can't the LDS church in info boxes be that same basic way (including be adjusted as WP:Mormon policy)?

"==Please read unblock request carefully

This why I ask whoever read my request to read it carefully , I will address your points in order of when your address them.

First, your said that you will work with the editor to help make the page notable, yet that is what I was asking for throughout the entire debate before I was blocked, for someone to help me make the page notable. I cannot help showing I was annoyed when everyone who posted on that debate was making negative comments and continued to push for it to be deleted. Seen as I was the person making ALL the editing, it is the responsibility for administrators to assist me making all pages in question notable. I had already said sorry for the choice of words I've made throughout the debate but again it is as if no-one has the desire to care whether a user is remorseful of his action so long as the debate can continue, with or without them. 

Second, if the only party that was trying to defend the case was blocked and prevent not only from actively defending the pages in question, but stopped from actually adding the references and making the page more notable, well I'm sorry but I was doing my best all things considering. Even before I was blocked from Wikipedia, I did add in more reference, I read some of the notability guild lines and did make some changes, however I am only one person and there is so much I could do before I can say, 'I done my fair share, can someone help me finish this?'. But clearly not. I really don't know Wikipedia as well as you and other administrators do, but considering I have made many pages and edited many more in the short time I have started using Wikipedia properly, I can say that I have made useful information for people to read about and get accurate accounts of this. My point with this is that even though I have made massive contributions on here, there are things I do not know, and how to get pages back on Wikipedia after they are deleted is one of them. So if you kindly give me details and links on how to do this would be most appreciated.

I still fail to see why it is disrupted behaviour to return pages back on Wikipedia the way I have, a page before on Ryan Shamrock (fighter) was speedily deleted and then returned back on here, but not by me, and up until just today, no-one has affected that. The user who is suggesting it has also recommended 10 other pages for deletion, however, the user clearly doesn't know the fighters he wants deleted, as 7 of them are/have competed in either a major MMA promotion or a second tier promotion. As he is doing such pointless acts, I still wonder why he's able to do this knowing he will get into trouble with other admins for the similar things I've done? Here is the link for this debate - Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ryan Shamrock (fighter).

I get what you do mean when you say that it isn't about Shark Fights or Ring of Combat when it comes to this debate now, but none the less it is still an issue not to be ignored. UCMMA/Cage Rage UK was deleted for the same reasons that those two promotions, as well as a few other promotions on WP:MMANOT, should be. I find it amazing how these promotions are actually accepted by certain admins and are allowed to remain on there whilst a promotion I've been helping with, that has a better laid out page than the others and was making the improvements the other users were screaming on about doing for it, yet it got deleted, whilst those others ones get treated like they are highly ranked promotions. UCMMA/Cage Rage UK has a weekly chat show on Sky Sports 4, whilst showing their delayed timed events on Sky Sports 3, I bet those other promotions don't even get TV time.

The head of Cage Rage UK never asked me to post those articles. I have always worked by myself to help them with their Wikipedia page, never even expecting a thank you because I like their product and want to help other find reliable sources on them, which as many knows, Wikipedia is the place for that. If you type in UCMMA in the Facebook search bar, find the one with a picture of the words 'Cage' on the top, 'Rage' in the middle, and 'UK.com' at the bottom, then like their page, then keep looking for any posts from Carl Gale, as I keep mentioning to look on Wikipedia for UCMMA/Cage Rage UK information, fights at certain events etc. Look as far back as the 1st September 2011, you will clearly see that not only was UCMMA not part of it, they were pretty much telling me that all their information can be found on their website and their Facebook account so there was no need to continue doing it. However, I kept working on the Wikipedia pages, making contributions whenever possible leading up until their UCMMA 24 - Hands of War event.

"Dear Macrakis: I was the one who gave that exact solution in the first place. The golden ratio naturally appears in the 5th roots of unity; if you plot the roots in the complex plane, they form the vertices of a pentagon. This then explains why you can express a lot of trigonometric angles pi*n/5 in terms of the golden ratio. For example, cos 18 = (b/4)sqrt[2] = 5^(1/4)/2 sqrt[φ].  When you solve a quintic equation, naturally the fifth roots of unity are involved, hence why the radical solution of the quintic x^5-5x+12 = 0 can be expressed in terms of the golden ratio.  I hope it is clearer now.",0

Endurance
Q: """"Thank you for the welcome and tips! I would like to move some of the stuff on the Endurance and the Expedition out of the Shackleton article, since their scope is really quite a bit larger than him - can I do this? Is there any special way? """"

A: Absolutely yes!  It's pretty easy....just pick a concise and appropriate name for a new article on the expedition and start to build new content there.  You get started by putting the new article title in the search box.  If it's available you'll get offered a link to start a new article with that name.

I suggest putting some comments on the discussion page of your new article describing what you are trying to accomplish (same thing goes for the Shackleton article).  That way, other editors won't misunderstand what's going on.   If the new article is going to be under construction for awhile, it's a good idea to put a """"stub"""" notice at the bottom of it so folks know that there is more to come.  You add a stub notice by putting this at the bottom of the page: {{stub}}

As the new article takes shape and adds breadth and depth that the parent article lacks, you may find you need to tinker with the parent article to ensure that there is the right amount of detail there...not too much and not too little.  

Lastly, you'll want to find out what other articles exist that should link to your new article and add links on them.  That requires a bit of searching and digging around but usually isn't a problem and helps integrate your article into the broader encyclopedia.

Good luck with your article!  If you need any help, don't hesitate to ask.

 Why do you keep deleting a link to the most informative site about Middle Bass Island??? 

Norman,

you have removed the link to the main Middle Bass Island web site several times. That means you don't even look at the contents of the items you remove, which is rather petty and incredibly arrogant.

The site started as a non-commercial site and contains a great deal of island history as well as many, many island pictures. It's one of the most popular sites in the Lake Erie Islands.

Please take a look at """"Site Map Page 1"""" and """"Site Map Page 2"""" before removing the link again. Saying that the hundreds of pages listed there have only commercial value is idiotic.

The site was started out of love for the Lake Erie Islands and Middle Bass Island and the fact that it now carries a number of ads for island businesses does not change the fact that it is mainly a site with island information not available anywhere else.

So what is your real rationale for deleting it again and again and again???

Hi Ronz,

Thanks for updating me on what a conflict of interest is. I know what it means. I have read somewhere on wikipedia that if it appears that a contributor is only writing about one subject, there is likely a conflict of interest. This is a fairly broad and unfair generalization. 

I happen to have noticed a hole where a wikipedia page ought to be, filled it, and now any subsequent activity related to this subject comes from pride for my work in this instance, specifically to make the best wikipedia page or pages I can. Isn't that the point? Doesn't wikipedia as whole benefit from this?

 Hi there! Thank you for your querie about the Humanistic teachings of Nichiren Buddhism. Let me start by saying that the title """"Humanistic Buddhism"""" is rather sematically weak: because there are no 2 types of Buddhism: one Humanistic and another non-Humanistic. I think we should alter the title into """"Buddhist Humanism"""". If you trace the word Humanism you'll find various views: Christian Humanism, secular Humanism...etc... and adding the term """"Buddhist Humanism"""" is appropriate. 

 Secondly, the term Humanistic Buddhism or Buddhist Humanism, whether in China or Japan or the USA, is based on the Buddha's teachings - in particular the teachings of the Lotus Sutra. (The article mentions this clearly). The Lotus Sutra - of course - is not a private property of a certain temple or nation (Chinese, Japanese etc...) Buddhism of the Lotus Sutra is a universal teaching for all Humanity.

Historically, it was TienTai of China who placed the Lotus Sutra as the highest of the Buddha's teachings. Later it was introduced to Japan and the Tendai Sect emerged upholding the Lotus teachings, which was the ground for Nichiren, who appeared in 1222, to declare his teachings based solely on the Lotus Sutra. Currently, a 12 millions Samgha Nichiren Buddhist group (the Soka Gakkai International) is actively working for: """"Spreading Buddhist Humanism in the Community"""" http://www.sgi.org/about-us/members-stories/spreading-buddhist-humanism-in-the-community.html

 Nichiren Buddhism focuses on the Lotus Sutra: “Buddhist humanism:  It is a philosophical perspective that reflects the core spirit of the Lotus Sutra”
Buddhist Humanism: http://www.daisakuikeda.org/main/philos/buddhist/buddh-05.html

 I think it is more accurate and more professional to refer to Buddhism as either Theravada or Mahayana. In China or Japan, you have Buddhist schools which are either Theravada or Mahayana. There is no such thing as """"Chinese"""" Buddhism and """"Japanese"""" Buddhism. Using the term Chinese or Japanese Buddhism is plainly wrong. For example Zen has branches and temples in both Japan & China. It remains Zen. No need here for confusing """"passport"""" added to Buddhism. Nichiren Buddhism is found all over the world but mostly parcticed in Japan, this does not make it Japanese, but correctly: a Mahayana school based on the Lotus Sutra. It is even not logical to speak about Humanism and Humanity and in the same time restrict Buddhism to artificial national descriptions of  Chinese and Japanese terms. 

 Wikipedia articles must be impartial and must bring various views. Humanistic values of Buddhism cannot be patented to this temple or that priest only. All respect worthy people working to spread Buddhist Humanism must be acknowledged. I am doing research to include the participation of various Mahayana schools in the teachings of Humanism of the Buddha teachings which are for all Humanity. Thank you for your input and let's cooperate to improve the article.   """,0

 What are you doing? 
You created a huge mess in the CFR article by deleting the paragraph that leads into the cite of the Kelleher case, which results in a horribly confusing non sequitur. (That's what was being discussed on the talk page.) Plus it sounds like you are unfamiliar with federal administrative law, in which the plain English manuals are often more important for day-to-day contact with federal agencies than the regulations or statutes (unless one is dealing directly with agency lawyers). Famous examples are the USPTO's MPEP, IRS's IRM, SSA's POMS, and the CMS Online Manual System.   

 Well then I suppose you can cite it, right? No? Can't find a reliable source for your opinions and weasel words:
 """"...must be carefully drafted in highly technical language...""""
 """"Unfortunately, the vast majority of employees of the federal government are not lawyers...""""

Edit that Sparked Controversy

There is no consensus for a reverted edit that I made in this article (hereafter the “reverted edit”).  Therefore, I have not changed this article unilaterally back to my previous version, because that would be against consensus.

This reverted edit was reverted by KillerChihuahua (KC) who not only disagreed with it, but also said (in her edit summary) that the edit was disruptive.  I disagree with KC that the edit should have been reverted, for reasons already explained above.  I also disagree with KC that this edit was disruptive, and I will now fully and carefully explain why, for the record. This edit that KC reverted was clearly not redundant to any previous edits made anywhere else at Wikipedia, and thus this edit was not made by me in bad faith as part of any disruptive “edit war”.

This discussion of RCOG’s position on “choice” started at the article on fetal pain, and I moved it here for valid reasons.  At the fetal pain article, KC wrote: """"Please provide a source that this government institution is 'pro-choice' - abortion is legal in the UK, and that the official govt. chartered college are to make that safe is NOT pro choice.""""   I therefore investigated and learned that RCOG is not a government institution, that most of their members live outside the UK, that its governing documents do not specifically limit its activities, that many of its members do not have medical degrees, et cetera.  So, I concluded that the best place to deal with all of this would be here at the article on the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  Here at the RCOG article, I added quite a bit of info,    in addition to RCOG’s abortion stance. When I was at the fetal pain article and decided to move to this RCOG article, I repeatedly said so in the fetal pain discussion.   I did not sneak over here to try to avoid objections at the fetal pain article.

KC has elsewhere cited five diffs that she says prove this controversial edit was virtually the same as several contested assertions I had made previously. Here are KC’s five diffs: (1) in the fetal pain article, (2) in the fetal pain article, (3) in this RCOG article, (4) in this RCOG article, and (5) in this RCOG article.

None of these five previous edits cited by KC is the same (or virtually the same) as the reverted edit that sparked this controversy.  Both KC’s diff (1) and diff (2) show where I inserted a cite to support another editor’s assertion that RCOG is a “pro-choice group”.  KC pointed out very clearly at the fetal pain article that she did not think RCOG was a “pro-choice group” even though she thought RCOG could have a “pro-choice position” on particular issues:

There is no uncertainty or ambiguity that KC argued RCOG may have a pro-choice",0

 Third sentence of the lead 

Hello, I was just perusing this article randomly and I have a suggestion for the third sentence of the lead paragraph. It reads """"Anatomical similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor through a long series of these divergent events, stretching back in a tree of life that has grown over the 3,500 million years of life on Earth."""" I have two comments on this sentence.

1) First, it seems to me that the purpose of the sentence is to lay out, at the highest level, the independent lines of evidence in support of evolution. As such, I think that DNA (or genetic) similarities is a fourth line of independent evidence of the same level of importance as the three lines already listed in the sentence. Certainly, those three lines of evidence are the ones Darwin primarily relied upon when he laid out the theory (actually, he more apologized for the fossil record than relied upon it as an independent source of supporting evidence), but I think the incorporation of genetic evidence into the theory of evolution is at least as important a source of independent evidence and should be included in this sentence.

2) Secondly, for both anatomical similarities and genetic similarities, it's not so much the similarities per se that are crucial, it's the pattern of those similarities. The article states later that it's the fact that these similarities can be classified into a hierarchy of nested groups that is key to their support of the theory of evolution. I understand the lead isn't supposed to go into all the detail that is laid out later in the article, but I still feel it's crucial to say something about how it's the nature of the similarities that's important.

I might suggest: """"A nested hierarchy of anatomical and genetic similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor through a long series of these divergent events, stretching back in a tree of life that has grown over the 3,500 million years of life on Earth."""" for that sentence.

"""== Literal text ==
I have changed """"According to the literal text of the constitution, the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen of Australia."""" to refer to Queen Victoria instead. I did this to make a point and that point is that the literal text of the Constitution cannot be taken as an unfailingly reliable guide to either practice or law.

Read the Constitution and you will find no mention of the Prime Minister, who is undeniably the head of government, even if one might imagine that this position is occupied by the Governor-General from a cursory reading of the Constitution. The Constitution declares that there shall be an Inter-State Commission, but the truth is that this body does not exist.

Please, if you refer to the literal text of the Constitution, either stick to the literal text and refrain from inserting material that does not belong - you will search in vain for the title """"Queen of Australia"""", for example - or qualify it by referring to documents and events such as the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 where the title """"Queen of Australia"""" was introduced.  23:44, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Skyring - It is interesting how your own comments can be used to demonstrate how you add your own point of view - """"I did this to make a point!"""". A point about """"literal"""" text is make by using the adjective """"literal"""". Your point belongs elsewhere.

Anyway, the literal text does not mention """"Queen Victoria"""" it mentions the """"Queen"""". It further states that the """"Name of the King or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the time being is to be substituted from time to time"""". This is what I has done. Maybe, there is a more accurate way of making this subtitution, but """"Queen Victoria""""! That's wrong, wrong, wrong!

Is it? Have you checked the original? I think that you will find that instead of checking, you jumped in with some more untruths. Please think instead of responding when I press your buttons.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I notice you haven't responded to this. Have you checked the original? This is in Parliament House, and is on public didplay.  00:04, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Yes I have checked: www.foundingdocs.gov.au

""""Not found The page you requested is not available at this address."""" I suggest you check the original. I have.  00:29, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Rather than just jump in and make changes after 15 seconds thought, go back have a think for serveral days before you start adding stuff like this!. It just wastes time. Also, when you say """"Please!"""", """"Read the constitution"""", you are showing contempt for others. 
 01:02, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

When someone makes an obvious mistake like saying the literal text of the Constitution refers to the Queen of Australia, then I am quite justified in asking that person to read it.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

If you refer to the """"literal text"""" of the Constitution you will have to concede that it contains no reference to a """"Queen of Australia,"""" and that is because the thought of Australia as a state separate from the British Empire would have been quite foreign to the men who wrote the Constitution.  01:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I explained the substitution logic above and applied it. Then skyring put in """"Queen Victoria"""" !!! So I reduced it to just just """"Queen"""" (ie no substiution.) I have no problem either way.  11:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Let's stick with the Queen, shall we? That's probably the best bet.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I thought the point about literal text had been made, but I see that it has not been appreciated. The Constitution does not state that the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen. If you want to quote the literal text of the Constition, then by all means do so, but don't go making stuff up that you think might or should or could be in there, when it clearly isn't.  23:49, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Nowhere in the literal text of the Constitution will you find the statement """"the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen"""". Nowhere. s2 states """"A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative"""". That is a clear statement of intention. I noted s101 previously, which states: """"There shall be an Inter-State Commission"""". There is not an Inter-State Commission, so clearly it is incorrect to say that the literal text of s2 means that the Governor-General is now the Queen's representative, given the example",0

 Problems in section Governance/subsection Law 

The following paragraph reads:

""""France does not recognize religious law, nor does it recognize religious beliefs or morality as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. As a consequence, France has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws (the latter being abolished in 1791). However, """"offenses against public decency"""" (contraires aux bonnes mœurs) or disturbing public order (trouble à l'ordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution. With such emphasis on public order, laws sentencing racism, sexism or antisemitism are also old and important. For instance, laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881.[93] Some consider however that hate speech laws in France are too broad or severe and damage freedom of speech.""""

This has to be removed, or at least re-written, because it is incorrect, and not supported by the source given. The fact that France does not recognize religious law is true, this can and should stay. The fact that is doesn't recognize 'morality' as a source of law is not. If so, why was adultery illegal until 1975?? Even worse, why were 'children born from adultery' discriminated in inheritance up until 2001(!), when France was forced to change its law by the European Court of Human Rights ?? In regard to sexism, which is addressed here - France was one of the last Western countries to recognize the rights of women - vote for women only in 1944, women could not work without the consent of husband until 1965, leniency for 'crimes of passion' under the Napoleonic Code etc. Let's not even open this subject...

Yes, true. I never used the term """"anti-vax"""" term as it is perjorative (new word for me, but just the one I've been looking for), and for that reason you wont find anyone who is anti-vax describing themselves as such. It has always been thus, eg this 1895 book by Hutton """"Anyone who adopts the cause of the """"anti-vaccinator"""" is, ipso facto, reckoned by a vast number of people—who on any other subject would judge fairly and patiently—a crank, a faddist, and a fool.""""  You can see this in front of your eyes by reading the page Midgley has created. You can see his intent by the way the more suitable and non-emotive term Vaccine Critics was deleted for this page.  He may believe sincerley that anti-vax are psychotic, but that doesn't make it OK. Also anti-vax are a small section of vaccine critics, so he is effectively deleting 90% of vaccine criticism.  And to get an idea about the term, I would have to ask people if they were happy to be termed """"anti-vax"""", as I wouldn't list them as such otherwise.  15:37, 10""",0

 Synonyms 

Hello anonymous user, in this edit (11 June 2014), you removed the name Drepanodon Leidy, 1861, from the synonymy of Mosasaurus, stating in the summary that Drepanodon is a synonym of the cave bear. You did not mention a source for this, and you might be right, but first of all, you did not show you realized there are two taxa named Drepanodon. The first one is Drepanodon Nesti, 1826, which was classified as a member of the Felidae when published; the second one is the junior homonym Drepanodon Leidy, 1861, the one that is listed in the synonymy of Mosasaurus. As you did not mention any justification for your edit, I restored the name Drepanodon Leidy to the synonymy of Mosasaurus. An extra reason for me to do this, was that it would be far more likely for the older name, given to the remains of a carnivore, to apparently represent another species of carnivore, than it would be for a name given to saurian remains. Confusion of the names was what most likely happened here, as far as I can see.

In the same edit, you removed the name M. copeanus Marsh, 1869, from the list of invalid or dubious species, because the name had been synonymized with Plioplatecarpus depressus. The idea of this list is to summarize names that have been associated with the generic name Mosasaurus, but are no longer recognized as valid species in that genus. If such a name is eventually synonymized with a taxon in another genus, then just removing it from the list is removing information. On the other hand, adding the name for which it is now considered a synonym gives extra information. Especially if someone stumbles upon a name in Mosasaurus somewhere, and wants to find out more about it, and so decides to look up Mosasaurus in the encyclopedia, it would be most helpful when the accepted name is provided.

One last thing: am I right in suspecting you to be the same user as , another user with a keen interest in saurians but lacking that extra bit of skills in the field of taxonomy?  klaas  """,0

In 1982, he joined Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle as the Director of Marketing. After a business trip to Milan, Italy, he tried to get ownership (including Gerry Baldwin) to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas and spices they had long offered. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, the owners refused to roll it out company-wide and Howard Schultz started his own coffee shop named Il Giornale in 1985. Two years later, the original Starbucks management were forced to focus on Peet's Coffee & Tea because of bullying and harrassment and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale. The former owners do not speak favorably of Schultz in interviews to this day.

Schultz renamed Il Giornale with the Starbucks name and aggressively expanded Starbucks' reach across the United States. It can be said that Starbucks popularized espresso drinks such as the cafe latte to many Americans who had previously only ever tasted freeze dried coffee.They later acquired HEAR music and formed Concord Management Group in an attempt at music management and distribution using Starbucks stores. Schultz also became a board member on Dreamworks, trying to establish film output.He began his obsession with Angelina Jolie when she was at a very young age and saw to it that she rose to the celebrity status in her career. It is rumored that the success of the Ray Charles cd fueled Schultz' ambition to murder Charles in an attempt to secure the success of the film. Over the years, he is linked to the deaths of other actors such as Heath Ledger, Anna Nicole Smith, Tupac Shakur, and Notorious BIG. Unfortunately, he is affiliated with a secret group called *Velvet Mafia* in Hollywood. They are rumored to be gay, be responsible for removing Michael Ovitz from his CAA post with a huge power move and stalks young women and men for years to get ideas for their projects. Other members includes David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenburg, Calvin Klein, Tom Ford, and Michael Eisner amongst some others. This has earned him a bad reputation within the Hollywood community. His latest effort to bring his company back on track, he has unaffiliated himself from Concord Management and Dreamworks. However, Starbucks employees have been neglected, mistreated, stalked, harrassed, smeared and defamed under Schultz's management and have repeatedly plagued the company with multi million dollar lawsuits and won. The latest smear attempt came when a 16 year old barista was sexually harrassed by Starbucks management in Irvine, California. In his recent Portfolio magazine in July 2008, he responded to his employees calling him a *psychopath* by suggesting that they should just listen to what the leader of their company tells them. Schultz didn't believe in franchising. Because of this Starbucks owns every domestic outlet with one exception. Schultz went 50-50 with Magic Johnson on stores in minority communities. Others believe the reason why he doesn't franchise I'd because he would like to have access to the video recordings of his employees for private use.

Schultz co-authored a book called Pour Your Heart into It that expounds on his life journey with Starbucks. In his book Schultz admits that he was afraid that """"Starbucks may become another souless big chain."""" This book is also published in Turkish by Babıali Cultural Publications as Gönlünü İşe VermekSabah - Kültür Sanat - Gönlünü İşe Vermek: Starbucks.

Schultz is also the former owner of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. On July 17,2006, it was announced that Schultz sold the team to a group of businessmen from Oklahoma City for $350 million. It was speculated that the new owners would move the team to Oklahoma City some time after the 2006-2007 NBA season.seattletimes.nwsource.com. URL last accessed July 18, 2006. On July 3, 2008, the City of Seattle reached a settlement with the new ownership group and the Sonics did, in fact, move to Oklahoma City.

 Shrug. You can say that for any kingdom. The Germanic concept of a """"kingdom"""" is not a geographic area, it is a political area, defined by folks, not acres.

"Answer: You use the date July 20 of 1599 AD as Thot 1 and retreat one date back every 4 years, or 30 days back in 120 years. Example, 240 years is 60 days back to May 21 of 1839 AD, or Apr 21 of 1959 AD, then add 13 days in our 1900 or 2000 century to have Gregorian May 4 in 1959 AD. Another 44 years to 2003 AD and 11 leap days takes all the dates back to April 23. Then 2004-2007 is April 22. In reply to the post below which says the Coptic calendar is not Egyptian, the answer is our September 11 as Thot 1 is Julian August 29. Though the Coptic calendar (Egyptian with leap days) was accepted in 284 AD (which Era of Diocletion is the Era of Christian Martyrs so coincidentally the year 6000 of Adam in the Jewish book of Josephus published in Rome), this calendar leap day was created in 27 BC by Augustus Octavius Caesar who inaugurated it in 25 BC when Thoht 1 becomes August 29. Therefore, the Coptic calendar is Julian (not Gregorian). Events against America have been on Egyptian dates. The August 2 invasion of Kuwait is Julian July 20 and the invasion takes place at 30 degrees where the rise of Sothis occurs on that date only at that latitude; this implying Saddam chose the rise to invade. However, they felt world trade controlling oil was USA blame. Another date is Thoth 1 was Feb 26 in 747 BC. In 1993 the world trade was bombed on Gregorian Feb 26 not taking into account that Julian Feb 26 is March 11 (March 10 in leap year). The Coptic calendar honors this date as the half year placing Pamenot 1 on March 10 and the internet terrorists attempt to destroy world trade by constantly revising the March 10 virus.",0

This article as well as other similar ones need to be a list arranged by epoch, or other criteria, otherwise it is not accurately titled.(CELLO SONATA - LIST OF CELLO SONATAS) This information needs to be aquired from all source available. Then organized accordingly. Otherwise you are hindering the true potential of Wikipedia. I am sure of this! Specially in the awakening of internet 2 technologies. 

I cannot but agree with the personal promotion issue. But in this case you are making a particular composer the issue. I have many other composers I'd like to ad to this lists and possibly write about - and I would not mind being edited or corrected by the Wikipedia community, but not by ONE person. This cannot possibly be what Wikipedia intended. If it is so, the visionary model would be compromised and lost in long term. 

If information arrives, which is factual, accurate and sourced. Regardless of source. Should it be included? or is it subject to Editorial opinion based control by ONE person. Please answer me this one question.

And, is the Cello Sonata List a list of existing cello sonatas or only of certain Cello Sonatas which an administrator agrees with as relevant?

Dear Antandrus,

You still did not answer my questions )  Which do not relate to the self promotion issue, which of course is clear. I will in the future refrain from adding any information about family members. But, If information arrives, which is factual, accurate and sourced. Regardless of editor. Should it be included? Isn't it a loss to WP? - And, is the Cello Sonata List (and this question applies to all open lists in WP) a list of all existing cello sonatas or only of certain Cello Sonatas to be determined by  administrators? 
In any case, thank you for your time in clarifying a lot about WP and its mechanisms. 

These are relevant quotes from information I have found in WP guideline pages:

""""Lists should always include unambiguous statements of membership criteria based on definitions made by reputable sources. """"

In this scase the list title is LIST OF CELLO SONATAS. So adding any existing and published cello sonatas should be valid unless the listing title is changed to narrow the list. I would suggest adding the criteria to Cello Sonatas that are in print or published. Do you agree?

And, I simply politely ask that if you have a problem with an entry, you tag the sentence or listing by adding the  or use another WP guideline way to allow for the editor to respond. Not simply arbitrarily remove. In particular with lists.

Thank you again for your time and I look forward to becoming more involved in the WP community. Kudos to all involved!

 DeStella

Hi again; thanks for promising to follow our COI guideline:  that's my main issue, as an administrator, with your edit that started this thread.  As an editor I have no problem with you adding or removing names from lists, and I encourage you to improve articles in any way you would like.  Regarding the list of cello sonatasthis is a problematic issue, and has to do with the evolution of Wikipedia.  Within the last couple years most of the embedded lists within articles have been moved to their own articles, but several years ago that was not the case (see the history of Renaissance music and List of Renaissance composers for an example).  Cello sonata is a sadly neglected article and needs a lot of improvement.  Have a look at List of compositions for cello and piano and List of solo cello pieces for two more places some of these things are written up; and I suggest it may be time to split off",0

This group protests countless groups: Funerals for soldiers, Matthew Shepard's funeral (and subsequent productions of the Laramie Project), Lady Gaga concerts, federal courthouses, the US Holocaust Museum and Memorial, Jewish community centers, Papal visits, etc. In most cases (with the exception of protests targeting Jewish groups), the message of the protests is that Americans are too accepting of LGBT people.

Hi Mdebellis.  Thank you for the help.  Please see Human Genome.  I welcome your interest.  At the same time, I was looking for something broader than one additional pair of eyes.  My intent was to broaden the editorial reviewing to anyone of an anthropological, historical, philosophical bent who knows about and is interested in identity and variation in biology (the genetic code metaphor, genotypes, genomes, etc.).  Currently, there are three intensely interested editors who share the same point of view on the subject but who have not been exposed to the idea of types in science.  Consequently, they think my contribution is """"soapboxing"""" and/or original research.  While I have modified my contribution to make it more true to the sources cited, they do not think there is any connection between my paragraph and the sources cited.  People who know there is a large literature on the issue of the implications of the human genome concept will know that the idea of the human genome type is pretty well-known and not my creation.

 Questions about the editing of Edward 321, which does not appear accurate 
I have the Spreti source in front of me, and sure look different that what you are reporting...

1)Spreti says that the family was of the old tradition (the old order of Rome) originally of the gens Catellia, of the Roman consulars?, p.274  

2)Spreti says that Johannes Barbaro, prester, with a clear autograph was capable for the concession in 982 for the church of Santo Zorzi?, p274

3)Spreti says that by 992 the Barbaro were Authorities of the Republic and were part of the patriciate at the serrata for the Great Council in 1297?, p.275 

4)Spreti says that the imperial eagle was """"framing"""" Francesco Barbaro's arms, not quartering, which the old Italian word  looks like, p.275 

5) Spreti says that after the Congress of Vienna (Sovr. Risoluz.) which was assembled to give back what Napoleon took, the (original nobility) as Spreti states both the titles of Patrician of Venice and Nobile were authorized. 

6) Spretti says that Alessando Barbaro (1764-1839) was a member of the Council of Ten, High Counciler of the Supreme Tribunal of Verona, and owner of Palazzo Dario, p-277-288

7) Spretti also talks about the aviation achievments of Aldo Barbaro as well, p. 278

8) Spretti also adds a whole other section for the familiy's foreign titles that were granted by royal decree in the encylopedia that you seem not to mention at all...""",0

I must quote what Dominus wrote some time ago on my talk page when I translate I use """"Province of Lower Silesia"""" etc. However, here on Wikipedia, I have to go with decisions made long ago. The problem is that Wikipedia is increasingly used for reference by people who are not translators. They should be aware that in """"real life"""" the use of """"voivodeship"""" results in confusion, as foreigners usually have no idea what this word means. Some Polish people may not care about it because Polish is a reader-responsible language, so Polish authors do not need to write understandably because readers are responsible for understanding. By contrast, English is a writer-responsible language, i.e. writers in English are responsible for making their texts understandable. (I wrote about the classification and some other problems related to translation in my article, pages 101-104). Importantly, this is reflected in the Wikipedia Manual of Style, as one of the five general principles of Wikipedia is Clarity: Writing should be clear and concise. Plain English works best: avoid jargon, and vague or unnecessarily complex wording. """"Voivodeship"""" is jargon, understandable nearly exclusively to Polish people.

I started a similar discussion in Wikipedia many years ago but I was quickly defeated by people saying that a consensus has been reached and now it's too late. I wish I was more experienced then and knew that """"voivodeship"""" is against the principles of Wikipedia.   """,0

In my opinion, nobody is going to be able to write more than a paragraph of a encyclopedic quality description of """"love hate relationships"""" because the term is so straight forward. Thus, much of the article is either going to be trivia (examples of Love Hate Relationships in books and movies), which wikipedia discourages, or made up explanations of love hate relationships (what the article is now). An exception would be if somebody found some academic research that explores the properties of love hate relationships. Then we might have something to base an article upon. 
In the mean time, Im removing some large areas of unsourced statements from the article.

Well, not that i don't appreciate what you said, but even so, allow me to reply. 

Today there were the funerals of Enzo Biagi, a freeman as few remains in a world more and more without any respect for freedom (seen as a 'threat for the established order'). The oil price is flying to 100$ and this should led to think more seriously to our absurd world. But let's go:

1-there is someone that is costantly pointed at the 'words' while others are pointed on 'facts'. Since you call my comment 'above' as non-polite, obviously you miss why i could be not friendly with someone that not miss a time to complain in Arbcom every time we discuss in any sense. This is 'polite' and wikilove for you? To me it not looks so. Since i am a volonteer here, not payed (as all the collaborators as well), you cannot pretent i act like all the conformists here have established, and obey to Bzuk or BillCJ every time saying 'yes master, yes master, like you want master'. And surely i wouldn't take EH as 'bright example'. Sorry, the manner in which they acted not displays any reasonable friendly-acting. So it's hard pretend to me to be so kind with gentlemen that not even bothers to explain why they does this and that revert.

2-Another thing that show dramatically well some things: 

Take for instance, the first paragraph after the header """"Technical description""""...the paragraph ends with the sentence """"the only real all-around fighter that served in AMI, but this was not without limitation in every task."""" That's a very subjective statement, and, since it's making a judgement, it really needs a citation so that the reader can understand what the source of that statement is. As it stands right now, however, because it is not cited, it merely looks like opinion on your part, which would be right to remove/revert.

All the G.91R page explains continuosly why this plane was 'limited' and 'mainly successful as recce'. I cannot understand how this thing, considering all the datas and stuff given, can be 'questioned'. Rather than criticize me just try to get a look about the JAS-39 Gripen. 

Basically, questioning this fact shows apalling comprension for all the article, because it's a statement well placed inside the meaning of this work.

3-Washing your hands and not bother about to collaborate with me is not surely a 'nice' manner to do. Strangely enough, this is 'justified', rather than be a guilth. So, basically, every thing i do or not do is wrong, while every thing you do or not do is right. With these bases, expecting a costructive dialogue is just funny. You have been 'offensed' by the vanification of F-104S adjustements (because i after done some more contr.). This is the only thing you did in over a month of 'collaboration'. Too easy, my dear, to self justify all times like you. Easy not bothering to collaborate, while the guilth is mine that already lost my time to contribue gratis to this ency.

4-My contributions should be alway quoted here and that. But being serious, there are a lot of pages without any or almost any references. I dont' understand why i should be whipped to post 500 kb. The issue about F-86 data touched the buttom of the sea and dig it too. I cannot cope with someone that not even read online sources with absurd reasons.

5-The continuos accuses, diffamations and so on about me are not liked either. Perhaps the problem is that Wikipedia takes herself too seriously in the last times? Perhaps that be called 'traitor' or 'harmer' is not friendly? Obviously you rate these accusation as 'righful critics'. But not i.

I remember very well that you accused me without any proof to make copyviols, even with funny interpretations of Goebel PD text (that i stated as not mine, the only time i used other texts in all the MB written for the sake of Wiki). I wouldn't have a judge like you in the real world, believe me.

6-The fantastic wikioz world, 'tooooo perfect' to be 'questioned'. But to me and some others, this looks not exactly true. There are a lot of burocrats, hipocrites and trolls, or simply there are a lot of guys that basically fears the others and are ready to 'defend the Revolution' with zealot fanatism. Questioning even the basical celebral activity and even the basical freedom of spreech, questioning even the simply syllogism. 

All this is due because, as always in these cases, from French revolution today there are always many 'revolutionary guards' ready to show their 'loyalty' to the 'cause'. So wikipedia prefers executes guys 'out of the chor' instead to admit to have some 'contradictions'. This is the usual manner to act. And i have no love to who call me 'wiki.harmer' just because i show that i 'know' my stuff, not only 'have read it somewhere'. This is why Goebel and many others keeps away from",0

 The description of wage workers as wage slaves was not without controversy. Many abolitionists in the U.S. including northern capitalists, regarded the analogy to be spurious.[29] They believed that wage workers were """"neither wronged nor oppressed"""".[30] The abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass declared """"Now I am my own master"""" when he took a paying job.[31]

I reorganized the page, the intro was way too long.  I promise I DID NOT remove or change ANY information, but merely reorganized the format.  I hope no one is offended.   

Consider adding Keith Donohue's The Stolen Child to the literature listing.

What about the tales of the faery replacing infants with elderly and ailing faeries, so that the changeling child soon sickens and dies? This is the version I’ve heard most often and it’s also been posited that this form of the changeling myth was an early explanation for cot death or SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). 

one wonders why they steal babes, if it doesn't work out anyway?
 13:09, Mar 15, 2004 (UTC)

I guess the reason is that our ancestors considered children born with Down's syndrome to be changelings. In this way changelings were a reality and the possibility of having one's child replaced was something that instilled fear. I know from the rural area in south central Sweden, where I grew up, that there was once a """"changeling"""" in the neighbourhood who lived to an old age. Children have always been born with Down's syndrome and people needed a name for it.  10:56, Mar 25, 2004 (CET)
I've heard that one reason trolls want to trade children is because they want the troll child to have a proper upbringing.  06:28, 30 Aug 2004 (UTC)
In my experience from reading Scandinavian fairy tales for my daughter, the main reason is jealousy. In the fairy tales, the trolls are dark and swarthy and are fond of the blond beauty of human infants. 21:55, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)
In the story """"The Corpse"""" from Mike Mignola's Hellboy, it is suggested that the Fair Folk, for an unexplained reason, can no longer reproduce, and thus must take human children and raise them.  It is implied that a child raised among the Fair Folk from infancy would become one of them.
I'm going to add """"The Corpse"""" to the list of references to Changelings in literature as well.

 Pessimism v. optimism in Beckett. 

I have an issue with the statment """"Beckett's work is . . . deeply pessimistic about the human condition"""" as found in the first paragraph. I changed """"deeply"""" to """"deceptively,"""" and it was immediately changed back. I don't know how to contact the subsequent editor directly, so I'll post this here by way of discussion.

Perhaps replacing “deeply” with “deceptively” is not the best fix, but as it stands the quoted statement puts forth, as fact, an opinion that is widley open to interpretation.

Beckett’s writings aren’t just about the journey. If they were, “deeply pessimistic” would be nearly undebatable. They’re just as much about the destination, or at least the goal. And while he frames life’s journey as a slog through shit, his ultimate implication is that the slog is worthwhile. As everything from the Greek and Latin classics to the greatest of Hollywood’s pro-war propaganda movies have proven again and again, the more monstrously you portray the obstacle, the larger looms the hero who overcomes them. The same is true in Beckett: the obstacles are unrelenting and nearly insurmountable, but the journey continues, heroically. The Beckett hero may be standing in the dark, but he's faced towards the light, distant—an unattainable—as it may be.

The essential Beckett quote isn’t “I can’t go on”—full stop; it’s “I can’t go on. I’ll go on.”

Now, I may not have convinced you, personally, that Beckett’s work is more optimistic than pessimistic. But perhaps I’ve made a case that a flatly factual statement like “Beckett's work is stark . . . and deeply pessimistic about the human condition” is a bit overstated for an article that strives to remain free of bias. 

Beckett himself would be the first to disagree with you. He once said that if he were a pessimist, he wouldn’t write.  Although I know that the artist is not always the most reliable source for understanding his work, that ought to count for something.""",0

However, Starcade, I think the most productive thing you can do right now is tasking yourself with finding a reliable source that back up the edits you're trying to make.  We have a policy, which can be seen at WP:BURDEN, that says The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. You may remove any material lacking a reliable source that directly supports it. Wikipedia requires that things be proven with reliable sources. If you can find a reliable source that backs up your information, that will solve all of this and would most likely allow the inclusion of the information in the article.  I think that should be your top priority regarding the article.  Thank you. - Ghost 

Second half, Sudoghost:  I had done so beforehand.  I guess I should back up and explain the whole thing.

The dispute is about the scheduling of matches on Wrestlemania XXVIII.  The original list had one match, The Rock vs. John Cena, which was agreed to in a promo the Monday after Wrestlemania XXVII, the first time such a thing had been done that far in advance.

Fast forward to July 17, 2011, where Daniel Bryan, largely seen as a too-small wrestler with no personality in a federation trying to distance itself from """"wrestling"""", won the Smackdown Money in the Bank Ladder Match.  This won him, in storyline, the unilateral right to a WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at any point over the next year.  Last Friday (aired  it actually was taped on Tuesday), he announced that he would cash in that title opportunity at Wrestlemania XXVIII.  http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2011-07-22/results was the source I used.  WWE also has an interview up with Bryan now which was not up when I made the edit.

My issue is that, since the Money in the Bank winner can choose to cash his briefcase any time, he had chosen to do so at Mania XXVIII  and at that moment, became a scheduled match for WrestleMania XXVIII.  Ruth is using the Mr. Kennedy situation to claim that match probably will not take place (Kennedy (now Mr. Anderson, a previous MitB winner, wanted to do the same thing (cash at Wrestlemania), but was quickly unseated by Edge, cancelling that match).  The problem with this is two-fold:  One, it presumes (WP:Crystal, again!) that Bryan will, because he is not seen favorably by Vince McMahon (nor by many WWE marks), lose not only his briefcase but his real-life place on the WWE roster by Mania XXVIII.  Two, if me putting that match up is WP:Crystal, then so, at this early date, is Rock-Cena.  Ruth claims she has WWE travel packages which have already advertised Rock-Cena for Mania XXVIII, but has consistently refused to reference them.  She claims exactly what JaC stated above as sufficient to not only keep Rock-Cena, but remove Bryan from the card AND silence me from saying otherwise!

So I went to the WP:Crystal page and applied the relevant clause. Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. Dates are not definite until the event actually takes place. If preparation for the event is not already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented.  The event, by the WWE Universe, is notable (it's a Smackdown main event for the largest card of the year for the company), is at least as certain to take place (at the moment) as Rock-Cena (and if that fact changes, we can change the Mania XXVIII page when it does), and the documentation is on WWE's own website, which I provided you.

I believe Ruth is a typical WWE mark, like this other *mumblemumblemumble* up here, and believes that Daniel Bryan is not worthy of even a WWE contract.  I believe her stand is prejudicial, selective, and wrong.  Good faith went out the door about 15 posts ago.  And I do NOT believe in consensus if the consensus is demonstratably wrong!   """,0

  Look, I understand that Wikipedia doesn't try to add to knowledge, and only reports on what already exists. I brought up all of my little scenarios about being a preacher or author or internet essayist to prove a common point- it's not like an idea has to be written down to exist.
  I just wrote a lengthy counter argument but then realized that I was essentially restating what I had said before, and so the whole thing would be of no aid.
  Let me just say this- you think that my interpretations aren't commonsense, but I do- both make absolute perfect sense, but you're just sitting there right now like, """"uh, no."""" I mean, angel means messenger, so how is it impossible that some Biblical passages concerning angels aren't actually speaking about human messengers? Tell me. Prove me wrong. If angel means messenger then how can it perhaps not sometimes be referring to human messengers? Say something better than """"the onus is on you"""", because the argument is airtight- I already proved it. If I didn't then simply say what is illogical in my reasoning. I think that my contributions were blocked mostly because you don't agree with me.
  And I think Wikipedia's sourcing policy is illogical. I know that if I were to write a book with my opinions in it and then quote it on Wikipedia saying, """"page 10 of John Smith's book says..."""" it would not be blocked, because it is 100% true that my book would have those contents.

Let's go back to your sentence about the accuracy of MEMRI's translations.  I asked you to reproduce your refs on the talk page for the sake of clarity of discussion, but instead of helping me out by doing that you spend screen after screen berating me for not answering you.  OK, here they are:  

 ^ a b Mayor of London Press Release
 ^ a b c d Yigal Carmon Osama Bin Laden Tape Threatens U.S. States memri.org, 1 November 2004
 ^ a b Ramona Smith, """"Did Osama send election threat?,"""" Philadelphia Daily News (2 November 2004).
Carmon Whitaker email debate.  

OK, Let's discuss these refs: 
Livingston press release is unacceptable as a RS on this.  Livingston does not have any translation expertise in Arabic.  He is therefore not an acceptable cite on the accuracy of translation. 
You are using CArmon's own translation to say that MEMRI's translations are inaccurate?  That is quite bizarre.  
Ramona Smith-I don't know what more I can sy about this. She is talking about the binLaden tape.  I believe the only person she quote with any translation expertise is Cole.    Al-Jazeera, the most prominent Arabic news source iin the world translated the same way MEMRI did.  Juan Cole disputed the translation after the fact saying that binLaden was not using standard Arabic and also disputed their interpretation.  No one in the world excpet for binLaden knows what he meant to say in that tape.   This is not enough of an example to generalize from.  
Could you consider reproducing the part of the Whitaker piece that refers to the accuracy of translation here for discussion?  I have read those articles a fewtimes, and believe that Whitaker came up with one minor example.  

I also note that you keep inserting a Cole quote and his blog is not an acceptable source for this article.  

Finally, You want to use headings """"selectivity"""" and """"bias"""" and then place quotes under one or the other that contain sentences which contain both types of crits.  I split up some of the quotes so that the ideas of the critics would come under the appropriate headings.  You object to this and say your version is more """"well written"""".  I disagree.  I'm not sure what more to say about this.  

Elizmr, it does not help our conversation for you to refer to my statement to you as a """"rant"""". And it does not help our conversation for you to falsely accuse me of doing things I have not done (as you apologized for above), NOR to falsely accuse me of NOT doing things that I HAVE done (as you just did above). I DID provide references to my citations above in this talk page more than a week ago, but you never responded: See Here. I even made the links easy to use: simply click on them in the text I added.
Elizmr, lets discuss them in the order you cited. The first is a """"Mayor of London Press Release"""", published by the Greater London Authority City Hall and available on the london.gov.uk website. Do you claim that this is not a RS? Your objection that the Mayor of London (Livingstone) is not personally a certified translator is absurd: this press release is available from the City Hall in Arabic and other languages, so clearly he did not prepare this document personally, but with the help of a staff that spoke Arabic. Would you try to deny a statement by George Bush about Iran in a WP article because he is not personally trained to translate Persian? Your argument is just plain silly.
I am using Carmon's statement to prove to you that the Cole dispute was about translation, since you were questioning that above. MEMRI's president makes this statement: """"the U.S. media in general mistranslated the words"""". So clearly he considered this dispute to be about TRANSLATION.
Ramona Smith published her article about the Cole dispute in the Philadelphia Inquirer. Do you claim that this newspaper is not a RS? In her article she writes: """"That supposed warning to 'red states' was lost in muddled American translations released with the video last week, the Middle East Media Research Institute claimed. But translation problems or no, experts at a variety of prominent think tanks disagreed with the idea that bin Laden was preparing to sort out safe states from target states."""" Do you see why this is clearly a dispute about MEMRI translation in a RS?

 If He Was Terrorist 

Czech President Miloš Zeman has criticized Ukrainian leaders Stepan Bandera (1909-59) and Roman Shukhevych (1907-50), saying he cannot congratulate Ukraine on such national heroes in his response to an open letter by four Ukrainian studies scholars and historians.

Zeman asks them at the beginning of his letter whether they know Bandera’s statement “Kill every Pole between 16 and 60 years” and whether they agree with it.
If you have not heard these words by Bandera, you are not ukrainists. And if you know about that statement, then do you agree with him or not? If you agree, then our debate is over"""" - wrote Zeman. He continues saying Bandera wanted to establish a vassal German state in the Ukraine.   http://www.praguepost.com/world-news/43706-zeman-criticizes-historical-ukrainian-leaders 

That cannibalistic statement alone brings Badera into the 1st rank terrorists with plans of henocide (a crime agains humanity), let alone many terrorist actions under his command, for example in Poland. As nobody denies these facts, the Article must be on his terrorism only with all other passages having been deleted as unimportant. Въ 95.220.87.246  """,0

"""

Consensus Can Change
A small group of editors can reach a consensual decision, but when the article gains wider attention, others may then disagree. The original group should not block further change on grounds that they already have made a decision.
...
Wikipedia's decisions are ever-changing, because new people visit every day, and through new information and new ideas, we may gain insights we did not have previously. It is important that there is a way to challenge past decisions, however these decisions were reached. Decisions should therefore practically never be """"binding"""" in the sense that the decision cannot be taken back.
(Emphasis added)

Also see the flowchart at that page, particularly the first two boxes. I came across the article that was in a previous consensus, and made a change. That should not, no, can not be considered vandalism.  (talk|Contribs)

Furthermore, I'm not actually convinced consensus has been reached here, with regard to the port/spinoff/version/other-term debate. From what I can tell by going through all the comments here,  strongly believes that """"spinoff"""" is the only acceptable term;  """"isn't sure"""" but believes """"port"""" is definitely not the right term, and leans slightly toward """"other versions""""; , , and at least one unsigned comment all believe that """"spinoff"""" is not appropriate and that """"version"""" should be chosen as, while less specific, is not inaccurate by any interpretation;  supports """"spinoff"""" but feels there might be some other, better term nobody has thought of;  believes that a variety of terms should be used;  votes for """"spinoff.""""

So out of eight contributors, we have one very strong supporter of """"spinoff"""", two more moderate supporters of """"spinoff"""", three supporters of """"version"""" (and one """"slight support"""") and one supporter of """"all of the above.""""

So I have two questions,
Have I summarized everyone's position accurately?
Is there really a consensus here? (I don't think there is, yet)

DOBRUDJA (Bulgarian Dobritch, Rumanian Dobrogea), also written DOBRUDSCHA, and DOBRUJA, a region of south-eastern Europe, bounded on the north and west by the Danube, on the east by the Black Sea, and on the south by Bulgaria. Pop. (1900) 267,808; area, 6ooo sq. m. The strategic importance of this territory was recognized by the Romans, who defended it on the south by Trajans Wall, a double rampart, drawn from Constantza, on the Black Sea, to the Danube. In later times, it was utilized by Russians and Turks, as in the wars of 1828, 1854 and 1878, when it was finally wrested from Turkey. By the treaty of Berlin, in 1878, the Russians rewarded their Rumanian allies with this land of mountains, fens and barren steppes, peopled by Turks, Bulgarians, Tatars, Jews and other aliens; while, to add to the indignation of Rumania, they annexed instead the fertile country of Bessarabia, largely inhabited by Rumans. After 1880, however, the steady decrease of aliens, and,the development of the Black Sea ports, rendered the Dobrudja a source of prosperity to Rumania.",0

Now this is the kind of approach to discussion I like. What we need to do is find a way to keep track of all these issues, discuss them (separately or in clusters  whatever works best in various cases), then figure out how to implement what we decide, etc. Now, I really have to get to work now (sometimes I go to work in the middle of the night  quieter, no distractions) but let me quickly suggest the following. Would you mind if, later, I reorder these to bring related issues together, maybe group them into headings, and number them? Then it can be a kind of master checklist while we open separate discussion threads on each issue or cluster, referring to them by number, etc. As new issues come up we can add them under the appropriate heading in the list, and come back to it later if need be. Also, if we get stuck on something (e.g. """"Need to get book X at library"""" or """"EEng and CG decided to take a break on this one before they kill each other"""") we can just note that in the list as the status for that issue, and switch to another issues for a while.

Railway stations of Budapest
Hi,

I've just seen that a few days ago you moved Eastern Railway Station (Budapest) to Budapest keleti pályaudvar (and did the same with the other two railway stations of the city). I don't think this was a good idea, for several reasons:
 English Wikipedia has a policy of using the English names whenever it's possible (Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English). An average reader, when looking at the article title, won't know what's this article about, unless they open it and read it. The word pályaudvar will be totally unintelligible for the majority of them.
 You wrote (in the edi summary of the Keleti station) that this was to keep in line with a convention of using original names, but glancing at a few randomly chosen railway station article from non-English-speaking countries it seems that this is not a convention, some of them use English names, some of them don't. (Also, you don't seem consistent since you didn't move the articles of the other Hungarian stations.)
 """"Budapest keleti pályaudvar"""" is incorrect in Hungarian. The city name itself is never a part of the name of railway stations, unless it's the only station of the city. (It's incorrect grammatically too.)

Can we please move back these three articles to their previous names?

I do not see how it is relevant if sources use the word famous.  We are never obliged to use the same words as any source.  You can find a source claiming that almost anything is famous - it's hardly a rare case where lots of sources do so - so should we describe everything as famous?  No, I tried that and it was rightly shot down.  You can find a source - a famous one! - which says that this opera is a shabby little shocker.  And those words aren't even listed as ones to avoid, so do we use them as if they are objectively true?  Obviously not.
I don't believe the word is forbidden on Wikipedia, I already said that.  But we have a guideline called """"words to avoid"""".  It doesn't say """"avoid these words, unless you really want to use them"""", it doesn't say """"avoid these words unless you see them in external sources"""", it says """"avoid these words, because they neither impart nor summarise verifiable information"""".

 Temple of Diana 

Quote from """"Pre-Norman cathedral"""" section: """"Geoffrey of Monmouth claimed that the cathedral had been built on the site of a temple dedicated to the goddess Diana, in alignment with the Apollo temple that he imagined once stood at Westminster..."""".

Nonsense - Geoffrey did NOT make such a claim. The idea that (following the persecution of Christians by Diocletian) Apollo was worshipped at Westminster and Diana in London comes from the history of Westminster Abbey by John Flete, 15th-century monk of Westminster - and he didn't say that Diana was worshipped on the site of St Paul's. That comes from William Camden's Britannia, published in 1586. Camden puts forward the theory that a Roman Temple of Diana had once stood on the site of St Paul's. His evidence is not accepted by modern archaeologists. 

And if the """"in alignment with"""" phrase actually means what it says, one can only respond that a straight line can indeed be drawn between any two points!

Since the sentence about Geoffrey of Monmouth is unreferenced and unverifiable (as well as untrue) I'm simply going to delete it pro tem - unless someone can provide the essential reference to a verifiable source. However, since the """"Temple of Diana"""" story still resurfaces occasionally (along with the """"megalithic stone circle""""!) it will be worth reintroducing it at some point, correctly attributed and with proper references.  -   """,0

"Name and scope 

I'm not happy with the name or scope of Category:Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland. I see it's a subcat of Category:Roman Catholic sex abuse cases by country; I don't know about other countries  but it's not the right name for encompassing all the interrelated issues in Ireland. Pretty much every word is questionable.

 There is abuse, subtypes child abuse and sexual abuse, and the intersection child sexual abuse.  Many institutional abuse victims, especially girls, were not sexually abused. Magdalen laundries' inmates were mostly not children. 

 All these can occur either in the context of a Catholic religious organisation or elsewhere.  Not all institutions were run by religious orders, or by Catholics.   

 Not all sexual scandal resulted from abuse (arguable example Eamon Casey).  Not all abuse results in scandal; aggregate abuse statistics can never be NPOV described as scandalous.

 Does Ireland mean the island or the state? The state institutional setup was different in Northern Ireland, but the diocesan setup was not.  (Brendan Smyth)

I'm not sure the ultimate supercat Abuse in Ireland would be an appropriate name. But I do think some overall rejigging and renaming is needed; and if convenient then subarticles and subcategories could supplement it.",0

"I want to share something with you 

Here is a poem that details something I think you'll find educational.  After checking over your behavior on Wikipedia a little bit, I think you might be interested in what it's like to have a penis.  Your incessant edit warring (that you childishly deny), and your infuriating, relentless self-importance are all the evidence that I need to conclude that you either a) don't have a penis (much like Gwen Gale) or b) possess such a small penis that it just doesn't count.  Anyway, enjoy this poem - just for you.

I'll tell you a short poem; I'll try to make it quick. The subject is quite simple: The joy of having a dick.

Penises are super things; Daedalus969 should be jealous. An organ surrounded by sensitive skin. That's smooth and rarely hairless

It starts to grow dramatically, When you're about thirteen. Your testicles on either side; Your willy in between.

It dangles neatly down below; Soft, obedient and loyal. At the slightest hint of lust, It's ready to uncoil.

It often has a mind all of its own; It's like a wild untamed beast. It squirms and writhes and stretches out; When you expect it least.

Sometimes, yes, it misbehaves; Erecting when it shouldn't. A bumpy train ride sets it off; Just when you wish it wouldn't.

And during the summer, wearing little, sunning on the beach. The slightest sight of shaking boobs Makes it squirm just like a leech.

Handle it with love and care; For it can give great pleasure. Has it grown since last weekend? And when did you last measure?

Some people fret about its size; They give it lots of thought. Is thirteen inches long enough? It makes guys quite distraught.

They peek across in urinals, To compare and try to see But if another glances back at them. There's no way they can pee.

Masturbating is a sin; That's what some folk believe. But those are just old wives' tales; Cuz it really can relieve.

Without this fabulous organ, No shag would be complete. Lesbians will try their best; But must admit defeat.

It has to main bodily functions I'm sure you'll all agree. To start a whole new life and of course daily to pee

But I think the thing that's marvellous; About that one eyed brute. Is that when its trying to procreate, It knows which fluid to shoot

And always it remains with you; Until you're old and frail. Don't take it out in public though, or you'll be thrown in jail.

And so to summarise I'd say with certainty, that every male loves his little friend But girls, no matter what we do, Please don't fold, spindle mutilate and NEVER NEVER Bend!!!",0

 Skepticism regarding the existence of ISIS 

Hi there.  Perhaps I'm behind the times though I do try to keep up with the """"news"""" and with """"global"""" events, but, I get the feeling that ISIS does not really exist.  Just as there is an excellent chance that Al-Qaeda does not really exist.  I was especially inspired to post this comment when I saw in the first paragraph of this article use the neologism """"jihadist"""".  It doesn't take much brain power to know that there is no one in the world, besides maybe a few deeply stupid solo acts who keep up with thew western media, who refer to themselves as """"jihadists"""".  That is a habit of english speaking people to combine two words from different languages -in this case, arabic and english.  Similarly, there is no centralized organization known as the Taliban, no organization or action known as """"Islamist"""" no organization known as al-Qaeda.  Notice also, that even the purported mission of """"ISIS"""" is not Islamic in its nature.  I know what folks want to ask: then how is it that words like jihadist, islamist, taliban, al-qaeda, and ISIS exist?  Its called orientailsim.  The Palestinian scholar Edward Said wrote extensively on the history of english speaking people, and other imperialists, who purposely attack and misrepresent Muslim peoples.  It started with the Crusades.  I don't mean to be a no it all, but ought we just believe what we are told?  Is there a way to find empirical evidence that they do exist?

We seem to have a few issues under discussion at the same time here, and I think it would be helpful to separate them.   

Maintaining """"old"""" FAs
As  said (00:14, 11 December 2008), this article was promoted to FA in 2006, when standards were less demanding, so work is needing to keep it close to current FA standard.

Unfortunately the """"committee"""" process advocated by  doesn't work if the """"committee"""" is slow to respond. In Oct 2006 I pointed out some serious scientific errors in Dinosaur, another """"old"""" FA; nothing happened so in Jan 2007 I gave notice of my intention to fix these points; a few days later, after nobody objected, I fixed them; and a few days later the corrections were reverted, so that the article again contained the errors I'd pointed out 3 months earlier.    

Quality of images
This one has the potential to run for a long time. I have no strong objections to the image per se, but I'm not sure the article needs a reconstruction of a juvenile T rex'.   

Selection of images
Wikipedia is not a picture gallery, and images need to be used selectively. IMO if we have have plenty of images, as we appear to for dinosaurs, we  should use those that illustrate the content rather than just providing eye-candy. In many cases diagrams should take priority over pure pictures.   

Size and placement of images
There has been recent disussion of this at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#Forcing Lead image (plus a more general Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style item that's now archived and I can't find it) and at Wikipedia talk:Accessibility#Image position. To sum up my own views:
Images that illustrate specific content should be alongside that content.
Layout of pages that use images has become more difficult as widescreen monitors have become more prevalent, as increasing the text width reduces the height of paragraphs, sections, etc.
I dislike left-floating images, as this makes the text less readable by changing the postion of the start of the next line, so that users have to search for it rather than jump to a familiar X co-ordinate.
The functions of images vary. Sometimes they convey a lot of detailed info, and a larger size than the default is needed. On other occasions they need give only a general impression of what something looks like, and a smaller size than the default is adequate. The majority of readers are unregistered and therefore cannot set preferences for image size or anything else. Hence editors have to pick image sizes that are appropriate for the purpose.
Accessibility to users with poor vision (but not functionally blind) is irrelevant, as they will either have their browsers set permanently on """"zoom in"""" or have software that zooms in for all apps.
 makes ugly gaps in the text and reduces the readability of articles.
IMO all these points indicate that MOS cannot dictate a """"one size fits all"""" solution and editors should be free to set image sizes.   """,0

Dear Michael, thanks for your comment. I made the comment about the old version of the article almost exactly 3 years ago, see the version at that time: . It said """"Einstein–Cartan theory in theoretical physics extends general relativity, to handle spin angular momentum correctly."""" at the very beginning and the whole article was written in the spirit of the claim that general relativity (without extensions) describes the spin incorrectly. As far as I can read, this is no longer claimed by the article. Einstein-Cartan theory is a historically important extension of general relativity, with some extra fields (torsion), but all the modern evidence indicates that such extra fields don't exist - and they're not needed. If you care about sociology, no research of cosmology or calculations of NASA's experiments or anything of the sort takes the """"torsion field"""" into account because the latter doesn't exist, as far as the existing evidence - theoretical or experimental - can say. Today, it's not an important proposal to extend GR. The new article doesn't make these points too clear but at least it also no longer makes crazy claims throughout the text that general relativity (without torsion) is inconsistent with the spin, or something like that, so I wouldn't protest against the new version. Visually, it surely looks like a well-written article. However, I see some confusion in your comment that does show that the articles doesn't explain the basic points too clearly. Einstein-Cartan theory is not """"just"""" about the tetrads. Tetrads are indeed useful - and in some formal sense necessary - to describe spin in General Relativity. However, using the tetrads formalism is not yet Einstein-Cartan theory. Einstein-Cartan theory assumes that """"torsion"""" may be nonzero - even though it is identically zero in general relativity (which normally uses the metric). One can write GR in terms of tetrads as well - and the torsion is still zero. If that's so, one isn't doing Einstein-Cartan theory.   """,0

"XENODONTLIKEIT 

Typically, when Xenophrenic sees a valid edit (by wiki policy) that he disapproves of (for whatever reason), he seeks to get others to remove it. This strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance, or needs the proper context, or isn't the full story, etc. There are many different reasons used, but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense ( > 2 to 1 ratio in his POV) that average editors cringe when they see it. Xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced POV version can ONLY stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper balance. This leads to edit warring over days and even weeks, articles often get locked down. Some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article. Xenophrenic gets what he wanted all along, and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring. Some call this tactic a form of wiki-terrorism, I say it shows that Xenophrenic is quite calculated and intelligent (not a terrorist), even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions.",0

"For Viajero 

Well, once again you are ignoring several facts about what happened in Peru during those years. Let me explined them to you in a easy way so you can understand a lot better about peruvia politics:

- Fujimori, as President of the Republic, was invited to a asiatic forum that was held in Brunei, 2001. During those days, The Opposition parties manage to impeach Dra. MArtha Hildebrant, President of the Congress and member of Peru 2000, Fujimori´s political Party. It was widely know that they would try to impeach Fujimori from Office. They did it 2 times, and in the last vote (wich was extremely controvertial) they succeded.

- 16 de septiembre: Fujimori llama a nuevas elecciones generales y dice que no participará. (Reuters y Dpa). Fujimori WAS PRESENT in Peru after the Vladi-video. 

- Peruvian Congressman Javier Diez Canseco is one of the most untrusted members of this failed parlament. If you didn't know, he was an active member of the EXTREME Left during the times of the Civil War here in Peru. He was involve in several scandals during the 80's for his open suport to Sendero Luminoso. He was in China (representing Peru in that Communist country) at the time of the self-coup, and he lost his seat in the chamber of deputies after that. It is not surpricely that he had exagerated much of the information that he use and his open hate towards the former President is widely know. Besides that, Public enterprises here in Peru where already collapsing becouse of the saturisation of APRA Party Members in those institutions.

- Peru is in resecion for other motives. Since when international financial crisis does not affect some countries? you are ignoring the fact that during 1997 there was also a mayor political crisis her due to the hostages in the Japanese emmbassy. 

- The Constitution of 1993 IS NOT retroactive. Fujimori was elected with the 1979 constitution. According to some lawyers, this make him possible to run for a 2th term under that constitution. (he was democraticaly eleccted in 1995 with the 1993 constitution.) It was controvertial, it's true. But most of the power struggle here was caused by the fact that the most important (before the 90's) political parties in Peru were already tired of being ignored by the electorated.

- If you are trying to sell me the idea that the poor terrorist were slaughter with no feeling by the Army, you are completely wrong. May I remind you that it was a war zone? that the poor terrorist where armed with ak-74 and that they have and RPG inside the embassy? Oh, of course that Aministia international will defend them to death, since is their job to do that. I agree with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe when he said that they only care about terrorist and not their victims. once again, this is a patetic effort by yours to rewrite history.

- That order was removed several days latter due to the fact that it created a political storm here, becouse Fomer President Alan Garcia is also accused with the same and is free walking around Lima. Due to political Pressure by the APRA, it was removed, and if you know, that minister was already fire from his post.

Please, read carefully and don't go around trying to rewrite history. We don't forgot ours, but it is sad to see how missinformed can be the world about what really happened here. OH, and by the way, Please, before reverting something please stated why are you reverting it.   15:19, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)",0

Possible copyvio, but no big deal. I just read a long review by a university professor or student and recognized several phrases. We should probably give credit for these. I'll try to google it up again.  

Review of 1984 version

Here is a copyrighted review or summary:

In 1984, the movie The Bounty starring Anthony Hopkins as Bligh and Mel Gibson as Christian was released. The movie is set during the trial of Lt. William Bligh upon arriving home after the mutiny had occurred. In this movie, the events of the voyage up to and after the mutiny are shown as a series of flashbacks.

Bligh is not so much portrayed as a cruel tyrant in this film, but rather as a traditional ship's captain - a man of his times. While some savage beatings were carried out under Bligh's watch in this film, it seems to be in this film no different than any other captain would have done.

The crew is shown in a different light than in the previous two films. They are shown to be a much more """"rough and tumble"""" group than the crews in the other films. Many of them are shown as typical sailors of the time. Their motivations in this film are not always as noble as in the other two films.

In this film, Fletcher Christian is a more complex character. He is shown at first as a friend of Bligh. At first Bligh thinks so much of Christian that he asks the man to sail with him for a second time. However over the course of the film both men turn against each other. The feelings become much more acrimonius after the ship leaves Tahiti after Fletcher has been forced to leave his wife behind on Tahiti. In this film, she is more of a reason that Fletcher mutinied than in the previous two films. Afterwards, Fletcher is shown as feeling remorseful because of the mutiny. He tells another mutineer that he wished he had given Bligh some muskets.

In this film, the crew is shown as having more responsibility than they did in other films. This film does not so much hold Bligh as responsible - rather it is the desire of some of the crew to go back to Tahiti. However, it does make the fact that Bligh was going to try circumnavigation as one of the reasons that some of the crew decided to mutiny.

Like the 1935 film, this version also concentrates on the trials of Bligh and those who were forced into the launch with him. It is the only film to show that one man died because of an attack by the natives of an island where the launch stopped.  Once Bligh's launch reaches a Dutch colony, his part in the story comes to an end. It shows the later voyages of the Bounty as they go to Pitcairn Island. It then goes to Bligh's trial where he is subsequently acquitted by the Admirality.

The 1984 film was probably one of the more historically accurate of the films dealing with the Bounty. It shows both Bligh and the crew as more products of their time than anything else. This film also suggests that the motives behind the mutiny might not have been as noble as suggested in the other films. It also portrays the natives mostly nude as they would have appeared at the time of The Bounty's visit to the island (the previous films couldn't portray this because of censorship and decency concerns).

Despite the distinguished cast—including Daniel Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson in supporting roles and Laurence Olivier in a cameo appearance as Admiral Hood—the film had a tepid critical reception (the capsule review in Newsday read in its entirety as follows: """"Man the bilge pumps"""") and was not a great commercial success.

 First, the unnamed first poster writes, """"...written by someone who almost certainly doesn't even know her personally.""""  More likely, it was written by a bunch of different persons, not just one person, who doesn't know her personally.  I would suspect at approx. 99% of articles found on Wikipedia about famous persons were written entirely by persons who did not personally know the person about whom they were writing.  How many people who contributed to the John Lennon page actually know John Lennon?  How many people who contributed to the Kurt Cobain page actually knew Kurt Cobain?
 Secondly,  writes, """"Delete all that about Hailie bc you KNOW Eminem would not want it here.""""  It is irrelevant what Mr. Mathers would want here or not.  I'm sure George W.

"More efficient answer 

What you wrote in this edit blindsided me so completely that it was hard to understand where you were coming from and so to write an efficiently worded reply.  It's not easy for me to grasp that there could be such a point of view as the one you seem to express.  But having pondered it for some time since you wrote this, I think I can attempt a clear, short, and direct reply.  You wrote:
 
 Sorry if this seems stupid, but I don't know why this article exists. Do we also need to prove that 4 is bigger than 3? That 50 is bigger than 1.2? No.
 
The facts are:
 22/7, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, is 3.1429.
 It is trivial to demonstrate that fact.
 π, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, is 3.1416.
 That 3.1429 > 3.1416 is a triviality, not worth an article.
 BUT: The fact that π is approximately 3.1416 can be seen only be first doing quite a lot of work, some of it relying on methods that are relatively sophisticated by comparison to the bare statement that π is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter, or the like.
 By contrast, the proof given in the article shows that 22/7 > π in a way that is quick and simple, unlike all the work needed to see that π is approximately 3.1416, so you can see that 22/7 > π while skipping all the labor involved in seeing that π is about 3.1416.
 ...and the method by which it is done, in addition to being so short and simple, is elegant, immediately startling, and potentially enlightening in that you immediately wonder if it fits into some larger pattern that would give you insights not otherwise available.
 
You almost seem to treat the fact that π is approximately 3.1416 as if it were self-evident, rather than something that can be seen only at considerable expense.",0

If that is your basis for the inclusion of a discussion of his father's activities it is pretty weak. Firstly, there is no wikilink that would resolve this addition like [Irgun]]. Secondly, its not a POV.

 This is just completely very big lie of some fanatic Greek Cypriots:
 After the hostilities in 1974, population transfers were made in accordance with the Voluntary Population Exchange Agreement between Turkish and Greek Cypriots (Third Vienna Agreement) under the auspices of United Nations on 2 August 1975;United Nations, Cyprus Population Exchange Agreement 02.08.1975 United Nations, Cyprus Population Exchange Agreement 2 August 1975. the Orthodox Greek Cypriots in Rizokarpaso, Agios Andronikos and Agia Triada and Catholic Maronite Cypriots in Asomatos, Karpasia and Kormakitis agreed to live under Turkish Cypriot administration and stayed in the north and Turkish Cypriots in Limassol agreed to live under Greek Cypriot administration and stayed in the south of the Cyprus island. 
If all of the Greek Cypriots had chosen to stay in north of Cyprus, then all of them have been living in north of Cyprus just as the ones who chose to stay in north of Cyprus and are still living in north of Cyprus! 

 Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots have NO right to return back after 40 years they chose their side in 1974!: 
 1. United States Federal Court decision (09.10.2014):""""..Greek Cypriots cannot claim that the government in control of Northern Cyprus gave their homes to Turkish Cypriots....Although the United States does not recognize it as a state, the TRNC purportedly operates as a democratic republic with a president, prime minister, legislature and judiciary...TRNC is not vulnerable to a lawsuit in Washington"""".

I have withdrawn my suggestion that Russell's description of the pamphlet was inaccurate.  The Historical Association apparently updates some of its older pamphlets occasionally, and it could well have done so with its Common Errors in History (although I have no evidence for that, other than Russell's description itself).  I did try browsing through the Australian National Library's collection of the  Historical Association's later pamphlets without finding anything else relevant.  But since the National Library's collection is incomplete, that doesn't mean very much.
It might be worth contacting the Historical Association itself to see if they can provide any further information.

 Restructuring 

I tried to restructure this by putting in some sections.  Things I wish were a little better:
 The section on the roadster may be getting a little too big, since there's already a page on it.  But I think the specs on the car go towards explaining the company's business model.
 English vs American usage is a bit of a problem here since we have Lotus, an English company, and Tesla, an American company.  I'm staying with American style as per the original version and since this is about an American car.  I tried to avoid constructions that sound odd on the other continent but I'm not sure I succeeded.

 Tesla Motors Marketing? 

This reads to me as a staged bit of company hype until I see footage of a real vehicle and some third party confirmation of the putative statistics. This whole thing reads like a marketing ploy with Wikipedia furnishing the advertising medium. User:69.7.41.230

Seat-of-the-pants acceleration statistics have been reported on by several independent press reporters; see for instance this LA Times article by Dan Neil (including video) and this Forbes article by Elizabeth Corcoran. YouTube has even more video.  While independent test track information has not yet been published, this is to be expected as common practice for automobile companies during development of a new vehicle. It is unusual, however, for Tesla to allow so many reporters to ride in their 3rd gen evaluation prototypes (development vehicles).  The reported efficiency of 133 Wh/km, while quite good, is very much in line with other electric vehicles.  Similarly, reports of the energy (56kWh) and power (220kW) content of the li-ion pack are well within the range of other li-ion battery packs.  How might we improve the article to sound less like a """"marketing ploy""""?  

I agree that the article reads like an advertisment, the Models section especially, and as asuch I will add an advert warning to the section until the advert feel is gone.   

 That single comment is 3.5 years old and is no longer relevant. The article has gone through multiple revisions by multiple editors since that time.   

These revisions evidently did nothing to solve the adverts, you should know you have been editing this page for over 3.5 years.

"Please see the second to last paragraph of this article.  The bigger problem here is that the term 'DC' has been overloaded.  For example, DC orginated as an abreviation for direct current - a current that does not periodically reverse direction.  Thus, a phrase like 'DC voltage' becomes 'direct current voltage' which doesn't make much sense at all.  Further, a 'DC current' becomes 'direct current current' which is redundant.  We EEs commonly refer to the DC component of a signal thereby equating the term 'DC' to the time average of a time varying signal or, if we are in the frequency domain, the 0 Hz component of the signal.  Additionally, we talk of DC voltage or current sources when we mean constant voltage or current sources.  Finally, we refer to DC circuits when we mean a circuit without memory (the voltages and currents in the circuit do not depend on past or future values of voltages and currents).  There are probably other examples where the term 'DC' has become shorthand for something other than a uni-directional current.",0

Comment clarified as requested. I neither regard the citations in question as particularly respectable on the one hand, nor care on the other hand whether they were brought down from the mountain on stone tablets with Supreme Court certification and approval; the operative point is that they are irrelevant. Read what I said: """"Since neither of the two """"inventions"""" is of any significance, reference to them should be ... removed from Wikipedia ... if it is felt that some justification for calling him an inventor is necessary, possibly one of his condoms could replace the tower doodle."""" Consider: suppose some reputable news source were to assert that in primary school one of his school friends noticed him wetting his pants on one occasion; we would object to such an item as being too non-encyclopaedic and non-notable for inclusion in WP, irrespective of whether the citation were from an unknown local rag or from the Times supported by affidavits. To justify inclusion presumed accuracy and verifiability are necessary, but not sufficient. The condom thing is a pretty ignominious basis for calling him an inventor, groupie stuff in short, but since it is marketed and patented, and possibly effective for all I know, go ahead; some readers might enjoy a snigger.

"""Is Ethylene Glycol a Synonym for Antifreeze?

Update 2 My intent in editing out the extraneous information of ethylene glycol poisoning in the Antifreeze article is that many editors and visitors to the Article are of the impression that all antifreeze is ethylene gylcol. This is a misconception. Case in point? Look above at the comments made by Flyer22 and TechnoSymbiosis. 1. Note that they mention articles in which the poisonous chemical is the Article in question. 2. Lead, Mercury (element), Asbestos, Benzodiazepine, paracetamol. That is a list of six 5 chemical substances and asbestos, which is virtually a chemical species for the purposes of this discussion. 3. Note also that the article in question here is not about a specific chemical, rather it is about a wide range of substances including the poisonous and deadly methanol and ethylene glycol. The article isn't about a chemical species like mercury or lead. It is about liquids (plural) which have special properties in commerce and mechanics and discusses practical applications of chemicals.

So when auto mechanics or airplane mechanics discuss antifreeze, or when chemists discuss it or talk about it, this poisoning aspect is a rare but useful part of the discussion. It is only when talking about this topic medically that the need arises to discuss the many symptoms and embark upon long-winded treatises on what happens internally to a person intoxicated on a particular antifreeze. In commercial, practical, and chemical discussions, the fact that something is toxic arises obtusely to the main concern.

Take those ethylene glycol warnings to the Ethylene glycol page and (if there was any sudden interest in it) to the Methanol article, which would be consistent with the 6 examples listed above. As a sideline, why aren't there any warnings of the deadliness of methanol, which is soooooo poisonous that it takes 10 mL of it to blind a person, and 30 mL to kill. Sounds pretty notable by the above standards, so let's list all of the symptoms in the antifreeze article, too. Or not. That would be borderline absurd, since the ethylene glycol lobby dictates that ethylene glycol is synonymous with Antifreeze.

Another absurd corollary would be to go to the Thermal insulation page and discuss how poisonous Asbestos is. I mean, all insulation is asbestos, right?

To summarize, this argument is about the scope of Antifreeze. I don't think this scope encompasses the symptoms of poisoning (from a particular type of antifreeze) which happen to be so difficult to spot that they deserve the full attention available at the Good Article named Ethylene glycol poisoning where all of the nuances of medical research and diagnosis can be discussed at length.   

 So fix the misconception, don't just blank an entire section.  

 Most antifreeze is still ethylene glycol. It's hardly an obscure risk.     

No one is or has stated that """"ethylene glycol is a synonym for antifreeze."""" And the misconception that """"all antifreeze is ethylene gylcol"""" can also be mentioned in the aforementioned section, although I have not read anyone in the discussions about this on this talk page express any misconception (especially since you've expressd such concerns before). Somehow, you are completely missing the point about why you are wrong to repeatedly remove this information. The point is that ethylene glycol poisoning, which is a part of this article, causes these symtoms; and therefore, there should be an appropriate summary of these symptoms, per WP:Summary style, before pointing readers to the article about it. It is not """"extraneous information."""" So once again, I will contact WP:MED to comment here on this issue. In the meantime, this information stays per the WP:Consensus against your repeated removal of it. 134.255.247.88

i would suggest to remove the passage about the mode of action of deet.this is speculaton and not proven. based on the NOR guidelines i cant say its wrong, but my data suggest that it might be not correct (blood substitute with ATP as sole attractant is also 'protected' by DEET (while there is no lactic acid...).   

Removed the """"natural alternatives"""" or actually added a question mark. Added refs to show that these """"alternatives"""" do not work. Also removed various distinctions between """"natural"""" and """"synthetic"""". There is no difference between a molecule synthesised chemically and naturally. Last: DEET is a repellant, NOT an insecticide.  

Made new page on DEET, using material gleaned largely from the CDC and EPA pages, and a couple of studies on health effects and insect-repellant effectiveness (from Google).  Although a bunch of the pages say one should be careful only to wear DEET when necessary, not under clothing, etc., they don't spell out why they're concerned.  I'm guessing DEET is chemically nasty (is it an organo-phosphate?), and so may have carcinogenic or other unfortunate properties.  If someone knows (and ideally can show) what these suspected effects might be, I think a short (hopefully rational) addition to the DEET page is called for.   15:03, 20 Oct 2003 (UTC)

What was Charlie Coll's contribution? Some Canadians think he invented the stuff.  22:13, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Is it a poison? If so, what is the LD_50? Is it liquid or a gas or solid (at room temp and standard conditions)? Thanks.  

As mentioned in the article, its effect on the human body is not yet fully understood; it's ?gay? (eh? - Ed) and not an organophosphate (as seen from the chemical formula image) but the effect seen with leeches provides a clue as to what might happen if enough of it entered the body. The effect on leeches is added from my own experience, using a concentrated DEET stick (like a deodorant applicator) and only needing to touch the leech for it to convulse off. It's a liquid at rtp, as far as I can tell.  10:10, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
Be careful adding from your own experience. That basically violates the Wikipedia:No original research policy. But that's simple to avoid, since if you've seen the effect, most likely someone else has. Wikipedia needs to be a secondary source, citing other published sources. So find a published source that finds the same thing, and the addition would be much better. Also it is liquid, as long as the repellant product bottles that say they are 100% deet really are. Also, just eyeballing from it's structure, liquid looks about right. I read a bunch of studies on DEET, and they all basically say it is safe as far as they can tell, but avoid overexposure as much as possible. A very small percentage of the time, some people (12 if I recall the study correctly, out of a large population) have a reaction to DEET. Basically the 60 years it has been used and the large amount of usage is strong evidence that at least the stuff is not really really nasty. So the article looks pretty accurate in that respect. -  Talk 12:00, Jun 13, 2005 (UTC)
Whoops, didn't know about that. Thanks. I'll leave it in for the moment and will try to remember to do backup research when I get home; if anyone believes that the information is unreliable enough please feel free to mark it out, and I'll just have to find a better source than word of mouth from my parents at the time ;)
Later: Researched. Found a fair bit of anecdotal evidence but not enough hard evidence to keep my previous addition in. Also a 1998 study shows DEET may actually accelerate absorption through the skin, so going to revert the edit. Putting in a link with lots of detail I found to make myself feel better ;)  16:38, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

 Choosing an easement curve 

I'd like to be clear about:
(a) which curves are actually used in practice ...
(b) in the various railways administrations; not just North American but also others, e.g. Australian, European, Indian etc.  (This would help with NPOV.)

My main concern is with (a).  Although the article mostly discusses Euler spirals, it seems to give the impression that's the only curve used, under varying names.  However, consider this quotation (from the AREMA reference in the article):
There are several different types of mathematical spirals available for use, including the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate.  Of more common use on railways are the Searles, the Talbot and the AREMA 10-Chord spirals, which are empirical approximations of true spirals.
This reference is, of course, discussing common use on American railways; but even in this limited context, it appears there are at least three ideal mathematical spiral forms involved: """"the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate"""", along with various practical approximations to them.

The article would ideally give the history of the use and adaptation of these various spiral forms.  Doing so would provide a solid illustration of how technological innovation was both necessitated and encouraged by the Age of Rail - a valuable insight into the social impact of rail.

I'm guessing that the AREMA reference probably continues on from the quote above to give some further detail about those approximations, their inventors and their history; but it may not.  In any case, can anybody provide suitable references to help flesh out this story?

 Hu12 administrator apparent libel and abuse 

Hello, this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for Mount Hood, done by administrator Hu12.  Toward the bottom at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mount_Hood#Climbing_Records

Hu12's post:
After going through the """"google results"""" (a disturbing education of sorts), there appears to be a long line of aliases for Dan Howitt, posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related.

Yep, this is going to end with at least a partial ban off the site.  After reading Wikipedia:Banning Policy, it now appears that the minimum which may avoid a full-site ban (which I'll address in a second) is at least one WP:TBAN for all professional wrestling posts (with a second WP:TBAN for college football soon to follow) under the """"Community"""" rules stated therein, and at least two WP:IBANs against both Ruth-2013 and ChristianandJericho (or however he spells it).

And that's the minimum...  Quoting from the Banning Policy page:

The measure of a site ban is that even if the editor were to make good edits, permitting them to re-join the community poses enough risk of disruption, issues, or harm, that they may not edit at all, even if the edits seem good.

And that's basically where I fear we are.  I will not be accepted by the consensus.  I knew that going in, and my experience here indicates that I am right in that regard.  Since the consensus holds absolute power (including the power to ban), I'm afraid that's where this is going to end up.  As I said, it's your decision going forward.    """,0

 Dear Mr. Jim Handerson, please read the 09:58 16 July 2012 fightingagainstlies edition of the article. You will understand that what I am mentioned. 

Oktay Sinanoğlu (born on August 2, 1934 in Bari, Italy) is a Turkish scientist specializing in theoretical chemistry and molecular biology. In his autobiographical book which titled """"The Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book""""[1] he describes himself as: """"A person who was the world's youngest professor in the last 300 years,""""[2] """"at the peak of the science in the U.S.A.,""""[3] """"a man who reached the level to say, """"I'm God"""" in science,""""[4] """"the Lord of the U.S.A.,""""[5] and """"The Turkish Einstein.""""[6]

Childhood and High School Years (1934-1953)

Sinanoğlu was born on August 2, 1934 in Bari, Italy, where his father (Nüzhet Haşim Sinanoğlu) served as a consul general. In 1939 - at the beginning of World War II - the family returned to Turkey. He graduated high school in Turkey in the year 1953. This high school's name was """"Ankara Maarif College"""" since 1951.[7] The courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology in this school had been given by English teachers in the English language since 1949.[8][9] Sinanoglu learned the English language very well in this high school.

Serving American Military Intelligence at the age of 18

In his autobiographical book entitled """"Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book,"""" which was published in Turkey in the Turkish language (first printing in October 2001 and 70. printing in April 2011, a bestseller: 150,000 copies), he stated that, in the summer holiday 1952-1953, he applied to the JAMMAT """"Joint American Military Mission for Aid to Turkey"""" (renamed JUSMMAT in 1958)[10][11][12] to get a job as a translator. His application was accepted by the U.S. Army Staff in Ankara, and he was sent on duty to Erzurum as translator for Secret G2 Military Intelligence Agents Sergeant Kowalski and Sergeant Peterson.[13] After graduating high school in 1953, a scholarship was given to him by the Fulbright Program to study chemistry in the United States.[14] According to the agreement, students were elected by the U.S. Education Commission in Turkey, but funding of the scholarship was provided by the government of Turkey, because Turkish students will return after graduation in the U.S.A to become teachers in Turkey. Sinanoglu was sent with this expectation to the U.S.A.

A University Student in the U.S.A. (1953-1960)

He arrived in New York on September 25, 1953.[15] According to his autobiographical book mentioned above, he stayed one year in Missouri [clarification needed], after which he went to California and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956, with highest honors in chemical engineering. Afterwards, in eight months, he earned a Master's degree with highest honors from MIT (1957); and after this, in two years, he finished his doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley (1959).[16] Subsequently, he finished a one-year postdoctoral research appointment at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California Berkeley (1959-1960).[17] So, his pupilage ended in 1960.

Violating Scholarship Agreement and Military Service Obligation to Live in the U.S.A.

According to the 1953 scholarship agreement, after graduation, Sinanoglu was obligated to return to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students.[18] Sinanoglu stated in his autobiographical book that: """"Returning to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students in the English language was worse than death, a horrible and dishonorable thing. İnstead of this, to stay in the U.S.A. and to teach chemistry to American students in the English language was a more honorable thing. I swore that: I will not return to Turkey; I will stay in the U.S.A and I will be a chemistry teacher in American universities.”[19] So Sinanoglu violated the 1953 scholarship agreement and did not return to Turkey. But there was a second problem: According to the military service obligation laws of his country, after finishing his studies in 1960, Sinanoglu was to return to Turkey to fulfill an 18-month military service obligation. The penalty for violating the scholarship agreement was a fine: the payment of a sum of money. But the penalty for violating one's military service obligation was the cancellation of one's passport and visa; this penalty could not be paid by money in those years (1960s). He stated in his autobiographical book: """"Theoretical Physicist Feza Gursey wrote a letter to me inviting me to the Middle East Technical University which was being established in Ankara, Turkey. But I couldn't return to Turkey because of the military service obligation. If I went to Turkey, I would be a soldier for 2-2,5 years.""""[20] An easy way to stay in the U.S.A. was to marry and father a child in that country.

 Raise the Titanic 

Look you obviously have a very thin skin and also an inability to write clearly and concisely in English. So >with a sigh< I have to take your hand and walk you through the facts:
you quote the opinions of just one screenwriter yet there were 17 other writers. Consider WP:UNDUE
you also insist on saying that they didn't ask for a credit for the film. Well so what? There were 17 people who also wanted a credit and in the end only one got it: Adam Kennedy. WP:SPADE
you use three sentences when I wrote it up in one. Do you know what a tautology is?

You want to keep this:
Novelist Larry McMurtry - who disliked Cussler's novel considering it """"less a novel than a manual on how to raise a very large boat from deep beneath the sea"""" - claims that he was one of approximately 17 writers who worked on the screenplay..

Then there is this:
Novelist Larry McMurtry, who was one of 17 screenwriter who offered to work on the screenplay, disliked Cussler's novel. He considered it """"less a novel than a manual on how to raise a very large boat from deep beneath the sea"""".

He doesn't claim anything, he was a writer on the project!

Let Define what is WP:COI and who falls under this tag

For starters, the Education section, in the form that BenBurch is pushing is WP:POV as well as WP:GRAPEVINE and is clearly hearsay and with any read of the cites,
will show this section is just unsubstantiated campaign rhetoric out of the Duckworth campaign brain trust. A brief read of the """"ZORN"""" cite will show that to be the case to any honest review of them.

NOW to the charge of WP:COI... I will cite the first principle which the the gang of that

""""...Pointing out an editor's relevant conflict of interest is not a personal attack."""" WP:PA

So, to point out a clear and demonstrable political conflict of interest is not a personal attack on an editor and or admin.

With all the nice stuff ben spews on the DU site, I don't want a guy like this writing a """"NPOV"""" article about a Republican office holder with such views.
