I tried to have a discussion about it with him on his talk page (he basically ignored me)... at which time I noticed on his user page he had a great deal of  anti-Greek Macedonian sentiment (and I still stick by that claim) When I asked him to remove a specific offensive link (that lead to an external page showing half of Greece under FYROM contro)... instead he called up an admin buddy to harass me with claims of """"trolling"""".  (oh irony of ironies)

But to be fair... can you please point me where specifically you think I called """"a whole bunch of people a whole bunch of nasty names""""? The only time I can recall reacted with any hostility to anyone was when accused of """"trolling"""" out of the blue (and I accused them of bias back)... and someone called me a """"racist"""" for stating the that there are 2.5 ethnic-Greek Macedonians (which I also responded in like for denying their existence). Again... do these 2.5 million Macedonians no longer exist? Does that seem consistent with their human rights? 

And getting back to the original query... is it considered professional for a Wikipedia admin to name call and threaten banning users without even reviewing the other POV? And if not...where would I register a complaint?

Thanks again Andrew. (I'd read the reply but won't bother you again as I've taken up enough of your time) I just wish to add... this isn't a minor matter here. If Macedonians are denied their own recognition... this very issue could very well lead to the next war in the Baltics.

I enjoy lacrosse and I am interested in UNC lacrosse history and all the cool facts too. You guys have a lot of facts, achievements, names, tournaments and events ,etc. It has been stated already, but just make sure to really sort those things out into categories or sections to make the viewer more satisfied to what they are looking at and reading. It's more of just a blob of information being thrown at me with cool facts thrown in. You can separate the tournaments like """"ACCs"""" and """"NCAAs"""" and then list what happened or what awards were accepted. Also, maybe you could start off with where lacrosse started or came from, or just highlight the word lacrosse with a reference. Then perhaps inform the reader a bit about the history of UNC lacrosse. Could also have a section of UNC's present lacrosse team and their status to really keep the reader up to date with UNC lacrosse. Otherwise, keep finding more stories and information about UNC lacrosse and be sure to organize and really make it flow all together. In addition to that, don't forget to reference your sources at the bottom and after information you have found along with access dates and names, etc. Keep it up and it will all come together great I'm sure.

"""No Mention of Deir Yassin? ==

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_Yassin_massacre

Perhaps this massacre should be mentioned in the history section, as it is 1) a particularly dramatic episode in Israeli history, and 2) the event that triggered Menachem Begin's frightening quote """"As at Deir Yassin, so everywhere"""". It would also help lend credibility to this article, which, as another user pointed out, is basically a pro-Israeli sales-pitch that glazes over descriptions of injustices in favour of terminology that distances itself from real events. Not that the Palestinians haven't committed their fair share of atrocities, either, but healthy representations of both groups' histories would be nice.

Not to bate charges of anti-semitism (or make conjectural accusations), but there is a problem with pages like this on Wikipedia, too (including Americans), as the Jewish population is inevitably better-represented than groups that don't per capita possess so many of the characteristic prescribed by Wikipedia as being typical of its user base, including higher income levels, literacy, access to technology, etc. These conditions, unfortunately, are condusive to incidents of systemic bias - how many Palestinians are frequent Wikipedians? Moreover, many Jews are highly politicized (though diversely), and very culturally involved, which suggests it's possible that systemically biased political and cultural views could be adversely effecting Wikipedia's objectivity.

"NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL FROM WIKIPEDIA 

I am writing this message to you as a notice of my withdrawal from Wikipedia following the recent events/edits on the CNN and Susan Roesgen pages – events that you were involved in.  Never in all of my years in academia (the better part of a decade) have I been privy to such patently-insincere and downright academically-fraudulent work as that which I have encountered on Wikipedia.
While I was initially willing to set aside all of the negative things I had heard about Wikipedia in an effort to contribute to a seemingly beneficial project, the actions of editors and administrators on the  Susan Roesgen and CNN pages has made it eminently clear that “scholarship” and Wikipedia truly are mutually exclusive – propaganda has carried the day.
My failure to grace the project with some actual academically-sound work was not made in vain, however; with every neutral editor that you drive out of the project with your blatantly POV-pushing agenda, you further bolster your reputation as nothing but an unreliable propaganda board. Your reputation for unreliability was perhaps best captured in a recent statement made by my corporations professor: “I decided to make myself more ignorant on the topic by looking at the article (Dodge v. Ford Motor Company) on Wikipedia.”
I strongly encourage you to alter your course, set aside your agenda, and reverse your – and Wikipedia’s – reputation as a laughing stock. This will not only benefit the public in general, but will, I submit, actually make you feel better about yourself. Best, J.M.",0

PNRS, human. PNRS, human. PNRS>human. The only problem is that your analogy at this point no longer correlates to the real-world thing it was supposed to analogize. It isn't that we have detected PNRS's twice and found they were generated by humans, therefore the third PNRS we detect is probably human. Rather, the real world knowledge that we have around how life developed on Earth would describe an analogy that says we detected several PNRS's, and they all turned out to be generated by natural phenomenon. Somewhere in the ID article, it says that ID is not meant to replace (insert laundry list of evolutionary bits and pieces), and that those bits and pieces have already been shown scientifically to be part of a natural process. Those are PNRS's that were proven to be generated by an odd arrangement of pulsars, not alien lifeforms. The flagella on bacteria is just another PNRS in this analogy. And while we may not scientifically be able to explain them yet, we have several other complex PNRS's that we know were created naturally, so rather than leap to the conclusion that """"a designer created flagella"""", science says """"no further information known"""". There's a concept that feels like you aren't grasping here: science is patient in the face of an unknown. science deals with the unknown all the time. But just because something is unknown doesn't mean science finds it neccessary to leap to a conclusion or redefine itself. natural science has defined itself as empirical, observable, repeatable knowledge. And that's worked pretty good for the last couple of centuries, even though when the first natural scientists came about, they knew practically nothing, and everything was unknown from a rigorous, scientific point of view. If one were to look at ID from a purely scientific point of view and ignore all the political intent, ID is so impatient """"to know"""" that it discards centuries of scientific practices to find some answer based on subjective measures like """"legitimate possibility"""" or """"probable explanation"""". Science is far too patient to give up so quickly in the face of an unknown natural phenomenon.  """,0

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Help:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase.

Even if we do merge analog stick into joystick, merging articles about specific controllers is barely even related. I think you are simply trying to make a point about the slippery slope, but such an article does exist: Gamepad. However, it is a sort of overview article which covers the general topic of gamepads, while some of the more important ones (or simply ones which have a lot of info about them) rightly so also have articles of their own, such as the ones you mentioned. Actually, looking at the articles has got me thinking; this is a very similar case. Analog stick can easily retain it's own article while having a significant mention in the joystick article (similar to the DualShock having a mention in the gamepad article, which likewise has a mention in the even more overarching game controller article). It has also made me think, """"wait a minute, the joystick article is about joystick controllers, NOT JOYSTICKS"""" if you see my distinction. The analog thumbstick can be seen as a type of input, while the things referred to in the joystick article are types of controller based around a joystick design.

 Hong Kong Skyline Restitch - Dec 2007.jpg

I would like to use your photo in a library guide for an undergraduate class, taught this winter at the University of Toronto - Scarborough campus. As per your Creative Commons license, I would identify you as the photographer in the alt and title tags, and the photo itself would be a link back to the Wiki Commons page where I found your photo (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hong_Kong_Skyline_Restitch_-_Dec_2007.jpg) or to a page of your choosing.

My apology if you find a personal attack in my more recent comment above. I have re-read it and can still find none. You """"argue that we should make the definition of polygon consistent with what the lay public is likely to encounter and study"""", while I believe that """"the elementary logic of physical objects is best used in the introductory lead"""". That looks like agreement to me. Where we seem to differ is that you regard this as calling for a Euclidean mathematical definition, while I do not believe that the lay person has sufficient mathematical appreciation for that to be appropriate to the article lead.
As to the actual content, the lead grew historically as a result of several contributors thrashing out our differing approaches. What emerged should not be treated lightly, or substantially edited without prior agreement. I am happy to discuss the rest of your  proposal, and no doubt others will chip in to help reach a consensus. I did restore a little of what you wrote, but in the mean time let us not play ping-pong with the page itself.
On the matter of references, Regular polytopes and Convex polytopes are widely-read works which can hardly be described as specialised: they are indeed precisely what this lay person encountered and studied. Some others which I referenced are original sources - which, out of respect to you as a professional mathematician, I would not pull away from drawing to your attention. Others do move beyond a Euclidean treatment, and were there simply to make the point which begins the subsequent paragraph.
More directly relevant is the issue that most lay people would regard a pentagram as a """"star polygon"""", recognised as such since the days of Archimedes but excluded by the definition you gave, which is more formally understood as a """"simple polygon"""". While mathematicians such as Grünbaum and yourself might choose to frequently omit descriptors such as """"simple"""" or """"convex"""" in treatments of these objects (Grünbaum explicitly, yourself implicitly), a general introduction to the subject can take no such luxury. The article lead should conform as far as is possible to the lay person's preconceptions, whereby polygons may be divided into those which self-intersect and those which do not.
With that proviso, if you have ideas for significant changes to the article lead, I would hope you can share them with us  first. — Cheers,  (Talk) 20:34""",0

For the novels The Hawkline Monster, Willard and His Bowling Trophies, Sombrero Fallout, and Dreaming of Babylon, I don't like when someone else changes what I have written. They create that thing on the right hand side of the novel pages about more information, I don't like that. Especially since there is no pictures on top it makes the article look bad.

Found it (capacity to conduct foreign relations). But it's not the """"problem"""" criteria for SoP - for SoP the problem criteria is the control of populated territory (e.g. ability of the SoP government to enforce SoP laws there). For example on p10/11 of the source: """"has a government...have a legislative body...have a judicary...have an executive, which carries out the laws and has at its disposal a considerable force responsive to its will."""" - in the case of SoP the territory it claims (regardless of undefined borders) is under Israel occupation/control. All other criteria are more or less satisfied - PLO-EC is SoP provisional government in exile, SoP has established diplomatic relations with many other states, SoP has diplomatic recognition by many other states, SoP accepts the membership obligations and has submitted membership application. The rest of the criteria depend on the judgment of UNSC and UNGA - whether SoP is """"peace loving"""", whether SoP is """"able and willing"""" to carry out the membership obligations. Even if it's deemed """"peace loving and willing to carry out the obligations"""" the """"problem"""" criteria is whether it's """"really a state"""" (because it doesn't have control over populated territory) and the related whether it's """"able to carry out the obligations"""" (because a state needs control over populated territory, otherwise it functions only in the diplomatic realm as a government-in-exile and doesn't have the ability to do anything on the ground). Of course, if the majority of all UNSC permanent members and 2/3rds of the UN members want - for political reasons - they can grant membership to a GiE (turn a blind eye to the lack of territorial control or resort to some reasoning that it's able to comply and only the foreign occupation prevents it, but that occupation is declared illegal by this and that UNSC and ICJ acts, so they won't take it into account, etc.)

The above paragraph illustrates that the axis to this entire debate is your misunderstanding of WP:SELF. More specifically: your mistaken definition of """"reference"""".

You, however, choose to define """"reference"""" very liberally, and take it to mean that Wikipedia should never include anything about Wikipedia, which of course is silly.

Sir,

It has come to my attention that despite taking advantage of our first-rate American education facilities, you insist upon identifying as a Bangladeshi.

My parents are/were Bangladeshis, and they were amongst the most wretched people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing; Indeed, during this unfortunate period of my life that I have been forced to spend in Bangladesh due to my father, I am now convinced that Bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist. (I use are/were because, I regret to say, my mother was struck dead by Bangladesh - and despite her dysfunctional state and pathological lying, I mourn her loss greatly.)

Never have I felt more love for my country than now, when I find myself forced away from it! I have now given my loyalty, heart and soul, to the United States of America: The greatest country in the world, God bless every inch of it.

But after my experiences with Bangladeshis, I cannot allow for one such as yourself to leech off of the United States while offering nothing in return. I implore you to either renounce Bangladesh and enjoy the remainder of your life in the blessed free world, or get the fuck out of my country, you filthy ape.

Sincerely yours,

A proud AMERICAN",1

"the “40,000 protesters” myth 

I understand that some members have a politically motivated desire to make the 2010 election look as sinister and anti-democratic  as possible, but you have to get the facts straight about these four sources on “40,000 protesters”.1. This one shouldn't be considered altogether. It is a UNHCR page quoting instead of a reliable news source a Washington-based “foundation” whose purpose is: “to inform and educate policy makers and the broader policy community about events and trends in those societies which are strategically or tactically important to the United States and which frequently restrict access to such information.” . It is a politically biased organization, not an independent news source. So, out with it!2. These two ,  are respectively the Voice of America and MSNBC (not MSNBC really but a direct quote from Bloomberg here). So in reality it is VoA and Bloomberg. Well, let me inform you that we are talking about the same guy - his name is James Brooke, as anyone can plainly see since 2006 he has been stationed in Moscow to report for Bloomberg and as of last summer for the VoA as well. Leaving aside the fact that the VoA is more of a propaganda tool fully owned by US government rather than an independent news source, let's see how Mr. Brooke came about this magic number - “40,000”. Apparently he was there, but did he count the demonstrators himself? No, he quotes Associated Press: “Within an hour, the Associated Press was estimating the turnout at 40,000.”!  Well, it wasn't. Anyone can see the number of AP and that number is 10,000. A little white lie, Mr. Brooke. Or maybe I'm too harsh, maybe AP did broadcast that number intially, but then seeing how preposterous it was quickly brought it down to what all the other major media guys were reporting. In any event, this “40,000 people” thing doesn't hold water.3. Basically the same goes for CBC as well. As I already said in one of the comments not only CBC didn't have its own staff in Minsk that night (I checked this myself here in Toronto with CBC Headquarters), anyone can see how heavily in that article it relied on other media: “Reuters reported...The Associated Press reported...”. As we know already from these ,  quotes both Reuters and Associated Press mentioned 10,000 protesters each.
Given all the above I'm removing the “40,000 people” part from the article.",0

Reckless, the policy and guideline were both updated last year to move away from the era of small screens and slow downloads; this was around the time en.WP sucessfully pushed the Foundation techs to move the whole 300 projects, gradually, from 180px to 220px default thumbnail size: great!). In fact, for readers with slow connections it's often better to have a larger display in an article, so they are less likely to need to double-click on the original; originals are often huge and take much longer to download. I am generalising here, and individual cases need to be judged on their merits. BTW, I encourage all editors to arrange and size images WRT narrow-to-wide window widths and font sizes/skins, etc. Just move your window through from narrow to wide to see what a difference it makes in the way text and pics interact. For this reason, left-side placements need to be treated with caution when there are right-side pics in the same section. Also, I recommend squashing all of the syntaxes for pics in a section right at the top, unless there's a reason not to.  (talk) """,0

So I will start with a criticism of the quote from Ollier and Pain, with whom I have more general issues than the """"postorogenic part"""". Phrase by phrase that I disagree with:
 Only much later was it realized that the two processes [deformation and the creation of topography] were mostly not closely related, either in origin or in time. Very wrong. Deformation causes topography, and the generation of topography is synchronous with deformation. I will email you a copy of Dahlen and Suppe (1988), which shows that this is the case - send me a message so I have your address and can attach a PDF. They tackle the large-scale deformation of sedimentary rocks via folding and thrusting during orogenesis.
 ...fold-belt mountainous areas...: """"fold-belt"""" isn't used professionally (AFAIK) to refer to a collisional mountain-building event. A minor thing though.
 Only in the very youngest, late Cenozoic mountains is there any evident causal relation between rock structure and surface landscape. and the following sentence: If I were British, I would call this """"utter twaddle"""". As I mentioned above, there is no way for many of the exposed structures to get to the surface without large amounts of rock uplift and erosion. And as a matter of fact, the trajectory of different units of rock through an orogen is in part determined by patterns of surface erosion. To keep it simple and send you one paper, you'll find this in and at the end of the paper by Dahlen and Suppe (1988).

Hello Alex, I would like to ask you very politely why you have deleted my passage on Lionel Messi regarding his 'playing style.' With all due respect it is very hard to find evidence of words depicting his playing style whereas the passage I have written clearly shows Messi's ability as any other person with football knowledge would agree. I don't think that there is any evidence apart from video evidence to confirm what I wrote about Messi.
For example passages such as 'he has exceptional dribbling ability, fantastic technique, he likes to cut inside onto his stronger left foot' are clear, direct observations of Messi's playing style for some years. This is confusing for me as of why you had deleted my post as some other users send me a message saying how that it was very helpful and detailed. Also, concerning the evidence problem, would you please kindly replace the passage I wrote because it is not a biased passage and clearly reflects Messi's playing style, I have also used what other commentators have frequently said and if you have ever watched a match with Messi weaving his magic you will know and surely agree along with the millions who watch him that this is a very descriptive, accurate passage about his playing style.
I am very hurt by your edit and deletion and I would ask you to kindly replace this text as it took me a very long time to write. If not, please tell me why or let me speak to someone else who could advise me or who would think I am justified

If it was always called Olzstyn in Polish, I stand corrected. I was perhaps confusing it with Ketrzyn, formerly Ranstenburg. (Is this a transliteration into Polish of Allenstein, as Frombork is a transliteration of Frauenburg?)

However, before 1945  the town was known to non-Poles as Allenstein, as a glance at any contemporary travel guide will attest. Witness also the League of Nations plebiscite in southern East Prussia, which as shorthand was referred to as """"the Allenstein district"""" (Cf. Churchill's memoirs). The plebiscite there in 1920 produced 97.8 percent (362,209 votes) for Germany and 2.2 percent (7,980 votes) for Poland.10  These are facts, widely reported at the time and cited in countless historical accounts since then.

By the way, it would be interesting to know what happened to the Masurians who used to live there.

No, sir, this comment is disgusting.  You offer not one scintilla of evidence for the claims you make, nor do you site one example of factual error in the article.  All you have to offer are your recycled opinions about the Irish Republican movement.  You have nothing new, or even interesting, to say.  I always love it when armchair opponents of the I.R.A. jump up on their high horse and begin pontificating, because, almost without exception, they say something like this: """"Whatever the crimes of the British government..."""", as though it is reasonable and proper to dismiss 800 years of oppression, murder, starvation, and constant meddling on the part of the Brits so that one may then attack the excesses of the Republicans, who have been fighting to kick the Brits out.  Let's see, 800 years of oppression on the part of the Brits, vs. the just over 80 years that the I.R.A. has existed, and you, in all of your wisdom decide that the 'R.A. is worse.

"""== Liquid Fire ==

Daria Huerta invented Liquid Fire. The term """"liquid fire"""" was created in 1960 and the product was invented in 1940. Liquid fire helps burn off blemishes such as warts, boils, and blisters. It is used in many dermatologists around the world. It was also used in construction work to help get rid of walls. They would rub the liquid fire on the wall and let it burn the wall down. Daria Huerta was one of the world's most smartest women of her time. She also created common things such as the coffee cup, pillow, and the sink. The product went into stores in 1961. It was sold at stores like Walmart, CVS, Wallgreens, and Pharmacies all over the world. It was originally called """"Fire in the Water"""" then they started calling it what it truly is """"Liquid Water"""". Liquid water sold for $10.00 per box. Each box contains 7 15x10 jars full of Liquid Fire. Daria Huerta created the Cark. She was playing around with genes from a shark and a cat one day. A year later she created a mutated creature. It was half shark, half cat. She then released it into the wild in 1990. The Cark started destroying the whole ecosystem. They had to destroy the Cark which took about 5 years. In 1995 she then decided it was time for her to quit science so she became a seamstress. She was playing around with yarn and discovered a thin piece that had ripped off which she then used to clean her teeth. This was called floss. In 2000 she created flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and wintermint. Huerta died in 2001.
The Picture Below is the ONLY Picture of the original Cark:

 crosstheTs is back 

Futper, as promised, I've been working on a precise report on your editing habits (and have assembled a long record of diffs that seem to show you almost without fail push FYROM positions (highly improbable if you had a NPOV on the issue) I have also been reading up on Wikipedia's Administrator_Code_of_Conduct.

""""Admins are entrusted with additional abilities, but do not have special rights beyond those of regular editors. Like everybody else, admins are expected to behave in a civil manner.

Admins should also be aware that warning a user of a block, especially when the user has no prior history of problems, can be perceived as a threat. When dealing with otherwise good contributors, it may be advisable to make suggestions to their behavior without mentioning a block.

Reflecting on those words... I don't believe some of your intial words to me (which included ad hominem attacks me and threats to block me remotely match those standards).

""""Every sane person with normal adult intelligence can see that your allegations against B.F. are nonsensical. If you can't see that yourself, it's probably no use me trying to explain it to you. I will simply block you if you continue with this topic, for being either a malicious troll or too clueless for rational discussion""""

Also... I don't believe it was appropriate after I had made the initial anon complaint about you for you to block me (if you felt it was necessary it should have been left in the hands of another admin). The Wikipedia admin code of conduct clearly states this about admin conflicts of interests.

""""An admin should not block a user if they are not neutral with respect to that user, or have a conflict of interest""""

The reason why I'm asking is because I realize we both have strong POV on FYROM issues and that we got off on the wrong foot because of it. While I am preparing to push forward with a precisely itemized complaint against you (which I believe clearly shows inappropriate behavior towards me) I really don't want to go about this the long nasty way (which was why as a newb my complaint was anon until Beam started to unilaterally campaign to block me and reveal details) 

I would much prefer to save both our time by letting the matter drop but that would require your participation and assurance you will never again try to leverage your admin status as a tool to personally threaten me again. (surely others admins can handle it if it seems very necessarily to them) 

So what I really am asking here is are you willing to press the polite reset button and just stick to arguing points?   """,0

Fair use rationale for Image:Chyr.jpg

Thanks for uploading Image:Chyr.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you. (talk • contribs • ) 
Unspecified source for Image:Chyr.jpg

Thanks for uploading Image:Chyr.jpg. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.

As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Fair use, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use. See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following [ this link]. Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If the image is copyrighted under a non-free license (per Wikipedia:Fair use) then the image will be deleted 48 hours after .

:East Jerusalem usually refers to the parts of the city outside the walls of the Old City that were under Jordanian rule between 1948 and 1967. The population of East Jerusalem is mostly Arab.

As a cook I often need to find recipes and their closely related variations in the same way a lawyer or doctor may need to find cases and their variations. 

In the past I resolved this need by asking the computer questions by means of submitting keywords. Today the method I use is quite different.

Today I find recipes and their variations by query - not by my query of the computer but by the computer's query of me. 

What makes this better is the time I save repeating keyword submissions  to refine responses and find the answer I need.

What makes this possible is the computers ability to minimize the number of questions it must ask.

"Legally, there are no rules which state any geographical or political requirements which a state has to meet in order to join the Schengen area (there are such criteria for joining the EU, but this is a different matter).

The associated state would only have the right to be consulted. Thus, the U.S. would have to accept each and every majority (!) decision taken in Brussels whether citizens of this or that country would need a visa for entry into the area or not. And the U.S. would have to accept that every third-country national holding a residence title of a Schengen state could enter the U.S. without even being checked.

 Hi David, thanks for your answer. However, I could not find any place on this page where I have """"distorted, selected, or combined evidence to suit my own view"""". I am a scientist in the field of metrology and if you make such a serious accusation you should back it up. I am pretty sure that everything I wrote (in the article) was based on sources.

I know that it is used frequently, but I did not find a definition so far. This lack of definition is the reason why I was against the renaming my article to Kendrick mass and this became the basis of this dispute. Thanks for your help.

It will be very difficult to find an article that is not """"metrology-related"""". This is why I think your ban is much to broad.

"Parentacide 

Parentacide is the term used to describe a child killing one or both parents. Although the subject is as abhorrent as suicide or infantecide, it is a part of our life that cannot be dismissed.

Parentacide dates back to Greek mythology, where Oedipus killed his father Laius and married his mother Jocasta. Frued coined the term Oedipus complex to describe a state of psychosexual development and awareness first occuring at the age of 3 1/2 years.

In 1989 Lyle and Erik Menendez commited parentacide when they murdered both of their parents in cold blood. Although the murders were at least partially motivated by money, the brothers alleged their father had abused them, which was their justification for the killing.

Jeremy Bamber committed parentacide by proxy and was convicted in 1986 of killing his adoptive parents, sister, and her two six year old sons. Although money was thought to be the motive for this killing spree, the fact that he was adopted indicates that the reasons behind the murders were less clear cut. Being adopted, Bamber very likely suffered from adopted child syndrome, which is a psychological maladjustment to the knowledge that his real parents had given him up for adoption.",0

"This is the lead as it currently reads: Lance Edward Armstrong (born Lance Edward Gunderson, September 18, 1971) is an American former professional road racing cyclist and triathlete. He won the Tour de France seven consecutive times (1999-2005) but was stripped of those titles by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and banned from cycling in 2012.

We have basically two things to consider: whether this is factually correct and whether it provides the proper emphasis. I'd say that the first clause of the second sentence is at the very least misleading since 1) there is now a consensus in the world at large that Armstrong did not properly win the Tour de France ever and since 2), as far as official racing he is concerned, he did not win the Tour de France at all. It would be far more accurate to say that Armstrong was once considered to have won the Tour de France seven times. This state of affairs is very unlikely to change. As for emphasis, at this point Armstrong is more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else. As time passes this is bound to  intensify. Since it is now obvious that Armstrong achieved his original fame by cheating and committing fraud, there is no reason he should not be more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else.",0

 Quick Question on Sephardic Jews... 

Hello all... i'm not a jewish person but have a great deal of interest in both Israel & Judaism, and have doubts as to the meaning of """"sephardic jew""""

Wikipedia & other i-net resources have given me the definition most of you will know (from Iberian peninsula, emigrating to the mediteranean region, etc...) but what raised my doubts is something else.

I recently saw a documentary which claimed that Sephardic jews originated from a tribe in a land adjacent to israel (in the north, though i forgot its ancient name). The king/leader of this tribe was deeply impressed with his jewish neighbours and converted himself, as well as all his people, to judaism...

I can find nothing to back this up, and would love any imput you're wishing to provide..

No, Bach's taille was essentially the same as Lully's taille [des hautbois]—a straight, flare-belled tenor oboe in F. As the Wikipedia article plainly states (citing the New Grove article by Michael Finkelman), the cor anglais only came into existence ca. 1720, """"when a bulb bell was added to the oboe da caccia"""". Sibyl Marcuse states that the name did not first start appearing in scores until """"around 1760"""". This name was indeed drawn, according to Finkelman, from an older Germann term for the the flare-belled horns played by angels in paintings of the Middle Ages—doubtless shawms of all sorts—""""engellisches Horn, meaning """"angelic horn"""". There is a distinction to be made (as Finkelman does) between the emergence of the instrument called cor anglais, and the (German) term """"angelic horn"""", loosely applied to shawms/oboes of all sorts. The French word taille (for what it is worth) is cognate with English """"tall"""", and is applied to viols (tenor viola da gamba), violins (tenor violin, or viola). The taille des hautbois'' was known in England as """"tenor hoboy"""", and Purcell scored for it in 1690, a good thirty years before the invention of the cor anglais, and seventy years before the name first appears in musical scores. To claim that it is """"essentially the same"""" as the cor anglais is equivalent to saying the tenor lute is """"essentially the same"""" as a guitar.—  """,0

"Yes, there should be criticism of Schengen.  For Americans and Canadians who want to come and teach English in Schengen countries, the Schengen Agreement is a disaster.  Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and re-entering the country you were teaching in, now you must apply for a work permit, which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians.  Now, because of Schengen, Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English. I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between, say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper 'poste Schengen' visa documentation: they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America.  No sympathy for their situation, no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague, no concern whatsoever: they were treated like criminals breaking the law.  This is the ugly side of Schengen: it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe.  The good old days are gone, replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport.  Many English schools in Prague, for example, are complaining bitterly against Schengen, because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers.  Further: if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen: you only get 30 days to visit Europe...then you must GET OUT: or, you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting.  So, for Europeans Schengen may be nice, but for foreigners it is HORRIBLE.  I hate Schengen, and I hate the EU government in Brussels.  What a bunch of fucking assholes!!! They seem to be trying to copy George BUsh with the creation of Schengen. Fuck you EU government dickheads, we ESL teachers all hate you!!!!!!!  You ruined our jobs, our profession.

"You have not proven anything. If you had, you would have a new consensus to show for it. As we have previously demonstrated, those websites are often publishing content that is unsubstantiated.

Sky Sports might have listed the Sauber seats as TBA, but we had a reliable source that contradicted it, and since that source came direct from the team, it took priority. The list Autosport published included Grosjean before he was announced by Lotus, and gave no reason for the Sauber seats as suddenly changing to TBA.

 Articles for creation/Miriam Battista 

Hi Arctic Kangaroo,

I'm totally puzzled by the reasons you gave for rejecting this article Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation:/Miriam Battista. Miriam Battista is definitely """" 'worthy of notice' – that is, 'significant, interesting, or unusual enough to deserve attention or to be recorded'."""" It's true that her moment of national fame was short, but it was intense, and she continued to be noticed in the press as an adult actress. Also, the fact that she received a news obit (not paid for by the family) in the New York Times should in itself attest to her notability, since the obit was published so many years after her heyday. For comparison, please look at the article for Gladys Hulette. I certainly think that Battista rises to at least the same level of notability.

As far as verifiable references are concerned, I truly thought I had over-referenced if anything! There are references to Charles Donald Fox's book Famous Film Folk, Photoplay, Variety, The New Yorker, the New York Times, the Internet Broadway Database, and Internet Movie Database - are these not considered reliable, verifiable sources? If the problem is that I used too many references to privately held materials, I apologize for that, but I thought that the information they included was interesting and enlightening. I guess that raises a basic question for me: would Wikipedia prefer that information from privately held materials be omitted, even if it sheds light on the subject? If the answer is """"Yes,"""" I'm afraid that Wikipedia is missing out on a gold mine of material.

I had been considering trying to get in touch with Wikipedia editors who are working on WikiProject Biography, as well as those involved in WikiProject Film before submitting this article for review, but as a newbie I wasn't sure how to do that.

I can't quite agree with the philosophy.  I think """"announce on the noticeboards,"""" and then you can talk to people like a normal human with normal conversation on IRC, if you're going to be there anyway.

Wikipedia's rules are suspended there, including keeping a history, open editing, etc.  Therefore, if you announce first on IRC, you have, effectively, not announced at all.  I've tried to avoid taking such a draconian line, but that is the actual line.  In the meantime, knowing that people will say things as soon as they notice them, and, if they're on IRC at the time, they'll say it first there, the biggest thing is that every IRC user needs to know that whatever is said there simply hasn't been said at all, as far as Wikipedia is concerned.

He did do this type of work in civilian life as stated in a newspaper article I have reporting on him and the incident in which he recieved the silver star. From the stories I heard from my father, it sounded like John C Shumate separated from the military, opened a pharmacy and at some point went back into the military.

 Is MSI Ventures """"Active""""? 

James A. Patterson was the Chairman of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., while James W. Reding was CETI's president. CETI changed its name to MSI Ventures and it is no longer qualified to do business in the State of Florida. However, MSI Ventures (also known as Molecular Separations Incorporated) is a Texas corporation and its current status is hidden behind a paywall; unlike Florida, the Texas Secretary of State's corporation records are not freely available to the public.

The article should not assert that CETI is no longer active when in fact it may be listed as """"active"""" by the Texas Secretary of State. CETI (MSI Ventures) may have a multi-million-dollar-per-year contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to dispose of nuclear waste (by passing radioactive waste through Patterson Power Cells) and the children and grandchildren and great grandchildren of James A. Patterson may be receiving generous dividend checks from MSI Ventures. And that may continue as long as they keep their mouths shut and do not challenge the oil oligopoly that keeps us, as George W. Bush has do bluntly stated, """"Addicted to oil"""".

This page was subjected to repeated vandalism in the nature of a hoax.
One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

 Symbolism of resignation date 

It should be noted that Joseph Ratzinger, ex-conscript in (Adolf) Hitler Youth, announced its resignation as Pope Benedict XVI on february 11th 2013, Benedict of Aniane and Adolf of Osnabrück feast dayCaholic online. February fest days http://www.catholic.org/saints/f_day/feb.php. Maybe, this shoud be added in hid biography.   
WP:SYNTH   
Close, but there's no conclusion. Not combining sources, just listing two. Just out of curiousity, NummerSechs, why should this be noted? Is there anything beyond it just being a sort of weird coincidence?  (talk) 02:22, April 4, 2013 (UTC)
Please READ WP:SYNTH which says: Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. Emphasis is mine.   
I get that. But what's the implication? He announced his resignation on February 11, and February 11 was the feast day of saints with loosely-related names, therefore...?  (talk) 06:59, April 4, 2013 (UTC)
Since, I do not agree at all with InedibleHulk & Elizium23's comments, I put also this discussion on their talk page. Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis. Denying that, without arguments better than a lawyer point of view, means a complete ignorance about the essence of Pope's role in catholic world & over other Christian churches. BTW, I'm French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J. Retzinger is German) and I do believe that I have quite an authority to write that, since France is recognized Rome's first daughter.   
we can just say that it happens to be the same day as those feasts and let the readers draw their own conclusions. otherwise it is WP:synth. I do know German quite well, I have taken 3 years of German classes, one year has been college-level.  Aunva6talk - contribs  
It should be noted that February the 11th, Catholic Church also celebrates Notre Dame de Lourdes a.k.a Our Lady of Lourdes (south-west of France). Another (non related ?) coincidence  François-Bernard Michel who co-presides the Lourdes Medical BureauComité Médical International de Lourdes (in french) http://fr.lourdes-france.org/approfondir/guerisons-et-miracles/composition-comite-medical-international-lourdes, presides also the French National Academy of Medicine for the year 2013. He is also member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, he presided twice, at Institut de France, chair XIII, created in 1998.

For example, the officially sanctioned online site of a rock band has a direct and symmetric relationship to that rock band, and thus should be linked from the rock band's Wikipedia article. An alternative site run by fans is not symmetrically related to the rock band, as the rock band has only indirect connections with that site.

 Wikipedia Ambassador update! 

Hi! You're getting this message because you are or have been a Wikipedia Ambassador. A new term is beginning for the United States and Canada Education Programs, and I wanted to give you an update on some important new information if you're interested in continuing your work this term as a Wikipedia Ambassador. 

You may have heard a reference to a transition the education program is going through. This is the last term that the Wikimedia Foundation will directly run the U.S. and Canada programs; beginning in June, a proposed thematic organization is likely to take over organizing the program. You can read more about the proposal here.

Another major change in the program will take effect immediately. Beginning this term, a new MediaWiki education extension will replace all course pages and Ambassador lists. (See Wikipedia:Course pages and Help:Education Program extension for more details.) Included in the extension are online volunteer and campus volunteer user rights, which let you create and edit course pages and sign up as an ambassador for a particular course.

If you would like to continue serving as a Wikipedia Ambassador — even if you do not support a class this term — you must create an ambassador profile. If you're no longer interested in being a Wikipedia Ambassador, you don't need to do anything.

Please do these steps as soon as possible
First, you need the relevant user rights for Online and/or Campus Ambassadors. (If you are an admin, you can grant the rights yourself, for you as well as other ambassadors.) Just post your rights request here, and we'll get you set up as quickly as possible.

Once you've got the ambassador rights, please set up at a Campus and/or Online Ambassador profile. You can do so at:
Special:CampusAmbassadorProfile
Special:OnlineAmbassadorProfile

Going forward, the lists of Ambassadors at Special:CampusAmbassadors and Special:OnlineAmbassadors will be the official roster of who is an active Ambassador. If you would like to be an Ambassador but not ready to serve this term, you can un-check the option in your profile to publicly list it (which will remove your profile from the list).

After that, you can sign on to support courses. The list of courses will be at Special:Courses. (By default, this lists """"Current"""" courses, but you can change the Status filter to """"Planned"""" to see courses for this term that haven't reached their listed start date yet.)

As this is the first term we have used the extension, we know there will be some bugs, and we know the feature set is not as rich as it could be. (A big wave of improvements is already in the pipeline. And if you know MediaWiki and could help with code review, we'd love to have your help!) Please reach out to me (Sage Ross) with any complaints, bug reports, and feature suggestions. The basic features of the extension are documented at Wikipedia:Course pages, and you can see a tutorial for setting up and using them here.

Communication and keeping up to date
In the past, the Education Program has had a pretty fragmented set of communication channels. We're trying to fix that. These are the recommended places to discuss and stay up-to-date on the education program:
 The education noticeboard has become the main on-wiki location for discussion of the Education Program. You can post there about broad education program issues as well as issues with individual courses.
 The Ambassadors Announce email list is a very low-traffic announcements list of important information all Ambassadors need to be aware of. We encourage all Ambassadors (and other interested Wikipedians) to subscribe to the list; follow the instructions on the link to add your email address.
 If you use IRC regularly, or need to try to reach someone immediately, the  IRC channel is the place to find me and fellow Ambassadors.

Ambassador training and resources
We now have an online training for Ambassadors, which is intended to be both an orientation about the Wikipedia Ambassador role for newcomers and the manual for how to do the role. (There are parallel trainings for students and for educators as well.)

Please go through the training if you feel like you need a refresher on how a typical class is supposed to go and where t",0
"""::::::::::::Firstly; outright misrepresenting my comments in an attempt to invalidate my contribution is upsetting to see. This is the not first time you have done so in this area - either that or attacked me (directly or indirectly) in a vaguely uncivil way. Please do not do so again. In terms of engagement; honestly I have tried. I tried to engage with you and your supporters (who I think could equally be seen as a """"noisy"""" minority trying to subvert community process); but just got indirect incivility, bluster and poorly focused ideas (i.e. on """"paid"""", not """"advocacy""""). The discussion so far has spectacularly failed to intelligently engage the core issues or consider the significant areas Wikipedia fails in protecting companies from harm (you FAQ being a case in point; it focuses on the, important, negative aspects of paid advocacy - but doesn't contain any helpful self-criticism). Then I tried to engage the paid advocates, but your Bright Line comments appear to have alienated most of those from being interested in dialogue. So I keep doing my bit on the sidelines addressing actual content issues; it's not glamorous but it at least picks away at the core matter. What upsets me most is that you seem to be casting my viewpoint (that a bright line is impractical and wouldn't change much, that we don't handle issues with company articles well at all, that being paid to write about something doesn't mean you can't ever be objective) as """"ErrantX thinks the community wants paid advocates to be able to advocate on Wikipedia"""". That strongly discourages me from engaging! And what is more when I do, I feel you've struggled to address any of these thoughts. Errant (chat!)

I am failing this article because it has two major issues: referencing and image use. You need references for the comic's censorship, especially, since that is a potentially controversial claim, but also throughout the history section. On image use, we have one free image, which is great, but we also have one non-free image with no rationale, and neither image is being used informatively within the article. Since fixing these issues will require searching out additional sources (usually time-consuming) and possibly substantial rearrangement of the article format, I'm going with a fail rather than a hold.

JSmith/Dmcdevit user conduct RFC draft

This is the illuminating link, beginning with """"Corrigan"""" onwards: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:J.smith/YouTube_Linklist#Corrigan_article_link. The false accusation of NOR, given uncivilly, should be addressed. It was followed by the report I made at NOR (in which he 1) didn't even try to argue that there was a NOR issue after making the accusation 2) did not apologize to the accused user for the false accusation. Along with discussions at EL, it clearly demonstrates that JSmith was aware there 1) was public opposition both to the project and how it was being conducted, and 2) there was public opposition to how complaints regarding valid links were handled/how other editors were mistreated/community editing was disrespected. In spite of this public opposition, the project, how it was conducted, and how editors with objections/community editing were treated continued unchanged.

Let's summarize:

1. there was opposition to project itself/how it was conductedthe project began without consensus, against established policy.
2. there was oppostion to how users with objections regarding valid links were treated/the disruptive effect this had on community editing at numerous articles. (When politely informed *by a copyright holder* that there was no copyright issue at numerous articles, JSmith, Mimsy, Dcmcdevit continued to delete the links about which they were aware there was NO copyvio, not merely links with suspected copyviothat is a separate issue from the fact that the project was established and conducted without community consensus. (Although both are user conduct issues there is no policy dispute. Copyright policy is clear, and they made no attempt to change it/discuss changing it. They cited the EL guideline as standard justification, without consensus, and directly against consensus after it was made clear at EL that no one agreed with a blanket You Tube ban, that links should be evaluated by article editors on a case-by-case basis, via editorial judgement and consensus. The extremely troubling incidents are not the ones in which they deleted suspected copyvios (although there is opposition to that/they do not have consensus and are acting procedurally against both C and EL)the extremely troubling incidents are the ones in which they continued to delete links they KNEW were NOT copyvios,  and how they treated other editors/the community in the process (bullying, false accusations, etcDcmdevit's comments to Argyiou, JSmith's """"NOR"""") and disrupted Wikipedia in violation of WP:POINT.

Listen: there were 350,000 Germans in Vojvodina before the war, and about 250,000 of them left from the region together with the withdrawal German army, before partisans took control of the region. The remaining 100,000 were the subject for persecution. Also, it is not quite correct that those 250,000 fled the partisans, but they fled the Soviet Red Army. Partisans came after Red Army (or together with it at least). Also, it is the main difference between Germans and Jews, since most of the Jews were killed or deported during the war, while most of the Germans escaped before they could became a subject for persecutions. Second thing, during the war, Serbs also were persecuted and thousands of them were held in prison camps or expelled. The only difference between Germans and Serbs here is that Serbs returned to their homes after the war, and Germans did not. So, is that difference a good reason to write here only about persecuted Germans and not about persecuted Serbs too? It is good that you said that the one who want to know who were partisans should to read the """"Partisans"""" article, because the one who want to know more why Germans fled should to read Danube Swabians article. However, the kind of compromise I would accept would be to write that most of the Germans colaborated with German troops during the war, and that this was a reason why partisans persecuted them.

 Neo-Nazis on Wikipedia  

With so much information online, there is a big need for encyclopedias. Wikipedia is not the answer.  Wikipedia has writers and administrators who squash the truth.   They are anti libertarian and they glorify totalitarianism with their Nazi-style behavior.  Wikipedia’s lies are so infamous that it has inspired a nationwide boycott, especially for the apparent Neo-Nazism of some of its more rabid writers.  

Wikipedia writers prevent any mention of the new historical discovery that the USA was the source of the Nazi salute. The USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis), as shown by Dr. Rex Curry.  It was not an ancient Roman salute. Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the """"ancient Roman salute"""" is a myth. A image search on the web for the “original pledge of allegiance” provides additional information.

The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. Additional information is available in web searches for the text """"military salute became the Nazi salute.""""

Francis Bellamy (author of the """"Pledge of Allegiance"""") and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel """"Looking Backward"""") and Charles Bellamy (author of """"A Moment of Madness"""") were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement in the USA, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" and their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party"""" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute. """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. """"  Additional information is available in image or text searches for “swastika secrets.” 

Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas are based on the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not use the word """"swastika,"""" but called their symbol a """"Hakenkreuz.""""  

Recently, one Wikipedia writer became wiser and improved the """"Roman salute"""" article somewhat so that it recognizes and repeats some of Rex Curry's discoveries. Other pledge and salute articles on Wikipedia are as bad as ever.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by phonies who tried to perpetuate myths. Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America."""" Wikipedia liars also used the painting """"The Oath of the Horatii"""" as absurd support for a Roman connection. The foregoing is all incorrect and of course without any attribution nor support on the Wikipedia page because there is no support. It is not a Roman salute.  Yet, Wikipedia regulars allowed the disinformation, including the dates “1787?-1934?” with the question marks included, to remain posted on Wikipedia, while deleting anyone who tried to correct the propaganda.

Similar criticisms apply to the Wikipedia pages on Francis Bellamy, Edward Bellamy and the Pledge of Allegiance.

Wikipedia falsifiers use the misnomer """"public schools"""" when they mean """"government schools"""" and they both cover-up the Bellamys' desire to promote a government takeover of education, a desire to end all of the better alternatives, and to impose socialism (and what the Bellamys called """"military socialism"""") within government schools. The Bellamys loved the military and wanted all of society to ape the military. Those points also help explain why Francis Bellamy enjoyed starting the pledge with a military salute.

Some regular writers on Wikipedia knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of",0

By a show of hands (or comments), does this revision to the article's """"critical reception"""" section smack of POV content removal (WP:VNT), editorializing (WP:WORDS), and undue weight to minority viewpoints (WP:UNDUE)? Oh, and being neutral in form, considering most of the reviews that the album received were """"mixed"""", as verified by Metacritic and The Independent, both of which are cited in the article, yet the editor seems to overlook that (""""using metacritic is lazy""""?), along with a few other reliable third-party sources (GoogleNews' index of sources, The Huffington Post) Dan56 (talk)

 Use as a mascot/nickname? 

The use of the binturong as a mascot and/or nickname for schools and sports teams is relatively dubious.

Ah, good catch, thank you, I was going based on the wording of a Times Union article that called it a State historical marker. If the list is indeed complete, please make the note of that invisible, as my note was. When I put a list article up for FL status is when I learned that we dont put statements like """"This is a list of..."""" or """"This is a complete list of..."""" The preferred way of doing an opening paragraph is to actually have a prose that describes and tells about the list rather than being straight forward about it. One I worked on and am proud of is List of incorporated places in New York's Capital District. Some very recently promoted FL's would be the most up-to-date on style preferences used on lists today- such as List of Oregon state symbols which is nearest in type/topic of list to yours that I know of, a search of other list articles of a similar topic and see what they do may be beneficial to this article and the writing of a prose lead. This is really skimpy and just a summary but reading Wikipedia:Featured list criteria could be beneficial if you havent already, or contacting someone who regularly does FL promotion reviews (I can provide you with some names if you want).
Separate from that, perhaps changing the title of the article to expand its scope to include any historical marker would be something you are interested in doing? A separate list article could always be done to cover them. If you're like me and enjoy researching and learning new things, expanding or making a new article for other types of historical markers could be fun and I for one would be very interested in seeing the work and learning more from the hard work that you've shown you do a good job at.

Why the Prophet Jeremiah should not be censored out of this article 

All the abusive invective in the world doesn't alter the fact that when we consider the Jewish law, the following is relevant:
  
'How can you say, """"We are wise and the law of the LORD is with us when, in fact, the false pen of the scribes has made it into a lie.'      
Jeremiah 8:8, New Revised Standard Version 

It is relevant because:

 Jeremiah is a major Jewish prophet, so his opinion carries weight.
 Jeremiah lived over 2000 years closer to the time when the books of Moses were compiled.

The fact that another contributor is so determined to remove this evidence from the public record demonstrates that the point Jeremiah makes is sensitive. Nevertheless it is also highly relevant to any rational discussion about this aspect of the Jewish law, and for that reason should remain.

If other contributors wish to argue that Jeremiah's comment about scribal ethics is not relevant to Biblical passages about circumcision, they are welcome to demonstrate this. However, censorship is not the way to make this point.""",0

 Murder of a deposed Sheikulislam in 1821/ was this Haci Halil Efendi? 

There is information in some sources about a deposed Sheikhulislam who was travelling in 1821 to Mecca with his family for pilgrimage, it was the time of the Greek war of Independence and their ship was captured by Orthodox Christians of Hydra and everyone on board was killed. The source state that this Sheikhulislam was actually pro-Greek but still got murdered. Unfortunately the name of the Sheikhulislam is not mentioned, is it possible that this person would be Haci Halil?

Has anybody more information about Haci Halil Efendi? The source claims without sources that he was murdered in Constantinople by torture. It states that he was deposed because he tried to prevent a massacre of Greeks, but we also need Turkish/Ottoman sources.
The article needs more sources and investigation.  

The following is written in Massacres during the Greek Revolution.

""""Another similar massacre took place in the island Hydra, one of the most important Aegean islands. Besides the atrocities committed against the local Muslims in the island, two hybrid brigs captured a Turkish ship laden with a valuable cargo, and carrying a number of passengers. Among these was a recently deposed Sheik-ul-Islam, or patriarch of the Orthodox Muslims, who was said to be going to Mecca for pilgrimage. It was his efforts to prevent the cruel reprisals which, at Constantinople, followed the news of the massacres in Peloponnese, which brought him into disfavor, and caused his exile.W. Alison Phillips, The War of Greek Independence, p.66 There were also several other Turkish families on board. British historian of the Greek revolt, W. Alison Phillips noted: The Hydriots murdered them all in cold blood, helpless old men, ladies of rank, beautiful slaves, and little children were butchered like cattle. The venerable old man, whose crime had been an excess of zeal on behalf of the Greeks, was forced to see his family outraged and murdered before his eyes...""""W. Alison Phillips, p. 67""",0

>Hello Beaumont,I noticed that you have recently joined the Dzierzon discussion and especially Dzierzon's self-identification. You may want to read his own biography and look at his family photos at [56].
What exactly the autobiography is supposed to prove? That he wrote German. And where he identifies himself as German? And what the photos suppose to proof?
>He himself states that his mother Maria and father Simon had a small farm in the same place in Silesia. In other words they were longtime burghers of Silesia, as well as him.
Yes there was. “Name of his great-grandfather Jerzy (1717-1800) appears in the oldest Polish chronicles of Lowkowitz “(W. Kocowicz 1987).
>You look at the church records with birth, marriage, death from Lowkowitz and surrounding area and all his Dzierzon family members, who all wound up after 1945 in Western Germany and you find no traces at all of either him or his parents having moved from Poland to Silesia, Germany.
It only proof that the official language was German and Germanization was on the way look V. Raczek, Erinnerungeu all den Altmelster der Bienenzuclit Dr. Dzierzon
>His grave stone also identifies him as Johann Dzierzon.
The grave stone is repeatedly mentioned by many as proof. The stone was funded by Austrian Beekeepers’ Association and have nothing to do with Dzierzon’s family will. I already mentioned about it in earlier part of the discussion. Lokk up.
>The only Polish people, who came to the Silesian town, I find reference to, is by the way on the current Polish Kluczbork.. (?) site, which tells us that Protestant Polish people took refuge there in the 1600's. We all know, that the Counter-Reformation and the Jesuits 'convinced' the Silesians and others to re-catholizise. Perhaps that is, where Johann Dzierzon had gotten his surname from.
You like to forgot that orginal population of Silesia was Polish people. Look for “Recoveret Teritories” article. The orginal Polish language survived for hundred od years. (It is not exceptional facts you can found such event on Lithuania and others countries where the native language was not changed in vilages) As you can imagine because the schools were fewer.
>I have not seen any self-description of him by himself as a Pole.
I am not surprised of it. German do not publicized such thinks. You need read Polish. You have editions by Polish authors in English. You can find them in “Literature” sections. Also you disbelieve recent Polish authors but you believe on NSDAP propagandists Karl Fleischer (his editions are 50-70 years old). I ask many times for recent German beekeeping historians who says Jan Dzierzon was German.
>The wikipedia Polish group, lead by A Serafin, who is also Nr. 131.. are the only ones with a note from a 1961 book, which is added to the incorrectly named Jan Dzierzon wikipedia article.
The correct name of Jan Dzierzon is Dzierżon the z is with dot above. “Dzierżyć” means to keep in Polish language. What do you mean a note from 1961. All Polish beekeeping historians says Dzierzon was Polish. You just disregard parts which are inconvenient.
>This not only claims, that he said that, but insisting on, that he actually did say that. Where is the actual proof? 
In Kluczbork museum. There is many more interesting thinks about the Polish Dzierzon family and their testimonies. I will encourage you to find proof of yours statement JD was German. Nobody yet give me one except the NSDAP propagandists Karl Fleischer scribbles. Autobiography do not say anything of such, we already know it, is not? 
>That quote, supposedly from him,'identifying himself as a Polish person', actually just says, that his surname is a Polish-based surname.
The citation say: “Regarding my nationality, I AM obviously, just as my name says, Polish of birth, since on Silesia people speak Polish…” in Polish version is: """"Samo moje nazwisko mówi, żem Polak z urodzenia"""" which is “just my name says I AM Pole of birth” Further the sentence says: “because from 10 birthday I found myself in Breslau and I studied there I become German educated, but the education does not accept borders or nationality.” I did not include the other part before as I avoided irritating Germans chauvinists. Now you have it.
Original Polish text: „Co do mojej narodowości, jestem oczywiście, jak już samo nazwisko moje mówi, Polakiem
z urodzenia, gdyż na Śląsku mówi się po polsku, a że od 10 roku życia znalazłem się we Wrocławiu i tam studiowałem, stałem się Niemcem z wykształcenia. Ale nauka nie uznaje granic ani narodowości.”
Original in Museum of. J. Dzierżona in Kluczborku, sygn. 35, 14, 11 Folge, Zur Charakteristik Dr. J. Dzierzon.
Are you really assume that Prussia was an asylum of tolerance and love? If so you would be surprise. Dzierzon did not have a reason to love Prussia.

 That first link has nothing to do with anything - I won't argue the issues with it as I would probably get in trouble for turning this into a blog. Who constructed the table in your second link? (it was not clear). Was it a credible academic clearly labeling themselves as an EP? If it is a legitimate source, you should cite them. Regardless, you should know that this is not how you reference sources in psychology. The sources are not at all clear... in the table, the author writes their piece, then say at the very bottom: """"The four Central Questions are BASED UPON Darwin e.g. 1859, 1871; Lorenz e.g..."""" What does that mean exactly? Is this a bibliographic listing of sources that a person might have read before constructing the questions? Regardless, it needs to be made clear. A bibliography is much different than a reference list. Your table, for example, would seem to be YOUR WORK, with bibliographic references to the sources you claim to have read. You ask us to read the references if information is unfamiliar. I have stated here numerous times that Darwin's Origin of Species cannot be summarized in the way that you have done so.   

Tables are great ways of summarizing established information.  But you are using the table to forward a novel argument - this is a straightforward violation of NOR which is why the table should be deleted.  Your links only prove that other people use this table to make points not about evolutionary psychology.  E.g.: """"THE FOUR CENTRAL QUESTIONS OF BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH USING ETHOLOGY AS AN EXAMPLE.""""  Aside from the fact that this does not come from a source that meets our sourcing standards, the source does not even say what you claim it says.    |  Talk 
An important question is also whether these concepts are key to EP or to evolutionary theory in general. """,0

The two paragraphs about the Christian allegorical theme about love and the two brides being based on two meanings of love, which relate to the latin words """"amor"""" and """"veritas"""" seems contradictory to the fact that the story is, apparently based, on a """"Russian-Jewish folktale.""""

Although the Christian/Jewish contradiction may be attributed to the relationship between the two religions, the fact that the entire thing is made clear by the fact that the meanings of love """"come out better in Latin"""" raises a few red flags for me. Hell, Russian isn't even a Romance language.

On top of all that, I can find no evidence that Theophile Guerin ever existed, or his 1836 book about a monk and a dead woman.

It's very interesting as an idea, but since this information of Guerin is given rather than a citation, I say that the entire two paragraphs should be IMMEDIATELY deleted.

However, I've already spent too much time writing all this and researching that, and am too unsure to actually delete it.

If i get around to rechecking this discussion and no one has said anything or disagreed, I will edit the entry, as there is no citation and it seems unfactual and invented  fictional.

"Non-Scientific 

I guess this article breaks just about every rule there ever was about Scientific Method proving empirically that the study of biological systems is what's evolutionary, and that the self-appointed experts are just at the beginning of the rationality / knowledge curve and not at the conclusion, as they often make believe.  This is really sad.  It's sad because with the kind of dogma, unsupported by facts, that this article contains, there are two steps backwards for every step forward.  Evolutionary biologists really need to clean up their act and get serious. There is no credibility here compared to other hard sciences.  They should take a note from physicists and chemists and really do more to prove their work, instead of just transfixing themselves on convenient hypothesis and staking unsupportable claims.",0

"A good idea that went wrong 

this was a good idea that went wrong; turning into a list of every anime on the planet. It also excluded anime with major significance (sailor moon mainly) under the sole reason of not liking sailor moon. Shows with multiple titles/seasons were often mistakenly labled as seperate shows (of which teh origional author's reasoning was quite laughable). THere was also no format determining which shows made the list and which didn't. All this resulted in people adding random shows that do not matter/removing shows that matter and adding overall incorrect information.

To correct his, i have reformatted the list. By merging shows with multiple seasons (expanding an origional storyline), removing shows that do not make the ANN top 500 in some way shape or form, and limiting the episode count to 48 (a regular anime season in japan) i hope to have corrected any problems with this article.

So you haven't done your homework, you refuse to read or listen to the answers to your questions and then you delete the references that have them.  You are quite a piece of work.  What happened to freedom of speech and free open honest discussion where people can be swayed by reasoned thought?

I am curious what all the other wiki editors who have been following this think.  Of course it will be difficult for them to research the sources you have removed and now locked out.  How about that.  

Suggestion: if you were really as honest as you like to think you are, you would put both articles on the page for everyone to read and vote on.  Yours as it now is, and mine as I last left it.

It says in the instruction to new editors to assume good faith.  That has not been my experience of you, and from my point of view, you have now demonstrated that beyond any doubt.
There are other issues here.  Everywhere I look in wikipedia I see poorly written, out of date articles, or articles with messages requesting that someone update them.  I am curious how many others have had similar experiences to what I have had here and who have lost interest and moved on? Does anyone keep track of wikipedia's hit count and how it has changed over the years?  Or the number of active wiki editors?  I wouldn't be surprised one little bit to find out it both have leveled out and gone into decline.  If so, has it occurred to you that that might be a signal of some sort?
This issue also points out another major flaw in wikipedia; the fact that a single admitted non-expert in a field of study can override multiple experts from NASA, Lockheed Martin, JPL, etc., on a topic as you have done here. 

You have some serious issues here.  I will be interested in seeing how you resolve them, assuming that you can.  Or will this article remain as it now is, another stone in the constipated belly of wikipedia, for years to come?

I just had an idea.  I am going to put the article as I last left it right here so that the other wiki editors who have been following this can read and compare without editorials from either of us.  
It will be interesting to see if you have the courage to leave it alone and allow others to form their own opinion and do their own research.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

A skyhook is a proposed space transportation concept that aims to reduce the cost of placing payloads into space. 

Skyhooks are often confused with an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator, but they are different.  A skyhook is much shorter than a space elevator and does not reach down to the surface of the Earth.  A skyhook requires a suborbital launch vehicle to get to the bottom end of the skyhook, a space elevator does not.  Due to the much shorter length of the skyhook and the resulting reduction in strain, skyhooks up to 4,000 km in length can be built with existing materials, while an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator cannot.Amanda S. Wu, Tsu-Wei Chou, """"Carbon Nanotube Fibers for Advanced Composites"""", Materials Today, vol. 15, July–August 2012, pp. 302-310   

The advantage of a skyhook it that the lower end of the cable is moving at less than orbital velocity for its altitude.  As a result, a launch vehicle flying to the bottom of the skyhook can carry a larger payload than it could going directly to orbit on its own.  When the cable is long enough, single stage to skyhook flight with a reusable launch vehicle such as a spaceplane becomes possible.  Reusability of the launch vehicle and an enlarged payload fraction makes for much lower launch costs.   Once the cable has become long enough the skyhook becomes cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator (assuming a space elevator can ever be built), and the skyhook can be built.{{cite jour",0

I see. Then, very regrettably, Wikipedia is crippled from its birth, suffering from an inherent, incurable disease: its disregard for truth. Such policies theoretically allow the building of articles comprised mainly of false contents, simply by providing ample references that in turn are false, claiming they are """"reliable sources"""". And that is just what might be happening right now to a sizable proportion of the 3-million-plus articles, making Wikipedia unreliable per se. That's very saddening indeed. I just knew Wikipedia was too good to be true: now, evidently, it is true that it is not that good after all. It's more than disappointing, more than dismal: it's just nauseating.

there is absolutely no need to have the comment be inserted in every page as it is specifically intended only for the template page.

There is no apparent reason to have a category in the template. the category would be just as well put independantly.
The link in the header was misleading as implying an article limited to western Russia. Unless Kremlin actually is, but I doubt that, and can't really tell anyway.
No background color in the header, unlike 90% of wikipedia footers
Picture enlarging header unnecesssarily, at the very least it should be reduced and move in the content section of the footer.
80% is unnecearily small for a simple footer like this. Most wikipedia footers do very well with 90%

Now that you have skilfully discovered where our local VC lived and died and further to our recent discussions on putting a suitable plaque on the house in Gays Lane – I am pleased to say that it would be an understatement to say that the present owners are happy to agree to this.

 I have tried contacting English Heritage (for the Blue Plaque) with little success.

A local Council funded and designed Plaque maybe more in keeping especially if local schoolchildren are involved with the design based on certain parameters.

Would you be kind enough to put the matter before the Council at your next meeting for the necessary permissions and funding?

It appears that you tried to give List of St. Louis Rams seasons a different title by copying its content and pasting either the same content, or an edited version of it, into another page with a different name. This is known as a """"cut-and-paste move"""", and it is undesirable because it splits the page history, which is legally required for attribution.  Instead, the software used by Wikipedia has a feature that allows pages to be moved to a new title together with their edit history. In most cases, once your account is four days old and has ten edits, you should be able to move an article yourself using the """"Move"""" tab at the top of the page (the tab may be hidden in a dropdown menu for you). This both preserves the page history intact and automatically creates a redirect from the old title to the new.

While I am somewhat dissapointed by D'Adamo's lack of footnotes, and frustrated by his avoidance of indexes, I haven't yet found a credible direct dispute to any significant claims of his. I am aware of a text that might indicate behavior of lectins on stomach tissuus would need to be directly studied, but I wasn't willing to spend in excess of $200 US (iirc) to find out what exactly it found, depite it being a """"real"""" scientificly strict (apparently, as I didn't actually get to read the) study. 
While not as rigourously strict with the science as it should be (at least what is presented in his books) ER4YT doesn't seem to be significantly paranormal or disprovable. So while it has a stigma of pseudoscience, that stigma hasn't really been justified.  Some supposed refutation I have come across turned out to be of even poorer quality, either reflecting it's own pseudoscience, or a lack of familiarity with the nominal subject. I would really like to see some explicit, maybe even rigorous debunking of D'Adamo's (occasionaly controversial? I can't see why) offerings. As of yet, I consider this closer to protoscience than unfalsifiable pseudoscience. 
In any case, I don't think that anything I previously posted on this matter is all that fantastic.  Is the mere mention of Doctor D'Adamo, or Eat Right For Your Type (ER4YT) enough to invalidate the respose I offered?  Other than that vague stigma, is my above answer to the utility of divergent blood types unhelpful or incorrect? I do believe that I was careful enough to avoid anything that wasn't NPOV.

I don't see in what way this is not explicit enough. There's nothing unspecific whatsoever about the situation - she posted a picture of very specific pair of prescription medications, Estradiol and Spironolactone. You don't just randomly come across this pair of medications by accident, and you don't change your name to a distinctly feminine name at the same time as posting them just for the fun of it. Furthermore, her username on Twitch was changed which was completely unprecedented - Twitch has a strict policy against name changes for their partnered streamers. She is the first Twitch partner to have ever gotten a name change, which points to extenuating circumstances - this was not done on a whim. It is incredibly offensive to Narcissa to continue listing her name and gender as male. Think about it another way: if you properly list her name and gender as female now, the absolute worst that can happen is that later she clarifies that """"No, actually, despite all the evidence to the contrary I didn't actually transition"""" and we revert the article as if nothing happened. If we continue with this farce of listing her name and gender as Cosmo/male, the bad case is a much bigger issue - offensive degradation of a trans* person by refusing to acknowledge their gender identity.

OK...you all call my behavior 'aggressive,' but I consider it WP:BOLD. You all call my editing behavior 'uncivil,' but I just call it 'being vocal' about the removal of valid material from Wikipedia. I will refrain from using 'strong language' in edit summaries in the future, including capital letters. You say that: """"This is persistent and entrenched behavior on your part that you don't seem to understand or want to change after many warnings and two blocks""""  I've never had any substantial warnings, only the two expedited blocks. You say that I should """"accept the rules"""" when other editors are totally disregarding and/or misquoting them, or trying to pass off essays and guidelines as policy when they are not. The fact is that if someone is removing good/valid/sourced material from Wikipedia, I'm going to call them out on it. Any way that you put it, strong wording in edit summaries is not a valid reason to perma-block people, as short sentences like that can easily be taken out of context.

Regarding my claims of censorship and vandalism in the above-mentioned edit summaries: I'm not sure what else to call it if not censorship and vandalism...I suppose I could always call it """"the constant removal of valid categories/information from articles,"""" but that would be whitewashing the issue. For whatever reason, entirely valid, relevant, and sourced material is consistently removed from many articles (Paul Wolfowitz, Ben Bernanke, Lewis Libby, others) by the same editors again and again, and after a while it just gets very old, ridiculous, and frustrating to have to keep inserting this valid information over and over. By the way: I consider the removal of valid material/categories from articles over and over again to be censorship and vandalism...don't you? Some kind-of phantom clause in WP:BLP is constantly cited to try to justify the removal of this information even though this information is currently found in thousands of other articles with no problem at all.

When I wrote """"Revery [sic] Jayjg's idiotic edit..."""" in an edit summary for removing Category:Ethnic nationalism from the White nationalism article I only made that statement because the very first sentence of the article said """"White nationalism (WN) is a form of ethnic nationalism...""""  thus the removal of said category seemed rather idiotic in my opinion since the first sentence of the article obviously confirmed that particular category. Jayjg then changed that first sentence (he provided no source for this edit) and removed the category. I never called Jayjg idiotic, only that particular edit.

Since everything I write on here seems to be misconstrued, taken the wrong way, and wrongfully considered 'uncivil' and/or 'aggressive' (what is and what is not 'civil' and 'aggressive' is highly POV and a matter of opinion, by the way), I plan to edit  and remove any and all information that could be considered 'offensive' or 'uncivil'  I am going to bring the page down to the basics.

Truthfully, I try my best to avoid getting caught up in all of these Wiki-politics, personal vendettas, petty edit wars, childish games, etc.; I am part of no group/cabal here, I stick to myself and mind my own business, and improve and expand Wikipedia as best I can. However, when I see factual edits constantly being reverted for no apparent reason (what I term censorship and vandalism) it tends to make me a bit angry, so I have no choice except to be vocal about it and hope that other good editors see what is happening and will begin to take action and discuss these issues. That's another thing...the complete and utter lack of discussion by these people, whether in edit summaries or on talk pages. I would like to discuss these issues (and I always try to leave a good edit summary), but whenever I try to discuss these issues the response I so often get is one or two bogus sentences and the mindless repetition of a bunch of Wikipedia essays/guidelines (NOTE: NOT POLICIES) in an attempt to justify the censorious deletion/vandalism """"the constant removal of valid categories/information from articles.""""

NPOV concerns

I tend to agree with the NPOV concerns of some comments here.  They seem to be more along the lines of what is *not* included than what is.  To be fair, a google search returned far more of the 'critical' sources than any other.

However, I was able to make a minor edit I regard as an improvement. I replaced one Guardian article, """"Iran contra men return to power"""" with another from the same publication, the """"Negroponte: Amercia's voice of experience"""" article.

I believe the former article is redundant to many of the others, and as the least specific to Mr. Negroponte is the least relevent.  The latter article I believe balances the collective tone of the references, and does not omit mention of the Honduras accusations.

However, I have retained the old article here:

 """"Iran-contra men return to power""""(from The Guardian)

I haven't even read his latest reply at User talk:142.161.182.190. Maybe I will read it a few days later and reply then. But it's fruitless replying to him because he's so stuck on the fact that he's right even in the face of overwhelming evidence that he's wrong. He thinks like this. He doesn't understand at all that we follow what the sources say, except for when it suits him. And that he insists that the information in the Lesbianism in erotica article about studies showing that men are more sexually aroused by lesbian pornography than heterosexual pornography makes my head hurt. He acts like we are presenting opinions as fact, when all we are really do is presenting the findings of several studies  not one, but several. In his opinion, we shouldn't include this information because he doesn't consider the evidence strong enough. Yet he considers """"just googl[ing] the most purchased adult videos,"""" """"see[ing] what they're about"""" and this """"would correspond to male arousal quite well"""" to be strong enough evidence. Most heterosexual men buying heterosexual porn doesn't mean that most heterosexual men are more turned on by heterosexual porn than lesbian porn.

 Solution 

This is save Venice, and I created a makeshift account under SV Solution. I have no intention in keeping it, nor do I wish to even continue to talk on these pages. After this statement, I will be closing it and just be Save venice. This was needed becasue of a childish block claiming me to be a vandal- how stupid.

Now, If Wikipedia is interested in a real solution to this problem that appears to have been going on for nearly a half of year now  with no end in sight, here is a solution (step by step):

1) I have looked into all of your backgrounds, and none of you are Venetain experts, please stick with what you know, and don't muck up good articles. Most of you are only interested in hoaxes, and seem you to enjoy talking about them, Stop doing that- it is not a solution. 

2) Having also looked into the background of this situation,  it is clear where the hoax is coming from, Fenwick High School in Oak PArk Illinois. Vitus must have went there, and these kids knew him or knew of him, they saw his name referenced on the Barbaro family page, and then proceeded to use his name into creating a fake secret society that he was NOT involved with. Shut down any mention of him in such a fake society, and the hoax is then neutralized. 

3) Go to the Fenwick H.S. talk page and get rid of all of that hoax stuff., If you have some issue about removing nonsense from talk pages than just file it away into an upper file, so it is there but out of the way, it is too inspiration for kids to perpetuate hoaxes.

4) go to Barbaro family talk page and do the same, now we have two nicely cleaned pages with files that can still be oponed.

5) If anyone post personal talk page comments on a talk page that is meant to be about an article, it must be transferred to a relevant personal talk page.

6) If anyone goes to the Barbaro family talk page and starts discussing matters about hoaxes and Vitus etc. It should be fair game to be removed. They should be viewed as trouble makers and people that desire to perpetuate confussion and hoaxes. 

7) I have also looked over the previous page you sent me, and the knowledge on that was also good, Spretti goes into detail about the family's Roman roots etc. It can be referenced, but I am not going to reference other peoples work, return the page we worked on together that is equally fine with a great picture on the top. It is a good over-view of the family, and it is enough, if people want to know more than they can do further research themselves.

8) Return the two head at the bottom as cited red links, and I will work closely with our expert on that, there is an interview with biographical info in the Family Record for the House of Barbaro. Also, red links show where further development needs to occur- there may be other people out there that has info too. Red links are useful. If you still have soem issue about them than just flag the section until they are fully developed as blue links, but leave them there there are useful to direct development.

9) Notify everyone on the nature of the hoax. The hoax is not Vitus or Antonio, it is kids using real people to create fake articles about secret societies that they were NOT involved with. 

10) Do just tlk about solution or send me petty blocking notices, be a leader take action to fix this problem by following the outline above.

11) My involvement in Wikipedia editing is based on what you do from this point forward. I will not play childish games or be treated in this manner. I am intersted in writing about other Venetian topic, next I would like to write about Palazzo Da Mula in Morano Venice. My focus is not just on the Barbaro family, I am happy to fix it and then move on.

RELATED ISSUES:

1) I am not the same Barbaro family representative called in to fix the problem, nor do I believe that that even occured, I suspect that Vitus and his clan could care less about Wikipedia. What I believe happened is some kids working at a school computer started all this (at Fenwick H.S.) and some teacher that knew Vitus and his family tried to step in and fix the mistakes of these stupid kid- she was probabaly afraid the family might sue the school for defimation of character. I highly doubt the Vitus would go through the trouble of bringing some """"Expert"""" to fix a Wikipedia article. 

2) I am NOT misguided, I know this family's history well an dknow for a fact based on creditable sources that Vitus and Antionio are acting heads. You will also find more info out there about Antonio's line because in Malta, titles are still holding political power, while in Vitus'case they are cultural titles devoid of powers. 

3) Finally, Antonio's branch is 100% the same family from Venice. Spretti p277: """"Ramo di questa famiglia fiori",0

As to The Church of Jesus Christ, they are big enough, I think, with about 15,000 members, to merit an article in their own right. I think there's verifiable material on the group's current practices and doctrines, although I'm not familiar enough with it. As to the much smaller groups like the Cutlerites and the Strangites, I think their notability comes from their history. There used to be a lot more members, and they had significant interactions with early Mormons. For the FLDS Church, there's not much verifiable information about their current practices, but they are in the news so much that they should definitely have an article. Basically, though, I see no problem with allowing an article for any distinct religious denomination. There may not be much verifiable information, but as long as they are either in the news, or have some historical significance, or have published things, that seems notable enough for me. As to particular church buildings or single congregations of a denomination, that's probably where I'd draw the line, unless that particular church building or congregation has some special significance.

Be that as it may, what studies in diglossia in Tamil over the last several decades would have done is merely deal with the 'problem' in greater detail and throw light on such things as the causes for diglossia, 'evolution', perpetuation etc., of this phenomenon over the centuries and other things of academic interest like that.

What I am trying to say is, while scientific interest and research into diglossia might be a development of the last few decades, 'diglossia'(in tamil) existed nonetheless, even before that.  And like I said, Caldwell has only touched upon it though not gone deeper into it to research the more intricate details of it.

Notwithstanding that, the fact remains that the ordinary Tamil, especially one without formal(or informal) training, is often at a loss to understand Classical tamil enough to fully appreciate its beauty.

so, imo, the lines that are already there should be retained as it is.  But, you should also(before those lines, preferably) make a mention of the diglossia that exists in Tamil, the different levels, the continuum etc., and then conclude that... """"....as a result of the said diglossia, the ordinary Tamil, sometimes even with formal training, is at a loss to understand the language of classical literature(or the other diglossic levels)""""

And, to answer Sundar's question as to whether (I feel) this is limited to just Tamil or is also a feature of other languages -

While I dont a 'professional grade' knowledge of any language, I've had formal schooling in both Kannada and Hindi.  And I've observed this feature in both languages, much more so in Kannada.  In Kannada, in fact, if you were to study the 'Mankutimmana Kagga'(written sometime in the 60s or 70s i guess) by D V Gundappa, the language used is somewhat in haLegannaDa style, though I would say, it doesnt 'sound' as haLe(old) as haLegannada.  I am able to understand this work for the most part except in some places where it gets a little too much for me and I might have to refer to the dictionary.

Any literature, regardless of when it was written, but written in pure haLegannada style, I would say, wouldnt make much sense to the untrained eye or ear.  

With Hindi, probably because the language is much younger than Kannada or Tamil, though I've observed a sort of diglossia, say in the language that Kabir employs, verses that of Munshi or someone,  Kabir is far more discernable to me than say the Kavirajamarga would be to me or probably Kural to you.

In general, I feel some degree of diglossia almost always exists in most languages(atleast Indian languages) in that, the lingo employed by news readers, say,(atleast in the good old 'Doordarshan only' days), is removed from the one you would hear on the street.  Talking of newsreaders and the lingo on street, I just remembered an interesting thing about the Kannada spoken by the people of South Kanara.  It is almost exactly like the one employed in the news or in formal documents, in that, they speak much the same way they and the rest of Karnataka would write.  I am not sure if there's a parallel to this in Tamil or any other language that I have any knowledge of.

I usually read all of a discussion and think about it, before replying to any of it.

We have yet to have any sources that show that Brian Harvey is an expert, or what fields he is an expert in.  It's rare for an instructor at a University to be tenured, and also rare for senior faculty to let them make policy decisions alone, without tenured senior faculty's input and approval.  Instructors are usually hired to implement policy set by senior faculty, and kept on if they do the specified job well. This frees up faculty for other tasks and projects.  But this is mute - see the next point. (But if you feel you have to, in Brian Harvey's case, sources please to show otherwise.)   

Brian Harvey is not what Wikipedia refers to as an Independent Source (aka third party source).  He has used Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SCIP) at Berkeley and has been acknowledged by Abelson and Sussman in the Second Edition of SCIP. (He is not acknowledged in the First edition. (Took me a little while to find a hardcopy.)) So using him as a reference is a small step from using Hal Abelson, the subject of this biography. Wikipedia asks that non-Independent Sources be used with care and only when an Independent Source can not be found. 
 
The Boston Globe reference has the same issue in their feature, and should not be used as we have an Independent Source.   

Chris Haynes and Dan Friedman are acknowledged in the Second Edition of SCIP.  Mitch Wand is acknowledged in the First Edition of SCIP.  So their book has the non-Independent Source problem.   

Which leaves us one source that  found. I'm not going to try and find out if it's an Independent Source, i.e. who was in the group that decided on giving Abelson the award.   

Without a reference, this sentence with the word """"worldwide"""" in it fails WP:NPOV. It is also unclear what it means: how many CS departments?, what parts of the world?, etc. Even with a reference, the claim should be in a quote from that reference, not in plain text. Wikipedia prose is suppose to be written in a neutral tone, with non-neutral text clearly tied to a source. WP:NPOV also requires that available WP:SOURCES (if any) that balance out the article on this and other parts of the text be added. If you know of one on this point or others, please add it to this biography.   

A claim this wide could have other Independent Sources making it.  If any one wants to find and add them ...   

The laundry list of course materials is trivia that isn't needed in a biography, and is distracting to the reader.   

So ....   

Proposed consensus

I propose we change the sentence to this:

The Association for Computing Machinery notes this course """"was widely emulated and adopted by colleges around the world.""""

and add this as a new paragraph, perhaps in a new section Awards:In 2011, Abelson received the Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award.  The citation read """"For his contribution to computing education, through his innovative advances in curricula designed for students pursuing different kinds of computing expertise, and for his leadership in the movement for open educational resources.''

If this award was published in an ACM journal, it be better to use the  template.

The Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award has neither an article nor a template. It's in over a dozen articles so far. Create either if you feel it's meets WP:N.

 A few ideas to balance the US centric style.

Whilst you have brought in large area of British (mainly English and Welsh) facts neverthe less the opening paragraphs are somewhat US based.  I have no knowledge whatsoever on anything other than the UK perspective (though as this contributes significantly to US law, it will at least set some history.  

I am also a little bit concerned at why juries were created in the first place, you state that this is because they are believed to be free from bribery. Historically, trial by jury arose because of the difficulties of securing trial by ordeal, due to a change in church law.  By that time juries already sat to decide if there was a primae facie case to answer (the modern equivalent being Grand Juries).

The history of trial by jury (in England and hence the US) is related to several important events, most notebly the Assizes of Clarendon, the Fourth Lantern Council and the Magna Carta.

It may be useful for you to have a look at some of the wikipedia sites listed below:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_ordeal

""""In the Assize of Clarendon, enacted in 1166 and the first great legislative act in the reign of the English Angevin King Henry II, the law of the land required that: """"anyone, who shall be found, on the oath of the aforesaid [a jury], to be accused or notoriously suspect of having been a robber or murderer or thief, or a receiver of them ... be taken and put to the ordeal of water.""""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Lateran_Council

Canons 14-18. Rules on the conduct of the clergy including against such things as: non-celibate living, drunkenness, frequenting taverns, hunting, conducting trials by ordeal or combat 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta

Though you may be best considering the uk statute site which says:
http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519

""""NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor [X5 condemn him,] but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.""""

The lead is meant to summarise the rest of the article. Extra references don't hurt. Why do you have a problem with the scientific view that this story is pure fiction and could not have happened.
The part about the 19th century is purely linked in with it because you keep removing the reference to the current state of science on the matter as """"too much"""". Are you happy to let me put back in the earlier wording that modern science completely refutes the story? Make up your mind what your disagreement is and stick to it. Now it's because the mention of the 19th century. Earlier placement of that reference was just to state what science thought of the matter, but you objected to that as I recall. If you'd leave it how it has been in there numerous times before as simply a statement that science today disproves the whole story: you'd not be making this latest of argument to prevent the view that this story is not at all factual.

"""==King George County, VA==

There seems to be some a contridiction of the status of King George County. The King George County page indicates that King George County is NOT a part of the Washington-Baltimore Metropolitan Area. Yet, according to the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area page, it is.

This also brings to light a local controversey regarding King George County and whether or not it is part of the Northern Neck of Virginia. Historically, King George County has been included as part of the Northern Neck. The Northern Neck Tourism Council website lists locations in King George County amongst its historical sites and museums, and the King George County Homepage labels the county as the """"Gateway to the Historic Northern Neck"""". I was educated in Northumberland County, Virginia, and this is what we were taught during our segment on local history for 11th grade US History, that there are FIVE counties in the Northern Neck, including King George County.

However, until 11th grade, I had always grown up under the assumption that the Northern Neck consisted of only four counties: Northumberland, Lancaster, Westmoreland, and Richmond counties. Locals think of the Northern Neck more as a community with similar  values and interests, rather than a geographical area. King George county is considered to be """"suburban"""", part of the Washington DC urban sprawl and therefore doesn't share the same community interests as the rest of the Northern Neck.

This article from the Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star highlights both sides of the King George debate.

The inclusion of King George County as part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area stems from three facts: King George's proximity to Fredericksburg, its inclusion in the Washington DC media market, and the presence of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren. However, the historical connections between King George County and the Northern Neck shouldn't be dismissed. It wouldn't be inappropriate to consider King George County as part of both, as Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area seems to be a statistical category, while the Northern Neck is a historical/geographical region.

I have also added this discussion to the pages on both the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and the King George County pages. If there is no further discussion or objection, I will edit the Northern Neck page to include mention of the local debate on the status of King George County.  """,0

When I saw the edits and MPLX's addition yesterday, I found it rather anti-GWB (which I happen to share, but...) POV and unfounded. The connection seems absurdly weak and tenuous; for decades if not centuries politicians all the world over have been speaking of peace while waging or preparing war, and assuring the populace that it is a just war to bring a better tomorrow for everybody (in my country, we have rich experience with """"fighting for peace"""").
So, first of all, I don't think the speech was particularly paradoxical, let alone """"[[Orwellian]"""" - although I don't follow the US media; if MLPX can provide links of other commentators noting this, he has a case in point.
Secondly, even if the speech was meant to explicitly refer to FDR's Four Freedoms, I think that the mediated connection to 1984 is too loose and willed for an encyclopedia.
Thirdly and most importantly, even if the section had a place in the article, it's certainly not squat in the middle of the section """"The World of 1984"""".

The University seal was removed from this page.  Per the University's official logo guidelines, available at http://logo.wustl.edu, the seal is limited to items for Commencement and those events sponsored by the Board of Trustees, the Chancellor, or the deans and requires special permission from the University for use.

Please be advised that the University has in the past pursued legal action when images and symbols are used without permission for which permission is specifically required.
This unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) .

First, I must kindly ask the user who posted this topic to please sign their username to their post in future. Secondly, the use of Washington University’s seal in a Wikipedia article is perfectly fair and legal. Just as wikipedia is allowed to use the logo’s of McDonalds , Apple, and other US corporations that have also copyrighted their logo’s, a wikipedia article is still allowed to use College and University seals under the US copyright law’s fair use'' policy. Wikipedia does not need permission to use Washington University’s seal so long as it meets the fair use qualifications. Every other university's seal including  Harvard's, Northwestern's,  and Yale's is used in Wikipedia articles that reference them, even though they have similar policies about university seal use. This because wikipedia is a non-profit foundation, allowed to use copyrighted logo’s under the fair use policy.  

I will be reinstating Washington University's Seal to meet the format consistent with other US College and university articles. 

Please be advised that legal counsel has been notified.  The University makes available the official University logo for these purposes.  Use of the University seal is strictly prohibited and protected.  

The use of the Washington University seal even if it is copyrighted is allowed on Wikipedia through the fair use policy. Notify legal consul if you must but the Fair use policy has already been affirmed in court see: Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation. I have also examined user 's discussion page and found that the user has flouted Wikipedia rules and regulations in the past. Taking this into account I will continue to reinstate the university seal until the user   presents a concrete reason why I should not. Placing the university seal on the wikipedia article that it concerns is consistent with wikipedia format, and encouraged by the wikipedia community. The same policy which governs the use of Washington University logo also governs the Washington University seal. And I question  to be a spokesperson for the university and decide that it is acceptable to use the logo. Although I was unable to access the link that
  provided in an attempt to present their case my understanding is that the policy applies to the use of the seal by members of the university community and not an outside non for profit foundation. Once again there has been no violation of the fair use policy concerning the Washington University seal brought to my attention and 
87
Atherefore I continue reverting to the original article until one such violation is identified. 

user  please post Washington University seal policy in full on the talk page so users can examine it and compare it to other university policies as I said before I was unable to access the link, you still not be removing the seal PLEASE stop. 

I do agree with  that Fair Use doctrine permits use of the seal in such a not-for-profit context. (As a sidenote, Wikipedia's image tag for """"logos,"""" which asserts the right to use such images in this context, surely wasn't invented out of thin air; there's presumably some legal research/knowledge behind that tag's invention.) I think we might do well soliciting the advice of an administrator who has specific experience in copyright/Fair-Use issues, if this dispute continues. Surely this sort of issue must pop up on Wikipedia all the time.  

The official seal of the University is a protected trademark and may not be used without the written permission of the University.  The University has not",0

Just to be clear, in many cases I personally added a link pair like """"[[July 4]], [[1976 in radio|1976]]"""" to an article so 1) I created that link pair, 2) I did not realize that it broke autoformatting, and 3) I acknowledge that date autoformatting is now deprecated and is being removed by the bot.

Apparently, the dispute is over whether the term """"Greek Macedonians"""" should be used to refer to the Greek Macedonians. While it is a sourced term and is in use by academics as has been demonstrated above, there is a strong refusal to including it.

"History 396 outline for Grey Owl

Career:
1. Trapper (sub heading under career)
His earlier mindset surrounding trapping will be discussed in greater depth, as not much is discussed with regards to how he viewed trapping before his switch to conservationism.
His work with the Ojibwa Indians / Guppy Family will be explored as they were critical in his development as a trapper that understood the fragility of the animal ecosystem (Smith, 41)
The time of his life spent working and living at the Temagami Inn as a chore-boy will be mentioned as this was one of the events in which  Archie first became an observer of the Objibwa way of life. (Smith, 40)
His love interest, Angele will also be discussed as she also introduced Archie to influential figures within the Objibwa community, providing Archie with plenty of sketches for his infamous notebooks. (Smith, 42)

2. Early Conservation Work (sub heading under career) This is my section for the project. 

From the section on his life as a trapper, we will discuss the impact of Anahareo on his switch from trapper to Conservationist.  
The transformation of his own personal views of conservationism will be explored through his writings in Pilgrims of the wild.
His initial desires to write will also be explored, this section then ending with the completion of his first book “The Men of the Last Frontier” which can be seen as one of the starting points of his public conservation career.

Source matter in this subheading will discuss Grey Owl’s beginning with Parks Board Canada through meeting James Harkin, covering material surrounding the films he made with their support, and his placement as caretaker of park animals at Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba.  
His relationship with W. J. Oliver regarding his being commissioned by Parks Board Canada to make films of Grey Owl will also be explored.  
We will also delve further into his later life as a conservationist and his role in Prince Albert National park.

 The Transylian War

Stabbed Kercher getting axed
Hello, Wikid77 here. Now that User:Zlykinskyja has been hounded away from editing """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""", the wholesale axing of fully-sourced text has begun. See: removal of forensics. The apparent WP:Wikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman, with legal expertise, trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms. I warned beware of """"colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia"""". Perhaps if American student Amanda had been """"Adam Knox"""" then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20? misquoted infamous statements. (I didn't know any evidence in December 2009, now I know much, and some seems falsified in Italy). Zlykinskyja tried to add how """"Donald Trump"""" rejected the verdict (+source), but that was quickly deleted. Some US officials are conducting a mock-trial by judge to compare verdicts, but I doubt that could be explained in the article. Then some prankster this week posted at top, """"Breaking news: Knox dead in prison from suicide, details not confirmed"""" (from an IP edit in the London area), and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that. I wish we could split the article into several low-target subarticles (I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles). The talk-page has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on """"Amanda Knox"""" and naturally, a prior subarticle was AfD deleted.However, I suggest the following:
 """"Amanda Knox"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article with civil suits, appellate trial, and college coursework in prison.
 """"Raffaele Sollecito"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article, noting he completed his computer degree while in custody, and they met, at a classical music concert, because he looked like Harry Potter.
 """"Prosecution of Amanda Knox"""" (new) - would contain all the pro/anti-Knox text, moved from edit-wars in the Kercher article.
 """"Investigations of Kercher murder"""" (new) - would be a forensic article, with fingerprints, Low copy number DNA, luminol, unidentified DNA/prints, listing exact quotes+sources, etc.
 """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""" (reduced) - would be trimmed into an overview, linking sections to subarticles.
I have seen how other articles, split into subarticles, greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details, so that forensic details would likely match the sources, when viewed there. This message is just a general notice, sent to a few admins, and I don't expect an immediate response. Also, feel free to delete this, knowing it was posted in a 1 May talk-page revision: as a May Day warning about axing of Kercher text. Thanks. -  """,0

“Wikipedia is an encyclopedia written collaboratively by many of its readers”
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Introduction

“The term collaborative writing refers to projects where written works are created by multiple people together (collaboratively) rather than individually. Some projects are overseen by an editor or editorial team, but many grow without any of this top-down oversight.”
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_writing

“Volunteers do not need any formal training before creating a new article or editing an existing article. The people who create and edit articles in Wikipedia come from countries all around the world and have a wide range of ages and backgrounds.”
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Who_writes_Wikipedia

“Neutral point of view is a fundamental Wikimedia principle and a cornerstone of Wikipedia. All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly, and as far as possible without bias, all significant views that have been published by reliable sources. This is non-negotiable and expected of all articles, and of all article editors. For guidance on how to make an article conform to the neutral point of view, see the NPOV tutorial; for examples and explanations that illustrate key aspects of this policy, see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view

“Bias -NPOV requires views to be represented without bias. All editors and all sources have biases—what matters is how we combine them to create a neutral article. One can think of unbiased writing as the fair, analytical description of all relevant sides of a debate, including the mutual perspectives and the published evidence. When editorial bias toward one particular point of view can be detected, the article needs to be fixed.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view

“Neutrality disputes and handling - A common type of dispute is when an editor asserts that a fact is both verifiable and cited, and should therefore be included.  In these types of disputes, it is important to note that verifiability lives alongside neutrality, it does not override it. A matter that is both verifiable and supported by reliable sources might nonetheless be proposed to make a point or cited selectively; painted by words more favorably or negatively than is appropriate; made to look more important or more dubious than a neutral view would present; marginalized or given undue standing; described in slanted terms which favor or weaken it; or subject to other factors suggestive of bias.  Verifiability is only one content criterion. Neutral point of view is a core policy of Wikipedia, mandatory, non-negotiable, and to be followed in all articles. Concerns related to undue weight, non-neutral fact selection and wording, and advancing a personal view, are not addressed even slightly by asserting that the matter is verifiable and cited. The two are different questions, and both must be considered in full, in deciding how the matter should be presented in an artic",0

"The ArsTech article provides a great potted history of the project, it includes a lot of the information I had hoped to read here at Wikipedia. I'll try to briefly summarize: from a 1 man project to a 2 man project, eventually getting a code repository. Story on Slashdot November 3, 2001, bringing many more developers and users. The scope of the project expands to more than just SCUMM games. Rewritten from C to C++ starting in 2002, addition of a GUI, etc. 
 Then the legal issues with LucasArts  this is far a more notable part of the history of the project than an alleged GPL violation many many years later  and their amicable resolution and ongoing development of the project. (That's just page 1)
 Then cooperation from games companies, sharing of source code and in some cases offering the games as freeware (a section of prose on this would provide context and make the long lists of later in the article more meaningful). ScummVM developers evening working with companies under NDAs. Merging the SCI engine goes from April fools joke to actual reality many years later. 
 page 4 of the article talks about the Mystic GPL issue that already has been given undue weight in this article, an issue best solved by rebalancing the article with more prose. The article mentions touch support added for WebOS that might be generalized and also mentions the Google Summer of Code. 
 I encourage others to take my brief summary and flesh it back out again to create a few paragraphs about the History/Development of ScummVM and improve this wikipedia article.  109.76.13.212",0

Update re: """"public domain"""" in the United States
Some parting comments re: the two images; for those still seeking to document the licenses that reference """"public domain"""" in Poland and/or in the United States, one might want to take a look at the """"Photo credits"""" in the PBS (U.S. public television) documentary Website for its series Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State (2005); about a week ago I edited the article on the BBC program to include the source citations for the PBS broadcast of the same program (with diff. title).
(cont.) Today, while searching """"images of Auschwitz prisoners public domain"""" out of residual curiosity re: this matter, I located one photo credit referring to """"public domain"""" in the U.S.-published Website for the BBC program shown on PBS: it is a photo credit for """"Auschwitz prisoners"""" (not Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum/Wilhelm Brasse photographs, but photographs taken contemporaneously at Auschwitz in period from 1940 to 1945, depicting prisoners outside on the grounds of the camp at a barbed wire fence, e.g.: see Credits, scroll down to """"Auschwitz prisoners"""", and go to page 1 (hyperlinked) to see the photographs.  If PBS is citing """"public domain"""" in the United States, this might be a helpful precedent to cite re: Auschwitz photographs (taken by Polish photographers w/o copyright credits being given?).  Just a thought.
(cont.) I do not expect to be editing Wikipedia much if at all in the near future, so I thought I'd leave others with this possible publication precedent in the U.S. for citing U.S. (and possiblly worldwide) """"public domain"""" re: photographs of Auschwitz prisoners; though I am not sure it applies in the UK or European Union too; that would not matter if it applies in the U.S.
(cont.) The so-called duplicate photograph (3 poses) of Kwoka in the Wik. Commons file of same name is not exactly the same; it would be a good idea to rename the Wikipedia version as asked in the template to reduce possibility of deletion; the one in Wik. Commons still has the Museum captions in it and by virtue of that is possibly not in the public domain.  The cropped one w/o the Museum captions has a stronger argument for """"public domain"""" in the U.S.  (The one that is more clearly a photograph of the Museum-captioned photograph has a weaker argument as such, though I am not sure of that.  See the various discussions of the two images linked via the templates.) It is important to correct the conflict/problem pointed out via the templates of the duplicate names for images that have conflicting licenses/fair use rationales in Wik. and Wik. Commons.  If the images are determined by the reviews to be public domain in the U.S., they do not need fair-use rationales; they can be files in Wikipedia Commons (w/o Museum captions/the cropped version currently in this article) and not duplications w/ same name in Wikipedia (??).

I know that the Croatian perspective is somewhat different. This comes from a very specific historiographical school, which had among its roots Grga Novak. Assuming that Dalmatia was one of the most primitive of Europe at the time of Venetian domination, we must also think that since 1797 to the date you specified (1945) they are 150 years. Josip Smodlaka stated in 1911 (1911!) that Dalmatia was still one of the poorest regions of Europe. As you can understand, we can not talk only of the Italian evil foreign rule to explain this fact.

If they are notable, find a source that says that they are notable. These list of favorite players should be removed from this page, as well as from the other position articles. Dil 

Who says these players are notable? What criteria is being used to determine who is or isn't notable?
It's completely unsourced POV. Come to some consensus criteria for what is going to be considered notable, and then add players back along with sources showing they meet these criteria. These sections are completely unacceptable per WP:A as they are currently written. Dil 
The notable player section is pure WP:OR and even if they meet a standard (say All star game the year before), there'll be other standards that makes other players notable.    

See the soccer positions those all have lists and these lists can let people easily see some famous players without having to see another page. The standard is those players have won awards before such as All-Stars such as Tony Parker, MVPs such as Steve Nash or All-NBA teams Steve Nash and Billups. New England(Black Harry) also agrees with me and to prove it see:Talk:Power forward (basketball).  
That's circular logic...Because soccer players have it, basketball players should?   Just because another user agrees with you means it should be in there.   I'm opposing based on the notion that wikipedia should not be setting the criteria on who is a notable PG and who is not.    

Regarding soccer positions, WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS. 
If it's a list of players that have won MVP's, gone to All-Star games, or made the All-NBA team...then it should say that it is a list of those things, not that they are """"notable."""" Without clarification, it's just going to be a section which is constantly in a state of edit-warring because people want to see their favorite players on the list.  Also, please note that I started a new discussion on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject National Basketball Association. This isn't something that should be decided on an article talk page if the resulting consensus is going to affect multiple pages within the scope of a project.  Dil 

There is no need to describe the other point guards who have won the MVP as """"much shorter."""" Oscar Robertson was also tall for the position at 6'5. Steve Nash is taller than many point guards at 6'3. Magic Johnson was an anamoly at pg because he was so tall.

Thanks for your very helpful comments. Yiddish authors belonging to the postwar generation who have published one or more books include: Alexander Belousov, Sholem Berger, Leybl Botwinik, Velvl Chernin, Gennadi Estaikh, Mikhoel Felzenbaum, Daniel Galay, Moyshe Lemster, Yitskhok Niborski, Boris Karloff (pen name of Dov-Ber Kerler), Heershadovid Menkes (pen name of Dovid Katz), Boris Sandler, Dmitry Yakirevich. Please note, however, that not all of them were included in the recently suggested revision. 

As for the even younger authors, Yisroel Nekrasov is widely published in literary periodicals in Israel, USA and Russia and his first book collection is scheduled to appear within next few weeks in Moscow (selections of his original poetry can be read in the online magazine """"Der Bavebter Yid"""" and on . Boris Kotlerman's original prose was published in two major Yiddish literary periodicals in Israel (at least twice in each one of them). Haike Beruriah Wiegand's poetry appeared in """"Bavebter Yid"""" and soon in """"Yerusholaimer Almanakh"""" in Jerusalem (see a small selection of her highly sophisticated verse at ). Perhaps a special case could be made for retaining their names in this entry for it is not all that easy for a contemporary Yiddish author to publish her or his work in a separate book no matter how well known and well received that work might be among contemporary Yiddish readers. A case in point is Alexander Belousov whose work was extremely well known and widely acclaimed, but whose first and so far the only collection of works appeared posthumously in 2006. 

Finally, and for the record, there are also two Yiddish poets (and Yiddish scholars), Gilles Rosier in Paris and Thomas Soxberger in Vienna who are also accomplished and well published novelistsin in French and German respectively.

When I discussed with User:MarkSweep on a private IRC session about any post made between 12:35 and 16:52, he pointed the following out to me:

Shultzii Those posts you just pointed out- they're troll posts? (I don't see how they are.)
Shultzii They look pretty innocent to me
mark_sweep that's what makes them troll posts
Shultzii Making a wikilink and pointing it out? *scratches head*
Shultzii I'll take a 2nd look at his talk page...
mark_sweep the original question may look innocent, but it was pretty pointless; that's why people consider it trolling
mark_sweep here's the thing
Shultzii Oh about the thought of naming a new city of Hoeryong somewhere in the US?
mark_sweep yes, but it's not even that
mark_sweep here's the thing
Shultzii Go ahead. Taking food out of microwave.
mark_sweep an admin asks you to stop
mark_sweep more or less accusing you of being a troll
mark_sweep you continue with the same thing you were doing
mark_sweep which only confirms his suspicion

All I was doing was disambiguating what someone was thinking. They misconstrued """"Hoeryong"""" as a Dutch phrase (meaning """"Child of a w""""). In the ref desk entry from the beginning, I meant what if I named a new town after a Korean city? Therefore, I had to tell User:DirkvdM that """"Hoeryong"""" in the way it was intended would be named after a Korean city, not a Dutch phrase. Not once did it ever even cross my mind that this was a continuation of a trollish act. MarkAlexander misconstrued it as such, so can someone please lift the block early?""",0
"Nah, I never really noticed any issues like that growing up in northern Lancaster County.  Most people just accept it as a way of life, and when I was young I thought there were Amish everywhere  not just primarily in Lancaster County.  I'm sure there are some youths that have yelled nasty things and I can recall a couple times where the newspaper's police log mentioned vandalism or verbal abuse; but by-and-large it's not at-all a common occurrence.  Oh, apart from when the Amish teenagers are playing with the electronics in the supermarket... I'll admit even I smirk at that, but people are usually respectful enough to keep their chuckling to themselves.  All of the Amish I know are understanding that they lead a very different way of life and simply ignore any insults thrown their way.

You removed the bit about reviewers being divided on whether or not the game was worth playing if they had access to the Genesis version, which I found puzzling because even your version of the reception section contains reviewers saying that it was distinct enough from the Genesis version to want to play it, or that the reader should search for the Genesis version. 2 sources discuss that even without the gaming sanctuary page.

Similarly, we know that even in Paul's there were """"other Gospels"""" (Galatians 1:6-9) and by the time Irenaeus wrote his Against Heresies (c180 CE) the number of Gospels had definitely increased.  The fact that Irenaeus stated that """"The thirty Æons are not typified by the fact that Christ was baptized in His thirtieth year: He did not suffer in the twelfth month after His baptism, but was more than fifty years old when He died."""" (Book II, Chapter 22) is one Joseph Wheless uses with nearly suppressed glee later on going as far as to say """"In the work often cited, Bishop Irenaeus either falsely quotes the Gospel of Mark, or the sacred text has been seriously altered in our present copies"""" regarding some other point.  While Wheless' ax grinding does get on the nerves and there are some really flaky interpretations and misreadings he does raise some good points.  If as the Pro Historical Jesus camp state that Jesus was born c4 BCE and died c36 CE (a space of only 39 years) then how could Irenaeus expressly state Jesus lived at least 11 years longer than this span and that view was """"as the Gospel and all the elders testify""""?

 some advice 

hi Hboetes.   You are new here and you don't understand the rules very well, much less the spirit that informs them - it is very very unwise to jump straight into a heated dispute as you are doing on the Michael Greger article.  Per the notice above you are edit warring, and if you continue doing that you are going to drive right over a cliff and get blocked.  So really  my advice to you is slow down and learn how we operate (and really learn!).  Ask questions about the relevant wikipedia policies and guidelines that govern our content.

I am sorry about this, but if you really want to get involved, it turns out that Wikipedia is a pretty complex place.  Being an """"encyclopedia that anyone can edit"""" means that over the years, Wikipedia has developed lots of policies and guidelines (PAG) to help provide a """"body of law"""" as it were, that form a foundation for rational discussion.  Without that foundation, this place would be a wild west -  a truly ugly place, where people would just make shit up, about why some content should or should not be in an article, and it would devolve into a bar room brawl.   But with the foundation, there are ways to rationally work things out - if, and only if, all the parties involved accept that foundation and work within it.  One of the hardest things for new people, is to understand not only that this foundation exists, but what its letter and spirit is. (I keep emphasizing the spirit, because too often people fall prey to what we call """"wikilawyering"""")   The more I have learned about how things are set up here - not just the letter of PAG and the various drama boards and administrative tools, but their spirit -  the more impressed I have become at how, well ... beautiful this place is.   It takes time to learn both the spirit and the letter of PAG, and to really get aligned with Wikipedia's mission to crowdsource a reliable, NPOV source of information for the public (as """"reliable"""" and """"NPOV"""" are defined in PAG!).   People come edit for many reasons, but one of the main ones is that they are passionate about something.  That passion is a double-edged sword.  It drives people to contribute which has the potential for productive construction, but it can also lead to WP:TENDENTIOUS editing, which is really destructive.  WP:ADVOCACY is one of our biggest bedevilments. 

So don't edit war - discuss on the talk page. Ask authentic questions, not rhetorical ones, about what policies and guidelines are relevant to the content you care about.  good luck.   """,0
"Are you serious? Nobody looks at the article history to get the information they want.

You are trying to force policies that were designed to guide not to control, down peoples throats, when you should be looking at the larger picture of what an article provides and it's usefulness, before jumping to castrate it.

 Hi Marcuse. I see you've run into Sojambi Pinola. don't mind him, he's a buffoon. He is friend of Biff Rose's. They mention each other on their respective web spots.

Poor Sojambi has been trying to fix it ever since.

It's a rather typical obfuscation tehnique. By accusing every person who posts something that makes an edit to his work, he then marks them as a bad user. It's also reminiscent of those toubling Republican smear tactics of last year- only translated to this site. He's a schmuck. Claims to be latino, then claims to be jewish, then claims to be black, then claims to be white. Next he'll claim to be a woman.

"Progressive Conservative Party still exists

According to your Rump section, there are still Progressive Conservatives who sit in parliament. So the party is not dead. See the extract below.   

Rump PC caucus
Following the merger, a rump Progressive Conservative caucus remained in Parliament, consisting of individuals who declined to join the new Conservative Party. In the House of Commons, Joe Clark, André Bachand and John Herron sat as PC members.

In the 2004 election, Bachand and Clark did not to run for re-election, and Herron ran as a Liberal, losing to Rob Moore in his riding of Fundy—Royal. Scott Brison, who had joined the Liberal caucus immediately upon departing the Conservative Party, was reelected as a Liberal in the 2004 election.

In the Senate, William Doody, Lowell Murray and Norman Atkins also declined to join the new party, and continue to sit as Progressive Conservative senators. On March 24, 2005, Prime Minister Paul Martin appointed nine new senators, two of whom, Nancy Ruth and Elaine McCoy, were designated as Progressive Conservatives. Thus there may be Progressive Conservative senators until 2021 when McCoy, the youngest of the five, attains the mandatory retirement age of 75, or later if subsequent senators designate themselves Progressive Conservatives. Nancy Ruth has since left to sit with the Conservative Party. Adding the death of Senator Doody on December 27, 2005, this reduced the number of PC Senators to three.",0

Turkey is regionally considered middle Eastern by most countries regardless of including the statement. The statement was put there so others wont think that a country like Turkey could possibly have influence on a continent like Europe. By adding that, one is implying that Turkey isn't good enough to influence Europe even though no one is claiming it does. It is also making sure no one assumes Turkey is anything but Middle Eastern.

Citing several sources (some of which are unreliable) about one particular issue which has already been addressed and sourced with notable sources is one thing, deleting edits with notable sources and then copying and pasting those sources to make a point is another.  You wanted the article to talk about Serer Nile Valley migration.  That had already been discussed several times with notable sources like Gravrand, Cheikh Anta Diop, etc.  You also wanted the ethnonym of Serer to reflect the thesis of Diop.  The article already did that with notable sources including Diop himself.  If only you took the time to read the whole article you would have realised that, all these had been addressed. However, you should also appreciate that not every scholar and certainly not the ultra traditionalist Serer who wants nothing to do with Egypt agree with Diop and in fact his thesis were rebutted by several scholars including Schuh, etc.  These are relevant view points which should also be taken into account in other to avoid bias.  

I will now respond to the """"sources"""" that you have provided.

http://books.google.com/books?id=EZLF3T-5tlgC&pg;=PA706&lpg;=PA706&dq;=serer+wolof+north+east+africa&source;=bl&ots;=6ZlcoUiSsf&sig;=zOFR1CQY5BWf2thxHjWIhmq9Q8Y&hl;=en&ei;=BMFiToPpH6HL0QGE142OCg&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=6&ved;=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q;&f;=false

Have you realised that this source is not credible contrary to all the sources cited? Have you also realised that the author referred to the Kingdoms of Sine and Saloum as Wolof states?  Even the least verse on Senegambian history can easily find out for themselves that the Kingdom of Sine and Kingdom of Saloum were Serer Kingdoms not Wolof never mind a supposed scholar.   
Further, all the sources, historical and archaeological evidence shows that the Senegambian stone circles were built by the Serer people. (See: Gravrand, Pangool; Gamble, Salmon and Njie; Burke and Else; and F. Richard).

Since they were built by the Serers, and evidence have shown that they are built well before the 14th century, how then could the Serers have migrated into the area into the 14th century?  That doesn’t make sense.  Now the Serers may have migrated to from the Nile Valley as implied by Henri Gravrand in “La Civilisation Sereer, Pangool”, which is one of the sources cited in the article,  but as noted by Gravrand, if they did came from the Nile it was more than 5 thousand years ago and certainly not the 14th century. Further, as demonstrated by Gamble, Salmon and Njie, the Serer are the oldest inhabitants of Senegambia, others later moved in.  This backs up archealogical source, backs up Gravrand, Kleine, Richard  and so on.  
If your source was referring to the Guelwars of Kaabu coming from Kaabu to Sine in the 14th century at least I could understand that because it was at that time the Battle of Turubang (1335) occurred as stated by Sarr, Becker and others.  Even the Wolofs were already present long before the 14th century never mind the Serer people who have been present for thousand of years. Further as substantiated in the article with credible sources which all backs up each other, the Almoravid wars on Takrur due to religion (Islam) led to the Serers of Takrur who were finally defeated in Battle to leave Takrur and headed south.  That was in the 11th century during Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar and War Jabi.  Even those “Takrurien” Serers came south long before the 14th century to join their other Serer relatives (See Daggs).

This link tells us about the meaning of Serer according to Pierret, which tallies with Diop.  The article had already address this point with notable sources as evident in the article.  However, since there are controversies regarding the meaning of the word, it is relevant to address those as well.  Furthermo",0

"The fact that Jenny is raped while unconscious during the course of the film shows that Jenny may not be aware of all of the sexual encounters she's had.  She may have been raped before, and so her claim that she had only ever had sex with Telly may be false (without her even being aware that it's false.)  I always thought that was the whole point of the rape scene — to show that naive beliefs held by these kids can't be trusted.  Telly's belief that he's only ever slept with virgins is probably false (unless he slept with a virgin who had contracted HIV some other way) and so is Jenny's belief that Telly was her only partner, or that in a culture of random drugged-out sex and casual rape anybody can even be sure who they've slept with.  I've modified the article accordingly.",0

"""It is interesting to see how this debate has never ceased.

When this article was named Myanmar for a long time, there was no real debate over the name of the country. When a small group of wikipedians allowed their emotions to get over their heads and moved this article to Burma right after the height of the 2007 Burmese anti-government protests (which if you checked the details, it showed that the entire moving process was pushed through before most people noticed it), the naming debate has ensued continuously for a full four years and running.

I believe this itself says alot about his classic example of a flaw in the way wikipedia is being exploited by a minority group in the face of widespread opposition, all in the name of """"political correctness"""" which goes against wikipedia's core policies of WP:NPOV. Over 90% of """"Pro-Burma"""" supporters may not always express it outright, but it is clear politics was at play. Conversely, over 90$ of """"Pro-Myanamr"""" supporters where hardly supportive of the current political regime, but simply found this a huge joke on the internet, or like me, were trying to defend wikipedia's core values of NPOV.

It is such a shame that I have teenage students using this incident as an lasting example of why Wikipedia can never be trusted as a viable research source. Today, wikipedia is the only source on Earth which states that the largest city of Burma is Yangon. I can sympathise with people when they laugh at this anomaly.

Reply from ColonelHenry
I have been pissed this week, I admit. Why?
 First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical """"rule nazi"""" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly """"this user is an asshole"""" and explain why and state """"this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia"""" I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say """"asshole"""" once, I get blocked.  She calls me a """"dick"""" over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.
 In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to """"wait until after TFA"""" and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize """"hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.""""  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.
 And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's """"Will to Power"""" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.

As for why, I like """"nineteenth"""" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for """"brevity's sake"""" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to """"kick rocks.""""

As far as I'm concerned, this is over. Move on. I am not addressing this any further, because nonsense like this keeps me from contributing and convinces me to leave Wikipedia again, and this time for good.

 2012 in UFC events 

When the situation calms down (or even before then if you want), would you be willing to do a peer review of 2012 in UFC events?  You aren't heavily involved in MMA articles and have only gotten involved though AfDs of various articles.  If this concept is going to be continued to full year articles (2012 in mixed martial arts) and for past years, I'd be interested in hearing from a somewhat uninvolved person how the articles could be further improved on.    
I will do what I can.  I have commented in a few places with the goal of opening a few minds, but there are many who simply hate change, so it will take some time and patience.  I don't have an exact picture in my head of how it should be done, but I do think you and Mtking are moving the right direction, in spite of a lot of close minded opposition.    
Hey Dennis, you like the rule book right? Well, here you go! WP:NOTBUREAUCRACY
WP:IGNORE   
What you are doing it cherry picking sentences that fit your desires, not understanding the policies as a whole.  I can't fix that, only you can.    

 Excellently written 

This is excellently written, much better than I could have done. If people will listen is another story, but let's not go there. I personally would have linked moved forward without you to WP:5THWHEEL , but that might be a little harsh (or not). Well done. (bainuu)  
I've posted in a few places, a bit of a velvet hammer, if you will.  I don't contribute content to MMA, and I'm hoping that that some people will listen simply because I'm objective, an old timer here and not an admin.  Most won't, but change will be easier if we can change the momentum from negative, to contributory, of a few people at a timer.    
I think it is what was needed, that and your follow up. I'm not an MMA person myself (not since I watched UFC 1 on an illegal PPV box shhhhh). Everyone finds change difficult, on and off wiki, I think you've done a great service with your comments, heeded or not. (bainuu)

 2012 UFC events 

Alright I did some work on it. How's the page looking so far? Any suggestions?   
I'm no expert, but it seems to be shaping up nicely.  Keep in mind that it may change in format several times before it is all said and done, so don't get too attached to any one way of doing things.  Just keep a cool head and talk about it on the talk page.  Sometimes several ways are tried, and they end up going back to the first way.  It is all part of the process.  As you may or may not have noticed, I don't actually contribute to the content on the articles anyway, my function here is mainly to help the transition go more smoothly and help people understand the reasons for the changes.  You know 100x more about MMA than I will ever know, so there isn't much I can do to help you with the actual content.  Your positive attitude toward the changes is very much appreciated.    
Yea I expect more changes, hopefully a name change from """"2012 in UFC events"""" to """"UFC events in 2012"""" will happen, because right now it's having trouble being listed on search engines.  ([[User talk:Glock1",0

 You care about it, as apodictically demonstrated by the fact that you responded and that you changed one of your less-than-literate edits.

Further, you deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

 So by your own words, you must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet you deleted mention of this endoresement in an area where you yourself agree that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit you delete all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

I'll have a think about this.  Some of it amounts to, hmm, not a basic civility, but an outright encouragement.  I'd like to take that up.  Sometimes, however, a citation formatting decline is due to fundamental errors.  I think a Comments with a lapse is better for the first type.  I'm still sticking with Decline for the second type.
A third case is 2c errors concealing 1c errors.  Often real 1c checking can't begin without appropriate citations.  Perhaps this is a subset of the second kind of problem, where citation formatting consistency causes a decline.
Jargon is harder.  Citations are a jargon driven field.  This is mostly where I'll be thinking about it.

Again, I may repeat that I have dealt with utmost consternation AND with due respect (while mentioning the Hon'ble SC) my opinion on the judgement which may qualify as Contempt of Courtsomething which Legalese has not and probably does not even bother to looking on the Talk-page. The purpose of repeatedly levelling baseless charges of Contempt of Court, despite my clarification on the same in the talk-page earlier is beyond my comprehension.

The charge that I am not being a """"good"""" editor can only be levelled as a matter of opinion only, (which I too can leve back at him) and not as a complaint because Legalese is NOT an admin, has no authority, has had no authority on wikipedia on matters related to the judgement of the quality of articles, and even final arbitration on what constitutes as """"good editing"""" or """"Objectionable behaviour"""".

His lecture to me on civility (that too publicly on a talk-page and not on my user:page) is itself very appaling to me-who has been contributing to wikipedia since more than a year now. What is even more appaling is his assumption of a role as the Moral Guardian and as someone who discerns the quality of edits. For attempting to accuse me of AND impose the norms of """"civility"""" and that too incongruous on a talk-page of an article and not personally on my own talk-page, Legalese deserves a warning.

Besides, I never said that I find the """"word-war"""" offending to me on part of Legalese. So an Unconditional Apology on my part does not arise at all. """,0

Fair use rationale for Image:God-of-war2-kratos.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:God-of-war2-kratos.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use.

 New station names - """"Shanghai East"""", """"wuhan South"""", """"Wuhan West"""" - on tielu.org 

I wanted to see how the new train services after the opening of the Shanghai–Nanjing High-Speed Railway show up on www.tielu.org. (I am not endorsing that site, but it just happens to be the one Chinese train schedule site that I am familiar with). As I query """"上海"""" to """"南京"""", the full list of trains shows up, including dozens of the new expensive G trains. The trains that arrive to Shanghai Railway Station are listed as coming to 上海 as expected. But - quite surprisingly - those trains (the majority of the G's) that I believe are going to Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station are shown as arriving to some place called """"上海东"""" (""""Shanghai East"""") instead! So apparently this is how tielu.org chose to call the new Hongqiao Station... Moreover, Wuhan's two """"old"""" stations, the Wuchang Railway Station and the Hankou Railway Station got new monikers as well - 武汉南 (""""Wuhan South"""") and 武汉西 (""""Wuhan West"""") respectively! (See e.g. the schedule for D3010, Wuchang - Shanghai Hongqiao, or, under tielu.org's new dispensation, """"Wuhan West - Shanghai East"""". Now, I have used the tielu.org site long enough, and know that until quite recently Wuchang and Hankou always appeared there under their usual names, none of this """"Wuhan West"""" / """"Wuhan South"""" business.  A quick web search did not find anything particularly useful about this matter, other than a few people's comments on the 武汉南 label for the Wuchang Station on a discussion forum.  If anyone in the know reads this page - could he comment if this """"renaming"""" is simply that website's own idea, or the """"new"""" names have some official or semi-official status?

But I haven't denied that at all! I am myself a subject who considers himself both french and spaniard... with both breton and Asturian  roots... So what? Of course there are roussillonese who may consider themselves catalan without stopping feeling french... I'm just saying that there are no references of studies or scholars (apart that GREC article) to back the sentence in the lead of the article: """"Other Catalan-speaking people from the Pays Catalan in southern France, Andorrans or Valencians are sometimes included in a Catalan ethnic group"""". That sentence is so freely included in wikipedia is just doesn't fit. We could also said that 3/4 of the spaniards may """"also be included in a Almoravid ethnic root""""... I'm sorry, but that is just too POVish.

Let me copy/paste here the first paragraphs of the """"Explanation of the neutral point of view section"""" in Wikipedia:Neutral point of view:

""""The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting verifiable perspectives on a topic as evidenced by reliable sources. The policy requires that where multiple or conflicting perspectives exist within a topic each should be presented fairly. None of the views should be given undue weight or asserted as being judged as """"the truth"""", in order that the various significant published viewpoints are made accessible to the reader, not just the most popular one. It should also not be asserted that the most popular view, or some sort of intermediate view among the different views, is the correct one to the extent that other views are mentioned only pejoratively. Readers should be allowed to form their own opinions.""""

""""The neutral point of view is neither sympathetic nor in opposition to its subject: it neither endorses nor discourages viewpoints. As the name suggests, the neutral point of view is a point of view, not the absence or elimination of viewpoints. The elimination of article content cannot be justified under this policy on the grounds that it is """"POV"""". Article content should clearly describe, represent, and characterize disputes within topics, but without endorsement of any particular point of view. Articles should provide background on who believes what and why, and which view is more popular; detailed articles might also contain evaluations of each viewpoint, but must studiously refrain from taking sides.""""

So, this said, again, I'm not against including that some sources claim the other regions to have some degree of Catalanity, but, as the guideline states """"Articles should provide background on who believes what and why"""". So, my addition that is only the GREC who includes all territories as catalan is correct and, even, necessary in order to let """"Readers [...] to form their own opinions"""". The same way the article should include sources to back that some people consider all territories as catalan, it should also include sources that some others don't.

Do we agree on this? MauritiusXXVII (Aut Disce, Aut Doce, Aut Discede!). """,0

"""Actually, I became interested in editing this very short article (amid Wikipedia's invitation for us to participate in the survey, ending November 3), when all newspapers were flooded with Burlesque King. Nograles was forced to run naked in the hotel. Now, I was not a Wikipedian then, but, when, the landmark acquittal suit was published, I took time to edit this tersely. Nograles placed 2nd to my 1975 counsel in civil case, Atty. Henry R. Villarica, 92.35% higher than Ferdinand Marcos' 92.35% trimmed from 99% due to Marcos blunder in political law subject, in an En Banc review of his test results, 1939. Villarica owns more than 100 pawnshops, and is a very close friend-business assoc. of my brother, in gold and (they have 41/2 ha. Sta. Maria, Bulacan) fighting cock farm. I don't know Ateneo Law School Nograles, but due to the bar rating 2nd place, he is so brilliant. Now, in my 6,500 edits, I happened to have seen and edited like this controversy in bios of USA Senators, etc. So, I just follow the Wikipedia pattern. The difference between Dante Tinga and Nograles, is that, the former was cleared by the Court, but, the Nograles issue of censoring publication by libel lawsuit vs. the naked running, was condemned after Court acquittal for lack of evidence. In Nograles, the acquittal is best Wikipedia evidence to go forth with the edit on Nograles bio-naked thing. Remember the Beatrix of the Netherlands IP address fiasco caught by Wiki scanner? On August 31, 2007, Queen Beatrix’s royal family affirmed that Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau, 38, and his wife Princess Mabel Wisse Smit edited the entry on Wikipedia which described Mabel’s relationship with slain drug baron Klaas Bruinsma (using the queen's palaces’ computer). The changes were found by Dutch media using Wiki Scanner - the entry which states Mabel provided """"incomplete and false information"""" about Bruinsma was changed to just """"incomplete information"""" in January 2006. My point is, in Tinga and Nograles, irrespective of Court acquittal or clearance, the publication of the bribe and Nog's U.P. Oblation run, respectively, with reliable sources, licenses us, editors, to add """"the thing."""" On short edits, I respect IT and other editors, since, it is a matter of style. If I were not a judge or lawyer, or if I were not an A.B. communication, editor, then, like IT and math editors, I would edit with a sentence or 2. But I keep my edits to 3 sentences for this reason: links die in time due to pay per view, and, scholars or readers of Wiki must be provided with a choice, to read more meats or essential ingredients. Also, the libel suit was filed by Nograles, et al. and the subject is the naked run. Now Nograles withdrew due to affidavit of desistance, but, the other complainant did not, and the Court decided based on trial's evidence. So, with more reasons must the edit be there and at the very least, even a sentence, but the essentials of the naked run ought to be there.
Final point. I do not personally know Tinga, but in 1978, I hired a lawyer of Santiago, Tinga, Fornier Law Office, to handle my simple Malolos case. Tinga became congressman and had been well known for this controversy, it is of judicial notice in IBP. Personally, I ignored these, until Douglas Anama, my text mate, the husband of Felipa Borlongan Anama, our Assistant Clerk of the Supreme Court (with the equivalent salary and rank of CA Justice) repeatedly approached me to consult dwarves, due to their case which Tinga decided against him, that's his family home. Tinga is not the only one who had these bribery things; Ynares-Santiago and M. Nazario (remember the Ramos notable contempt fine) shared the pie. My point is - the Court would instead put to rest the issue by fine or contempt. But for us editors, we just follow the pattern in USA bio of senators and public figures. Hence, my edit is well copy pasted from Wikipedia good articles on sub-section controversies. But of course, with all due respect to your edits. Sorry, for my TLDR, but it is so informative. Cheers.

 My position on the two Irelands, using Arbcom and admin abuse 

I give my views on the two Irelands in the paragraphs below, but I will begin with what I feel is most serious.

I've had a look back, and IMO, there is one thing in particular I that is pressing for Wikipedia's future here:

The admin User:Deacon of Pndapetzim must have his adminship fully questioned in the correct place. No one has a chance on Wikipedia when an admin acts (and wheel wars) like he has done – and I believe he has overstepped the line, and made a difficult but legal situation into a nightmare situation for everyone. I warned him of the mayhem that would be caused if Ireland was simply reverted into being a cultural all-island article, but he ignored me. This edit note (and selective deletion) is an example of the kind of intellectual demeaning by admin that lead to me losing my own temper. You cannot treat adults like children. It shows feelings of superiority in being an admin - which must not be condoned. Aside from his attitude, the way he reversed admin Tariqabjotu's Ireland Move, citing a very small hand-picked selection of admin who share his personal position on this - to his own personal wishes, was totally unacceptable. Where were all the other admin I saw who spoke up? For reasons I give after after I get the following paragraph off my chest, he completely shattered Wikipedia for me when he did that, and his reasoning for doing it showed it to be nothing other than an act of hypocrisy, as well as self interest. Arbitration are not there to be interested themselves (by their own admission) - they are only there to be there, and there is nowhere else now to to go. It has all been completely messed up now – so Arbcom has to be pulled in.

I regret that I am leaving Wikipedia with the worse kind of people in my mind, in a place that is actually full of fantastic unacknowledged philanthropy. I won't go the way of saying what I (100%, in all good faith, IMHO, genuinely, without doubt etc, etc) honestly think this is comparable to - people call it a 'Godwin', a commonly-used term which belittles the technical purity of the very example - an early internet 'battle' won by some clever person, for sure. But you have to think beyond the cliche. The talk-page admin 'cop out' over any car crash, is normally to pretend this place is just a pastime, but WIkipedia is a little more important than that - no? And conspiracy theorising - don't point that one at me – it us such an ugly slur. Who needs those, when you give ‘’individuals’’ so much power? People group - they always do. The only 'conspiracy' could be within wondering why Wikipedia has to be structured in this way. It's a Sunday drive, and includes the world - but anything difficult like this? The structure simply breaks down. So do some people want a loose ship? A negative answer would have little to do with the Irelands anyway.

Two wrongs don't make a right, and equally bad is a wrong made after a right. Now how was Deacon right? The first move to Ireland disam/(state)/(island) was rational and sound 'policy-over-polling', the reversal (in the horrendous way it was done) was wrong in every possible way. Those who were interested in doing so, simply needed to re-debate it from where it was (perhaps prove it in a global poll?). But why should I do even more work towards facilitating that? I have given hundreds of hours of my life to this already. And where now were those originally opposing? A number of them were addressing new content. The carefully avoided truth is that a global poll (so hard to bring about – I know, as I’ve tried) would simply bring in changes. I gave my time editing the changes I saw before me, and my work has been cynically thrown down the drain. And look at the edit frenzy now! Too few admin actually give a shit when people's time is wasted. The reversal of tariqabjotus's move has vindicated every troll, SPA, contentious editor, sock-maker and IP-abuser watching, who in this Ireland problem, are the worker-minions of the wholly-debilitating 'dual Irish country' """"solution"""".

Ireland isn't Palestine, it isn't the People's Republic of China, it's just a country commonly called 'Ireland' on an island which has two states on it (one with a sea divide) - called Ireland - and Wikipedia, despite the efforts of so many, hasn't been allowed to properly address and present that undeniable fact. The Irish country now has two time-sharing homes again - two mixed-up modern-day country articles, one of them subsuming part of a separate country altogether - simply because it shares the island. Silly non-policy arguments about where to put historical 'Ireland's aside, there has always been an Irish nation (covering all or most",0

OK thank you. I think i am learning a lot more now.,0
"Truth is I'm not as convinced as Livingston is that Arnold so easily believed in a transcendent God.  Nonetheless, this statement from a notable scholar (not to mention those of Ruth apRoberts) should make us stop short of a strong pronouncement one way or the other.  The eminent scholars are in a quandary on this one (and I am quite reticent to place myself in any category of eminence on this matter), surely their quandary is reason enough for us to look at least for some more qualified statement, and I mean to include by that my own substitute which no doubt also lacked sufficient qualification.

I cannot lay my hands on it just now, but Arnold does say at one point, somewhat defensively, that he believes in God.  I think the problem is that Arnold's beliefs are not really so easily categorizable.  He makes it clear that Spinoza's thoughts appeal to him.  He also clearly states that he believes Spinoza was mis-judged in his time in being declared a heretic.  Part of our problem here might be that today we are so divorced from these older discussions of religion that we only see two alternatives: the belief in a transcendent, historical God, a God with physical attrributes; or no belief in God or anything that even remotely smacks of the metaphysical.  Our only possibility for a middle ground today may well be agnosticism (although, on a personal note, my own beliefs fall into the middle ground, and I would be insulted if anyone ever called me an agnostic, that however is not an argument that should have any relevance for the case with Arnold).  Arnold, I suspect, was quite comfortable dismissing superstition and setting aside metaphysical concerns, while still believeing in God.  The physicality or metaphysicality of that God were not relevant to the virtue they brought to Arnold and to his society.  In his own time he was accused of wanting to eat his cake and take it, too.  But he held out, and to my knowledge mever admitted the doubts that are implicit in agnosticism.

In other words, I think with Arnold, Livingston overstates the case for him, he is not at the center of Protestant thought; Arnold really belongs to a middle ground that is more concerned with the poetry of relgion and its virtues and values for society.  But to call him an agnostic probably places him in an aspect of the middle ground that he would never have felt comfortable inhabiting.  Sorry to offer no quotations.  Let me see what I can find and get back with you.",0

Tone and style of article

Just a passerby and not a wikipedia editor per se. However, I felt compelled to leavea comment regarding the tone and style of the article: it suffer from sounding very personal, and has a tone of what one would expect a non-scholar explaining something in emphatic language. (the overabundance of quotation marks is one symptom, but there are other, such as the """"for the benefit of Europeans"""", which takes away from the neutral tone an encyclopedic article.) I'm not an expert on the subject (in fact I know very little about it, which is why I came here), but even to me it would be better if the page instead sourced a number of published treatises/works on the subject instead of going into a quasi-emotional and ambiguous personal essay-style on the subject. It sounds to me like the article attempts to unite the various concepts and make it as culturally vague and generalized and """"acceptable"""" (as in, lacking cultural, ritual and mythical specifics that would make different versions more characterized) as possible - and this makes the article sounds a little - dare I say - """"New Agey"""". (for lack of a better term.) I think more people would appreciate more specific mythic instances and rituals that specifically dealt with the Great Spirit/Mystery (and also those that established important differences between various views on the subject, as one would expect from proper research) - if those are available - as opposed to the currently rather watered-out explanation. 

As this is a very interesting subject, I'm looking forward to seeing how the article develops. ) Best of luck.

 Issue with an editor 

Hi there Bhadani. Recently there has been an user Aftab Kiran whose contributions are limited to just 3 topics, Operation Polo, Nizam and Hyderabad State. He seems to revert to his POV version of history which isn't backed up by references and despite other editors reverting his edits, he continues to revert. I've spoken to him, but he has behaved in an uncivil manner abusing me as being one of those who destroyed the Babri Masjid! I hope you can either block him or semiprotect those pages to avoid his editing because he's consistently coming back for last 2-3 weeks to revert.  
My reply copied from his talk page: Forget him - Hello. I am talking to you after a long time. Forget him: . In case people find that one destructive, he/he shall be suitably dealt with by someone. I find that taking any action is of no use as our processes are not capable of dealing with such destructive edits, if any! Thanks.

I agree with the above summary.
In my view, this is a textbook example of when not to force the article's title into the lead.  """"2011 Tucson shooting"""" isn't a widely accepted name for the incident.

And unlike cases such as Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre, the phrase doesn't arise naturally when referring to the event.

 Most Haunted 

I'm concerned about the references to the """"Most Haunted"""" show in the Cultural References section.

Although """"possessed"""" is in inverted commas, I think it would be more accurate to say that he """"appeared to be possessed"""". Acorah was supposedly """"possessed"""" by some """"spirit"""" every week and in fact, he was later dropped from the Most Haunted shows after the team became convinced he was making things up from bits of information he overheard during filming. Thirdly, some of the audience say they see """"dark beings"""" and other such things on the webcams every week - not just in this programme. I think it really would be better to limit the Most haunted reference to the fact that it was the most watched programme on television that night, as the rest of it is unsubstantiated speculation that trivialises the subject.

Dear User:Addhoc, I am hopeful, regarding the appeal for Justice made by User:Lakki Marwat. You are having good record impression and pleasant attitude.

So you correct me in a lovely manner, as a human deserves to be corrected in such a way.

Here I must tell you one thing humbly, that I don't want to discuss the edits on the article Marwat. I believe the edits should be into discussion at article’s discussion page. Where no one likes to discuss but keep on approaching administrations for their help.

Anyhow, I just would like to make you know one thing, by drawing your attention towards article Marwat that is vandalise by one of the fellow who is having almost similar username to article. 

If you visit the Discussion Page of article Marwat, you will find a paragraph (#19), written by User:Marwatt. In that paragraph (#19), heading and first line is written in pure Pashto Language (the headline and first-line is quoted below in bold).

Addhoc, doesn’t this means that this is a challenge and there is a personal enmity, political enmity besides this editing (vandalism)? 

See the discussion page of that article, User:Marwatt is fail to defend his edit/deletes, clearly.

Minor wording issue about steamboats
I'm doing some bits of minor copyediting and am stuck on this sentence, from the Navigation section: The use of steamboats along the river, beginning in 1850... There is a footnote, to this timeline page, which phrases it """"1850: Steamboats Columbia and Lot Whitcomb begin regular service on the Columbia River."""" The thing is there were steamboats in regular service on the river before 1850, at least to Fort Vancouver. The first was the Beaver (steamship), which arrived at Ft Vancouver in 1836. I thought about rewording the sentence The regular use of steamboats along the river..., but that isn't quite right either because the Beaver was in """"regular use"""", even if its operations were not limited to the river.

I'm sorry to inform you that you're contravening Wikipedia principles, namely Wikipedia is not a publisher of original research and accounts must not be shared. Unfortunately, this may lead to your being blocked or your contributions being removed.

Wikipedia tries to aggregate information that reliable sources have previously published; we do not publish original research ourselves.

I advise you to save copies of your articles to your computers, particularly Learning-Disadvantage Gap, as it may be deleted from Wikipedia soon.

A less fundamental problem is that shared accounts are not allowed. I don't really know why (I'm pretty new here); maybe we've had problem editors hide under group accounts in the past. Whatever the reason, the fact that you are a group of people sharing one account is grounds for blocking.

 Speedy deletion of Jennifer Tinsley-Williams  

A tag has been placed on Jennifer Tinsley-Williams requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

Please see Wikipedia:Stub for our minimum information standards for short articles.

 Farting 

I reverted this article back to a recent version that contained the term fart. Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia (not a medical one), and its important to use a term that a majority of people know. Flatulence is no more or less a """"proper"""" term than farting is, and its definetly not slang  its use is too common, everyday, and widespread. It would be a misservice the readers to simply ignore this important term. Its such a odd thing to want to sensor.
  
I agree. Why use the word """"flatus"""" all over the place? People don't know it's fart. Doctors know it's fart, and, well, doctors are people, but they ain't most people. The common term is fart or gas.  —   | Talk 
The reason seems pretty obvious to me: """"fart"""" is a much rougher, less """"refined"""" word. Using it casually is simply not appropriate tone for an encyclopedia. -  (Talk at me) 

 Citations needed 

Oh come on, not EVERY sentence needs a citation now, does it.. It makes articles really hard to read and is just silly. I am talking about the section """"Dietary"""" where every second word has a citation or """"citation needed"""". Whoever posted all that is obsessed with citations. seriously!217.231.205.126  
I agree, especially since the rest of the article doesn't seem to conform to the extreme citation standards in the Dietary section. Additionally, some of the stuff is a given and doesn't really need a citation unless you happen to be an alien from another planet who is completely unfamiliar with Earth, in which case it remains a mystery how this alien learned enough english to understand this article without learning some basic information about humans and Earth. Not everyone is a wikipedia administrator, y'know. 74.56.36.34

 Pallava are Brahmin 

Pallavas are brahmins. They have made many inscriptions claiming that they are are brahmins of Bharadvaja gotra. Hence Pallavas are not considered as tamil kings.

Then what happened to the decendants of the Pallava kings in Tamil Nadu?

Pallavas never claimed as brahmans at the start of their power. Later only some Pallavas left some inscriptions as they belonged to Bharadwaja Gothra.

The early Pallavas belonged to Nanthi gothra. Pallavas used NANTHI (BULL) their emblem. Kaikolans are still belong to NANTHI GOTHRA.

I hope the pius DEVADASI system became a system of only dancing and prostitution after the demise of the PALLAVA empire.

Your make a good point.  Let me first address it from the perspective of Marshall Hodgson.

Civilization is a somewhat arbitrary term, often narrowly defined by language.  This obviously has its limits.  On the other hand, the more broadly you define a civilization, the more subgroupings it must include.  Eventually, we come to see civilizations as groupings useful for the purpose at hand.  And ultimately, civilizations, like religions, are self-defined.

Hodgson considers the lands of Islam to constitute a world civilization.  He calls Islam a world civilization in the title of his book The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization.

For another perspective, I can turn to H. Patrick Glenn, in Legal Traditions of the World, speaking on tradition and identity.  Not all is arbitrary in the definition of a tradition, or civilization.

Glenn quotes Fernand Braudel, who speaks of an """"underlying structure"""" of civilization; """"those elements of a civilization which could not be changed without a fundamental change, or more probably disappearance, of the tradition itself.""""  Applying this criteria to Islamic civilization, one immediately understands that structure to be the religion of Islam.

To summarize: looking at the lands of Islam, with its concept of Umma, the shared traditions, the shared Arabic religious and often secular language, and indeed the shared religion of Islam, it seems logical to fall in with those who perceive the outline of a world Islamic civilization.

 Wikipedia:Linking 

Tony, FYI, I've restored the change to """"relevant"""" at Wikipedia:Linking. For one, it was suggested/changed by two separate editors in the past week as preferable to """"germane"""". I'd agree that """"relevant"""" does feel more accessible to a general audience, and several dictionary and thesaurus definitions indicate that the terms are interchangeable in this context. If there is a link to a point when specific language using """"germane"""" was agreed to, could you please provide it? If so, I'll self-revert, but otherwise it seems best to stick with """"relevant"""". ''''''chatspy """,0

    I wholeheartedly disagree with your stance on the subject, I believe there is ample evidence to prove the company under the supervision of the CEO in question was not only constructive but accurate. Terry Semel has ran a company which has gave money to lobby groups which wish to alter the design of the internet to favor profit over ingenuity. This would effectively change the measure for which code is ranked since it would also be determined by its purchased bandwidth priority over performance. This would not only have an effect on those involved in the programming industry but change the way the internet works for the entire world. Now from Wikipedia's own article on the subject an asshole is slang described as """"The word is mainly used as a profanity towards someone the speaker does not like or whose behavior is hurtful, self-centered, or particularly abrasive.""""

Biased?
I am curious as to why it would seem that the U.S was singled out for a complete page on national racism? - I have yet to find a page dedicated to racism in other countries such as Africa, Britain, Mexico, Brazil, Iran, etc etc. 

Why is it that a whole page is dedicated to racism in the U.S as if it is/was the only country to marginalize persons by race?

I believe that this page should be merged into a general page of world racism, or just be deleted altogether, it's a little more than """"biased"""" in my opinion.  

See Racism by country. We deal with the """"bias"""" of missing articles on Wikipedia by writing new articles. See WP:CSB if you want to help provide a more global view. By the way, people who say Africa is a country might raise a few hackles among other editors writing about racism. 

The situation in the United States is unique in terms of its special brand of racism, the completeness of the...the campaign against Native Americans, the special circumstances surrounding the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the particularities of this version of slavery, the premises and outcome of the Civil War, and especially the complex time period following emancipation. This period is fairly unique in many ways, including but not limited to the fact that a bifurcated society developed with the former slave class developing in parallel alongside the former slave-owning class with visible distinctions in terms of melanin and linguistic distinctions resulting from the circumstances of the previous centuries, the long process of segregation, Jim Crow, the rise of African-American influence on mainstream American culture, KKK, White Citizens Councils and lynchings, and the long drive for the abolition of Jim Crow and the securing of the right to vote not only on paper but in practice, and the fact that many of the goals have been achieved, though how thorough this achievement has been is still a topic of debate. Most historical precedents result in one race wiping out the other, either by killing or displacement. To merge this article would be like merging an article on the Second world War into a general article on War, or merging the article on Homo Sapiens into an article on mammals. It makes no sense.
The truth hurts, but it's still the truth. This is a website for facts.

I see where you hesitated with the ellipsis.  The American campaign against the Natives involved such things as biological warfare, enslavement, mass rape, forced migration, and ordinary massacres. It was nothing less then genocide.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.132.84.67   """,0

The Crying of Lot 49

ONE summer afternoon Mrs Oedipa Maas came home from a Tupperware party whose hostess had put perhaps too much kirsch in the fondue to find that she, Oedipa, had been named executor, or she supposed executrix, of the estate of one Pierce Inverarity, a California real estate mogul who had once lost two million collars in his spare time but still had assets numerous and tangled enough to make the job of sorting it all out more than honorary. Oedipa stood in the living room, stared at by the greenish dead eye of the TV tube, spoke the name of God, tried to feel as drunk as possible. But this did not work. She thought of a hotel room in Mazatlan whose door had just been slammed, it seemed forever, waking up two hundred birds down in the lobby; a sunrise over the library slope at Cornell University that nobody out on it had seen because the slope faces west; a dry, disconsolate tune from the fourth movement of the Bartok Concerto for Orchestra; a whitewashed bust of Jay Gould that Pierce kept over the bed on a shelf so narrow for it she'd always had the hovering fear it would someday topple on them. Was that how he'd died, she wondered, among dreams, crushed by the only ikon in the house? That only made her laugh, out loud and helpless: You're so sick, Oedipa, she told herself, or the room, which knew.

The letter was from the law firm of Warpe, Wist-full, Kubitschek and McMingus, of Los Angeles, and signed by somebody named Metzger. It said Pierce had died back in the spring, and they'd only just now found the will. Metzger was to act as co-executor and special counsel in the event of any involved litigation. Oedipa had been named also to execute the will in a codicil dated a year ago. She tried to think back to whether anything unusual had happened around then. Through the rest of the afternoon, through her trip to the market in downtown Kinneret-Among-The-Pines to buy ricotta and listen to the Muzak (today she came through the bead-curtained entrance around bar 4 of the Fort Wayne Settecento Ensemble's variorum recording of the Vivaldi Kazoo Concerto, Boyd Beaver, soloist); then through the sunned gathering of her marjoram and sweet basil from the herb garden, reading of book reviews in the latest Scientific American, into the layering of a lasagna, garlicking of a bread, tearing up of romaine leaves, eventually, oven on, into the mixing of the twilight's whiskey sours against the arrival of her husband, Wendell (""""Mucho"""") Maas from work, she wondered, wondered, shuffling back through a fat deckful of days which seemed (wouldn't she be first to admit it?) more or less identical, or all pointing the same way subtly like a conjurer's deck, any odd one readily clear to a trained eye. It took her till the middle of Huntley and Brinkley to remember that last year at three or so one morning there had come this long-distance call, from where she would never know (unless now he'd left a diary) by a voice beginning in heavy Slavic tones as second secretary at the Transyl-vanian Consulate, looking for an escaped bat; modulated to comic-Negro, then on into hostile Pachuco dialect, full of chingas and maricones; then a Gestapo officer asking her in shrieks did she have relatives in Germany and finally his Lamont Cranston voice, the one he'd talked in all the way down to Mazatlan. """"Pierce, please,"""" she'd managed to get in, """"I thought we had""""

""""But Margo,"""" earnestly, """"I've just come from Commissioner Weston, and that old man in the fun house was murdered by the same blowgun that killed Professor Quackenbush,"""" or something.

""""For God's sake,"""" she said. Mucho had rolled over and was looking at her.

""""Why don't you hang up on him,"""" Mucho suggested, sensibly.

""""I heard that,"""" Pierce said. """"I think it's time Wendell Maas had a little visit from The Shadow."""" Silence, positive and thorough, fell. So it was the last of his voices she ever heard. Lamont Cranston. That phone line could have pointed any direction, been any length. Its quiet ambiguity shifted over, in the months after the call, to what had been revived: memories of his face, body, things he'd given her, things she had now and then pretended not to've heard him say. It took him over, and to the verge of being forgotten. The shadow waited a year before visiting. But now there was Metzger's letter. Had Pierce called last year then to tell her about this codicil? Or had he decided on it later, somehow because of her annoyance and Mucho's indifference? She felt exposed, finessed, put down. She had never executed a will in her life, didn't know where to begin, didn't know how to tell the law firm in L. A. that she didn't know where to begin.

True. Caste/Community related stuff are really difficult to grasp immediately given the complex nature of Indian society. I can understand that you need more time to fully analyse the issue. Take your own time and I am always there to help you in case you need more references   
, we have agreed to maintain the original content till the discussion is over. An anon 122.164.191.109 have edited the article without any references and you have reverted it partially. Change it back to original content as of Nov13. By the way, any updates from your side ? You can take your own time but make sure to maintain the original content   

We need to maintain the original version till the dispute is resolved. Anonymous edits and partial reverting will only lead to more confusions. If people continue to edit, I propose to remove all caste names from the article till the dispute is resolved.   

Sorry, I thought that I had fully reverted the ip. Anyway, I've read all the English items, in some cases more than once.I can see that the Gounder community phrase is used in the sense of meaning the KV community, but that is only apparent if there is a """"hook"""" in the article to give it some context. Eg: an article talks abour the KMK, you know that KMK = KV, and so when it then says """"Gounder community"""" then the context makes it is obvious that they mean KV. I've not explained that particularly well, but short version: yes, in the examples Gounder community = KV.

The problem is, that is not good enough. You cannot prove that the term is not used to refer to other groups of Gounder than the KV, nor could I find a really clear-cut example among the English language sources: all of them demanded that the reader already knew some background - eg: that KMK = KV party. Sure, you know that but someone born & bred in the UK or USA, Germany or Guatemala, Australia and Austria most probably will not. In that sense, you are engaging in synthesis, and we are not allowed to do that here.

You said that the Tamil sources were important. Are they really going to resolve the issues that I raise? In particular, is even one of them going to explicitly say that the term is used either """"always"""" or """"most frequently"""" to refer to KVs? -   

, none of them will say, Gounder """"always"""" refers to KVs because there are other communities too that are using the title. But you need to view from another angle. Why other communities (non-Kvs) are not referred as just Gounder Community ? Because, all the sections of Vettuvars, Vanniyars, Vokkaligas don't use Gounder title. Only some sections of those communities use the title and hence they cannot be generally referred as Gounder community. This gives the freedom to refer KVs as Gounder community. 

""""All of them demanded that the reader already knew some background - eg: that KMK = KV party"""". This is not very difficult. We can attach this reference along with other references to prove that KMK or KMP = KV party. Anyway, if this not enough, here is another reference which says about Gounder community (taken from Deccan Chronicle). Persons belonging to Kongu Vellalar are mentioned as persons from Gounder Community.To prove that, Gounder community mentioned here refers to Kongu Vellalar, I have attached the proof here. which says Sengottaiyan is a Kongu Vellalar. No need to infer from KMP or KMK. This reference will directly establish that Gounder Community mentioned refers to Kongu Vellalar. [[User:Mahevenki|Mahevenki",0

I doubt that the remaining editors did enough edits to offset that loss and certainly counting bot edits we are missing out on a lot. With that said, the corps Wikipedia site seems to be operating progressively slower with each new release so that IMO is at least part of the reason for the decline. Also, the tabs tend to jump around a lot on slow connections so editors not familiar with the site get turned off rather quickly by have to play chase the wild button around.

For very well-known celebrities, the US government archives may have something: a Google image search on """"site:.gov"""" may bring something up.  Also, the search engine on the Archives website (http://www.archives.gov/) may find things that Google doesn't.  For people with military service, the military might have something (Google search on """"site:.mil"""").

For celebrities that were well-known before 1950, there may be newspaper photographs that have fallen out of copyright.  These will be hard to find, but the Library of Congress (http://www.loc.gov/) may have something.

A further option is to contact the celebrity's agent or estate and ask for an image to be released under GFDL, Creative Commons attribution, or Creative Commons sharealike-attribution licenses.

In my opinion, if free-use images can't be found, the second-best choice is a promotional photo: it's an image that is intended to be distributed widely.  Of course, there are exceptions: for albums, singles, and DVDs, a low-resolution scan of the cover is always appropriate.  For movies, a still from a well-known scene or a low-resolution scan of a promotional poster is good.  Failing all else, other fair-use images can be used, but they need to be tagged, justified, have the source/copyright owner credited, and used very sparingly.

As for the images at Iron Maiden, I'm still trying to figure out how strict I should be about fair-use images: all the images there are directly related to the subject of the article (except Image:PrisonerNovel.jpg, which I've just removed), all of them have some semblance of a source indicated, all of them have some semblance of a fair-use justification, and none of them seem to be surplus to the needs of the article.

For example, as a expert on the history of technology, I would prefer more treatment of that topic in this article, but I also concede that history of technology is a rather dry subject for most people and therefore I'm satisfied with the brief mention and links it gets.  Everyone had to give a little to make the current readable version possible; the earlier versions (check the history) a couple of years ago were really bloated.",0

"Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii
Ekadashi, in Vedic (Vaishnava) calendar is a fasting day. This is day of Lord Hari (Vishnu), so one has to dedicate this day to Vishnu, thus one has to do more fasting, especially from crops (beans). In Vedas persons refrain from meat, eggs, flesh/blood 'food' completely, but on this day (Ekadashi) one even refrains from beans/crops like rice, as Kali (material lust) may hide there on Ekadashi day. This day Vishnu has to be satisfied and not our tongue, belly etc.

Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii occurs during the light fortnight (shukla paksha) of the extra, leap year month known as Adhika month. This Adhika month is considered to be very auspicious (adhika = best or greatest), as Vishnu appearing Himself. This month (Adhika Maasa) comes once every two (sometimes three) years, and so also this Ekadashi. Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii'' comes on Purushottam Shukla Paksh'''.

You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!  Dodo (and many others) amount to semi-professional BUSYBODIES who strut their stuff by interfering with others' use of WP.  Stop it.

Inquirer.net is a reliable resource but the particular Inquirer.net article that you used as reference never mentioned that the Ang Dating Doon segment is a parody of Ang Dating Daan. In fact, the name of the program Ang Dating Daan cannot be found anywhere on that Inquirer.net article. Therefore, it does not qualify as reference, not because Inquirer.net is not reliable, but because the idea that you're trying to convey is not supported by the article. Dar book, it is actually you who is bellittling Philippine-related articles by your reckless and uneducated editing. If you truly value Philippine-related articles then you should be extra careful not to destroy their quality and credibility. Also, since you are editing the Tagalog Wikipedia, may I suggest that you begin creating a Tagalog version of the English WP articles on Eli soriano and Ang Dating Daan? If you don't do it, someone else is going to do it sooner or later.

First, you shouldn't write articles about yourself, or your organization.

After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

I'd appreciate learning your views, for instance, your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

There are several options available to you:

 You can abandon the contributions made under this name and create a new account that meets our username policy and addresses the concern(s) noted above.
 Or, if you want to keep your contributions history under a new name, then you should visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the instructions there.

As the article sees the Holocaust as a mainly Jewish event, it would be highly unlikely that it would be featured, else to fly in the face of academics and commonly held social views.

It is not a case of also these groups were killed, it is the thematic of groups targetted, groups killed. Lest we forget the first killed at Auschwitz were not Jewish.

"I'm not clear whether a picture of a child's genitalia is legitimate or not - you appear to be more familiar with the way it works than me; perhaps you should ask whether images of children's genitalia are acceptable on Wikipedia.

I object to it for several reasons.  The is first that it is an image of a child's genitalia (albeit deceased), which is not usually accepted online for non-intersex children, and I am not sure why intersex childrens' genitals should be an exception to this.  Second, the example in question is quite an extreme case, where the child had a number of complications which meant it did not survive, and the genital ambiguity was one aspect of those complications.  I would worry that people seeking information and support would find this paper quite shocking, and as you are no doubt aware, it is an extremely rare case which has limited bearing on the experiences of the majority of intersex people.  So, is it a representative image (and link) on intersex?  No, it is not.  So, why is it there?  Finally, I resist the reduction of intersex issues to simply being about genital ambiguity - just as I resist the reduction to XY/XX chromosomes and all that entails.  I am sure that there would be better, fully consensual, images available if required - although I am not sure why they are necessary.  People who are involved with intersex in some way will not find it informative or helpful, so the only purpose appears to be either for 'shock' value or voyeurism, neither of which seem valid reasons for having the picture on Wikipedia.",0

Here on Wikipedia, my daughter was treated with insolence, which is unacceptable: . That was after one month from when they joined Wikipedia. They jumped into mediation only two days after joining, but the intentions are very evident:

The reason I switched accounts is clearly known, to help protect my daughter from harassment on Wikipedia and still try to contribute: . 

She has persisted ever since to cover it up:  (and the recent event on AN/I, and ArbCom) (I actually had to look up what forum shopping meant.)

"Finaly the Truth from Maratha  Vishal1976 

I have posted many images of Hindu / Arya /Indian wrestlers but just got time to read this rediculious discussion about this very article and i want to show , point out the realites about the wrestling and ground leval facts. But important i don't want to insult any one , specially the creator of this article but just want to show the truth.
1) The objection that the art of wrestling never existed in india and it is imported from Iran and other outside countries is pure colonial tact. As you can find out that any good thing which comes from India is not real Indian / Aryan / Hindu but is imported from outside to India and we Indians are basterd offsprings from that .No new to we!! The great Alfanso Mangos are not local from Konkan region but are brought to India by the Portugies and such other numerious theories put in this new world firstly by the British and later by Amiricanus. Brother Iranians i have read little history of Iran. As we all know that originaly all Iranians befoure the birth of Islam were not muslims but Aryan as the word Iran itself stands for littrley as the dewwlling of Aryans outside mainland India. And what happned when the Arabs now converted to Islam attacted to Iran ?? Were the gret Iranians who now boast that they are the creator and founder of this wrestling art able to protect the own country and ther religion ?? No!! No!!. And to escape from this attct wher the Iranians flead ?? Even to China !! O.K NOW TELL ME WE Aryans/ Marathas / Hindus / Indians fought 1000 years to Islamic invision and reuled and 200 years of British rule and now where are we and where are those grate Mughals/ Brtish / Afghans/ Pakistanis/ Turks / ETC . Thre truth is that we Aryans / Marathas / Hindus / Indians not only surveyed but overcome this invision and eat those invaders and will eat in feauter. We were succesful not only to get freedom but also keep alive our Arya/ Hindu religion along with our gods , traditions , educations such as Ayurveda , Yoga . Dance , Music and all other properties.
I dont want to get involved in to more discussion because i am alone and in my surrounding neberhood yor fans and brothers are present. I am awere of this fact as anyone can gess from the present condition of India.

2) The objection that the WWF wrestling in the world is facke , circus and not worthy to call as real wrestling and those who perform it as wrestler. Yess. I do agree. I have seen those WWF entertienment on cable TV sINCE 1992 and from the begining i was desliking to this Americanus beggares play. But in reality in my surrounding i have observerd great wrestlers and seen how much respect our Maratha society gives to these wrestlers.The traditional Maratha wrestling and wrestler has many sides and aspects , i will discuss it later but any way one can understand it if he is clever.Allthough these Indian wrestler are not successful in international competations such as Olympics , But if you see the ecomomic and weather conditions of India you may find the answer.In our Maratha society wrestiling is a good social title and way of life such as Docters and other professionals.   I use to workout and do exircise when i was in school and college and aimes to earn great body. I never exirsised in traditional Indian mud wrestling gym but in western kind of modern gym and before that some traditional exirsises and other like cricket , boxind etc.
I am owner of good body and realy have loved and perpormed workouts so i belive that i have right to say somthing about wrestling.
3)  As we can see now that the western world is now accepting the importance of Ayurveda and othe Aryan traditions and properties so in neare feature this Aryan art may see good days ans enriche the humanity.",0

 Archives 
 Archive 1 Friday 12th August 2005  Talk:Jack Abramoff/Archive 1 I made some substantial edits to the page and archived the entire earlier talk since it was mostly to do items since dealt with. 

COPYVIO
This article and it's sister screed are embarrassments to wikipedia.  They're essentially the same and both reflect the authors politocal hatred and zeal.  Both also have severe irredemable copyright problems and are and embarrasment to wikipedia.  They need to be deleted immediately.   

Alot of this article DOES seem to be a blatent copyvio.  Tyco, as below, was edited (the text was accurate, but half the news story was pasted in here).  You cannot just wholesale paste in paragraphs of text from a news story, attribute a link, and it not be a copywrite violation.  It's called Plagerism. 
  
 Tyco 
Almost the whole tyco section is a blatent rip from the WAPO article.  I've removed  part of it, as it needs to be re-written. 

I think I've cleaned much of the CopyVio stuff up, hopefully.  There is alot of non-essential stuff in this article about peripheral people, and not about Abramoff, however.  It needs to be cleaned up more, as the article meanders alot here and there.  

I reverted some things you took out (outside the Tyco section), like in the """"Early years"""" section and in the intro about DeLay. That material is not copyright infringement because it is properly sourced when directly quoted.  

It still needs to be rewritten to not be a direct copy paste unless you are going to quote it.  Just providing a link is not attribution, and copying entire paragraphs out of an article is plagiarism, not 'fair use' unless you are quoting. Also, if you are going to say 'the los angeles times reports' you need to source the times, not a 
secondary source (i.e. democracy now).

I modified the quote and attributed properly.

 

The speech from Tom DeLay is a direct quote (it's in quotations) so of course it is taken word-for-word from the source. I'll tweak the setup to the quote a little better as per your request. Here's the primary source for the other thing.  

No problem.  If I see something that is probable CopyVio I tend to chop it out first, and then rework it (I don't usually just leave it out, if the quote is accurate).  Btw have you found a link for the franken quote, I can't find anything other than on blogs.  Honestly I'm not sure what the relevence to an article on Abramoff is, really, anyway.

 The """"forced abortions"""" part was originally reported by Brian Ross at ABC News for 20/20 on March 13, 1998. It also appears in Al Franken's book The Truth (with jokes)'' in the """"Tom DeLay Saipan Sex Tour and Jack Abramoff Casino Getaway"""" chapter. Since we've agreed that primary sources are key, i've change the attribution in the article.  

 The Indian tribes scandal 
 
This area is a mess, I have tried to clean it up a bit and structure it better. It may be best to create a new page on the tribes scam and point the Reed, Norquist etc pages to it.

Basically we need fewer facts and more context. At the moment the page is simply a list of transactions that may or may not have been legit with a strong implication that they were not legit. 

I moved the whole scandal to its own page. This makes much more sense since although Abramoff is a major player in that scandal there are several others who are significant players, in particular Ralph Reed. I am not doing this to hide the scandal, I think that people looking for info on i",0

I think I have a way to resolve this unfortunate Billy the Kid issue. If you will give me a moment, I first want to explain how we got to this point from my perspective. A lot has been made over my alleged failure to adhere to the preferred Wikipedia manual of style. That failure on my part is simply not being as well versed on the various Wikipedia guidelines as I probably should be. I am not trying to disrupt your standards. Indeed, I would appreciate any and all the help I can get, along with the active participation by experienced Wikipedia editors to bring the Billy the Kid article in line with Wikipedia standards. 

I am not trying to defy or insult anyone. There seems to be a misunderstanding that suggests I seem to think that I have some kind of """"ownership"""" over the subject of Billy the Kid. This is not true now - and it never was true. Perhaps some of this misunderstanding stems from a sentence I could have worded better which read as follows: """"All I was trying to do was provide the most accurate template on the subject of Billy the Kid that others could work from."""" 

If I could take back the word """"template"""" I would, since it was clearly construed as meaning something totally different from what I was trying to state.  What I was trying to state comes down simply to accurate """"facts and dates"""" regarding Billy the Kid, and bringing the state of those many """"facts and dates"""" up to date to this point in time. Before it was removed, my Wikipedia article reflected the status of Billy the Kid research as it exists today. There were 147 detailed citations, which sourced the work of such noted Kid historians as Philip J. Rasch, Robert M. Utley and Frederick Nolan among many others. Before it was last removed on December 17, that version that I was working on contained the most accurate version of the Kid's life that has yet appeared on Wikipedia. That version of the article contained contributions by several researchers - not just me.

Then it all went away, when the article was removed for reasons that make no sense - at least not for anything contained in the article itself. I attempted to restore the version that I had been working on at 11:47 17 December 2015. I attached a note that read: """"Please do not delete this version of the Billy the Kid article. It contains the contributions of several respected historians, and remains the most comprehensive, and accurate treatment of the subject that has appeared on Wikipedia so far.""""

My restoration only stayed up for 4 minutes and and was once again removed at 11:51 on 17 December 2015.

I made what turned out to be a final attempt at restoration six minutes later at 11:57 17 December 2015. This time I left a note that said """"The continued deletion of an article by myself, and several other contributors, goes beyond vandalism and borders on being criminal."""" The crime was against historical honesty, accuracy and, indeed, the goals that Wikipedia is supposed to stand for. The total lack of respect to those who contributed to the article goes without saying.

This time, for my troubles, I was blocked - and my blocked status remains in effect until Dec. 24. Merry Christmas.

The irony is that when the version of the article I last worked on was deleted,  on December 17, I was done with it. I had no plans for further changes. I had hoped that others would then jump in - particularly those who possess the Wikipedia editorial skills I lacked to make it go along with your manual of style and other Wikipedia preferences.

Billy the Kid, as you all know, was born in lower Manhattan in New York City. I would like to use New York City as an analogy for how I view Wikipedia. Since the early 1960's I've spent a considerable amount of time, off and on,  in New York City. Those of you who have been there frequently know that there is always construction going on. Indeed, change is a constant in New York City. Change is also a constant with any Wikipedia article. As stated, it was never my intention to """"own"""" the article. I never expected, or wanted, it to remain frozen in place with my contributions. I was looking forward to contributions from other historians and researchers who could provide further info on the """"facts and dates"""" contained in the article, as well as working with experienced Wikipedia editors who could correct any mistakes that didn't go along with your preferred """"encyclopedic"""" standards.

Anyway, we seem to have ended up, at least for now, at cross purposes. Why it got to this point I don't understand. I am not looking for adversaries, at Wikipedia - I am looking for the collaboration of any and all who truly want to make the Billy the Kid article the best it can possibly be today - and, with the continued contributions of others, in the years that follow.

The quickest way to make this happen is by taking my",0

As for folk using it in other articles, well, if they do then that presents a consensus, doesn't it?

The infamous block

Veritas: do not get Wikinoid yet. The policy is on my side: it was a totally unjust block and I am appealing. I still trust Wikipedia. I don't trust so much certain wikipedians and administrators but I have faith that in the end truth, justice and NPOV shall prevail. If not in the ANI, where admins seem to behave like a wolfpack, at least in first instance, in ArbCom. Policy is very clear and Shell Kinney simply broke all rules. 

In my appeal I also ask for Shell to be recused from further cases against me or related to the controversial article due to bias and misuse of admin privileges. 

I won't go back to that article at least in a looooong while. I've reached my personal limit with it and after all non-existent races are not my primary interest. I believe though that all this conflict will help to raise awareness about what is going on in that battlefield... (oops! article) and specially about Thulean's wikilawyerist attitude. Besides it may also raise awareness about misuse of policy by certain admins that never admit any error nor fulfill their duties. 

Ironically Shell Kinney is running for ArbCom herself. Guess that her campaign is something like """"Wikipedia needs an iron man and that's me"""" of Thatcher. I don't know. I'm voting a more promising candidate.

Yes, there's some good stuff going on with The Beatles articles, not least resulting from your own dedicated and prolific work.

Shapiro is no more notable than medical doctors who have had their licenses suspended, or revoked.  I can think of one doctor (a former doctor of mine) who had his license revoked for killing a woman with the improper use of anesthesia, insurance fraud, falsely advertising he was board certified when he was never eligible to be board certified, and by the time the state attorney got involved (which is what it took to get this doctor's license revoked in ONE state), three criminal counts of sexual assault.  It took 9 years for this doctor to lose his license.  It was in the local newspapers.  Evidently, this all wasn't enough for national news.  And there is no political group called """"Overdoctored"""".  Would any of you think this doctor warrants a WIkipedia entry?  Sadly, there was no news about state medical boards revising their ethics rules.  This man is now in New York, and of course, not practicing medicine - it took awhile for the three other states in which he was licensed to catch up with him.  Yet this man is not infamous.  Why not?  If a lawyer can be castigated in WIkipedia for misleading advertising, why don't we just begin a whole slew of articles about other sleazy lawyers, and doctors, and accountants, and....

 The Black Keys Split With Fat Possum, Prep Releases

Kati Llewellyn and Amy Phillips report:
The Black Keys and Fat Possum Records seemed like a match made in blues-rock heaven, right? But as Jack and Meg (or Puffy and J.Lo or Britney and Justin) will tell you, sometimes couples that look like they're perfect for each other just aren't meant to be. Sigh...

Black Key Dan Auerbach told Billboard.com recently that his band and Fat Possum have parted ways, and they are currently shopping around for an American home for their forthcoming album, which they hope to
release on September 12. (V2 will put the record out in Europe, and Modular will handle it in Australia.) Although the album is untitled at the moment, songs slated to appear include """"Your Touch"""", """"The
Flame"""", and """"It's Just Got to Be"""". 

Auerbach assured Billboard.com that the Fat Possum split was """"amicable."""" Yeah, yeah, they all say that, but this time we actually believe it, for quite a few reasons. First of all, Auerbach and his
bandmate, Patrick Carney, will leave the Mississipi imprint with a parting gift in the form of the Chulahoma: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough EP. A six-song tribute to the late bluesman (with an
answering machine message from Kimbrough's wife tacked on at the end), the disc hits stores May 2. It includes """"The Black Keys - My Mind Is Ramblin'"""", which
the Keys covered on last year's Fat Possum Kimbrough tribute album, Sunday Nights.

Tracklist:

01 Keep Your Hands Off Her
02 Have Mercy on Me
03 Work Me
04 Meet Me in the City
05 Nobody But You
06 My Mind Is Ramblin'

Also, Fat Possum will continue to distribute Carney's Audio Eagle label, which has so far put out the Gil Mantera's Party Dream album
Bloodsongs. Future releases include stuff by two Carney side projects, 10% Animals and Marble Arches. The latter also features guitarist Jamie Stillman (ex-party of helicopters), who co-runs Audio Eagle.

That's kind of the rock and roll equivalent of seeing the kid every other weekend, right?

The Black Keys are currently in the midst of an Australian tour, which has them playing some weird festivals with people like Femi Kuti and
Buddy Guy. In May, they'll head to England to rock The Shins-curated date of All Tomorrow's Parties.""",0

I was just looking at the illos in the book you cite, they were my original inspiration for the arts and draft on my page. I did hope to find some additional refs for the largest etc., but we can kick it off - me thinks. cygnis insignis 
I'll be grateful if you start it off. 'Coastline' or coast? cygnis insignis  Yeah we can always play with that later i think - i hope Suro 
 whee! ... here's anuther. No G yet, or any other sort. I dived into water without my floaties. cygnis insignis 
Florabase has a feature on Marine plants of Western Australia, maybe the starting point should be there. Unless I can adequately focus, my draft will have to remain so. There are any number of things to be resolved. cygnis insignis 
The flowery plants would be a minute part of them. Better check w/ Hesp on the cate for biota by place. cygnis insignis 
I am under the impression that seagrasses are the only truly marine plants. Everything else either isn't really marine, e.g. mangroves are essentially terrestrial; or isn't really a plant e.g. seaweeds are algae.... Although come to think of it the latest thinking has the Chlorophyta amongst the Plantae. But leaving aside the navel gazing (if I can; I'll try), I say that """"marine plants"""" and """"seagrasses"""" are essentially synonymous, and personally I prefer the latter term. Hesperian 
 I was going to say 'proper plants, but http://florabase.calm.wa.gov.au/marineplants/ were fast and loose: includes both marine angiosperms and a variety of marine macro-algae. cygnis insignis

"Hello, the Heleen Mees article is now full of nonsense. Mees never was an employee of the european Commission, the 2006 article about women (not) working was not her first article in NRC Handelsblad. She had published quite a bit before that. Also, the article includes vicious and superfluous references to the stalking charges that are set for dismissal and is quite unbalanced. The following would be a much better text:

Heleen Mees (born Heleen Nijkamp, 1968, Hengelo)[1] is a Dutch opinion writer, economist and lawyer. She has been credited as being a third wave feminist.[3]

Biography
Mees graduated in Economy and Law at University of Groningen. From 1992 to 1998, Mees worked for the Dutch Treasury in The Hague. From 1998 to 2000 Mees worked as a national expert for the European Commission in Brussels.[5] In 2000 she emigrated to the USA, where she changed her surname to Mees.[6] Mees lives in Brooklyn, New York.[2]
Mees' breakthrough as an opinion writer in the Netherlands came in 2006 when she wrote The time is long overdue that women should go to work.[8] That same year, she co-founded Women on Top, an organization that until 2011 advocated more women in top jobs.[9] 
From 2006 to 2010 Mees wrote a bi-weekly column in NRC Handelsblad, and from 2012 to 2013 for Het Financieele Dagblad. Her work has been published in the Financial Times, Foreign Policy and other international newspapers. Currently she is a columnist for Project Syndicate[11] and the German magazine Capital. Mees is the author of three books. 
Mees has been president of the New York chapter of the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA) in New York. In 2008, she worked as a volunteer for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.[12]
In August 2012, Mees completed a doctoral thesis at the Erasmus School of Economics, focusing on the effect of China's economy on the emergence of the 2008 global financial crisis.[13] While completing her research, she worked as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Tilburg University.[14] From September 2012 until July 2013, Mees was employed as an Adjunct Associate Professor of Public Administration at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.[15]
In July 2013, Mees was arrested in New York on charges of stalking her former lover, the chief economist of Citigroup, Willem Buiter.[16] In March 2014, the court decided that the case against Mees was to be dismissed in one year provided that she complies with two conditions.[17]",0

That is a good point about John Locke (I do know who he is, he's even taught in our local middle school, just by the way, haha), he was very influential, but he was a philosopher, not a theologian. Many church goers, whether self-identifying Christians or not, and many self-identifying Christians, whether church-goers or not, do not believe in original sin. I have no idea how many, or what kind of proportion that would be out of the total populations of their respective groups. However, original sin is a biblical doctrine. Babies going to hell because they were not baptised, however, is not. The Bible is not very specific about that issue. It is a Catholic doctrine, yes, but we need to keep doctrines voiced by all of Christianity and parts of Christianity distinct in this article. The Protestant stance is that babies, both born and unborn, whatever they do, are not held accountable until the age of accountability, or the age of reason, at which point they know the difference between right and wrong. Roman Catholicism also holds this idea, so I'm wondering now how babies could go to hell when they can not be held accountable for sin? They have their inherited sinful nature (original sin), sure, but that's different from actually committing a sin. Is the official Roman Catholic stance then that all people are born destined for Hell, whether or not they've actually lived long enough TO sin and thus separate themselves from God and so choose eternal death over eternal life? Honest question here, I'm not trying to bash the Catholic Church.

Yeah, this is pretty much how I see you. I can tell the difference between an editor or admin """"out to get me,"""" a few are on occasion, maybe, and one who is simply dealing with matters as they appear at the moment. Often what I do can be hard to understand; if I'm brief, it's rejected as incoherent, if I explain thoroughly, it's tl;dr. And to explain with the exact balance of brevity and detail is difficult and often time-consuming; that is the best of writing, and it's hard to come by. One of my friends who, in the past, has written on the same topics as I do, but who is far more brief, has said that, sure, he's brief, but I'm more thorough, and it takes him three times as long to write his brief summary (which, I'd say, is typically excellent) as it takes me to write my tome.) Ideally, it takes all kinds to write and edit an encyclopedia; writers *often* are too wordy, besides having points of view, making mistakes, and failing to reference claims, because they are writing from personal knowledge, and that's why they need editors, in real life as well as on Wikipedia. Editors and writers, real-world, are famous for conflict.
On-line interaction is also famous for leading to flame wars, because of the absence of all the cues that allow truly high-bandwidth communication in person, mostly visual: this can't be stuffed into the very narrow channel of text, not even close (much more than a thousand times as much information per second). I've been """"conferencing"""" on-line since the mid-1980s, and it was obvious then. If there is rapport failure, text may be interpreted through a hostile filter; hostile or false meanings can be seen in the text, instead of alternate true or at least neutral meanings. Woonpton has done some reading in my history, and doesn't understand what she read (I think it's she). Others have done the same. If you look at Jehochman's warning to me that was the basis for my block last year, you could see a similarity with Woonpton's conclusions. Iridescent didn't make that the basis of the block, but was clearly thinking the like of it in discussions around the block on her Talk page. I went to the trouble of working it out with Jehochman, first with a userspace self-RfC (an new process, I must say, that should be more used by editors with a complaint about how they have been treated, it was designed to be minimally disruptive; had I been as accused, I'd have been so advised, and I would not have been able to use the self-RfC for anything else), then by approaching Jehochman directly, and, out of that, a very solid working relationship has been formed. it was good even before we met in person. I never did address it with Iridescent, it seemed moot by the time I'd have been ready. Maybe someday. Thanks for dropping by, make yourself at home.

"Nuclear Reactor 

Nuclear reactor [1] or a nuclear reactor, a device for performing a set of nuclear reactions under control. The laboratory scale apparatus for the production of specific isotopes, radioactive materials (radioisotopes) Prtvdarvha as well as for medical and laboratory and industrial scale for the production of electricity are made 
History 

The first controlled nuclear fission energy was achieved in December 1942. Construction and operation of a cell led by a form of graphite bricks and uranium and uranium oxide fuel successfully concluded. The cell nuclear football at the University of Chicago was the first nuclear reactor was operating. 

 Reactor Building 

Despite the diversity of the reactors, almost all of them are composed of the same components. These components include the fuel cover fuel to slow neutrons from fission, cool stacks for transporting thermal energy from the fission process is controlled to control the fission rate. 

Fuel for nuclear reactors should be such that undergo fission neutrons can be obtained. Five Fissile Nuclides that are currently used in reactors. 232Th, 233U, 235U, 238U, 239Pu. Some Nuclides from the thermal neutrons for fission and some fast neutrons are also produced by fission. Reactor fuel is a difference between property in Uncategorized. The ability of fission fuel used in nuclear reactors must be able to meet other needs. Fuel must be mechanically strong, chemically stable against the radiation damage resistance, so the reactor does not undergo physical and chemical changes. The thermal conductivity of the material must be high enough so that the heat can move easily. It is also possible to obtain, making a comfortable, relatively low cost and non-hazardous chemicals and other benefits in terms of fuel. 

Pod reactor 

Nuclear fuels are put directly into the reactor, but has always been used as a cover. Covered or sheathed fuel, moderator and coolant it apart. This corrosion protection and fuel the spread of fission products from irradiated fuel to the environment is prevented. The pods could also fuel support structure and heat transfer to help. Materials such as fuel pods have good thermal and mechanical properties and the chemical interaction with the fuel material is stable environment. It is sheathed with a low cross towards nuclear interactions of neutrons and is resistant against radiation. 

 Neutron moderator materials 

A substance that can slow or rapid thermal neutrons are used up. The kernel has a mass close to the mass of the neutron is slow is best. The reactor will be used for the lower neutron absorption cross-section should be. Due to the properties of slow, there are some substances that can be used. Hydrogen, deuterium, beryllium and carbon are some examples moderator. Because beryllium is toxic, it is too low to be used in reactors. The isotopes of hydrogen, heavy water, and the water and carbon, in the form of graphite as a material to be used. 

Heavy water in some types of nuclear reactors as a neutron moderator is used. They can react with uranium to neutrons. Than conventional light water or water can also be used as a moderator, but because light water absorbs the thermal neutrons are light water reactors need enriched uranium to use high purity, But heavy water reactors can not enrich uranium or conventional uses heavy water so the discussion is to prevent the development of nuclear weapons. Heavy water reactors can be built in a way that requires no equipment enriched uranium to make plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. However, conventional uranium for use in nuclear weapons could be used in other ways, too.This material controls. But in non-industrialized countries like America and Canada, it means much gram and kilogram quantities without any specific authorization of the manufacturers or supplier chemicals supplied. The price per kilogram of heavy water with a purity of 9899% in about 600 to 700 dollars. It also can not use enriched uranium and heavy water plutonium production reactor construction. Just as pure carbon, super slow since the Nazis use of impure carbon use, they did not notice the truth of America's first experimental nuclear reactor in 1942 and the Manhattan Project and the Trinity test of the plutonium bomb, known as «FAT MAN »the manufacture of enriched uranium or heavy water is not used. 

Cooler 

Heat from fission in the reactor or fuel must be removed from the heat too high or the fuel rods melt. Heat is the fuel in the reactor power may be used to generate electricity. Characteristics of the coolant should be directed to heat the heat transfer can be effective. Also, chemical stability and lower neutron absorption cross section of two major properties Knndhast cool. Another point that must be noted",0

"""

, please, just think about what you're saying here. Let's take this by the numbers:

 Firstly, quite frankly, I am dissappointed that you saw no reason to act in the face of the diffs and information I posted at User talk:Black Kite . Your suggestion that HighKing should """"step back from this type of edit"""" is, quite frankly, going to be ignored, again, as his edits on The Automobile Association showed. His admission that he has a problem sounds depressingly familiar. After 5 years of being unable to contain this problem himself, and in the face of overwhelming evidence yet again in this case that it still exists, then coming as it did off the back of yet more of the usual erroneous defences, duplicitous denials and improper deflections, is surely wholly unsatisfactory.
 's close was both abusive and counter-productive. He closed a perfectly valid complaint, based on completely irrelevant reasons, namely my 'status' (further below, and on his talk page). If I had not pressed him about it on his talk page, he wouldn't have even bothered to notify you about it, and you would never have even heard about 's actions at The Automobile Association.
 Your charge of harassment is frankly ridiculous - all I have done with this account is make factual statements about HighKing's current and past behaviour, which you yourself have just repeated today, is still problematic. I am obviously not the IP user he was edit warring with, I never engaged with HighKing, I never reverted HighKing, I never threatened or personally attacked HighKing. All I did was comment on the situation in a factual manner, in the hope other admins would take action in your absence. If me making this sort of contribution spoils HighKing's enjoyment of Wikipedia, who the hell cares, quite frankly? It's simply not harassment. If HighKing was to turn into a model editor tomorrow, then he'd never hear me talking about him ever again. That's not harassment, it's practically the job description of a Wikipedia admin!
 Your block for evading scrutiny - it is entirely pointless. Enforcement of WP:SOCK long ago stopped being about what's good for Wikipedia in many instances, as this block shows. Whatever my history, whether this is a legitimate or illegitimate alternate account, whether I'm blocked or banned, whatever, there isn't a single thing that I could possibly be hiding that would make the edits this account performed look any less valid to an outside observer. Nothing that might be or could be revealed about me, would change their meaning or relevance, and it certainly wouldn't make them any (more) true. The idea that only established can be implicitly trusted to tell the truth on Wikipedia strikes me as extremely dangerous, a view no admin should be seen within a hundred miles of holding, let alone repeating.
 Taking 3 & 4 together, there was absolutely no preventative purpose to this block, and so, it it is entirely without grounds in basic policy. And on the issue of basic points of policy with regard both the socking and harassment charges - you don't even know for sure if this is an illegitimate sock. You don't know if I have a regular account, or if I'm blocked or banned. You're just guessing. For all you know, I might be using an undeclared alternate account because I myself might have previously been the victim of harassment from HighKing, and so I would have a perfectly legitimate reason to hide what my 'regular account' is when commenting on him in future. And given the fact that, as this block shows, being critical of HighKing is seemingly enough to get someone tarred with a charge of conducting a """"long term campaign of harassment"""" without any actual evidence whatsoever, then it would be entirely understanable if an editor in good standing would not want to expose their main account to that sort of smear, as the price of simply commenting on HighKing.
 To expand on the socking issue - rather than being an """"inappropriate"""" use of a sock, when it comes to HighKing, I think its self evident given his past, using a sock when commenting on his behaviour at a venue like ANI is highly appropriate, as it removes his ability to do what he has often done in those situations, namely trying to deflect attention from his own behaviour by talking about what the people reporting him have done, whether it is even relevant or not, and indeed, whether it is even true or not (his habit for example of makin",0

Well, I'm sorry, but I don't have those links that you desire. Yes, this article is very POV based, in favour of vangard propaganda sociology. Unfortunately, due to the tyrannical trends of namby pamby liberalism (Labour UK, for example), not much genuine research can be done in the subject, because it's quite politically incorrect these days. For example, when a university professor says that on average Black people score lower in IQ tests than white people, said professor gets voted out of tenure 600 to 1. So it's not good practice for libertarian capitalists to bother trying to counter argue against all this namby pamby left wing crap. Labour UK is a twisted experiment, which, although capitalist and ostensibly right wing, has introduced very bizarre left wing projects in to the political playing field: such as, teaching young children about homosexuality in schools, trying to make gay hate a crime like race hate, trying to make condemnation of monotheistic religions a crime, with use of the truth distorting term 'incitement to religious hatred' etc. We are on the losing side, those of us who love truth.

  Lebanon: Catholic Villagers attack and vandalize Baptist Church
Posted on 29 August, 2006

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” 

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” 

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” 

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” 

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” 

The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajaltoun had the right to change their religious affiliation. 

Abou-Mekhael told Compass today that the church remains officially sealed, and that he is in the process of filing a case against the attackers. He also said that his congregation of approximately 80 people is ready to open a second case if they are denied their constitutional right to worship at the site. 

“Even if we get permission to remove the red wax, there are still threats from the mayor and from the bishop that if we go to worship they will attack again,” the pastor told Compass. “By the constitution of Lebanon, we have the freedom to worship there. But they say, ‘Okay, go try to practice your rights, but we will stop you.’”

 Authorship 

Over at the Barack Obama article, there was some discussion of whether his book authorship merited lead position.  I argued (and consensus seems agreed on this), that very brief mention of those best-sellers should be in the lead, particularly since the books have their own article section.

In McCain's case, he is co-author on several books (none seem as prominent in sales-ranking and the like), and there is not a separate section on them.  However, I still wonder whether there's any sentiment that authorship should still get a clause in the lead. ×talk """,0

 Reviews and meta-analyses...get your secondary sources, folks! 

There are 398 papers that fall under the """"Reviews"""" tab at PubMed on the query """"Homeopathy"""" (out of 3545 total papers). Below are a selection of interesting papers (that my institution can access) from the last couple of years, with money-quotes from abstract conclusions. I stopped after a couple dozen, travelling back to ~2002; this list isn't close to exhaustive, but it may prove useful for discussion & article building. Any responses should probably be made in a new section, or a subsection of this one, just for navigational clarity.

There is currently little evidence for the efficacy of homeopathy for the treatment of ADHD.

...some homeopathically prepared remedies show promise for reducing infarct size and associated impairments...Individualized homeopathy may even play a helpful adjunctive role in treatment of sepsis. However, a great deal of systematic research effort lies ahead before most of the options discussed would meet mainstream medical standards for introduction into routine treatment regimens.

...experiments with a high methodological standard could demonstrate an effect of high potencies. No positive result was stable enough to be reproduced by all investigators. A general adoption of succussed controls, randomization and blinding would strengthen the evidence of future experiments.

The evidence from rigorous clinical trials of any type of therapeutic or preventive intervention testing homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments is not convincing enough for recommendations in any condition.

The [studies] were generally of low methodological quality...Homeopathic medicines, tested in HPTs, appear safe. The central question of whether homeopathic medicines in high dilutions can provoke effects in healthy volunteers has not yet been definitively answered, because of methodological weaknesses of the reports...

The results suggest that, for several treatments, the risk-benefit profile is encouraging...For other therapies the evidence is weak or contradictory: homeopathy...

Complex Homoeopathy...showed inconclusive results.

effectiveness of homeopathy can be supported by clinical evidence and professional and adequate application be regarded as safe.

1-The question is why the symbols must be removed from the infobox;

2-They MAY be still valid. What we have until now, and nobody can find more evidences, is that law of 1962; The last law that deals SPECIFICALLY with the topic is the one to be followed; It doesn´t matter if this law is from the time of Cleopatra. It doesn´t matter if it´s a colonial symbol.

3-There are many examples throughout history: New York city, Jakarta, São Paulo city, Rio de Janeiro city, and many other cities used their colonial symbols until a new law dealing with the subject was created. Some even maintained their colonial symbols, like New York and Rio. That´s a heraldry principle.

The article is starting to come together, and I plan to begin working on filling in the {Winners} tables with the 1979-1995 winners.  I'm still not really convinced the page even needs the """"Winners"""" tables, since the ceremony is equally dedicated to awarding television actors (if not more so) and the categories have changed so much over the years it would be impossible to efficiently list all the winners in the various categories that have popped up and disappeared over the years: Dramatic Films, Comedy Films, Action-Adventure Films, and then the """"splitting"""" of categories into age groups, etc. It gets pretty convoluted, so I think it might be a better idea to use the """"Winners"""" section to mention some of the notable former child stars who were nominated for or won a Young Artist Award and then went on to receive  acclaim as adults, but for now I think the tables that are on the page should at least be complete, so I'll be working on that next.

Is it because other Pakhtuns have been challenging you after my contributions to the debate regarding Pakhtun status of Tanolis. You've have been peddling this name about on different sites in Wikipedia and I've left it for proud Pakhtuns and others to challenge you. Get it into your ignorant head that Tanolis are Pakhtuns and Janjuas are kasbis (I know at least 3 families of Janjua origin who do not claim to rajputs but say they are of Maliyar caste. None of the historical sources link them with rajputs. Ghakhars use the title raja but are not rajputs as do the Turks of Hazara, in Manakrai,and they are not rajputs either - read about Raja of Mahmoodabad. Moreover, the real Rajputs of Rajputana use the universal title of Singh to denote their proud identity (the term raja is reserved for the rulers). As for the Gujjar issue it is well documented that Jat, Gujjar and the so-called rajputs of northern Punjab are the same people. This leads to the conclusion that maybe the Janjua claim to be rajput is suspect as I have said all along. Darbar-e-Akbari, Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri and other historical works do not mention Janjuas and Rajputs together and locate the former in Bhir far away from Hazara, and more importantly, from real Rajputs as well. 

I accept there are people who live in Tanawal and use Tanoli as their geographical origin but they do not fit into the clan system of the original Tanawalis. We know who the gujjar families are in Tanawal and they do not use Tanoli for themselves though they do say they reside in Tnawal. Other Gujjars in Hazara are either settled or are move about between Swat, Upper hazara and Azad Kashmir.

Additionally, you seem to be on a mission to prove something that is not proveable. I know you are in the UK and I can meet you face to face to discuss this if you prefer. We can sort a number of things relevant to this debate as well as you can know who I really am.

Actually, the only poll that I'm aware of looked like this:

It is produced by force-feeding ducks and geese large quantities of food causing the animals' livers to swell up to ten times their normal size. A long metal pipe is inserted into the animals' esophagus several times a day. The process can cause the animals' internal organs to rupture. Several European countries and the state of California have outlawed the practice as cruel. Do you agree or disagree that force-feeding geese and ducks to produce foie gras should be banned in Pennsylvania?""""
Now, considering the question, the fact that 94% of respondents had either never eaten the stuff (54% had never even heard of it), can you see that this is the very definition of a push poll? If general indicators are any indication, the fact that a large number of chefs in the Chicago area decided to put or keep foie gras on their menu (some of them had never served foie gras before), and that this eventually led to the repeal of the Chicago ban on foie gras, then the assertion that most chefs do not support the ban of foie gras sounds like a reasonable conclusion.

To Huon and Stephan2 ' At the present time I do not agree with either of your positions regarding the use of images on the Sergio Franchi biography. First of all are enough images."""" I do not believe that editors should be concerned with the absolute number of images. I do not believe that pictures which represent different aspects of a person's life are excessive. On the Filmography I used lots of images because Franchi was in a lot of TV productions. On the biography page, I am sure I could remove a few images, but our culture is image-driven and I used the images believing that their use would draw attention to this person's life. Dying before the advent of the internet his memory was almost allowed to die because none of his contemporaries carried his story onto the internet..thus my desire to preserve the biography of a person who was very important during the late 20th century in musical and theater history. As for my own motives as an editor of Wikipedia, I have used my work on these pages to increase my expertise as a Wikipedia editor, and have made contributions on every page that I felt competent to add at the time. This has also increased my editorial knowledge.  Enough about personal motivation. As to the issue at hand... Wikipedia's biography portal describes a biography as """"a detailed description of someone's life. More than a list of basic facts [education, relationships, and death)....a biography ...highlights various aspects of his or her life...."""" THAT is why I believe that the non-free image depicting Franchi's beloved avocations were deserving of representation in the 2 photos showing his automobile and pewter collections. I also felt that a textual statement would be enhanced by the 2 photos that I had discovered. As to the Non-free book cover depicting Sergio Franchi's 18 months of his life on the Broadway stage musical """"Nine'..as you are aware, usually only the original creator of the role is given fair space. However, his role was considered import enough by the producers to warrant new posters, programs, and an original song...I believe that the visual reminder of his impact on musical theater in 1984 was important. There were no other free images available after 1976 when the copyright law regarding publicity photos. I am interested in improving as an editor, and if you still believe that I should remove the Library of Congress image (Pewter collection), I will comply with your suggestion. Please consider my argument on it's retention. Thanks

You are spot on Leladax. Some with a strong FYROM POV around here argue that 'Republic of Macedonia' is the only official name in use and wish to lock it in at Wikipedia.

While true many nations and NGO's have chosen in the interim to use """"Republic of Macedonia""""... all nations in principle agree to honour whatever name FYROM/Greece can hammer out. When it comes to Wikipedia itself all names should be used if NPOV was actually being observed... especially since the dispute is still ongoing.  Many countries around the world still officially use FYROM (including even the US which still uses both names at times (the US Senate resolution last year condemning FYROM actually used the FYROM name).

What I really think is missing from the article is that technically speaking FYROM is currently in breach of at least a few of its original UN brokered terms with Greece. (This incidentally is exactly why I the why the US government passed the resolution last year condemning FYROM for breaking terms,  why the Greek government vetoed FYROM's  recent attempt at NATO membership, , and why it will probably veto EU membership as well.)

Agreement Violation #1: FYROM was supposed to stick to FYROM for external use

FYROM citizens are now trying to be recognized exclusively as """"Republic of Macedonia"""" even though in Article 7 of the original UN brokered agreement (which their own leaders signed) specifically states

""""the Party of the First Part reserves the right to object to any membership referred to above if and to the extent of the Party of the Second Part is to be referred to in such organization or institution differently than in paragraph 2 of the United Nations Security Council resolution 817 (1993). (which is still be FYROM I believe)

Agreement Violation #2:: Refrain from propaganda against Greek cultural heritage and territory

Article 7 and 11 of the UN agreement between Greece and FYROM state:.

""""Each Party shall promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by State-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility against each other.

If either Party believes one or more symbols constituting part of its historic or cultural patrimony is being used by the other Party, it shall bring such alleged use to the attention of the other Party, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action or indicate why it does not consider it necessary to do so.

The article should probably include a few real world examples to show the complaints are very real. I myself recently heard someone from FYROM claim Aristotle was actually Slavic on a forum but there are literally thousands of examples of irredentist behavior to be found. (a small subset of some recent examples that seemed relevant, verifiable and seemingly demonstrate the argument beyond the abstract) 

There exists a steady stream of FYROM supporters on the Alexander_the_Great article history page claiming Alexander wasn't Greek.  

Top ranked FYROM websites  almost universally are writing revisionist histories that suggest Alexander was not Greek  (quote taken from the website)
""""Contrary to modern Greek claims, Macedonia was never part of Greece, and the ancient Macedonians were not regarded as ancient Greeks.""""

Current FYROM Prime Minister welcomes Pakistan “Macedonian” Prince Ghazanfar  and uses it as """"proof"""" of their ancient Macedonian roots. That one really made me cringe considering not so long ago everyone was being assured by FYROM leadership...

'""""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.""""' Kiro Gligorov (FYROM's first President)

'""""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are a Slav people and our language is closely related to Bulgarian... There is some confusion about the identity of the people of our country""""'. Gyordan Veselinov  (Canadian ambassador to Canada in interview to Ottawa Citizen in 1999)

(incidentally both quotes appear extremely relevant to the article. I tried to add them myself to the article but they were removed without justification. You are welcome to try.)

""":::First and foremost there is not and never has been any """"Wikistalking."""" This is paranoia on Chadbryant's part and has been present in numerous remarks he has made, not just those dealing with reverting. I do find it humorous, however, that he has to claim """"Wikistalking"""" yet he has a history of reverting an article in an edit war but trying to claim he is in no violation of a 3RR rule as a result of his changing non-existant """"vandalism.""""

Second of all, I did not attack his talk page. You may go and see the history of the page if you wish to verify this, but all I did was make a comment that was not in agreement with what he said. Because he dislikes me, and because of his paranoia, AND possibly because of other reasons (which I won't go into because he'd just cry about personal attacks), he removed the comments I made. All because they didn't go with what he said and believed. This was immature, selfish, childish and stupid at best, but as I said on another page if he wants to look that way who am I to stop him?

Then there is this """"appeared as another blah blah blah as soon as blah blah blah."""" Isn't this funny or what? He has to go and request a checkuser because he can't tell who is who yet he has no problem pulling out the sockpuppet accusation and whipping it around like a cowboy's lasso at a rodeo. Of course there's no WAY Chad could ever be  despite evidence pointing towards him. For it would be unthinkable for someone to directly accuse him of the same behavior of which he so loves to accuse others.

""""Made allegations of stalking"""" [ . . . ] """"to paint himself as a victim."""" Did Chad even read what he wrote? Did he realize that he claims I made allegations of stalking to paint myself as a victim yet in the same remarks he claims Wikistalking on himself? I mean, you just gotta laugh sometimes at these things, you know? But being a hypocrite is nothing new to him.

As for the attacking of the external link  he still has no proof I am that person who he claims that I am. This is the same debacle he got into with . And how fucking funny is it for him to claim I am that person, yet three paragraphs later he has to go and claim a checkuser?  

You get the idea, I hope/think. This is stupid, but when you are dealing with Chadbryant, you have to expect that.

Bohr's Philosophy
Hello and thanks for your critique on my slight, though important changes to the article. I'd like to comment that previous to my changes, the particular part was absolute horrible writing, strictly from a stylistic point of of view, while my changes morphed that into a well balanced, clean structure that semantically integrated into the overall flow of the previous text. Furthermore, your deletion, based on arguable and vague stylistic opinion while ignoring a more important semantic correction—without which many are misled to believe that Bohr was an atheist unarguably—makes you appear to have done it in an attempt of an ideological censorship. Although I'm sure you have had no such intentions, your removal of only one side of the story points directly to your own dogmas on the subject.

As someone who, I believe, appreciates freedom of speech and honest representation of views in Wikipedia, you can understand my arguments. If you wish to discuss the style of the change, I'm more than open to discuss it with you, but I think your fine reputation ought to prevent you from silently deleting it in the future. Therefore, relying on it, I'm reposting the correction, which we can later collaboratively polish to your liking.

Finally, as we are on the subject, I have done an extensive search, and to my knowledge Bohr never called himself an atheist, and the references for this statement """"Bohr's disagreements with the philosopher mostly stemmed from Bohr's atheism"""" seem completely unsupportive of the thesis—statements by anybody but the man himself can hardly prove such a blunt declaration about such rigorous subjects as religion and philosophy. What are your thoughts on that?""",0

You claim that we must change it because the word """"democracy"""" is too broad. There is nothing """"broad"""" about """"democracy,"""" especially when the topic is about protecting """"democracy"""". The eternity clause make specific provisions to protect """"democracy"""" as stated in the article referenced in National Review.

I just want it said upfront that (as I thought I'd shown) if it's significant, a lipogram can talk about it, fully absorbably, and without circumlocution.

GTBacchus, that is an excellent idea. Indeed, the sources are available (as we have both noted) in the Dresden Firebombing Wikipaedia page, so there's no real dispute about their availability and relevance. The WP:RSs are there for editors to assess in the wiki-link provided.

"""
Well, let's try again (one more time).
Re """"""""commonsenual"""" = WP:OR. Regardless of sui generis it has all the characteristics of belligerent occupation (Glantz et al.)"""" """"Commonsensual"""" is not OR. Occupation sensu stricto is something quite concrete, and it is regulated by various international conventions. For instance, Guggenheim lists three different forms of occupation, and one of them refers to something quite unique. Therefore, we can speak about the """"occupation sensu stricto"""" and """"occupation following an armistice"""". That is what I mean under """"commonsensual"""" occupation, and that is how a reader will understand it.
Re belligerent occupation, I do not deny the fact that some sources do describe it in this way; however, other sources (majority of sources) use different terminology. Therefore, the reference to one more source that uses the terminology you like does not change a picture much. I propose to present both viewpoints - you reject the very opportunity that a second viewpoint exists. Therefore, it is your arguments that do not hold water.
Re Malksoo, please, re-read his works again. And, since both you and I can draw different conclusions from different pieces of Malksoo's text, below is a quote from his own explanation of his own position, made specifically for us:
"""" The Baltic Sattes were occupied in June 1940 and annexed (incorporated) by the USSR in August 1940. Thus, both occupation and annexation DID happen. The fact of annexation - and that the USSR proceeded with its policies from the presumption that these territories were its own, not occupied - changed the nature of the occupation, if not in terms of law than at least in terms of political realities. For example, when 1980 Moscow olympic games took place, the olympic regatta took place in Tallinn. This cannot be a typical occupation situation.However, it is important that the article would make clear that in the eyes of the predominant Western opinion and post-1991 restored Baltic States themselves, the Soviet annexation remained illegal. In this sense, illegal annexation equals extended occupation and the whole debate is a pseudo-debate. The annexation - since it remained illegal - did not create any extra rights to the annexing power, the USSR. If the article makes that aspect clear, I would be perfectly fine with the title of the article being changed to """"Occupation and Annexation of the Baltic States"""". In fact, I would recommend such change because it takes more precisely (closer to the facts) into account the complex nature of the Soviet rule in the Baltic States.""""
What else do you need? Malksoo clearly says that in the case of the Baltic states both occupation and annexation took place, and we can speak about continued occupation in this sense (but not in others. P.S.) llegal annexation equals extended occupation. In other words, we can speak about occupation in a context of the state continuity of the Baltic states, and I never argued against that. Again, what synthesis you accuse me in?
Re """"there is no bridge between the Baltic and Soviet/official Russian positions; there is no in-between or continuum of scholarship, it's one or the other;"""" Wrong. There is a Baltic position, position of different foreign states (which was different from state to state and from time to time), positions of scholars (western, Baltic, Russian), Soviet positions (different during 1950s-70s and during Perestroika) and official Russian position.
Re """"From Glantz to Malksoo, a belligerent occupation."""" Glantz is an authoritative expert in the military aspects of the WWII, not in the legal aspects; Malskoo does not consider Soviet intervention in 1940 as a military operation at all. The only aggressive step, according to him, was a naval blockade.
Re """"Baltic citizens became a lower class as their homelands were """"colonized"""""""" Probably. However, other sources tell that the real economic and political situation in these republics were much better than in other parts of the USSR, hence extensive influx of migrants. Was it possible if they had a colonial status?

Hello James Cantor,

Thank you so much for your comments. The last 21 Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine have had wiki pages for a number of years and the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate. I just find is unusual that Crusio's page is so much larger than those who are far more notable. I think Crusio's page size should be about the size of an average Nobel Laureate. I can not but wonder how Wim Crusio's page is so much bigger than that last 21 of the most recent Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine. As a scientist, one tends to plot data on a graph, and if you where to do so, Crusio's data point would be considered an out lier. As I stated, the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate over many years. These pages have been edited by hundreds of users for many years, I think that gives us good yard stick, and says something about how much information a scientists site should have.

 Proper use

I found one discussion  that has some physics-based arguments that I found pretty persuasive.
One commenter says that the preferred way to use a pipe wrench is the opposite direction from the preferred way to use an adjustable wrench,

Norm Abram, in """"Adjustable Wrench"""",
implies that (unlike a basin wrench) an adjustable wrench often works adequately even when turned the """"wrong way"""", such as when doing the """"flip trick"""".
This may also contribute to why so many people disagree on the """"proper"""" direction to turn it.

What exactly is the advantage of turning it the """"right"""" way versus the """"wrong"""" way?
Too often I hear that turning it the """"wrong"""" way is """"more likely to round off the corners"""" without any more details,

The redirect stops after one redirect, so instead of an infobox those articles just displayed a link.) It is better to determine the name, and then make the changes across the board so that we can be sure there are no problems. ''''''chatspy """,0

 Verifiability 
I noticed you deleted all of my contribution yet again. It would be more helpful, not to mention a show of good faith, if you would participate in the process and edit my contributions instead of completely deleting them!

Now that you have removed the link to the powerbasic forums, and elected to not sanction the description of """"official"""" Powerbasic forum, perhaps some other relevant links would be appropriate. I agree with you that they are in fact """"user to user"""" forums and will reword my contribution accordingly. I also agree with your wording """"this forum is not a source of official support."""" Additionally, Your own website states: """"Should your request goes beyond the intent of the technical support and resources we offer for free you will be advised there will be a $49 per incident charge if you would like us to proceed with your request."""" So I am not sure why you deleted that too?

As I indicated, the last remnants of company support suddenly left the powerbasic forums with Lance in July 2004 as confirmed in the thread you quoted. As another member put it """"you may indeed be correct. lance's last post was july 5, 2004 and the last post that indicated he was powerbasic support was june 25... also, between march 6 and march 7 of this year lance changed his title from """"administrator"""" to """"member"""". if he is indeed gone i wish him a lot of luck!"""" It seems pretty clear that no one at the time had any idea what happened. But this is irrelevant and I only mention it because Lance provided technical support via the forums (as can be seen by any casual search of his posts). The current levels of participation in the forum by powerbasic staff cannot under any stretch of the imagination be considered support.

Because 30 support posts of any real value in SIX MONTHS cannot be considered support, and there is no eveidence of alleged """"email support"""", my statement that """"little if any real support is offered"""" is valid. Support is a key issue to novice developers and should be clearly represented in the wikipedia entry.

Thank you for helping with the wording of """"there were 8508 total posts, not 8508 requests for help"""". This is perhaps a more accurate statement and as I have said all along I welcome your input. Since we agree on this number, perhaps you can justify your statement of """"18,771 messages in support of PowerBASIC customers""""?

The numbers I quoted are easily verifyable from your search engine. simply type in any of the historical support staff names like """"Steve Rossell"""" or """"Bob Zale"""" under """"User Name:"""", highlight the five forums in which users confine thier posts for help:
PowerBasic Console Compiler

PowerBasic for DOS

PowerBasic for Windows

Programming

Programming the Internet 

then hit search. If you look at page two you will see that posts in the last six months immediatly dry up. 
A grand total of 32 posts from Mr Rossel and 48 posts from Mr Zale.

A quick review of these posts shows that in fact Mr Rossel contributed 18 posts of any significant help and Mr Zale only 12 (leaving aside Mr Zale's recent spurt of enthusaism).

This is a verifyable FACT. Anyone can verify these numbers. This is not my opinion. Even if we include every post made in that timeframe as real """"support"""" we are still only talking about 80 out of 8500, thats still less than one percent! This is a relevant verifyable fact.

Your point 5 contains no references or even vague offers of proof. You mention Microsoft Visual Basic, seem to assert that Visual Basic users should be entitled to support from powerbasic staff etc etc. I am unclear how any of this is relevant? 

It is interesting to note that you use an internet archive to support your arguments about historical posts when is suits you, yet have so far to acknowledge that the post relating to the incompatability of unsigned integers was targeted and deleted. If you statement """"The truth is, we welcome criticism, as it's a key element in the evolution of our products"""" is true, then cite an example from your forums of criticism that has been embraced. 

In fact powerbasic would like to dodge all accountability as clearly demonstrated when this [thread was deleted.]

Encyclopaedia Britannica , 15th edition , vol.3

""""Croatia became a kingdom in the 10th century, and in the 1091  Ladislaus I (Laslo I) of Hungary assumed control; the ensuing union with Hungary lasted for 8th centuries. During the union with Hungary, Croatia retained its own assemble, the Sabor,  and was legally an independent kingdom.""""

""""Croatia retained its independence under native kings until 1102, when the crown passed into the hands of the Hungarian dynasty. The precise terms of this relationship later became a matter of dispute; nonetheless, even under dynastic union with Hungary, institutions of separate Croatian statehood were maintained through the Sabor (an assembly of Croatian nobles) and the ban (viceroy). In addition, the Croatian nobles retained their lands and titles. """"

I think you misunderstood me; I did not claim your arguments were """"illegitimate"""" as a whole, merely that they were less legitimate than the others. """"Legitimate"""" was probably the wrong word. You made some good points, but the request's supporters made better ones. Your opposing vote contained the following text:
Furthermore, the reason given for moving is in itself offensive. The title is objective, and the objection to it seems to be only that it doesn't adequately conform to Laval's own beliefs about what is motivating the contributors to this article. In the absence of any evidence that we're bigots, I suggest the correct move is for Laval either to demonstrate we're bigots or to apologize for slandering us.
This violates WP:AGF in the first sentence, and continues to be something akin to a personal attack. I am sure that your comments were sincere, but I think both sides allowed themselves to get riled and to speak too rashly. Your point about original research was more significant, but the term """"Anti-Quebec sentiment"""" does seem to be in fairly widespread use (I did check).
A person doesn't have to vote to voice an opinion. The instructions at the top of every poll state """"Please remember that this survey is not a vote"""", so the fact that I've inferred opinions from other parts of the debate is not a problem. It seems that 205.157.110.11 (an IP, but one with a very strong history of contructive edits) would have made an explicit vote were it not for the hot-headed wording of the proposal, and GTBacchus (an editor who I have yet to see make a mistake) also supported a very similar title. Laval, the move's proponent supported his move, of course; tjstrf proposed an alternative title, which garnered little support, and """"Marc Gévry"""" commented more on the debate than the title. This makes 3 """"votes"""" in favour of """"Anti-Quebec sentiment[s]"""", and one (yourself) directly opposed. Characterising votes for alternative titles as either support or opposition for the quoted proposal cannot be accurately done, so I omitted those from the count (but took them into consideration for the decision, of course).
I don't approve of returning to debates once they've been closed, and I really think you should move on. There is plenty of work to be done to the article, at whatever title it may be, and I'm sure you can contribute a great deal to it. Therefore, I don't wish to discuss this matter any further. I reviewed the case in good faith, and I made a decision, which I stick to.

No one is disputing that a debate exists over the proper naming convention, the question is over the degree to which that debate should be reflected in the name of the article. I'm all for delineating the various points of view on why one name is used by one group of people, and the article does a good job of that. But as you point out the most widely used name is FGM, and if a 4.5 or 3 to 1 ratio is not a significant  majority than I don't know what it is. Secondly, the pov issue is very much with the people here and not with the literature. Lets be clear about the rationale of the UN bodies which have opted to use the term FGC. According to their own websites (and this page), they use the term FGC in communities where the term FGM may be seen as counterproductive to the goal of reducing the occurrence of FGM. They do not use it in their published literature and their websites make it clear that it is an application of the term for case-specific scenarios and not as an overall attempt to cease the use of the term FGM.   19:48",0

You're right, staying in a country while you are working does not constitute being an """"expatriate"""".

"Holby series/characters 

Hi there,
I know you've been doing a fair bit of contributing to the various Holby City series and character pages recently. I see you've been adding various wards after character's names and job titles, though I think it's got to a point where the lists are tending to look a little cluttered. As the editor who added the character lists to the individual series pages in the first place, the intention was to only include the ward that each characters usually appeared on - the one they were resident on - rather than just the wards that they popped up on from time to time. As such, this is why I've been keeping characters such as Guy Self and Colette Sheward in the list without a ward, as they do not appear to be formally allocated to a particular ward. Where there have been multiple wards listed, this has been due to the characters moving between wards over the course of the series, such as recently when Ric Griffin and Michael Spence swapped roles on Keller and AAU, respectively, during Series 15, hence their listing there as Keller/AAU and AAU/Keller. 
As such, I'm proposing, for brevity's sake, as well as for clarity, that the wards listed be kept to a minimum - each character's principal ward only, rather than any that they occasionally appear on (for argument's sake, pretty much all characters appear on AAU from time to time, but that doesn't mean they should have AAU listed after their names). The alternative is that we do away completely with having characters' wards listed after their names.
I've reverted the list to its former appearance, in the process removing a couple of things (Dominic isn't on AAU, Edward (who, incidentally, left the show in Episode 13, and has been removed from the opening titles and the BBC website) wasn't on Keller, and Nathan and Mr Thompson were never given allocated named wards). 
Let me know what you think - it may be that the complete removal of wards may be the easiest way forward!",0

Hi, in the above article, you claim that Ken Livingstone repeated allegations by Fred Holroyd of a plot against Harold Wilson. I haven't read Holroyd's book, but I have read secondhand accounts of his allegations (and the New Statesman articles by Duncan Campbell that broke the story) and I recall that they didn't relate to plots against Harold Wilson, but more towards Army collusion with Loyalist paramilitaries and sundry dirty tricks of that nature. Are you perhaps thinking of the entirely seperate Colin Wallace/Clockwork Orange allegations that came out at roughly the same time? I did pop a 'See Also' to Clockwork Orange already...  

Hi, I was unfamiliar with the Colin Wallace allegations.  I only came across Holroyd on the page for Holroyd I just included what was mentioned about Nairac (long speech), some of which I didnt photocopy. There was other stuff in his speech. The Nairac stuff quoted alludes to some of it, but I will post the other references below it: 
""""His complaint, which eventually led to his removal from the Army and an attempt to discredit him, which has been largely successful, was made when the MI6 operation was taken over by MI5 in 1975- 'by many of the same people who are dealt with in Peter Wright's book [Spycatcher], and many of the same people who are alleged to have ben practising treason against the elected Labour Government of the time'""""

""""It [Miami showband massacre] took place in the midst of the ceasefire that had been negotiated by the then Labor Government and the IRA.  The right hon member for morley and leeds, south (Mr.Rees) pushed it through and sustained it, although there was a considerable opposition from within the security services and within many political parties.  The Labour Government did everything possible to make the ceasefire work, but it was not wholly accepted within the appartus of MI5- our operatuves who alledegly were working on behalf of the British State in Northern Ireland.""""

then later in the speech Livingstone says:

We saw in last Sunday's edition of The Observer that another intelligence officer, Colin Wallace, who was closely linked with Fred Holroyd in a campaign to expose what was going on, has been dismissed as irrelevant by the British Government.  We see now that The Observer, using forensic tests, has been able to demonstrate that the notes that he wrote were not written in the past couple of years by somebody who is embittere and is trying to cash in on what has started to come out.""""

then later:

""""Wallace and Holroyd are making these quite specific allegations""""

My favourite place in Spain is Benalmadena a costal town near Marbella where all the cool Spanish people use to go, because Marbella is too turistic, and Benalmadena was still undiscouvered by the """"people"""" or mass tourism. Another reason are the great golf courses that are near. P.S.:You said in your comment """"we are just a little bit richer"""", it can´t apply to Serbia, because it´s way much poorer than in the 80´s. Yugoslav Serbia was way better. There was freedom to travel (to Yugoslav citizens wasn´t even required visas for majority of western countries) and had, limited throu, private property or companies. We had the EURO in 1976, Olympic winter games in 1984, the non-alignement was a very interesting initiative... Younger people (even in Serbia too) doesn´t know much of that. Almost all Serb families had a house on the Adriatic, going skiing was usual, travelling to Austrian or Swiss Alps, to Italy or Spain in summer, was """"normal"""" to many Belgraders. I see you been to South Serbia (Niš and Leskovac), but you should have in mind that Belgrade and the northern part was and is way more richer (double, or even more). About the separatism, it was a huge error (for Serbia) not to allow to Croatia and Slovenia to be independent during the monarchic period. All the rest of the country was suposed to belong to Serbia (call me nationalist, but that is a fact). Even Yugoslavia was created so there wouldn´t be a """"big"""" orthodox Kingdom of Serbia. Neither Vatican, Austria, Germany or Turkey, neither France and UK (with excuse of the possibility of that Serbia becoming a allied of Russia) wanted that, so a """"neutral"""" Yugoslavia was imposed. About the Serbian-Bulgarian problem, it all begin when Serbia was not allowed to have direct access to see, so it had to be compensated with lands, part of current Macedonia, that were suposed to belong to Bulgaria. I know and recognise that. You have the maps on the page (Kingdom of Serbia) where you see that the Serbo-Bulgarian border was moved east, so that Albaian state was created. All current Eastern Macedonia was given to Serbia as compensation for taking Albania from Serbia. We could talk centuries about it, wright?   """,0

I want to point out a few possible problems with some specific sections or topics, esp pertaining to 'no citations':

no citation, npov: The system is still encountering strain and financial constraints, some say more than ever. And what is the point of the sentence anyways?
Healthcare
The Campbell government inherited a health care system that was encountering strain and financial constraints upon assuming office.

No citation: It also has an issue that he campaigned on NO cuts to government workers, hospital workers, etc, in fact, when accused by the NDP of his going to have to make large cuts and layoffs, he fired back that the NDP was fear mongering:
[edit] Income tax reductions
In 2001, Campbell campaigned on a promise to significantly reduce income taxes. A day after taking office, Campbell reduced personal income tax for all taxpayers by 25 per cent over two years. Cuts were applied to every tax bracket; the tax rate on the first $30,000 of income was cut by 2 points from 8.4% to 6.05%, while the top tax rate for income over $85,000 was cut by 5 points from 19.7% to 14.7%.

No citation:
Education
While funding was increased to record levels during the Campbell government’s first term in office, challenges remained in K-12 education.

Again, no citation. Campbell might have been in favour, but it was started by the NDP, as many pundints are quick to point out when hospital closures are compared against the cost of new luge track.
2010 Olympics
British Columbia won the right to host the 2010 Winter Olympics on July 2nd, 2003. This was a joint Winter Olympics bid by Vancouver and the ski resort of Whistler. [18].
Campbell, a main proponent of the bid to get the games, attended the final presentations in Prague, Czech Republic and made an impassioned plea for the games to come back to Canada for the first time since it was held in Calgary in 1988.

This is only a quick look. I would appreciate some feedback before changes are made.
As I have pointed out earlier, a great deal of this article reads like a press release. If you compare this premier with any other, there will be a world of difference. 

Perhaps it should be scaled back to the bare minimum bio, and everything else gets chucked into the appropriate spot.

Anons concerns cont'd

On the grav-locked, red dwarf planet:

Note that a planet gravitationally locked to its star will have tidal heating like Io, so it's not as if everything will freeze on the night side. The great advantage of a grav-locked planet is its stability. I think it's fair to say that stability is easier for life to deal with than instability. If you look at the stability of Jupiter's great red spot (400 years and posited to be permanent), weather on a grav-locked planet should be relatively stable, I presume a convection rising at the """"sun pole"""" and falling at the """"dark pole"""", with terrain eddies, of course. Such a planet will have no axial tilt, no day/night cycleI don't even think it can have an eccentric orbit, but I'm unsure. This greatly reduces the complexity of an organism's job: for example a plant doesn't need the night """"mode"""" earth plants need; they would not have to drop leaves for winter. These seem like advantages to me.

Based on the best information I can find on the US Dept. of Energy site (solar information), what plants get on a clear equinox day is about 8 kWH/m^2, peaking at 1 kW/m^2. The vast majority of that power comes in the middle 8 hours, less than 1 kWH/m^2 is in morning and evening. The night is essentially 0 kWH/m^2not absolutely, no, but to the 2 digit accuracy I was using, yes. (Compare visual magnitudes of sun vs. moon.) This varies by latitude and season, of course. Now let's plug this into the supposedly horrible 60-200% variation of a red dwarf. Instead of roughly 1/3 time at 1 kW (yes, it really is close to that), equivalent energy would be all the time at 1/3 kW. Thus, the variation would be 1/5 kW during minimums (=60% of 1/3 kW) and, of course, 200% is 2/3 kW. Thus, ignoring frequency, the red dwarf plant has an easier time. The lower power of red dwarfs just pull the HZ in. Considering Earth shade plants, which live on far less than 1 kW/m^2, the HZ is where the total solar and gravitational energy are right for water.

Organizationally, perhaps the best thing would be to treat Earth-like planets in the main flow of the article: then discuss tidally-locked red dwarf planets, with a note that thinking on the issue is in flux; and note that chemosynthsis biospheres would be possible even around brown dwarfs or outlying moons, like Titan and Europa. Perhaps (keeping original numbers):

1 Suitable star systems

 1.1 Spectral class
 3.1 Binary systems (since all but the closest binaries are ok, put it here)
 1.2 A stable habitable zone

2 Planetary characteristics

 2.1 Mass
 1.3/2.2 Acceptable energy variation (as I hope I showed about, """"low"""" isn't really necessary; include the case of Jovian moons in the HZ)
 1.4 High metallicity (it comes from system formation but it's a planet property)
 2.3 Geochemistry (maybe combine with metallicity?)

3 Alternative biologies
 3.2 Red dwarf systems (tidally locked; low light?)
 NEW Chemosynthesis-based biology.

4 on, no changes.

I should add, this is a really good article. Maybe I'm trying to gild the lily.

 Mistake ? 
I am not a specialist but """"Mars, by contrast, is nearly (or perhaps totally) geologically dead and has lost much of its atmosphere [10]."""" (mass paragraph) seems doubtful to me. I mean, Mars still has volcanoes (Mount Olympus for example) so it sees strange to me that it's geologically dead, but once again I am no specialist.  

Mars does have volcanoes, but as far as I know, they're not really active, so nothing is really """"powering them"""" and geological activity isn't really showing up.   
Luna, Earth's Moon has volcanoes, and it's accepted as geologically dead. The presence of volcanoes doesn't mean ACTIVE volcanoes. 
That's basically what I was trying to say, I guess I just never made it really clear.

"""
BTW, /where/ a particular critic is published or quoted is 'technically' only relevant (for verifiability) as far as the 'reputation' of the publication. Time and Womens Wear Daily are equally 'reputable sources', in the very sense I mean, as in that if either one publishes an interview with a major personality you can be pretty damn sure the person actually said the quotes. Writing """"Bob said 'I love it!'"""" is a 'statement of a fact directly known to the author'. The interviewer saw and heard the interviewee say it, unless they are lying, the publisher let them get away with it, and the interviewee didn't scream bloody murder. Doubtful for either of those magazines.
The same critic's interview published on the fansite 'www.ilovebooks.com' fails that test (His published quotes are 'notable', but not 'verifiable'). In the little known 'Collection of My Interviews of Book Critics', written by 'Joe English Professor, Ph.D.' and published by Oxford University Press it definitely passes due to scholarly review.
OTOH, the interview quotes of an 'unnamed Palestinean' as part of an article in Time about the West Bank pass the verifiability test, though 'notability' of the quotes would depend on context. The same article in Womens Wear Daily does not, as they are much less likely to have fact checked it as thoroughly, which is needed for something such as that. It's much more plausible that the WWD author spent his entire 'in country' time sitting in the hotel bar writing a fake article and got away with it. Get it?
It's also unlikely, TBH, that Bloom would have said anything different if he was asked the exact same questions, in the same order, by the same person, in the exact same context except that the interview was for Time. Also, a formal 'review' by him would have said the same thing....just in better language.
As far as a book review by a professional, which is a 'direct statement of opinion by an expert', where the critic is published is a function of his 'reputation', not vice versa. Peeps write reviews for Time instead of The Podunk Daily because of their reputation, and the fact they are published in Time is just an indication of that.
Say that famous reviewer retires, and only writes occasional reviews for his hometown paper, The Podunk Daily, to 'keep his hand in'. They are just as usable, though it might be harder to verify that (you can assume a reviewer published in Time is a 'good' one, you have to check the other one out).

I urge you to read the long history records on the Ronald Ryan article and discussion pages. There have been defamatory and false edits against Ryan and his living family menbers. We know meatpuppets are using various fake IPs to add false material and to removal of factual material. In one of many recent disgusting edits by meatpuppet/s, Ryan was accused of having sexual relations with his own daughter. In another disgusting edit Ryan was accused of being born a homosexual. Ryan is dead but his family members are alive to take legal action against these meatpuppets. 

Ryan’s surviving members of his family will continue to correct the distorted, manipulated opinions and views of one book author Mike Richards, whilst all other referenced material is ignored, vandalized and removed. The scapegoat/excuse being used by these meatpuppets is wrong as it is outrageous. Members of the Ryan family are alive and well. 

Supporters of Ronald Ryan will forever unite on the facts of his case and execution. We will continue to contribute the facts, based on the hundreds of references that diagree with Richards personal views. Facts like: There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to prove Ryan fired a shot.

 opening 

There seems to be a constant push to put neoclassical economics in the opening and make it seem like this covers all economic theory.  I don't know if this is due to ignorance or design or both.  At least this time it's in the fifth paragraph in stead of the first.

Calling neoclassical economics modern economics is hopelessly POV.  People who agree with the theory are """"modern"""", what are people who don't, antiquated?  This was called mainstream economics, and it was changed to modern economics.  Since the person who changed it complained they did not like the phrase mainstream economics, I am changing it to neoclassical economics.  It is fine if you don't like the phrase mainstream economics, whoever called it that in the first place, but dividing economic theories into modern and implictly antiquated for the rest is POV.

Then there are the three sentences following that which detail neoclassical economics.  Neoclassical economics is one theory, your favorite, among other theories, and putting it at this point means to me that the paragraph describing the difference between these theories must proceed it (""""Another division is between mainstream economics, used to distinguish economics in general, and heterodox approaches..."""") so people understand they are reading one approach to economics, not *all* approaches.  

Someone wanted to put this neoclassical stuff in the opening and use 75 words for it.  I think it is better to not go into it in the opening, but whatever.  But if it is put up there, the alternative, original theory of value deserves more space up top as well.

Then we have the modification of """"that economics primarily deals with the exchange of value, and that labour (human effort) is the source of all value."""" to the ridiculous """"Thus, in Marx’s labour theory of value, value is considered as a measure of labor exploitation, rather than of price.""""  This makes no sense on many levels - does this mean Marx thought an object produced without labor exploitation would have no value?  The idea that labor is the source of all value was not an innovation by Marx - Adam Smith, David Ricardo and all the early economists agreed on this and Marx simply accepted it.  """,0

"Thanks for your comments to the scoring system. It was, if you can see, for the first 2 rounds, the first person who gets the correct answer received a times-infinity bonus because all others are given 0 points. My work with the current scoring system is to encourage people to KEEP ANSWERING after somebody has got correct, and as the same time KEEP the privilege of the first correct-getter. As you can see, owing to this new scoring system, the amount of answer-scripts have risen dramatically. I wonder if the 1-extra-point system will bring any negative effect to the future competitions. It is because each question carries different amount of points, and the first-answer will lose his or her advantage. Instead, I suggest that a multiplier is to be kept instead of replacing it with an addition.

Also, to encourage more replies, I've also given bonus multipliers to the second and third persons who get the correct answer. So what I think after hearing your opinion is, to keep the multiplying system, but the multiplier may be reduced from *4, *2, *1.5 to something like *2, *1.5, *1.2 (something greater than 1 but not greater than 1.5).

I move to strike  from the Lead.   

I also move to strike the entire last paragraph of the lead {{Genealogical researchers have documented that ancestors of many Lumbee families were part of a tri-racial isolate group of predominantly African and European ethnicity, originating among individuals free in colonial Virginia. Most such free African Americans were descended from unions between white women, servant or free, and African men, servant, free or enslaved. Although relationships across racial lines were tolerated among the servant class in early colonial days, Virginia officials later moved to outlaw them. In the mid-1700s, the free colored families of Virginia migrated together, with other European colonists, into the interior of North Carolina. Researcher Paul Heinegg noted numerous families identified as mulattos, many with characteristically Lumbee names, in the 1768-1770 tax lists for Bladen County, from which Robeson County was formed. Heinegg found no nuclear families listed as Indian. In the 1790-1800 censuses, all free people of color were listed under """"other free"""".[3]}}

Posting the murderer's name on the talk page does not constitute disruption: yes, making a point, but no, not disrupting Wikipedia, and in any case they've promised not to continue.  And given that you have been involved in the discussion and taken a clear stance against this user's opinions (as established by you here), it might be best for you to let it be.  I honestly see at most 2 who really support the block: you and Jayron, and you'd been involved in the dispute.  Arguably Exploding Boy might have, but his one comment has  been contradicted.

In order to facilitate reference to talk page discussions, I will need to create an archive page for the talk page content that one of the admins previously blanked.  Is there any problem with that?  

You can link to a permanent revision in the history if need be, so long as the page was not actually deleted.  

As far as I know, nothing was permanently deleted, although some discussions have been moved to archive pages.  The other thing I need to exhibit is the blocking message that KillerChihuahua posted.  That one does not appear in any revision of this talk page; it appears on a template that I see on my user page, but I don't think others see that template.  How do I reference or exhibit that original blocking message?  

Just go into the history, and click the appropriate date on a revision.  That will bring you to a page, with a link.  Here is an example, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Moulton&oldid;=157221709.

As an aside, what will you do if unblocked?  Do you intend to edit articles again?  

How do I link to something that exhibits KillerChihuahua's original blocking message, wherein she gives the reason for blocking?  

It's too soon to decide what I will do if unblocked, as that depends on what transpires during the course of these proceedings.  If the objectives I set forth in my RfC are embraced and endorsed, then it's reasonable to imagine that it would be feasible for people like me to contribute to the crafting of mainspace articles.  If those objectives are repudiated by ArbCom, then there would be no point in editing articles, even if I were provisionally unblocked on technical grounds related to denial of due process. 

I have one other question on how these cases are titled.  Is there any standard convention on titling these cases?  

this is your block log.  Tilting?  

Not tilting, but titling.  Do I entitle the case """"Moulton"""" or """"Moulton v. KillerChihuaha"""" or """"KillerChihuahua"""" since she is the admin whose actions I am contesting.  

No vs.  You are verses anything.  You are requesting a unblock review to ArbCom.  """"Moulton"""" works.  

I have filled in the RfAr Template, and (unless you spot any deficiencies), I believe it is now ready for posting.  Would one of you (Nathan or Anthony) please do the honors? Thank you.  
.  

Thank you!   
Notice for any observing parties, I am moving to unblock Moulton, after current attempts to seek reassurance from Moulton that he will not edit any pages except his user space and the relevant RfArb. sections/pages are complete.  
P.S., Moulton: check your email.

"""::::::: Hi everyone this is the first time I've closely examined this page. I've been heavily involved in OWS since last October, which means two things: 1) I know a bunch of stuff first-hand, including things the media has failed to document, and 2) sometimes an NPOV is going to be difficult for me to maintain. That said, I have many concerns with this article, mostly on the facts. For example, this quote above: the rules of Zuccotti Park aren't self-justifying; this quote and others in the article seem to indicate that they are actually material. They're not; they don't actually exist; there is a rule-making procedure that is required by city law which the police and Brookfield have totally ignored. So, using them to explain police action without quoting or citing a police source is not NPOV. Secondly, these rules have nothing to do with the police tactics used that day, which were employed all over the Financial District, well outside the region where the """"rules"""" of Zuccotti Park apply. What happened was the police grab whoever they feel like at any given moment, apply laws like the disorderly conduct statute willy-nilly (""""blocking pedestrian traffic"""" is frequently absurdly applied), and have a goal not of enforcing laws but of maintaining an extralegal standard of order. This is called """"crowd control policing"""", and it explicitly involves unconstitutional conduct and arrests. Remember, sometimes a point of view is political despite being neutral, i.e. based in empirical observation and fact. Thanks for your work, and perhaps you can offer some guidance as to how first-person expertise can properly be used to make sure a wiki article is factual and not based on flawed or incomplete media interpretation.

I mean why else would  open himself/herself open to conflict of interest accustions unless they thought loyalty to ones mates buys more then the rule book.

Since you like to seemingly feel free to edit my complaint as you like, I put a copy here incase you admin type feel guilty about your little stunts:
The block log clearly says I have committed a  24 hour 3RR edit war and that is false and I have said so. How does an administrator have the right prevent my voice being heard? Is this some sort of In-Crowd club where new people are not allowed to have any rights? Wethe new usersare simply abused and punished without pause while other groups of users gang up on us and get away with the very same thing unscathed?

another copy of my complaint since you admin types like to edit out the truth along with the rules-

I’m not sure exactly why I have been blocked; it has not been explained to me. It is quite clear that I have not committed a (24 hour) 3RR offense here Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Edit_warring#User:Gharr_reported_by_User:Sloane_.28Result:_24h.29. I think this administrator is out of line. The users that were affected by this are not  here, it seams that  on on me! Because of this unjust punishment I have been prevented from having my voice heard in a complaint against —(and  User:Sloane  has seemingly been successful so far here in continuing that trend with a administrators help). 

Since I have been blocked there may be a chance my complaint about hounding will go into the archives. Other users have claimed that silencing people are wrong, yet it has been done to me so my complaint will remain unheard. Further User:Zakhalesh has started to get involved too and seem to have sided with User:Sloane. 

I get the feeling  that  users have linked to my personal page and also claimed to have links to outside Wikipedia on my comments. None of the many people leaving comments there have bothered to say this is wrong. Perhaps new user here really don't have any equal rights here on several levels. You people have permanantly turned me off asking for any more powers in Wikipediamany of of you seem to wield those rights like weapons against new users and do whatever you like.

However I can only go by the block log and that says I have committed a  24 hour 3RR edit war and that is false and I",0

 Why did Saturn fail??? 

I came to this entry to find out why GM is having to close Saturn - obviously decreasing sales - but why did this occur???  I would have thought that a new car company - away from the strangling management and unions of GM, started from scratch to compete against foreign small cars, would have been a winner - after all, the problem with GM/Detroit right now is that they don't make the right kind of cars, don't make small cars to compete with foreign small cars.  But this article tells me . . . . . absolutely nothing about what went wrong at Saturn.  Another useless Wikipedia entry.  I guess I'll have to go someplace else to find out what happened to Saturn.  P.S.More and more entries at Wikipedia are becoming like this, i.e. leaves out tons of pertinent information (can NEVER have negative information in a Wikipedia entry - that is VERBOTIM!!!) until the article is useless.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 81.158.54.161   """,0

"""Just for the record, Castro apologised for his treatment of gays . While this doesn't mean that what he did was all fine now, it shows that he is at least remorseful and has stopped persecuting people based on their sexuality. In 1992 he told a Sandinista official:

""""I'm not going to deny that, at a certain point, this machista thing,
influenced the approach that was taken toward homosexuality. I personally 
you are asking me my personal opinion  do not suffer from this type of
phobia against homosexuals. Truly, in my mind, that's never been there and I
have never been in favor nor have I promoted [homosexuality], nor have I supported [laws against homosexuality].""""

I don't see homosexuality as a phenomenon of degeneration, but rather I see
it in another way. The approach has been of another sort: a more rational
approach, considering the tendencies and natural things of the human being,
who simply must be respected. This is the philosophy with which I view these
problems. I think that there has to be consideration shown toward the family
that suffers these situations. I would hope that the families would have another
mentality, that they would have another approach when something of this sort
happens. I am absolutely opposed to any form of repression, disdain, contempt
or discrimination with respect to homosexuals. That's what I think."""" И]] 12:15, Aug 19, 2004 (UTC)

(see English French German cathedrals). They were the largest architectural challenge until the invention of skyscrapers. The medieval English Windsor Castle (see the photos on that arcitcle) was even bigger than the largest imperial palace of the Roman Empire (the so-called famous Nero palace). The ancient European and renaissance mathematic philiosophy theatre , sculpture fine-arts paintings are also much finer than Chinese or Japanese. Western European technology and civilization became much developed around the 14th century than the Eastern high cultures. The metallurgy and steal industry were much developed than the eastern too.The development of Eastern science and technology stopped around the 14th century.

In popular culture
 Dunkleosteus was the main apex predator of the fifth most dangerous sea in Sea Monsters. The show counted down the top 7 most dangerous seas in history. Dunkleosteus was depicted as being cannibalistic and capable of bending metal.
 In the Dinotopia books and movies a massive Dunkleosteus dubbed the """"Fish"""" by the Kraabs', Lee and his son, Cyrus guards the underwater entrance to the subterranean caves that contain the strutters and sunstones.
 The Devonian predator also made a brief appearance in the video game ParaWorld.
 In the video game E.V.O. Search For Eden, Dunkleosteus appeared as an enemy creature in the first time period, and the player could evolve its jaws and body, both being the strongest in those categories.
 China Miéville's novel The Scar features Dunkleosteus, where they are also referred to as """"bonefish"""".
 In Ecco the Dolphin, Dunkleosteus appeared as an enemy in the prehistoric levels. Ironically the Dunkleosteus existed in the Devonian period and the prehistoric levels takes place 55 million years ago. They were already extinct during that time. Even its echolocation sprite resembles a shark.
 The early Playstation game Aquanaut's Holiday features at least two of these animals. One in the far north, within a 'den' and one in the extreme southeast.
 Dunkleosteus was featured in the second episode of Animal Armageddon.
 A Dunkleosteus is rumored to appear in the upcoming season 3 of the ITV television show """"Primeval""""

 Issues on Banned IP 

Howdy,

Noticed that this IP has been banned due to vandalism, and if I could, would highly recommend that you contact Internode about this.  Internode has been around as an ISP here in SA for a very very long time, and has a reputation of """"doing the right thing"""".  Could I recommend you contact Simon Hackket at Simon@Internode.on.net .. He's the CEO of the business, and a very active and involved person.  It may be quite possible that he could initiate some action against the *actual* vandal if you are able to provide a clean time and date that the offending IP did it's work.  I *think* actions like this would be against the agreement made with Internode on fair use.

In any case, he's a great guy who just won't ignore the issue.

Hope this helps.

Q.  How are the barrels rotated?

A.  The rotational force is delivered by two hydraulic drive motors operating off of both main aircraft hydraulic systems (A+B).  The motors deliver their torque to gearbox in the Hydraulic drive assembly.  This in turn delivers the force to two drive shafts.  The forward one goes to the rotor assembly on the GAU-8 itself, while the second delivers it's power to the ammunition drum.

Q.  How long is typical spin-up time?

A.  While the system is capable of operating at 4200 rounds per minute, it is limited to 3900 while installed in the aircraft.  Since the GAU-8 has 7 barrels it needs to spin at 1/7th of the firing rate.  Basically since it's rotating a touch over 550 rpm the spin-up time is almost instantaneous. 

On another point the statement on the gun gas on affecting the engines is complete rubbish.  During the firing of the GAU-8 the engines ingest so much gun gas that the engine igniters (think super spark plugs) must fire to ensure a stall does not occur.  The engines also will ingest so much soot from the firings that they need to be """"water washed"""" (have water and a mild cleaning solution misted into the engines while running at approx. 80% power) periodically to remove soot from the blades.  Anyone who has had to clean an A-10 will tell you the gun gas goes just about everywhere aft of the nose.""",0

Ethnic Malays
This edit war is getting a little tiring. You added a lot of references to support your claim """"and to some degree Javanese culture; however it differs by being more overtly Islamic than the Javanese culture"""". Yes, it is true they are similar to """"some degree"""". But you could also say that Malays are similar to """"some degree"""" with many other Austronesian cultures, of which there are thousands. If you look at the language classification  the Malay language and Javanese have over 1000 languages in the same language group. Out of those, the Malay language is in fact closer to many other languages such as Ibanic, Kendayan, Balinese, Madurese & Sundanese than it is to Javanese. So why have you mentioned Javanese specifically and not one of those other 1000 cultures, especially those which are more closely linked to Malay culture? You can of course find elements of one culture which have been adopted by another culture, but does that make them similar enough to mention? Its like saying American and Japanese culture is similar since they both like to play baseball. You could just as correctly say that Malays and Thais are similar """"to some degree"""". The second part of the claim """"however it differs by being more overtly Islamic than the Javanese culture"""" is wrong since it implies that religion is the only, or even the main differentiating factor.

 strange situation at the Barak Obama talk page 

Recently I added a single reliably-sourced word, """"African,"""" to the list of Barak Obama's mother's ethnic origins near the beginning of the Barak Obama article.  My basic point is that if the article mentions Obama's mother's single Scottish ancestor (who was born 400 years ago), as well as Obama's Irish and Swiss ancestry, then there shouldn't be a problem with an equally-brief mention of her African ancestry. My one-word addition to the article was first modified and then deleted, so I opened a talk page here.  The discussion has taken a disturbing turn, and seems to have hit a nerve of racial discomfort among some wikipedia editors.  In particular, the suggestion to delete the entire list of ethnic origins as a way to avoid adding the word """"African"""" strikes me as a potential public relations black eye for wikipedia, which is why I am making this post here.

Hi. Do you mean the box that says """"This article is an orphan, as few or no other articles link to it."""" on the article Gobar Times?

 Dear Leslie fyans, hello, and welcome to Wikipedia! I hope to not seem unfriendly, but I'd like to bring to your attention the conflict of interest guideline which explains the potential incompatibility between the purpose of Wikipedia to produce a neutral, verifiable encyclopedia, and the purposes of an individual editor. Conflict of interest editing often involves contributing to Wikipedia in order to promote yourself, your friends or family, or the interests of other individuals, companies, or groups you are closely associated with. When an editor disregards the aims of Wikipedia to advance outside interests, they stand in a conflict. Please review this guideline, and you may wish to also review the notability guidelines as well. Thank you for your interest in Wikipedia, and I hope you'll find many helpful areas! Sincerely, Ariel♥Gold 
Hi Leslie, I'm placing this here for your review, as your submission to articles for creation was specifically about yourself. Also please see Wikipedia:Autobiography, along the same lines. Normally if you are notable enough, reliable, third-party sources will exist, and an article will have been written. If you are notable (again refer to the notability requirements), but the article does not exist, you may request it, but either way, you should not edit an article about yourself, as explained above, as it would be quite difficult to remain neutral, which is one of the core policies of Wikipedia. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thanks! Ariel♥Gold """,0

Disclaimer
This talk page should remain BLANK, so any message here would probably be deleted without being read. To prevent this, I recommend you to post your comments according to the indications below.

1. Comments related to article content
This is not the place for them. Every wikipedia page has a Talk Page. If you are unhappy with what I've wrote, you want clarification or you want to suggest improvement, press discussion on the top of the respective page and express your concerns. This way, more people will see your comments and maybe they will be able to help you more.

2. Warnings
Don't put it here. Choose a random page (preferably a talk page) and put your warning there. Admins will consider I have been warned anyway, so why ruin my Talk page?

3. Blocks
If you're an Admin and you have blocked me, don't note it here. I'll surely notice it when I try to edit an article. If you want to show others how strong you are, there's always my Block log. In case you want to give me the chance to ask a review of my block, don't bother. Other Admins will most probably agree with you, and even the ones who think the block was not fair will do nothing about it. So why waste your time?

4. Personal comments
If you want to tell me something important, but not related to one of the categories above, don't write here. Keep it for yourself. Of course, if you want to warn be about a imminent nuclear attack against South Eastern Romania, you could send me an e-mail. But only then. So please, no personal comments here.

5. Vandalism
Why vandalise this talk page that few people watch when you can vandalise the page of a country, a city or a president? More people will see you and you'll gain a better reputation.

Hi - two or more stub types which you created have been nominated for deletion or renaming at Wikipedia:Stub types for deletion. The stub types (templates or categories), which were not proposed at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals, do not meet the standard requirements for a stub type, either through being incorrectly named, ambiguously scoped, or through failure to meet standards relating to the current stub hierarchy or likely size, as explained at Wikipedia:Stub. Please feel free to make any comments at WP:SFD regarding these stub types, and in future, please consider proposing new stub types first!

It is worth noting that stub templates are virtually never created for independentist regions until such time that they are recognised internationally by a significant number of countries, as these stub types tend to become the targets of potential edit-warring (something which has far more far-reaching effects on templates than it has on articles). Thus, for example, there is no stub type for Turkish North Cyprus, since it is only recognised by one country. If Abkhazia and South Ossetia become recognised by more than just one country, then feel free to propose the creation of stub types for them. Until then, it is generally accepted practice with stub sorting for them not to have separate stub types. ...wha? """,0

 Stillman inference 

a paragraph in the article, citing pp 14-16 of Stillman's 1979 work, reads as follows:

According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself and avoid being accused of double standards given the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir. Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.

however, the only relevant discussion i found was this (p.15):

When all hope was gone they [i.e. Qurayza] sought to surrender on the same terms as had the Naḍīr. This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā c at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery. Muhammad then declared that this was none other than Allah's decision. Actually, it is clear from the Muslim sources that the Qurayza's fate had been decided even before their surrender. One of Muhammad's emissaries, Abū Lubāba, who had advised the Qurayẓa to give up, had to perform penance for hinting to the Jews what their real fate would be.

Stillman doesn't state or imply that Muhammad deferred judgement to Sa'd in order to avoid accusations of double standards (especially when he openly endorsed the decision), so i believe this is original research. what seems more apparent is that, because of the Awsites protesting, it was Sa'd (Aws chieftain) who was chosen to pronounce the judgement, as they may have been more accepting of the decree if it came from their tribal leader.again, with the second sentence in the article, i do not see how the solitary sentence discussing Abu Lubaba substantiates what has been written, or where Stillman is making any """"infer[ences]"""" that Banu Qurayza's fate had already been decided by Muhammad before their surrender.  
This is clear from the last two sentences of the excerpt. The first sentence states the conclusion; the second contains the premise.  Or 
could you also address the first point?  
This is clear from the following setences:This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery.
 Or 
i have provided that extract above, and commented on it: Stillman doesn't state or imply that Muhammad deferred judgement to Sa'd in order to avoid accusations of double standards (especially when he openly endorsed the decision), so i believe this is original research. what seems more apparent is that, because of the Awsites protesting",0

Well it is clear that my position on what is proper to cover in this article does not fit with the vocal majority here.
I maintain that the article, in its current form, reads like a sanitized Vatican press release.  Even if all of the arguments I've presented here are seen to carry no weight, I fail to see how the wealth of reliable sources that I've sited have been so readily dismissed as irrelevant, giving not so much as a single mention within the body of the article.  And aside from the one's I had highlighted, there were plenty of reliable sources reporting on the December VatiLeaks Dossier, with that document's connection to the resignation decision.  I find it shocking to see so many editors here to not want a single mention of any of that.  So the decision for now is to continue presenting an article on Benedict's resignation as though there was absolutely no connection to any of the scandals, and to pretend that all of the reliable sources that do point to such connections don't exist.  Very curious.  15:20, 7",0
""":::It has nothing to do with the validity of cross cultural comparisons.  It has everything to do with original research and laziness.  There are all sorts of similarities that exist in the world, and all sorts of similarities that some editor is going to think is interesting.

That is why reasonable sources are required and items without sources deemed original research.

His son tried to evade taking the land in lien from the Holy Roman Empire, but after some years, had to submit. Further Polish dukes all submitted to the empire. Then Wenzel II, a king of Bohemia (part of the empire) also became King of Poland.

Silesia, conquered in the 990s by Boleslaw I Chrobry was until 1157 ruled by Polish dukes (who were subject to the Holy Roman Empire). Thus Silesia, conquered in the 990s by Boleslaw I Chrobry was until 1157 'Polish'.

"Bold textPosted by someone else from here on (I couldn't figure out how to make my own post, sorry!): Its actually generally the later Diablos that weren't RWD since Audi took over in 1996.  Although the VT has always been AWD/4WD (I have no idea what the difference is if there is one!) and perhaps the only AWD/4WD Diablo (I'm not sure!) Audi began to produce more models of VT (i.e. the VT 6.0, VT 6.0 SE and the VT Millenium Roadster as well as the previously made VT and VT Roadster) because of their stupid beliefs about sensible 4WD being better than the more dangerous yet obviously more thrilling RWD mainly due to the danger factor!

Now all Lamborghinis made are AWD/4WD however and that's thanks to Audi who have Audified the entire Lamborghini model range in probably every way!  Oh well, at least Lamborghini were able to produce the Diablo SE30 Jota before it all went wroong...",0

Current Squad
I propose redoing the current squad list a bit (for all South African teams). During the first half of the year, the top players will play Super Rugby for the Bulls; during the second half, some of them will play for the Springboks. I suggest we list all players in this section that are contracted to the Blue Bulls, but also indicate if they play at national team level, at Super Rugby level, at Currie Cup level or at Vodacom Cup level only.

With the current format, I think the only way possible would be to have some kind of indicator. Something like:

Props
  Dean Greyling (NT)
  Rayno Gerber (SR)
  Rossouw de Klerk (CC)
  Basil Short (VC)

Hooker
  Chiliboy Ralepelle (NT)
(NT) Represented South Africa in 2012(SR) Represented the  in Super Rugby in 2012(CC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Currie Cup rugby in 2012(VC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Vodacom Cup rugby in 2012

The indicator would show the highest level the player played at during the season and players would be sorted by position first, then this indicator, then surname.

However, an alternate representation could be:

 PropsNameNTSRCCVC  Dean Greyling                          Rayno Gerber                                      Rossouw de Klerk                                  Basil Short                                                 Hookers  Chiliboy Ralepelle                   

(NT) Represented South Africa in 2012(SR) Represented the  in Super Rugby in 2012(CC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Currie Cup rugby in 2012(VC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Vodacom Cup rugby in 2012

This could again be sorted by playing position, then level played, then surname.  Footnotes can be used if a player represented a different Super Rugby franchise than the main one affiliated with the union, etc. A template (which is a slight variation on {{rugby squad player}}) can be developed to simplify this.

Any thoughts, question, comments, suggestions, criticisms, etc?""",0

 My reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the Nicosia Discussion page....l 

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

 Please help me end this drama once in for all 

I really do hate to get start making accusations, but I feel as if User:Delicious carbuncle is seriously heading down a road of corruption. It all started over a simple proposal at WP:VILLAGE where I skeptically proposed an idea for a template similar to the Template:Romeo warning for silly vandals apparently belonging to cheerleading squads. DC then started questioning my actions at WP:ABUSE, in which case I appropriately addressed his concerns. However, he seems to possibly have a problem with either my involvement at the project or perhaps even the project as a whole. He posted my real life first name, high school, and high school mascot in an example, in which case I raised concerns of WP:OUTING (note that his previous block for outing is unrelated). He said that it was merely a random name he chose, and I've chosen to WP:AGF in the matter, and you may treat that matter however you so desire. After receiving a comment on his talk page from a blatant IP troll that's been harassing me for over a month, he decided to start looking into the trolls claims about my handling of a repeat offender mainly known here as User:LBHS Cheerleader. He started heatedly questioning my actions, asking for diffs about bans. I had removed a """"suspected sockpuppet"""" template stating that the user might be related to User:Bobabobabo (which I had added over a year ago) and replaced it with a banned template since although I feel it's inappropriate that we were using Boba's ban against LBHSC without evidence, I similiarily felt it was inappropriate to all of a sudden to consider her """"debanned."""" I also added LBHSC to the list of community banned users as it seemed to be a consensus to me. I probably should have discussed this first, but I did not in light of WP:BOLD and WP:DENY (I didn't want to start a thread without absolutely needing to). Per WP:DUCK, it seems pretty obvious that LBHSC and her minions have been vandalizing for quite some time, at least since 2006, probably ban-worthy. However, I gracefully removed the contested templates when Delicious carbuncle started a thread at WP:AN/I in attempt to calmly settle the issue, and even stated that I would voluntarily abandon my efforts to combat LBHSC's disruption (beyond non-controversial reverting of blatant vandalism of course). DC ruthlessly refused to compromise, and I even contemplated retirement if only to save my name """"PCHS-NJROTC."""" Even then DC was not satisfied. Several users argued that LBHSC should indeed be considered banned as she would likely never be unblocked, including highly respected admins. Many editors, administrators, and even members of the WP:ArbCom have expressed their opinion that DC should move on. Even an admin who felt I had acted out of line and should be blocked stated that there's not enough support to keep the discussion going. Although there were those who defended my actions 100%, felt that although that the user should be banned but I should have discussed first, felt that I was being power hungry, and even thought that my actions were abusive, the general consenus of everybody was that I had offered settlement, learned important lessons, and that good faith should be assumed. Despite consensus, DC continued to revive the discussion over and over again, providing nothing new, and basically insisting on action. He has been warned repeatedly by several respected editors. He had stopped, and I had disengaged. I really wish this could have stayed in the past. However, Delicious carbuncle started User:Delicious_carbuncle/PCHS-NJROTC_ban_redux in the dawn of the new year. Considering the edit summary he used when creating the page, I initially thought his intentions were to use that as an arguement against someone who he is in conflict with known as User:Neutralhomer. In desire to not be involved in his conflict, I nominated the page for deletion at WP:MFD. I viewed it simply as an attack page which did not help the encyclopedia. I could have nominated for WP:CSD, but I didn't want to say that he was """"attacking me"""" as I was in favor of disengagement as was recommended at AN/I. In response to the MfD, he indicated that he intends to start yet another ban discussion. I'm not sure if he's wanting a topic ban on vandalism as before (which really isn't even a topic) or an all out ban. I did indicate that I would not stay here if I was topic banned, and that I would just assume be renamed to something unaffiliated with me (i.e. Vandal Fighter Missing in Action) and then be fully banned, but thankfully there's no support for either a topic ban or all out ban. It's clear that disengagement is still prefered based on some comments at the MfD discussion. After the original p",0

Thanks for the advice on the deletion votes - I'll try to be more descriptive of why I think these things should be kept. However, it was not my understanding that a vote would be discounted simply because no explanation was given.
Re my username, while I understand that many people harbour predjudice against trolls, my username expresses my belief that in building a neutral, accurate encyclopedia, creative and innovative approaches are helpful. I believe that trolling is an important part of any wiki, and without people who are willing to creatively challenge accepted assumptions and groupthink a community may stagnate or fail to maximise its opportunities. Many people who say they are against 'trolling' are actually, when you talk to them about it, against vandalism, personal attacks or timewasting, none of which I condone. I think that w e need to be more tollerant of different approaches as a community, and more willing to try to understand each other - in that way we can build the best encyclopedia possible. Thanks for you advice, hope to see you around,  10:47, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)",0

I appreciate your reasoned explanation of the edits, Lucericr, but it is still troubling that Chzz chose to enforce Wikipedia's policies for personal rather than objective reasons (and please, no more inane references to WP:AGF or the like; it is perfectly obvious why Chzz felt motivated to decimate my contributions to the Soft3D page). It is becoming abundantly clear that this web site's objectivity is compromised by a small group of privileged admins, some of whom manipulate policy and selectively enforce standards to their own personal tastes. So much for the encyclopedia that """"anyone can edit."""" If you really want to claim that your policies are enforced fairly, then I challenge one of you to edit the Softimage XSI page in the same way Chzz edited the Soft3D page.

Do you mean you can read about those work conditions & not see that it's slavery?  Prepare yourself for earthshaking news: the wage system is slavery but most people didn't think so.  Slavery means """"someone who is controlled by someone or something.""""   A boss controls a slave, but a slave also enslaves a boss.   Being offered a wage you can't live on is slavery.   All jobs are being eliminated by machine-slaves,  which makes it more obvious than ever before that all people must have a Guaranteed Minimum Income, although I prefer the word 'residual' to 'minimum'.  Read child labour & try to see it was child slavery into the 20th century, & it still is today since many children work in their parents' business.  When they """"ended child labour"""" that didn't set the children free; they were """"free to starve"""" because what they need/ed is a GMI.  Having children is a form of slavery too: parents become slaves to their children (when they need to eat, bathe, etc) but the children are also slaves to their parents.  So """"no control"""" also means we'll always be slaves to needing food, & we can find ways to eliminate all the work with machines which again means all people need a GMI.  (Actually all people should own all things, because when a few rich people own everything it's obviously slavery; how did every person not know that?  America refused to let any attempts at Socialism & Communism succeed; instead they forced it to fail by starting many wars, teaching torture, & you must read Wm Blum's """"Rogue State"""".  Fidel Castro was right & America was wrong.)  And the BLS is wrong; they always underestimate, because most of those people are probably illegal immigrants from many generations back.  They say every year 50,000 people are smuggled into the US to work as prostitutes (that's slavery), so can you imagine how many illegals there must be in America hidden behind walls, & all supporting a few rich slave masters who travel the world & raise their families on the backs of SLAVES in America.  How can you read about multinational corporations & not see they cause poverty in those other countries, as well as in America?    If Liberia has a population of 3 million & one corporation goes there & """"creates only 2000 jobs"""" then can't anyone see the wage is causing their poverty??  That's just an example, but do you see what I'm saying about the wage is the problem worldwide, not the solution, like America thinks?  When 3,000 people show up to apply for 20 job openings, you know the wage is wrong & it's slavery.  I know I'm a slave, & I know every person is a slave & I'm right & everyone is wrong.  Gerry Spence also says we're slaves in Give Me Liberty.  That's all for now.    02:08, 31""",0

Reviewer: Hello, dear Derild! You might remember me from MOTD. This is a nice article, simply written, informative, and readable. ) I've done a quick see-through, though, and found a few okay, nitpicky, merciless person that I am, a bunch of concerns. Here they are!  talk 
 Seekers follows four young bear cubs: Kallik (a polar bear), Lusa (a black bear), Ujurak (a small grizzly bear who can change into any animal), and Toklo (a grizzly bear). I think """"...follows the adventures of..."""" might sound better.
 Dogs were considered but rejected because they were too close to cats in their hierarchal social organization, their pack and hunting lifestyles, and their territoriality. <""""their"""" is unnecessary in its second and third usage.
 The company wanted her to write another series on animals just not about cats. This sounds slightly awkward, maybe a comma or two will make it flow more smoothly.
 HarperCollins suggested dogs, but Holmes """"was reluctant...they guard their territories"""".. Direct quotes need direct references. The statement about HarperCollins suggesting dogs especially needs a reference because it's referred to in the introduction.
 """"the all-action excitement that the Erins love so much"""". Same here.
 the company then thought about horses knowing how Holmes also like them.. This sentence sounds a bit awkward, too (there's something grammatically incorrect in that sentence, methinks, but unfortunately, I'm too dumb to lay my finger on it myself).
 ...the main inspiration for the series is Inuit beliefs and the Native American languages The great grammar mystery..again.
 Lusa means black in Choctaw while Kallik means lightning or storm in Inuit.[2] Shouldn't Choctaw be linked to Choctaw language?
 However, even there, Ujurak, who leads the journey feels that they need to go further, into the Arctic. I think a comma after """"journey"""" might make the prose smoother.
 Seekers follows four young bear cubs: Kallik (a polar bear), Lusa (a black bear), Ujurak (a small grizzly bear who can change into any animal), and Toklo (a grizzly bear). Here, a serial comma is used, while in other examples such as Lusa, Kallik and Toklo and The Last Wilderness, Fire in the Sky and Spirits in the Stars. the extra comma is omitted. Either can be used, but it has to be consistent throughout the article.
 The """"First Series"""" section could be expanded quite a lot, I think (especially since the books don't get articles of their own yet).
 Children's Literature picked up the environmental theme, it also commented themes such as """"commented on"""" is probably better.
 approach - three bears mdash;, mdash;, otherwise you crash..
 """"She also cleverly deals with the theme of racism through a unique and honest approach - three bears of different color, different backgrounds and different beliefs turn to each other for survival and friendship""""
 Kirkus Review  thought """"Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty, beauty, tenderness, savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery""""; they also wrote that too much detail went into developing the characters and setting and there was very little plot.[7] At first they're complimenting the book, and then they're """"also"""" criticizing it. Maybe something along the lines of ...mystery""""; however, they criticized the weakness of the plot and the excessive detail in character development and setting.
 """"Other media"""" could simply be """"External links"""", no? )
All in all, this article has a solid base and good references, but it needs much improvement to get there.

I will neither resort to insults nor put any words in the opponent's mouth like you just did. Instead, I will stick to the point. The matter of fact is, you cited regulations only partially, leaving out the regulation that warns about bias. It says (interpreted) that all authors and all sources are by definition biased, until filtered through neutrality checks and balances. So stop raising references alone to the pedestal of allmightiness. They alone are insufficient to establish that there is no bias (in them and otherwise). They must have an outside check. In historical science the check is called primary historical document and it supersedes all references ever written on history. In this case it is the Ottoman military records, used to create List_of_Ottoman_sieges_and_landings#Growth_.281453.E2.80.931683.29 and Eyalet#Eyalets_in_1609.

"""::::::First off, Miles and Blume came to the same conclusion, and Blume said he did interviews, so I'm assuming Miles didn't pull his statements out of his behind and actually talked to some residents about the riots. That would be the logical conclusion since he's one of the few in Lhasa for the riots, so why would he just hang around making assumptions about what they were complaining about without any evidence whatsoever? Even if Miles didn't interview anybody, Blume still did and he still came to the same conclusions so your point is absolutely moot. Your criticism is REALLY getting ridiculous here. Miles already says what the primary reason is (ethnic hatred), and one must assume that he had to talk to people in Lhasa to find out why, otherwise he would've made the same conclusion that you and many other misinformed do - that the riots were for nationalism/independence. The fact that the rumours of monks getting killed angered the residents and helped start the riots is already mentioned in the article. Not to mention that I ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT POINT OF YOURS. So what if monks getting killed is part of the reason why riots started? Does that point to nationalism or does that point to the same type of anger you or I would feel if we saw nuns getting shot by the police? I already addressed your """"proof"""" of nationalism by the Chinese flag being trampled. You are free to actually read what I say. And someone who attributes flag burning and pro-tibet slogans as proof that the riots were not because of ethnic hatred, but because of nationalism (and implying that the cause of the riots were for independence/autonomy) has no right to criticize how the current article is written. Your own """"proof"""" is 100% presumptuous, while the argument I make is actually from what the Tibetans have reportedly said. Until you actually find that someone in Lhasa being interviewed complaining about wanting independence or autonomy, or any evidence that the Tibetans rioted out of nationalism, besides your own presumptuous interpretations, then I advise you to drop the issue because you seem downright biased and unreasonable right now. Sorry, to say but the evidence is stacked against your view. Last, no one said it was all about the rising prices. If you read the article, it clearly states that the riots occurred for several reasons, of which only one was inflation. So basically, YOU ARE JUST SPECULATING. You cannot just include your own, personal opinions and interpretations into the article. The fact is that the reporters who were there actually described what the residents were complaining about, and at the very least, offered their professional interpretation of what the riots were about (James Miles), which is supported by their interviews with the residents of what they were complaining about.216.252.71.154

Then I do not see a problem in using it until a better source can be found.

I can only interpet this as something is probably better because it is newer?? This makes no sense to me. History is what it is, it should not change for the sake of change. If it was accurate over 600 years ago, it is just as accurate today. Again, if something is true and accurate hundreds or even thousands of years ago, it is not and should not be subject to change because someone decides to re-write it for either personal gain or an agenda. That is exactly what has happened with the origins for many Highland Clans. For any that might be interested, William Skene's and John Murray's collaboration of The Highlanders of Scotland: Their Origin, History and Antiquities is a wonderful and refreshing read. This is more than likely the truest accounting for several of the Highland Clans. It asserts that many of the origin claims put forth in more recent times are attempts to gain a foothold on the Chieftainship, by usurping the rightful lines. You'll find that cadet septs used this technique to basically try to re-write history for their own selfish gain. You'd have to read the book to see how this played out but as I said before, nearly ALL of the Highland Clans being """"bastardized"""" as Norman/Anglo-Horman/Flemish, etc. are really Dalriadan and Pictish mixes. Examples would be Campbell, Cameron, Grant, Davidson, Wallace, etc. I of course have distant YDNA connections to ALL of these surnames, but I know no one wants to hear about that as any sort of evidence. I'll admit not one of these surnames or clans has a pure lineage, but they all have a lineage going back to the Picts and Gaels. I am of that lineage, which is quite rare and continues to be established. The masses are not of that lineage, they are a mix if R1A1, other R1B haplotypes, the I haplotypes, etc. I will be the first to admit there may be hundreds of families, not even related through a shared male ancestor, sharing a surname or Clan. My concern is with the origins only, and the original Chiefly lines. And please don't tell me how we are a mix of so much dna, I am only referring to YDNA, the male lines. I am not talking about MTDNA nor Autosomal. What I don't understand is why when there is so much sourced information out there, some editors choose only to use factually inaccurate """"sourced"""" information. There is substantial """"factually accurate"""" sourced information out there however it is not my intent, to correct these erroneous articles or to present an """"opposing view"""". There is no opposing view, there is either the truth, or their are lies. Either the Celtic version is correct, or the Comyn version is correct, or neither is correct. There can't factually be multiple versions of an origin, it is what it is and there is only one true origin. This is not a contest to see who can provide more recent sources. I would hope wikipedia would want the truth out there, and not contests of who can out edit who, which is what wikipedia appears to be. There, my case is presented to the message and not a specific messenger. Clan Davidson is Celtic, it descended from Celts and it has no connection to the Comyn family. It did not descend from a Comyn male. They came from a very ancient Gaelic ancestor, an ancestor shared by several Highland Clans, before surnames even were in use. One other greatly incorrect update to this site was the battle alleged between the Davidson's and the MacPherson's....this never happened. The battle was between the Clans fighting for the Chief of the Clan Chattan, the battle was fought between the Mackintoshs and the MacPhersons.The MacPhersons were the true chiefly line, but were """"out-documented"""" by the usurping Mackintosh. This is pretty much exactly what is happening here, on this very page. I hope someone else has more time and energy to properly update this page with the correct information and let's bury the lies and factually inaccurate information comprising most of this article. It was originally much more factually accurate, but over the course of time has been corrupted with sourced information that is not also factually accurate.

 Editing on Hypertension 

Hi DocJames, 

As a long time wikipedia watcher, I feel like I'm talking to a celebrity here after seeing your name on so many medical pages. I'm a medical student who uses wikipedia very frequently, and now that I'm getting to the end of my training I'd love to be able to contribute back to the encyclopedia that got me through my training. 

As you can see, I'm fairly new to the editing scene, so any guidance you can give me would be much appreciated. Regarding my recent edits on the Hypertension article, as I mentioned in the """"talk"""" page I'm basically trying to find a way to get rid of the """"daunting wall of text"""" problem that I feel the article has at the moment. I'd like to preserve all the hard work that others have done on providing detailed research, but to try to keep the page as something that even people who got diagnosed with hypertension and are wondering """"what's that?"""" can browse with relative ease. As such, I feel that the best way to go forward is to preserve the highly detailed content (most of which is only relevant to medical professionals) on specific pages, and keeping the sections of this page down to a few short paragraphs summarising the most relevant points. Let me know what you think about this approach, and please modify my submissions or revert them as you see fit.

A: Speaking from an alumni perspective (Go ODU!), Goodie is a warrior. She won't get a lot of attention, but she just goes about the work and grinds it out.

JERSEY CITY, NJ - 05/06/2003…Adrienne is often compared to her cousin, Dennis “Lil Pie” Goodson.  His alma mater, New Jersey City University (Jersey City State College) unveiled the newly created Dennis Goodson Memorial Basketball Award, at the Annual Athletic Awards Banquet in 2003.  Dennis competed as a point guard with the school from 1983 to 1987 and was a starter on the school's first Final Four team in 1986. Sadly, he died on June 25, 2002 at the age of 36.  
 
Named in honor of the star point guard, the award is bestowed to either a male or female basketball player at NJCU. The recipient will best exemplify the attributes for which Goodson was known: team loyalty, dedication to the sport of basketball, competitive spirit on the court, knowledge of the fundamentals of basketball, and demonstration of leadership, and sportsmanship.
