WP underattack by followers of Sina's Cult of phobia

Hi guys 

Ever thought why the Islam related pages have become insane these days ??
Ever thought If its just a coincidence that we are having very insistent people wanting their unverifiable data to be added on Islam related pages
Ever thought why there is so much pressure to add links to phobic sites made by illeterate liers that are driven by hate
Ever thought why there is so much pressure to add a picture of Muhammad riding Burraq to Muhammad page .
Ever thought why there is  so much pressure that Jihad means """"holy war""""( aka kill all infedils ) only . And not a """"cleanse oneself spiritually"""" kind of philosophy also . 

Well every question has an answer , as there is no effect without causality . 

The answer is right here , see for your self .

As you might have guessed , this is the tip of ice berg . A lot is going on , under cover . Being the followers of a cult , they dont show their intentions . This is why they use PM & not talk about it on forums now . These so called good faith editers are running a whole Project Wikipedia to attack each & every page associated with Islam . This has been happening under our noses for not less then 6 months , & now its officially made a project .

There was a thread there which has been deleted by Sina . So for the benifit of all sane thinking people , I have added these threads to WP , so that if some muslim hacks FFI , & by some coincidence only these threads are deleted ( as Sina says ) , then these will be present as an evidence on WP . 

Now , 

Do we want WP to become a mirror site of FFI . 
Do we want phobic psychos to run around all over WP . 
Do we want to explain the same things over & over again to people who always say that they are a newbie on WP , & want to make it better . After some time of copy pasting filth from their hate site, they vanish & some others show up with the same language , same mentality & same """"Stuff"""" . 

I was also thinking for some time what happened to all venom spitting Sina-philes , & why are we now having some decent looking  people wanting to add their links to WP . Well that is also in the Sinan recommenddations of """"How to attack WP"""" . U can all see Zeno's edits at Muhammad , & Jihad . The pressure to add a picture of Muhammad , pressure to add cresent as a symbol of Islam , Pressure to call Jihad bin nafs some mythical concept popularised by Sufis . Still in Jihad article , Zeno has changed """" Ibn taymia, scholar of classical Islam """" to """" Ibn taymia , The classical, militant scholar of Islam """" .  Dont you think he could have easily changed to """"Ibn taymia , the founder of Salfi thought in Islam . """" Do you think its coincidence , or lack of knowledge......nooooo , its called Agenda .Similarly nickbee , who just came here , saying he doesnt accept all that Sina says , but has has written lenthy posts pressurising to add their link . Would any body who doesnt care waste so much time on adding links , He also brought two well known trolls from FFI to back him up . May be its the new strategy , work in clans , one carrot two sticks  , & a lot of anon IPs . 

If we dont do something , these attacks will occur again & again , week after week , month after month . Its a big waste of time & energy . When I came here , I wanted to add some info about mysticism here . I havebeen here for 5 m",0

 Proposal 

I propose a solution to the issue posed by the guideline regarding disambiguation pages (and the resulting AfD): keep the article, and simply remove """"(disambiguation)"""" from the article title. Thus, this would become the article Apartheid, with a short definition and citation to the Afrikaans origin, and then links to the various usages, with History of South Africa in the apartheid era being the first and most prominent link, with the others following, retaining the language about usage being an analogy to South African apartheid. 

This solves the disambiguation guideline issue. I don't believe there is a consensus to delete this article, and argued in favor of keeping it, but I acknowledge the argument that it is less of a literal/classic disambiguation page and more of a """"here are some uses of the term which have Wikipedia articles"""" page. I believe there are a number of precedents for that type of page, where a term is discussed in different contexts, some or all of which have individual articles.  """,0

 Hakan Mild 

Hi Johan. Why do you keep deleting the link to video featuring Hakan Mild?? You write, """"it's irrelevant to the article"""". Great, if the article was about Nuclear Power Plant, I'd say too, the video about great Swedish football player Hakan Mild, showing his AMAZING skills with the ball, is irrelevant to the topic. But the article about Mild... so what's wrong with the video about the very guy the article is written about, Johan?? ) Seriously, I wonder why do you delete it. Please, think again, let's put a link to the video so all the people who visit this Wikipedia page (and Wikipedia's pages are first to be found in all search engines, so everyone who likes to know more about Hakan Mild, would visit this page first) would see an amazing skills of the guy. If I could, I'd add more videos to that section, videos that feature his goals, for example, that great goal he scored when Sweden beat Bulgaria 4-0 in 1994 (over the 3rd place, I bet you remember). Other pages DO HAVE this link section with the link to videos. So why wouldn't we?? 
P.S. Mind you that it is NOT my video neither I want to promote it in such way. I'm simply a big fan of Sweden, Swedish football and everything that's connected to the fame of your incredibly beautiful country.85.250.39.107  Ronnie Slogun, 5 Dec 2007, 7:41 PM.""",0

Yes it definitely isn't an ideal source, but unfortunately since these events took place in a very secretive, distant battlefield (Mike Spann was the first US casualty in the War in Afghanistan), the fine details of the event are limited to only a few sources, thankfully an experienced and respected English-speaking journalist was there shortly after events to record them. And yes unfortunately I know way more about this subject than I ever intended to. There were MANY previous edit wars, although I say more towards vandalism, which were mainly just people reverting edits on bias (same types of information  anything negative towards Lindh  was only thing removed) and saying the cites weren't right and making me have to go through sometimes hundreds of pages of documents (like the AR15 field investigation) and find the page number, paragraph, and line for them to prove the integrity of the cite to get them to stop.

"Cinama C making again disruptive editing ==

Cinema C is again making disrupting editing without consensus, without discussing on the subject. 

Kosovo is a state, a sovereign and independent. Not even disputed. 

1) Serbia defacto recognizes Kosovo

2) Serbia tacitly recognizes Kosovo

3) Serbia establishes border and custom control with Kosovo

4) Serbia does not control Kosovo, defacto nor dejure

5) Serbia recognizes the international subjectivity of Kosovo as an independent sovereign body.
 
6) Most Serb media, like Beta and Fonet, clearly use Nis (Naissus) as a southern town. 

7) Serbia president needs permission of the Republic of Kosovo to visit

8) Serb leaders are now allowed to enter through customs and borders.
 
9) Regions are geographic names, if we use region that definitely, Nis, Novi Pazar should be included because they are both part of Kosovo region, not Serbia. 

10) Territory is when controls, but the inhabitants refuse to recognize the legitimacy of the ruler. Palestine. 

11) Kosovo fulfills all the criteria of a sovereign state, with several UN bodies recognizes it, such as IMF, World Bank and other world institutions. 

12) Serbia willing to establish diplomatic relations with Kosovo if some territory is swapped, obviously, Serbia cares about territory, because it already recognizes Kosovo. 

13) Invalidity of Serb passports to Kosovar citizens. Not even, Kosovar Serbs can travel to EU. So much, about the dispute.

We all agreed that Kosovo is a disputed state, until Cinema made disruptive changes, without consensus, leading warrants and locking. SpanishBoy2006

On the basis of logic, reason and science there are no Gods. Science holds that individuals should not accept ideas proposed as truth without recourse to knowledge and reason. No evidence of any kind exists to prove supernatural phenomena are real and not imaginary creations. Therefore deities can be added to the prolific list of mythical beings such as genies and wyverns which fill human mythologies.

I thought wikipedia prided itself on being factual and unbiased. The facts are very straightforward. God is superstitious nonsense and this truth should not be clouded by the persistent large following of gullible individuals who still believe in the supernatural.",0

 """"Countries"""" or """"Regions""""

A relatively large group of people organized under a single, usually independent government; a country.  2.  The government of a sovereign state.""""  Thus the word """"country"""" in American English at least is bound up in the notion of sovereignty.  The use of """"country"""" in this title by a single editor is a legal artifact of the wording used to bind Scotland, Wales, etc. to the United Kingdom.  It is not a term in general use for administrative divisions, but a term of sovereignty for the majority of English speakers as evidenced by the dictionary definitions of """"country"""" and """"nation"""".  There is no insult intended for Scotland et al. by referring to them as Regions.

Also, the Wikipedia entry takes from the La Nación article two different quotes and combines them as if they were a single quote. It is inappropriate to treat exact quotations in such a manner.

I have made a few small edits from work, and have tried to revert and correctly cite my edits when I get home.  Since I found out about the situation, I may have made 1 other edit from work (one of the 209.150.67.x IP's).  I have always tried to be a good user. If I have made any mistakes, I am sorry.  My editing has always been of a minor variety, spelling fixes and grammar basically.  Also I have been working on Interwiki links for the Chemistry article.",0

Clarify """"Issued""""

I've added a """"clarify"""" tag to the word """"issued"""" in the first paragraph  this is easily the most confusing and non-obvious aspects of carbon trading.  How does a government decide how many credits ought to be issued (for free, I assume) to each entity before trading begins?  Indeed, most questions about emissions trading boil down to this very question.  For example, if an auction is used, and the auction is efficient, economics would predict that no trades would take place post-auction (the occurrence of such trades would imply that the auction had been improper)  making the whole concept of """"cap and trade"""" actually mean """"cap via auction"""".  I don't mean any of this as criticism.  But, as Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, I think it's failing to fulfill it's job here by dodging the most policy-critical aspect of the issue.

Whilst Dr. Beck asked only that we take down the BDI-II, I still have to pay $4 a copy for the original BDI-I so I must assume that's under copyright and licence as well. I'm going to try and find some relevant bits from WP:C to justify (or not) removing the links. From what I can see the relevant text is here: 
Linking to copyrighted works
""""External sites can possibly violate copyright. Linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem, as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone else's copyright. If it is, please do not link to the page. Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States (Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry). Also, linking to a page that illegally distributes someone else's work sheds a bad light on us. If the site in question is making fair use of the material, linking is fine.""""
From what I can tell, I think that the sites that are hosting the BDI-I and BDI-II are violating copyright. Most of them don't say that they have permission to use the instrument, they don't cite the original paper, and in the licence when you buy a copy it explicitly says not to make electronic copies. Now each of these separate users may have made a licence deal with Harcourt individually, but it seems unlikely. A lot of the google hits that come up are appendices and lecture notes from university projects; I don't think there is an exemption for educational use, but then university psychology departments often buy a """"portfolio"""" of test copyrights for limited use. This would not normally extend to use on the web however. In terms of next steps, I actually think this is one of the rare occasions where a consensus is not the way to go, but rather we could list the issue at WP:CP?
If it's an issue of helping depressed people, I'm not sure having people just fill out the form will do them much good. After all it just produces a number, it's only useful in context. One option would be to have a link to a therapeutic community as these may be of some help . For instance, MoodGym is a site which allows users to self-administer cognitive behavioral strategies .

"""::::::Noren, your argument is ridiculous. Only a very few atoms (helium, neon, and argon) have TRULY filled electron shells, and can participate in energy-releasing fusion.  The reference is making generic statements, so that it specifies """"light nuclei"""" instead of particular elements.  It does not need to say HOW filled an electron shell is, when making generic remarks about light nuclei.  It DOES specifically state, """"In normal conditions between atoms or molecules, the nuclei never get close enough for fusion to commence"""".  And all of us here know that the conditions of CF are far more normal than stellar.  Regarding the other stuff in my last post, I do know that it is OR and was not trying to get it into the article at this time (it won't be OR forever).  I just wanted to point out to Art, who brags about his Phd, that he's the one who is dead wrong about electron shells being in the way.  I recall reading about the shells being in the way about 4 decades ago, when I first started learning stuff about fusion.  It was the very first thing that came to my mind, as a problem to solve, when I first heard about cold fusion.  It is silly to not mention this problem in the article here.  IS there a conspiracy by CF-detractors, to keep any data out of the article that might someday become related used to the solutions to the main problems?  Why else would Art do his latest lie-of-omission, trying to talk about real nuclei under real-world conditions without paying any attention to the electrons that were associated with those nuclei?  The SUN does not fly apart, all its temperature-freed nuclei receding to infinite distance under the influence of mutual electric repulsion (which would indeed happen if there were no electrons in the mix).  He even wants us to believe that while we can mathematically add 2+2 to get 4 in a Wikipedia article, we can't do simple obvious logic that is mathematically equivalent.  If a source article says, """"termites caused the collapse of this house"""", Wikipedia can't be precisely accurate and say, """"gravity caused the collapse of that house, after termites weakened its structure""""??

 District of Safed 

Hi, regarding your edit at Dallata.  Because there are quite a few examples of more than one village in Palestine of the same name, we usually identify which district of Palestine it was in (sometimes even in the article name). The unwritten convention among the editors who work on the village articles is to use the 1945-8 districts since that is what most modern sources use.  See Districts of the British Mandate of Palestine, last section, where you will notice that we should be calling them """"sub-districts"""" rather than """"districts"""".  Also, writing that a village was in Mandatory Palestine won't do, since that entity only lasted about 25 years but most of the villages were there for centuries.  Saying that they were in Palestine would be more accurate.  It can be confusing, but I think """"Palestine"""" along with the past tense is about the best short solution.

Well from the offerings you have made on your wiki, blog and elsewhere, you would certainly be a gem of an editor here. Your comments on the 10 commandments to save world fisheries and your notion of a Pacific Islands Fisheries Management Index move in directions I think the Wikipedia articles should. It's true that Wikipedia is more anonymous and constrains, in that you cannot present original research, but must instead back up statements with verifiable sources. It is an encyclopedia, so the encyclopediac game must be played. But still, that doesn't have to be that constraining, and Wikipedia has many advantages. The demand to be encyclopediac can often help cut through bull shit and starkly clarify where new research is needed. Important current issues that cannot be adequately sourced can still be discussed in the talk pages, and strategies can be developed so they may eventually get appropriate external sources. Well structured articles will be here to stay. They can have modest starts, but if properly framed will lend themselves to incremental improvements over time. Your articles need not drop off the edge of the blogosphere or disappear into the limbo of deceased wikis. They will have far more traffic and outreach than blogs or personal wikis can ever have. The traffic should increase with time. And of course you can still personally invite collaborators. An article on Pacific Islands Fisheries could be set up as a start to your index project, and a very nice article it could be too. We could work it up to FA. I think """"commandments"""" for sustainable fisheries is probably the single most important topic in the Fisheries and Fishing WikiProject, and I'm sure we could eventually get that humming nicely in attention grabbing but encyclopediac ways across a number of articles.

 A tag has been placed on Faronics Power Save (software), requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Safi is from Iran, where images of the Prophet are tolerated.

 This is the English version of Wikipedia! Adjust yourself to that fact or go somewhere else. 

Why are English speakers always barraged by racists trying to insist that we use their language? Especially Spanish and Arabic. This is the English version of Wikipedia, and it should be written in English. Why do these racists always try to cram Spanish down our throats? Everyone in the world has a language. Yours is not better than mine. In fact, it is inferior. Speak, read and write Spanish if you want. And use the Spanish-language version of Wikipedia. I don't care. But stop harassing me! This page is not nearly as bad as many others, but I am fed up with this practice. The leading paragraph of some topics is virtually unreadable because a translation has been added for almost every word.

In this article the leading paragraph provides the asinine translation found in this sentence: """"He is the founder of Ricky Martín Foundation (in Spanish Fundación Ricky Martin), a non-profit charity organization."""" To begin with, a moderately mentally-retarded person, who doesn't speak either language, could probably figure that out. There is no legitimate reason for this translation. And why the racial prejudice? Where is the Russian translation? What about German, Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese, etc? The logical conclusion of this absurdity will be that every word of the English article will be followed by its Spanish counterpart. Insanity! We don't vandalize their wiki; they should stop vandalizing ours.

I checked the Spanish-language wiki for this article, and it contains no translation into English. That is appropriate. This version should contain no translations into Spanish, unless the Spanish wiki is shut down completely. Then it would be acceptable to include a few pertinent translations.

 I think the general idea initially was to change how the company is described wholesale, including in the lead, to a """"taxi dispatch service"""" from a """"ridesharing service"""".  There doesn't appear to be consensus for this because most RS do not describe Uber that way.  
Based on our discussion so far, what I'm suggesting is that 
we leave the lead alone and maintain the """"ridesharing service"""" description, and 
 under the 2012-present section of History, that we describe that Uber implemented an option in their app  called Uber Taxi that dispatches actual taxis drivers to customers, and that it has been implemented in multiple cities.   
So, if folks want to support or oppose that idea, please indicate that below so we can start gathering a consensus on the matter.   drop me a line """,0

The Decision to Come to America
We lived very nicely in Skala. We always had a servant and we had a new house that had just been built. We lived very nicely until the fire. Everybody tried to save their own property and it was windy and the fire spread all over the city. Our house didn't go because it wasn't directly in town. But all businesses and everything else went. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]

After the fire, it was a time of great migration. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Gross]
[Note: The """"Great Fire of Skala"""" is believed to have taken place in 1899.]

I came to America because my father didn't want I should become a soldier and eat not kosher stuff there in their army. My brother Sam came before me. He sent me the shiffskarte, ticket. And he sent me some money to come here and I paid him everything when I started to work. [Yankel (Jacob) Wiesenthal]

All the enterprising young men came, because they were poor and to escape the army. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Brill]

I don't remember my father [who died when she was young]. My mother wanted to come, but only the three of us were left in Skala, my mother and Ada and me. My other sisters [who already were in America] couldn't afford to take us together. So I was the first one. I came just because Jake went [she accompanied her male cousin]; otherwise I wouldn't go. I was a teen-ager, thirteen or fourteen. I didn't want to come to America. I was crying. [Chana (Anna) Menchel]

We came because we couldn't make a living there. It would be a shame for the girls to go as maids in Skala. There was no way of making a living. [Hudya (Ada) Menchel] 

 
From Skala to Hamburg or Antwerp

7. Emigrants took the train from Skala We went by train, all the way from Skala to Hamburg. [Yankel (Jacob) Wiesenthal]
We got the boat in Antwerp. First we went by horse and buggy to some neighbors in another town and we stayed overnight there. And then we went by train to Antwerp. Another thing I remember, of course, we were third class and they stopped for a while for you to get water. There was no water on the train. So I remember my mother left us three kids on the train and she had a kettle and she went to get water and I nearly died. The others didn't know the difference. I felt sure the train was going to start without her. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]
 

 
In Hamburg
We stayed overnight in Hamburg before we went on the ship. I remember I was really very young. I was a kid. And when we came to Hamburg, I was afraid. I only wanted to go to sleep with my cousin Jake. So he says to me, you can't go to sleep with me. Don't forget, you're a girl; I'm a man. You have to sleep with the girls. This I'll never forget. [Chana (Anna) Menchel] 
8. The emigration hall in Hamburg, early 20th century 

 
Aboard Ship

9. Aboard ship We were three children and we had one berth. All the four of us slept together in one berth. With our mother. You know how narrow those berths were. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]
We were in an upper berth. And there was a very rabid Polish lady coming to America in the berth below. She probably didn't like it that there were four people above her and she started out with a real hatred of us. Anyway, one day I wet myself and some of it went through. So then the woman went to complain to the captain. And she said, """"Not only did this woman's child wet my bed, but she stole my best blouse."""" She accused my mother of stealing her blouse and they came and looked among my mother's possessions, but they didn't find it. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Gross]

 

We came through steerage, of course. Somebody else was in the room with us and my mother said in Yiddish, I hope my daughter doesn't get sick. But I was very sick and so was my mother. [Hudya (Ada) Menchel]

I went on the boat twelve days. I took care of Anna. She was sick already and I had trouble with her. We",0

Don't talk to me like that please. I have made no personal attacks on you, no profane language, & only made a very well put arguement. Indeed I am angry, but I am not expressing it in my writings to you. Do angry uncivil people say """"indeed""""? I doubt it.

But becasue you actually really wanted to, you gave no thought to if it would hurt my feelings & went ahead with the nomination. Make no mistake, I'm angry with Riana as well, as she also knew my intentions. You posts on Sarah's talk was intriguing as well, as you state that I created 2 more RfA pages for Riana """"immediately"""" after the declined one. I only created one, & that was 2 months later. So don't mistake internal anger & external calmness with anthing else. You both hurt my feelings as I made several posts about how I wanted to nom or at least co-nom. Riana could have waited as I'm not on here 24/7 as I too have a life to live. I would have easily waited another day for someone who not only nominated me first, but was also my friend, before superimposing on the RfA page. But again, I think you & Riana have different standards to mine & had no problem hurting another's feelings...  

Ahem, """"I have no problems letting you guys nominate her first"""" - this is what you call """"no problems""""? Glen 

Yeah, but you said after that that it was in fact fine. Besides I only said that because you were pushing that you wanted to nominate. I never thought you'd be so cruel as to not actually let me nominate... But anyway, it doesn't matter now. I'm trying to distance myself from the situation.  

Ouch. Mates, I'm sorry, this is all my fault, I forgot to include 's nomination statement as well. I've been incredibly busy and not really giving my full attention to the RfA, because I have a dad dying in hospital.

Dude, let's not be silly. I wholeheartedly doubt that """"black people"""" are afraid of a """"mulatto uprising."""" I think """"black people"""" are more afraid if not most afraid of not progressing due to perceived racism (real or not) by whites who have the real power. Besides, there have been plenty of """"mulatto"""" (those people who phenotypically have kind of a beige skin color, and caucasian features) """"uprisings"""" against darker skinned people be they in North Africa or Western USA or South America. Actually, these people whether they be mestizos, mulattos, dark caucasians are already racist towards darker skinned people, which most of the time includes Black people and native Indians - ie, the systemic racism is already there. There isn't going to be some sort of """"big bang uprising"""" wherein """"mulattos"""" start to """"uprise"""" against darker skinned people or """"black people.""""  The concept of """"black"""" and """"mulatto"""" aren't diametrically oppossed like the concepts of """"black"""" and """"white."""" The worst thing that can happen is balkanization.  Furthermore, as white people continue to identify as """"white"""", I don't see the idea of """"blackness"""" going anywhere soon.  """,1
"""
I wasn't questioning the """"literary forgery"""" issue i.e. """"hoax"""" but the claim that """"plagiarism"""" isn't used here in the lead except as a partisan view when looking at the sources of the document. Given that the document was published well after the death of the source author (whom it is alleged borrowed from an earlier source anyway) your example isn't remotely relevant. The chain of authorship isn't as simplistic as your example. An alternative presentation of plagiarism is the Origin_of_the_Book_of_Mormon#Purported_plagiarism because of the intent of the author but oddly enough the Book_of_Mormon article doesn't mention """"plagiarism"""" at all. Here it is the reverse with numerous use of wording for """"plagiarism"""" and in the lead paragraphs but yet with no clear idea how the (mostly) anonymous authors would gain from the plagiarism i.e. gain from the reputation of Maurice Joly. The claim of """"plagiarism"""" only works if there is an unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Now the problem for you is that Serge Nilus did plagiarise the protocols but the protocols themselves are not plagiarised but derivative. If no one claims authorship then where does that leave the claim of plagiarism ? . That's not clearly proven here so I'm suggesting that the word """"plagiarism"""" is removed from the lead paragraph (though it can stay within the main text and elsewhere that the protocols are used in context of being derivative from the earlier work) as it unbalances the lead. """"hoax"""" and """"literary forgery"""" can obviously stay.   """,0

Search: Corporate Blacklisted engineer

   

I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer for almost 20 years collectively for the following companies; Pratt and Whitney, Williams International, Ford Motor Company, and as a contract engineer for Compuware d/b/a Professional Services at Chrysler Corporation in Auburn Hills, Mi. It is the latter two to which I am forging my complaint as they told prospective employers, my private investigator and my newspaper reporter, that I was not employed by them, thus blacklisting me, and preventing from all future employment.

 

I believe that they did this to me because I found fault with one of Chrysler’s automotive designs that could have resulted in a safety issue, that they did not want to fix and it was easier and cheaper to get rid of me.

 

I took my case all the way to the Supreme Court in Washington, DC and in Boston’s Federal court ….all courts denied me justice. A lawyer representing Chrysler offered me $1000 to settle the case about 2 years ago which I refused since I felt it was like a slap in the face compared to the injustice they have caused me.

 

Your viewing of my video will greatly help to end my 11 yrs of homelessness by increasing public awareness of my case and consequently, will send Chrysler, Compuware and combustion components a direct message that I am not giving up and refuse to go quietly into the night.

Proposed addition of two See Also and two references

If there is no objection, I propose to add two See Also:

Community Open Source Program Office, Open Source Investment Strategy (late 1990's)
Report to the Director of Central Intelligence, the Challenge of Global Coverage (July 1997)

The first was written by Joe Markowitz, the second by Boyd Sutton.  Both are stored at www.oss.net with
persistent URLs, so hopefully we are over the """"self-promotion"""" bit.

If there is no objection, I propose to add three links in references, all to actual documents:

General Al Gray, Commandant of the Marine Corps, """"Intelligence Challenges of the 1990's,"""" American Intelligence Journal (Winter 1988-1989).  This was the first-ever public call for changing the focus on intelligence from the Soviet Union to revolution, crime, and terrorism; and also the first-ever public call by a Service or Agency head to shift emphasis from secret to open sources.  
Joint Military Intelligence Training Center, Open Source Intelligence Handbook (June 1996)
Special Operations Forces Open Source Intelligence Handbook (Strawman)

All of these are visible with links via www.oss.net/BASIC.  If BASIC can be locked in and protected, perhaps there is no need for the added references, but I suspect my work, which has now survived three days, will be vandalized eventually, so I defer to the group on what is best.

Disputing """"Job Guarantee"""" Section
Chartalists don't guarantee a job.  They merely argue that the role of government in cases of underutilization is to provide the necessary demand to resolve that situation, since otherwise you have unused capacity and net economic loss.  It's quite a jump to take that and conclude the government hires everyone who isn't employed; in fact, it often means the government becomes the customer of a lot of businesses.  If you are in a state of underutilization that represents an economic loss, and it's due to a demand problem, it means you must have some net fiscal expansion from some source in order to drive utilization.  If the private sector is attempting to build assets (run a surplus) and you have an external deficit, the only mathematical means of accomplishing this is public deficit, that is, the government is either hiring people or buying from the private sector.  So the section I've marked for expert review needs to recognize that Chartalists prescribe that government deals with unemployment not by guaranteeing a job, but by hiring more and/or spending i.e. buying more from the private sector.  Things could easily, and likely would, weigh more towards the second option.   (posting on behalf of one Filburt)""",0

Former Students and other fans at the game are not considered the 12th Man...only current students.  This restriction does not apply to other sports on campus.  Many of the """"12th Man"""" representatives have gone on to receive scholarships, such as Rich Coady, Caleb Russell, and Travis Labhart.

I agree with Anjouli's paragraph as a bookend to the above discussion, but I don't think it's quite self-explanatory enough to give guidance to future editors.  How about these four points?  I'd like to refine them and propose them as refinements to WP:BIO. Everyone: Please comment below each bullet point.  | Talk 

 Follow WP policy on Wikipedia:Notability (people)#Lists of people. This says that """"the list should be limited to notable people: those that already have a Wikipedia article or could plausibly have one, per this guideline."""" Entries that are clearly non-notable or spurious should be deleted.  | Talk 

 Where a person on the Notable Former Students list does not have an article already (i.e. has a red link), check to see if the person used to have an article, which was deleted because they weren't notable. In that case, delete the person from the notables list. Otherwise, they may stay on the list but, in the spirit of the WP policy on attribution to reliable sources, there should be a footnote attached to their name with a citation showing their local connection. If there's no footnote, it's appropriate to put on a """"fact"""" tag saying a citation is needed.   | Talk 

 Where a person on the Notable Former Students list does have an article, but the article does not mention the local connection, then the editor adding the notable citizen to the list should add a statement to the person's article, documenting their local connection, with attribution to a reliable source. If there's no such statement in the person's article, it's appropriate to put a """"fact"""" tag on the person's entry in the list to show the article is missing evidence for a school connection, and perhaps the person doesn't belong on the list.  If it seems likely that there is no school connection, delete the name from the list.  | Talk 

 Where a person on the Notable Former Students list has an article, and the article mentions a local connection, but there's no attribution to a reliable source, then it's appropriate to put a """"fact"""" tag against that unsupported mention of a local connection.

"Ikke noget at tale om!  There will probably be more discussions about this in the future, but let's leave it there for now.
 However, I find this discussion interesting as (according to my personal experience) Stockholm with its 'isolated' location in the middle of Sweden rarely relates itself to Denmark or Copenhagen (we don't hear more from Denmark than do people in, say, London, Paris, or Berlin).  In contrast, Danes (always near Sweden) tend to bother much more about its northern neighbour.  Of historical reasons, Finns tend to behave similarly (regarding Sweden).  It might be interesting for the article (maybe the culture section?) to explain this - after all, Stockholm's only official raison d'être is to be the capital of Sweden, but, locally, there is sort of a subculture trying to develop an identity independent from this.  For example, Stockholm tend to be obsessed by its own local history (sv:Stockholmiana) and one of the most striking thing that occur to tourists must be the historical pretensions of the city, notwithstanding most façades (with their beige plaster) are in fact much younger than buildings in an average European city.  Its symptomatic the new Moderna Museet was well-received in Stockholm because it merged with the neighbourhood whilst a new museum in Copenhagen is celebrated if it gets international attention (i.e. Arken).

Great. This article needed the tender ministrations (*grin*) of an expert. I do suggest though that if you remove all mention of certain things, like the philosophical influence of feminist historians, political groups like W.I.T.C.H., and disagreements with more """"traditional"""" forms of Wicca, then you open the article up to people coming along and adding these back. Essentially the article is easier to maintain (not to mention more informative) if we try to get some of these mentions right, rather than removing them entirely.

"""proposal by Coulliard 

I'm going on the soapbox for awhile, an uncomfortable position in a baseball game (sliding runners tend to knock it out from under you).  I want to explain my position without us getting personal.  If you take offense, apologies in advance.  And apologies for being so wordy.  Genetic defect.

I am a baseball researcher by hobby (computer programmer by trade), and I take everything about baseball's history seriously, especially the Negro Leagues, which have become my area of expertise.  Segregation in Baseball remains the absolute worst scar on its face.

In my opinion (emphasis on it being my opinion), Josh Gibson, Pete Hill, Satchel Paige, Bullet Rogan, Oscar Charleston, Andy Cooper, José Méndez, Cristobal Torrienté, and many others men would have easily been Hall of Famers long, long ago had it not been for segregation.  It's my belief that given current evidence Gibson wouldn't have hit much more than 500 or so home runs playing a full schedule, given the HR rates of the 30s and 40s (not nearly as high as today), given his truncated career (he died after his 17th season), and given the position he played (catchers just don't play full schedules because of the extreme wear and tear; on the other hand, he might have been converted into an outfielder or first baseman in an integrated Majors, and 600+ would have been a possibility.

Babe Ruth hit 714 Major League HRs; had he had to face Bullet Rogan, Andy Cooper, Satchel Paige, and other pitchers of color, his totals might have tailed down toward 650 or so, and that in a 22-year career compared to Gibson's 17.

What we know is that Gibson is credited with 115 verifiable HR in Negro League play, plus 44 in Mexican League play, which was a bit lower level competition than MLB.  Gibson hit .359 against Negro League competition, which would be second highest of all time (behind Cobb) had he done so in an integrated majors, and Cobb's .366 might have lost a few points as well had he had to face Negro pitchers like Lefty Cooper and Willie Foster.

The raw numbers are still small.  We can't do anything about that.  115 compares very badly to 714, much less 762.  But it's still important to know those numbers, because it's what he did against major league-level competition.  What he did against amateur and semi-pro competition in exhibition games is fun to know (if we truly did know), but it is not the true measure of his worth, and (IMO) it insults the man's memory to artificially pad his numbers.  Understanding that Babe Ruth hit HIS home runs in a league that played 154 games per season, that homers were easier to hit in Ruth's league than Gibson's (livelier baseballs in the AL), the relative numbers make Gibson look like Ruth's peer.

With few exceptions, there are no researchers who do not believe that Josh Gibson was one of the two or three best pure power hitters in the game, and no exceptions among serious Negro League researchers.  We can (and in fact should) report that there have been various reports of his accomplishments in earlier days, but these numbers, taken without any context present a superman as unbelievable as that X-Files episode (""""The Unnatural"""").

You have to trust that the reason for putting up Gibson's reduced stats has a noble purpose.  Telling people that Gibson hit 800+ HR and batted .384 against all levels of competition tells nothing really, because he could have in reality hit .200 with no HR against top-level Negro League teams, but fattened up by counting 1,000 games against Little League comptetition.  Telling them he hit .359 and had a home run every sixteen at bats in a career that included many games in Griffith Stadium tells them something of importance  it gives us an excellent clue as to how he would have hit in the Majors, had he been allowed to play.

The """"nearly 800"""" and """"962"""" numbers give us no way of being able to separate them and understand their meaning.  An official scorer counted every one of Babe Ruth's HR in his major league career, and we can go back to sources from that day and find it.  In Gibson's case, someone reported (sometimes months later) numbers that no one even at that time could verify, because a lot of the numbers were based on hearsay, and some were just plain made-up.  We can't tell how many he hit over a 150-foot fence against a 17-year-old kid with a 60 MPH fastball, because we can't separate them.

There's plenty of space on the internet for repeating urban legend as fact.  Wikipedia should not be one of them.

My proposal is that we rewrite the article to include the latest official numbers, and make sure it is understood why Gibson only managed to play 510 Negro League games in his career.  It will inclu",0

 Daniel, your encyclopedia is a joke, and the article about Sanchez is a great illustration of the many and sundry reasons it is a joke. Every single one of your """"pillars"""" and """"policies"""" has been violated in the article itself, the discussion thread, and the administration of it. You and your cabal have allowed the subject to edit his own article; you've blocked verified facts from the article; you've demonstrated a lack of neutrality and good faith throughout; you've abandoned any pretense of common sense or even-handedness.

 The result is an article that is just plain false. But, you see, this doesn't matter at Wikipedia, because at Wikipedia all truth is negotiable, when means it is politically determined. The good thing is that, aside from anything that happens at the Sanchez whitewash page, the world at large is onto you and your crew. Wikipedia's lack of respect for truth, and its wholly capricious and abitrary administration, not to mention the falsification of biographies by its insiders and the insertion of corporate propaganda into articles, has been discovered.

 Replaceable fair use Image:Frex denver.jpg 

Thanks for uploading Image:Frex denver.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link].

A tag has been placed on KnowledgeLake, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

"""Ed's idea of research==

My idea of """"research"""" is a quick google search, followed by a copy and paste. Perhaps I am too hasty in some cases. I have learned from FeloniousMonk how to use the new  tag.

Unfortunately, Ed, this kind of research is no longer de rigeur on Wikipedia. In the past, when the community simply wanted to increase the number of articles and wasn't too concerned about the initial quality, using the internet as a primary reference was fine. But the democratic sense of the internet and the lack of verifiable vetting of internet sources means that using the internet as a resource for high quality articles needs to be done much more carefully. Being a responsible editor means using responsible sources and the internet is not the best repository of these. Old fashioned libraries are a much better source for getting accurate information. Certainly using the internet is fine at first glance, but using the internet as a sole means of research just does not cut it anymore.

Speedy deletion of Will berardelli
 A tag has been placed on Will berardelli requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

"Jxm, I inserted the phrase “purporting to examine” back in January.  I believe it is the most appropriate phrasing because:

1.  PEAR only claims to be examining psi, legitimate scientists don’t think that there is any psi to examine.

2.  Even if telekinesis were real, PEAR’s experiments wouldn’t have proven its existence anyway because of their methodological flaws.

3.  The reliable sources seem to be suggesting (though not outright stating) that PEAR was probably involved in deliberate fraud.  The fact that one of PEAR’s own staff was an experimental subject who had a significant effect on their results coupled with the fact that PEAR’s results are not reproducible seems to have created some suspicion.

While I’m not proposing that we add PEAR to one of Wikipedia’s lists of hoaxes, I don’t think that it would be appropriate to use any language that might give the reader the wrong impression.  The mainstream seems to regard PEAR not as honest but misguided bunglers, but rather as malicious pseudoscientists who started at their conclusion and worked backwards.  We should avoid asserting that PEAR actually studied telekinesis in Wikipedia’s voice.  76.107.171.90",0

"Dear Llinus (if I may call you that),
Thank you for your reasoning on KV55. I can't say I disagree with it though I thought including a reference to the difficulties of using modern forensics to date ancient mummies was useful...to illustrate how impossible it was to claim the mummy was just a young person when he died. The Gabolde note, though is quite correct since it does place undue weight on the views of one scholar when there are so many differing views on the KV55 king. Thanks for pointing out that Waenre was actually part of Akhenaten's titulary. Gabolde certainly knew this but I did not. I thought it was another epithet like Meryamun. Yes, I really can't see who else the KV55 mummy can be except Akhenaten; this could be settled if modern forensics didn't give us so strange results for the Egyptian mummies.

As an aside, you are quite right that wiki is not perfect. It has several flaws...the chief one being vandalism and then WP:OR contributions by some crackpots. (yes Hatshepsut's article was vandalized again) But there are a few plusses: at least, with wiki, one can create articles on many fairly obscure temples or archaeological sites such as Trajan's Kiosk, Amada, Temple of Beit el-Wali or Kiosk of Qertassi. In every case, I created the articles and managed to source images for them from flickr users who were happy to see them used on Wikipedia. I hope you like them.

In other words, you are asking if you and your cronies were unsuccessful at shutting down the discussion of the issue, on a different page (EURO), in part by employment of your ham-handed authority to shut me down for a few days, which you did 6 months ago.  No, you were not successful.  In part, this was also due to the fact that your cronies failed to actually address the issue:  They were apparently so enamored at their power to call you in to abuse your authority, they didn't find it necessary to actually present winning arguments...you know, DEBATE.  You, yourself, were unwilling or unable to participate in the debate, too.  But that means that there is no basis at all to allow you to give your input, in any way, into this matter.  You must admit to these people that you really weren't interested in the subject, you were just brought in to be a thug, a torpedo, to shut down the debate.  You must also admit that you were stalking me on WP:  Tell them what mechanism you used, so they know what you did.  (The fact you used that mechanism will show them how illegitimate your motives were.)
The reality is (remember reality?) that according to the remnants of their archived webpage, EURO did not argue for """"white supremacy"""", """"white separatism"""", """"white nationalism"""", or any other """"ism"""" I can imagine would be relevant.

Original article should be like this

 

Franjo Tuðman (May 14, 1922 - [[December
9]], 1999) was the first president of Croatia in
the 1990s.

Tuðman's political party HDZ (Hrvatska Demokratska
Zajednica, Croatian Democratic Union) won the first
post-communist multi-party elections in 1990 and
he became the president of the country. A year later he
proclaimed the Croatian declaration of independence. He
was reelected twice and remained in power until his death
in late 1999. In English, his surname is spelled
""""Tudjman"""".

The Communist

Franjo Tuðman was born in Veliko Trgovišæe, a village in
the Hrvatsko Zagorje region of northern Croatia.

During WWII Tuðman fought on the side of
Tito's partisans, where he
also met his future wife, Ankica. He became one of the
youngest generals in the Yugoslav People's Army in the
1960s — a fact which some observers linked to the
fact that he sprung from Zagorje, a region that gave few
Communist partisans.

Others have observed that Tuðman was probably the most
educated of Tito's generals (as regards military history,
strategy and the interplay of politics and warfare)
— this claim is supported by the fact that
generations of future Yugoslav generals based their
general exam theses on his voluminous book on guerilla
warfare throughout history: Rat protiv rata (""""War
against war""""), 1957, which covers topics as diverse as
Hannibal's drive across the Alps, the Spanish war
against Napoleon and Yugoslav partisan
warfare.

Tuðman left active army service in 1961 to found the
Institut za historiju radnièkoga pokreta Hrvatske
(""""Institute for the History of Croatia's Workers'
Movement""""), and remained its director until 1967.

The Dissident

Apart from the book on guerilla warfare, Tuðman wrote a
series of articles  attacking the Yugoslav
Communist establishment, and was
subsequently expelled from the Party. His most important
book from that period was Velike ideje i mali narodi
(""""Great ideas and small peoples""""), a monograph on
political history that collided with central dogmas of
Yugoslav Communist elite with regard to the
interconnectedness of the national and social elements in
the Yugoslav revolutionary war (during [[World War
II|WWII]]).

In 1971 he was sentenced to two years of prison for
alleged subversive activities during the so-called
""""Croatian Spring"""".

The Croatian Spring was a reformist movement that was
actually set in motion by Tito and Croatian party
chief Bakariæ in the climate of
growing liberalism in the late 60s. It was initially a
tepid and ideologically controlled party liberalism, but
it soon grew into mass manifestation of dissatisfaction
with the position of the Croatian people in
Yugoslavia, and it began to threaten the party's
political monopoly. The result was a brutal suppression by
Tito, who used the military and the police to crush
what he saw as the threat to his undivided power - Bakariæ
quickly distanced himself from the Croatian Communist
leadership that he himself helped gain power earlier, and
sided with the Yugoslav ruler.

During the turbulent 1971, Tuðman's role was that of the
dissident who questioned the central myth of modern
Serbian nationalism, the number of victims of
the Jasenovac concentration camp, as well as the role
of centralism in Yugoslav and the continuation of
ideology of unitary """"Yugoslavism"""". Tuðman felt that this
originally Croatian romantic pan-Slavic idea from the
19th century had been mutated in harsh realities in both
Yugoslav states into the front for a pan-Serbian drive for
domination over non-Serb peoples — from economy and

It is cristal clear that there's nothing solved here, and I agree with ,  and  that the article has many other flaws that we could address first. 
 Culture: the section is indeed too big and should be thought as a glance inviting the interested reader to explore the Culture of Paris detailed article. We can also feel a certain trend to mix that section up with the more mainstream Culture of France article. I think an overhaul is necessary in order to focus more on the key elements to understand what is specific to the Paris identity: theatres, the movie industry, impressionist school, few key writers and singers, and the current state of today's Paris cultural life.
 Landmarks by district: that section, currently listing 450 different buildings, is totally unreadable in its current form. It should be replaced by a more general """"Monuments and Landmarks"""" section, if not by an even broader """"Visitor attractions"""" section with not more than 20 different mentions. Once again, there is already a standalone article for the Landmarks in the City of Paris which is more reader-friendly for those wanting to explore a more detailed list of those.
Even if that doesn't solve ongoing conflicts, focusing first on these 2 sections is probably the best way to get back to more constructive contributions to the article.   """,0

 Re: Patron Saints of Places 

I noticed on the Talk page two separate comments, going back a few years, that the page would be more user-friendly if the listing was according to Place. Accordingly I've been trying to re-sort the entries towards that end. I've been making the changes in what I hope are manageable bits, partly because it's very time-consuming and I don't want to lose anything(particularly the citations), and partly because I've been waiting for someone to object. (I take it from your welcomed feedback that I may proceed.)
As far as the other patron articles: In general, since an article on any individual saint would indicate their various areas of patronage, geographic and otherwise, I think the over-all listings would be better grouped by topic. However, those pages seem somewhat less pressing, because at least they are separated alphabetically, (whereas, I found the Places page a bit confusing ... particularly because a number of the historical """"places"""" are now known as something else). -I am going to see if I can find some images as well (unless there is a rule against images and lists).

 Please stop your """"vandalism"""" warnings on my user talk page 

As you know, you have recently posted two vandalism warnings on my user talk page.  Please stop.  I have not been vandalizing anything on Wikipedia, but making good faith edits.  I once had an administrator caution me about bringing false charges of vandalism.  He said:

Now to answer your concern about vandalism reporting: vandalism is the kind of edit that no one should have a disagreement about.  Here are a couple of examples of true vandalism:   .  Edits other people want to make and you don't like are not vandalism, and it's a kind of incivility, if not a downright personal attack to describe someone's good faith edits as vandalism.

 Perhaps the addition of a discussion of Jerry Pournelle's Iron Law of Bureaucracy will provide sufficient amplification of the typical American attitude toward this institution to account for the negative connotation almost universally accorded the concept of bureaucracy in American culture, in which the bureaucratic imperative — however it manifests — is utterly despised. Indeed, Pournelle's relatively dispassionate criticism of bureaucracy may not go far enough to accurately convey the pure hatred held by the average American for bureaucrats and everything having to do with the institution of bureaucracy in both the private and the public sectors. It does not (for example) address the bureacrat's propensity for sloughing responsibility:

""""There's a reason bureaucrats are seen as ass-coverers whose foremost priority is to ensure that they're never accountable for anything. It's because many bureaucrats really are ass-coverers whose overriding priority is to ensure that they're never accountable for anything. As a corollary, if things go wrong, support for the idea that you predicted it may be helpful in building your bureaucracy's importance at the expense of its rivals.

""""This is as true within corporations as it is in the public sector or the military. If you've spent much time in the working world, you've seen this tendency in action."""" 

 ...which is (in American eyes) particularly despicable for its abject cowardice as well as its wastefulness, ineffectiveness, and inherently obstructionist effects.

 Hm. And while we're at it, how come we're not discussing the sheer Vogosity of bureaucracy?

"""==Rory==

Is her son reading PPE, Modern History, or Modern History and Politics (MHP)? All three have been mentioned (including the non-existent """"history and politics and history""""). It is sometimes the case that an admissions tutor might suggest that a candidate accepts a place for a subject other than that for which he or she has applied, although I think that is most likely to happen when the candidate has applied for a Joint School and is thought to be better suited to just one of the subjects it includes, e.g. an applicant for Philosophy and Theology might be offered Theology (there is no School of Philosophy); I suppose it is possible that it was doubted whether he was suitably qualified to read the philosophy and economics aspects of the course and, since there is no School of Politics, it would be possible only to offer a Joint School including politics, of which the only one currently offered is MHP (presumably he would have been considered well qualified for Modern History). It isn't the case that PPE is more """"coveted"""" (or even """"coverted""""!) than MHP; rather, that more applicants aspire to read it. I suppose those applicants (and later those who were unsuccessful) do covet reading PPE, but I imagine that MHP applicants covet a place to read MHP. Perhaps PPE is quantitively more coveted, but I think that unless MHP students secretly covet the opportunity of reading PPE, it isn't really an appropriate description. All that might be said is that PPE is long-established and is currently thought to be a good preparation for future life. When the PPE School was in its infancy it was regarded as a very poor School, though not as poor as English Language and Literature, about which it was commonly asked whether one could really justify a university teaching English literature (English language was less controversial, which is why the early course placed such great emphasis on language rather than literature) - one might say that English was the old media studies. Today, English is considered one of the most respectable university degree subjects. Modern History used to be considered second after Literae Humaniores and is still a highly respected School (in fact, all Schools at Oxford are highly respected, notwithstanding criticism sometimes directed against Classical Archaeology and Ancient History). Presumably the earlier information about Rory Campbell reading MHP was incorrect, or he has managed to change his course, which is not uncommon, although it would seem strange for a student to be allowed to change to a course for which he or she had previously been rejected.

Is it actually important to mention that Fiona Millar's son is reading PPE at Balliol? Many hundreds of people have read PPE at Balliol, so it is hardly a thing of any interest in itself. Perhaps if Fiona Millar had previously been an opponent of PPE (very unlikely), or of Oxford (or Oxbridge) (a distinct possibility), or indeed of Balliol (unlikely but a remote possibility), it would be of interest. However, nothing in the article suggests that she holds, or has ever held, anti-Oxford/Oxbridge views. If the suggestion being made was that her son had gained admission to Balliol because of the importance of his parents and in spite of being """"widely regarded as a top class idiot"""", I would think that the allegation is unkind, probably unfounded, and almost certainly impossible to prove. The only way in which it could be included here would be if it was stated in some other source, such as a newspaper article.

The entire Wikipedia administrator system is flawed.  There is no rule of law at Wikipedia.  There is no administrator accountability to other editors.  Administrators, like you, deem yourselves to be the law-givers and the law-enforcers, but in reality, you're just people like the rest of us.  You have no right to order me to ponder anything.  You have no right to re-interpret the specific rules about making legal threats.

Spite
User:Dennis Brown, you accused me of """"spite"""" on a public board for removing the article body content at Veniamin Sozin. (You accused of """"ownership"""" as well, but I already explained at ANI how your interpretation of editsum was not correct.) Why I removed body content at Sozin is complex, but it wasn't something as stupid and petty as """"spite"""". It's a big sorrow to me to have to leave ortho chess article editing. (I have loved it. I had no idea, the hostile and ruthless culture at WP, and the editors who revel in that environment to throw lies and smears and do bullying would ruin it for me. But I should have known better. The signs were early and my love of editing made me want to ignore them.) The deal is, Dennis, I regret ever creating that article (and there were only two others) for the orthochess project. I just regret it. And that regret, also somes with pain. And sorrow. But in the end, I wish I never edited for that subproject. I met some nice talented editors doing (e.g. User:Tocatta Quarta, User:Cobblet whom I learned to understand better and appreciate), but there were some bad apples, and the environment allowed them to make hay with me. That wasn't nice. When defacto subproject leader Quale defamed me consistently by complimenting my detractors, and disparaging my good-faith efforts out of prejudice, well, that's life in the big city, it's political and nasty here, and I'm not willing to suck up to it. I'd rather leave. So I did. Seeing the three articles I left behind I created, that I can no longer expand, made me sick. I began to sincerely wish I never created them. So I made mercy killings of them. (Have you seen One Flew Over the Kookoo's Nest? There's a mercy killing in that movie. Was it spite!?) You apparently have no idea what complex emotion caused me to delete those contents, so, a quick & dirty answer you accuse on a public board, is that of """"spite"""". (Why do you jump to suppose bad faith like that? You should think about that. In effect an accusation of """"spite"""" is a dig of my character. I've never toilet-papered a house or lawntree in all my life. Or played a mean trick on anybody for fun. Why should I start now? To accuse me of mere spite is to say I'm no better than a juvenile delinquent. And you don't see the insult value and personal affront in that? You are Mr. Editor Retention. And yet you seem clueless what I as editor have gone through, who has done a partial quit of Wikipedia  the quit of a subproject [orthochess]. The emotional toil is real and genuine. I know I cannot prove that, only attempt to explain to you. But please note how you jumped to bad faith explanation, and affront, and maybe why you would do that.Like I mentioned, the emotions were complex. Take one of the other three articles, for example: Paris Defence. Some of the above was at play with the deletion of that artice's body content, but there was something else, too. I had to fight tooth-and-nail, to get that article to 'Keep' status, and a WP:CHESS member also who is a deletionist kept pestering me about why the article couldn't be 'Merged'. The reasoning for 'Delete' and 'Merge' were all faulty, and I painstakingly and patiently tried to reason and explain. To little success. But the article stayed. Only through my perseverance, I guess. I never demanded the article stay  I don't think I even !voted at the AfD for it. I simply made comments because even then, I had disassociated myself as project member due to already giving up on the level of civility from one editor initials CPL who you favored at your Talk against me, when I went to your Talk in good faith consel session, and there was no counsel discussion, just diaparaging criticisms of me, and I withdrew. That is when I never trusted you again. (Your compatriot Elen of Roads of course came in to render supportive disparaging criticisms of me, there and on her Talk, without end. You see how """"friendship"""" explains all on the Wikipedia. Arguments are for losers, it seems.) The reason I deleted body content of Paris Defence is because I worked so hard, so very very hard, for the good, and consistency, of WP chess articles then, to keep it, and prove it. (CPL was saying the opening didn't even exist. That it was a joke of a 3rd move by Black. Yet he was willing to tell everyone at any opportunity that he's a """"chess Expert"""" rating, in repeated boasting. I worked so very hard hard hard to keep that article, I improved it during the AfD, and it was amazing to me, because those imporovements didn't seem to matter (no one said they did), when they were in fact central and vital and the whole point. So where does the sorrow come in? After working so hard as I did, for the reasons I did, I was alone. Alone alone alone.

User:JimWae, the part your assessment relevant to my compromise version, is for the most part, incorrect, and furthermore, you have acknowledged that you do not have references that support your claims. If you looked at the references that qualified the statement regarding the """"propagating atheism,"""" you would find that it is a factual statement. And once again, this article is not about state atheism exclusively, but about the ideology of militant atheism, which was applied to some atheist states; an atheist state could exist, without promoting militant atheism. Your version of the introduction eliminates defining the ideology of militant atheism as given by several references and summarized in the Concepts section of the article; the lede should define the ideology and then talk about its Application, which parallels the structure of the article, namely the headings listed in the article's table of contents. Furthermore, contrary to your opinion, militant atheism is an integral part of Marxism-Leninism, as supported by the consequent references. For example, Faith and Order: The Reconciliation of Law and Religion, specifically states:  When discussing content, you must keep in mind WP:RS, rather than your original research. You assert that many people do not know about the Cultural Revolution and for this reason, it should be removed from the paragraph. That argument does not hold any water whatsoever, as this is an encylopædia. Moreover, removing the information on the concept of militant atheism, the Cultural Revolution, French Revolution, and political thinkers, violates WP:LEDE, which states """"The lead should be able to stand alone as a concise overview of the article."""" Your revision of the introduction fails to do this. If the term """"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution"""" is not as common, however, I would not mind compromising and changing it to just """"Cultural Revolution.""""

 I think those sound reasonable. I have changed them to sentence case, and re-added the record covers which were deleted from the discography by Jonah. I also re added the descriptions of Rose's musical style that were deleted without explanation. Finally I re-incorporated a new version of the sentence dealing with racism and antisemitism. It makes not direct claims about Rose's online work, only that it deals with race and religion. Then I wrote that this has created a series of accusations of racism and antisemitism in various online chat groups. While online chat groups are not officially a source, the fact remains that these criticisms are out there, posted in various places. I think that this should satisfy both SP (by being NPOV) and Ayers (by bringing up the issue).  Hope this helps. I agree with Will, let's move on.

""""Bone Again"""" and """"Elizabethan Period"""" were funded by people or companies other than Biff, and given professional print runs of a few to several thousand; they were distributed through non-internet indie channels, and reviewed in Mojo magazine.  """"Roast Beef"""" was pressed using Biff's royalties, but then it was picked up by a distributor who slapped their own record label's sticker on the cover; several thousand were produced and sold.  """"Hamburger Blues"""" was an """"official"""" release that may have been a smaller print run than some of Biff's website releases.  """"Uncle Jesus"""" was a major label album that is harder to find than """"Roast Beef."""" """"The Pickwick album was an """"offical"""" compilation of far seedier origin than some of the indie releases.  The whole issue of """"in print"""" vs. """"out of print"""" is a bit difficult to assess as well.  If copies are sealed, stockpiled and available, isn't the album still """"in print""""?

My concern with these categories is that they tend to appear at the same times that text changes are made diminishing Biff's accomplishments; and they seem to be included as part of the intent of that effort.  If you look at other artists' discographies, these distinctions are rarely made.  For example, see Sun_Ra.  A great many of Sun Ra's albums were self-released, including most of the artistic milestones.  It is a vague and misleading designation.  Why not go for straight chronology?

And to confirm Marcuse's interpretation, I was not implying that Marcuse initiated a given edit.  Is someone trying to start fights where they ain't?   

The problem here is that you wrote something, a line that went unsingned, but on closer inspection was found to be added by you but attributed by you to someone esle. You then followed this by saying that you agreed with the line. Very unwiki of you.

Indeed, someone is trying to start fights where they ain't.   

 Wallawe/Jonah, I'm curious what the """"released on cdr"""" that you keep adding to the discography means? What is cdr? As far as the self vs. officially why don't we just simply put """"Full length releases"""" and combine them?  

In most of these cases """"cdr"""" is not an accurate designation.  Some of them were glass-mastered CDs.  But as I said above, I don't think that's too important, anyway.  

, you claimed to revert back to Marcuse, but you did not.  That's a super-misleading tag.  

And now I understand what you are referring to:  .  That's something I do a lot.  It's called """"Paragraphs.""""  Here, I'll do one right now.  Here goes....

The first paragraph was one sentence long and  went: """"Judiasm is targeted"""" is a really problematic phrase.  

Then, as I had an additional comment on a different topic, I skipped a line, kept the same indent, and continued.  I assumed that someone with a minimal level of int",0

 Hi 

Dear Mr. 147.252.223.38.

Please do not vandalize like you did to Fourier inversion formula. Math is a wonderful subject even if you don't appreciate it. Mathematicians do something useful for the world and what they do lasts for centuries. They also enjoy what they do. If, by """"get a life"""", you mean """"go to parties, get drunk, and crash your car into another car and die"""", then it's obvious to anyone with a modicum of intelligence that mathematics is far superior.

Also, you have no right to criticize people who do math unless you yourself can understand what they do. The mathematics you have criticized is deep and interesting and you shouldn't insult it unless you understand it. I hate the mentality that if you don't understand something you need to criticize it. It tells more about you than it does about the people who do math.

Good luck.""",0

Clearly you are acting in good faith, attempting to serve a useful purpose in informing people of information that stands to benefit their health. Unfortunately, however, this is an example of exactly the kind of thing which Wikipedia does not do, and it conflicts with several of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. You are clearly intending to use Wikipedia to host a page about a product to publicise it. Whether the motivation behind doing this is to increase profits of the company making that product or """"for the good cause of the women in India"""" is irrelevant: Wikipedia is not for use to promote anything for any purpose. To put the same thing another way, the policy that Wikipedia is not for promotion applies just as much to promotion of good causes as it does to promotion of business interests. Trying to increase awareness of health issues in a population where there is widespread ignorance of those issues is no doubt a worthwhile thing to do, but it is not one of the things that Wikipedia does.

You should also be aware that editing on behalf of a business or organisation to write about a subject in which that business or organisation has a direct interest is brings you into conflict with Wikipedia's conflict of interest guidelines. A Wikipedia article needs to be written from a neutral point of view, and if you are writing on behalf of someone else in order to publicise a subject they are involved with, it is likely that you will find it difficult or impossible to write from such a neutral point of view. (In fact, in this case it is clear that you do not even wish to write from a neutral point of view, since your declared aim is to portray the campaign as a good thing.)

""""Stayfree India"""" has used several Wikipedia accounts, which have been blocked from editing, because their only purpose was using Wikipedia to promote their cause. They have evidently approached you to edit on their behalf, to continue the attempt to promote their cause. Under Wikipedia's policy on  abuse of multiple accounts, if any account is used to make edits on behalf of a blocked editor, thereby helping the blocked editor to evade the block, the account used for such purposes can be blocked too, as it is being used to circumvent Wikipedia's policies. As I said at the beginning of this message, I have no doubt that you are acting in good faith, and that is why I have taken the time and trouble to explain to you what the issues are, rather than simply blocking your account. You are welcome to contribute to Wikipedia on other topics, where you do not have a conflict of interest, would not be helping to evade blocks on other accounts, and would not be promoting a cause. However, continuing to edit in ways which conflicts with Wikipedia's policies in those respects will not be acceptable.   """,0

Few months after its formation he was joined by brothers Alex Kampamba """"Lex""""(Producer/Rapper) and Kelvin Kampamba """"Kellz""""(Producer/Rapper) And

vocalist Lengwe Sinkala """"Elle""""(Vocalist/Song Writer) a new and promising prospect that would add a whole new side to the bACEline.
And later the same year two young promising youngstars, Matherz's litle brother Moses Simbule """"Chichi/Bob""""(Producer/Beatmaker & Rapper) and

I think it is a good article.  I'd never heard of the gentleman, but I did see the Veronica Mars episode cited, so it turns out I am familiar with him.  While I think it is good, you will have problems getting it through FAC on the grounds some people think it is too short.  Never mind that a nineteen year old isn't going to have a huge article, people will say it is too shorttrust me, I've heard this objection on my own articles, e.g. Julia Stiles and John Henninger Reagan.  FAC commentators will also seize upon the photographs problem, which I don't see ought to be an impediment to getting FA status, but people will object.  Now, as to the article itself . . . What happened to his father?  Divorce?  Something ought to be said because it looks odd mentioning only a mother.  Second, I wonder if you could find some print articles about him?  You might try accessing databases such as ProQuest or Ebsco through the public library.  I'm hesistant about articles where all the sources are electronic.  While I've used many links on articles such as Tom Brinkman and Paul Hackett, I also cited the print version so when the operators of those sites take down the electronic versions people will still be able to find the material.  Third, I'd eliminate some of the red-links to movies and schools.  Again, this will raise objections if you take it to FAC.  Finally, most of the article is dedicated to his roles.

 Agnew early career

The promising Leicestershire fast bowler, Jonathan Agnew, aged 22 [sic], is being flown home from Australia after contracting glandular fever. He was to have spent the winter playing for a club side.
Mike Turner, the Leicestershire secretary-manager, said: """"It's a great disappointment because Jonathan had just returned to his best form after battling for 12 months to recover from a back injury.""""

The statement he refers to is in fact the very description of Complementarity in Bohr's own words (published in the journal Nature), and personally verified by the eminent historian of physics Prof. Gerald Holton of Harvard.

You are nuts, there is a lot of freedom of speech in the US and you abide to that.
You can't just make a law that will prevail over the US constitution. Unless you are willing to rewrite the bill of rights, for that we have to kill Dr MLK jr. again.
You allowed this computer hacker Pablo something, located overseas, probably in some garage in a little town in a country called argentina to ignore, laugh at our bill of rights.
He censored my contributions, probably he could not even understand what was in those, his command of the language is just poor, you allowed him to show how powerful he is.
No freedom of speech on wikipedia, and i am sure our fathers have fainted back there in Philadelphia after that statement.
This pablo does not need to worry about the us constitution, the bill of rights or anything like that, probably he does not even care about the bill of rights of his own country.
He can do as he pleases and block the freedom of speech of any US citizen at will.
His intrusion in our territory shall not be tolerated, he can do as he pleases in his country but in ours, he just can't.

"""personal view of """"fire in the lake"""" is that it is a dated political tract written at a time (1972?) before many sources were available to write any kind of history. Especially any history about events in North Vietnam during the 1950s. The author of the book further makes all kinds of statements about Vietnamese that with distance sound condiscending or even worse. When the book starts talking about the Vietnamese mind, its almost embarrasing to read it. Yes, it won awards when it was published. But its a very flawed book. For example, the basis of your claim that only 800 people died in the anti-landlord campaign is that her North Vietnamese/NLF friends told the author so. By contrast, Stanley Karnow writing in 1983, was writing in a less hysterical political climate and had access to more material than was available in 1972.

In short, please stop stating its a minority view.  I know this.  I see it as irrelevant as I can cite over and over again where the minority view was right.  I regret having to tell you this but there are a huge amount of majority views were once minority views.  Its irrelevant. BSF is a multidisciplinary issue and it is not surprising to me that it is minority.  I think this should be a evidential issue and not a polling booth.

"Unbelievably Biased Article - Not Fair 

This article is solely written and guarded by Britney's stubborn and standoffish fans; I do not see NPOV at all. They try to eliminate every negative material on Britney, but everyone knows what kind of person Britney is and we all know the schizophrenic thngs she does. Where is the information of Britney being a no-show at the Allure Mag's interview? Where is the information of her being diagnosed with bipolar disorder?   Where is the information of Britney's former bodyguard speaking out? Where is the information of her being under the influence? Where is the information of Britney spending more time partying (with Paris Hilton, nonetheless) than being with her kids or concentrating on her music career? What about the fact that she was seen without underwear, more than once? All of us KNOW why Britney mangled her VMA performance! She was seen partying in Las Vegas 2 days in a row than focusing on getting her performance right!

 Betacommand is back 

Hello. I am contacting you because you are one of the editors/admins who is still active now, and was aware of the notoriously disruptive editor User:Betacommand, a.k.a User:Δ (Delta). As you probably know, he was eventually banned after a third arbitration case, due to the way he conducted himself in the pursuit of his main interest on Wikipedia, WP:NFCC enforcement.

What you may not know, is that he has evidently returned and has been editing as User:Werieth since 2012, in violation of that ban. After just a year, Werieth is already causing the same sort of disruption that Betacommand did - you may experience some deja vu by reading reports made about Werieth such as the one at the top of this AN archive. There are already several others. A quick perusal of Werieth's contributions will also reveal the same Betacommand-like self-assured approach, grounded in the belief that their edits are always """"100% correct and 100% according to policy"""" (when the reality was that he made basic errors and pushed policy boundaries at a rate that, while acceptable in ordinary users for a time limited period, was found to be unacceptable in an editor with the edit rate and communication issues Betacommand had, especially given their inability to change)

I and others have already tried to expose his return via these sock puppet investigations, although as you can see, it's not getting far. That's not for the lack of an answerable case though - you can see the latest summary in this post. Most of the obstruction can be put down to the usual dysfunctional and counter-productive aspects of Wikipedia governance, which of course will always aid experienced WP:GAMErs like Betacommand.

But you may or may not be surprised to learn that the people obstructing this investigation the hardest are three admins whose own conflict of interest with regard to Betacommand/NFCC is best demonstrated in their own words - Black Kite (repeatedly deflects attention away from Werieth and onto accusers), Kww (blocks accusers, and has already unblocked Werieth once) and Future Perfect at Sunrise (has basically declared all out war on anyone who even whispers that Werieth might be Betacommand).

The purpose of this post is to raise awareness about his return, and hopefully persuade one or more of you to resubmit that SPI with the evidence I'm sure you will be able to compile using your own knowledge of Betacommand's characteristic traits. At the very least to prompt you to put his talk page on your watch lists and regularly review his contributions (although obviously, don't waste your time trying to deal with any issues you see on the flawed basis that he is just any old user).

Also obviously, you should also raise a red flag every time you see one of those three admins trying to further suppress the inevitable exposure of his ban evasion. If his return is to be covered up for an unnecessarily long time, it should at least be done simply through general incompetence, rather than obvious COI based abuse of the tools/trusted position of admin. A few emails to the arbcom members who dealt with Betacommand also probably wouldn't go amiss - if ordinary admins aren't bothered about this particular user's return (and you will remember, blinded by their enthusiasm for having someone, anyone, perform NFCC enforcement edits, a great many of them were unwilling to even admit his particular approach to that necessary work was a problem), 

Betacommand's clandestine return to Wikipedia is bad enough as it is given that he has simply resumed where he left off in the NFCC enforcement field, with several users already having wasted a lot of time having to deal with him as if he were a legitimate user. But obviously the nightmare scenario if the cover-up is allowed to continue for another year, is if Werieth/Betacommand decides script assisted batch editing is not fast enough for his liking, and decides to take an altogether faster approach - possibly even trying to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff;=prev&oldid;=43661105",0

"Your recent editing history at Melungeon shows that you are currently engaged in an edit war. Being involved in an edit war can result in your being blocked from editing—especially if you violate the three-revert rule, which states that an editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page within a 24-hour period. Undoing another editor's work—whether in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material each time—counts as a revert. Also keep in mind that while violating the three-revert rule often leads to a block, you can still be blocked for edit warring—even if you don't violate the three-revert rule—should your behavior indicate that you intend to continue reverting repeatedly.

To avoid being blocked, instead of reverting please consider using the article's talk page to work toward making a version that represents consensus among editors. See BRD for how this is done.

Hi PR. Sorry your article was deleted. Argument-by-exception doesn't tend to work here: previous creation or deletion of articles has no bearing on the creation or deletion of other articles. However, if you have a specific reason to object to another article's existance (other than """"my article was deleted so this one should be deleted too"""") then you need to tag it with {{subst:afd}}. That produces a tag that gives you access to the AfD process. Follow the red link it creates and on that new page add {{subst:afd2 | pg=PageName | text=Reason}}~~~~ where PageName is the name of the article (case sensitive) and Reason is your detailed reasoning why the article should be deleted. Finally, go to WP:AfD. There's a link marked """"Add a new entry"""". Click that link and, at the bottom of the page, add {{subst:afd3 | pg=PageName}} where PageName is is the name of the article (case sensitive).

Pfortuny on Pfortuny's mediation

Apologies for the delay and for the following text which is far too long and I think out of place, but the discussion has led us here. By no means I intend my opinion to be regarded as more important than any other's, but for obvious reasons some people are expecting it. Here it goes. The history of this text is in  15:09, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

After reviewing the history and talking to , I have got the following vision of the facts (which is the basis for my opinion expressed below):
Alex's editions on the 29 were done without discussion on the talk page. This was clearly a serious mistake which led to the first catastrophe, but I think we may assume good faith here, at least ingnorance, not malice, especially if one follows the summaries, diffs, etc... 
Alex's editions on the 9 and 10 November were done using the talk page but he made edits before discussing them and, given the complete history of the article, the edits were too bold to be accepted without previous discussion; this led to their being systematically reverted (which is common use in the WP for that behaviour) and in the end to the blocking of the page. This behaviour was clearly a mistake of Alex's, and I put it to his not having read the complete history. While I am not excusing him, I do believe that most of the problems were a result of confusion caused by his Asperger's Syndrome.
Nobody can agree """"not to make unilateral edits"""" (Adam's expression) in whatever page for whatever reason, this is a bit too generic and has no deadline.
He is aware of the damages he may incur in (damages for himself) if he repeats the above behaviour.
Before Viajero's suggestion, Alex had told me he was going to """"try to stay out of Mother Teresa's page for a while"""". He has privately told me he is not going to touch the criticism section al least for a fortnight.
It sounds nice to be a mediator, but on the other hand it is a responsibility I cannot (I mean cannot, not do not want to or do not like to) take up for the moment.
If Alex behaves like he did on the 9/10 November, I will also agree to any rational punishment. I want to stress that I was in disagreement with most of his edits.
I do not think that Alex will cause any further problems.

Before stating my opinion, I would like everybody to know that Viajero's suggestion on my mediation was done without either mine or Alex's prior consent. He later expressed his concern about this to me. I feel it is only fair to mention it here.

Hence, my opinion is:
Unblock the page. If Alex behaves in a non cooperative way, then the resources of Wikipedia to prevent this non cooperative behaviour will be used, as with any other user.

But I mean as with any other user. If he were going to appear in the problem page, he has to be told in his talk page in advance; if he were going to be banned, then he has to be told explicitly in his own page and by a sysop, or whatever the standard procedure is.  12:35, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I have read the above and agree with Pfortuny.   13:14, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

This essay presents a critical, but insightful and vigorous character sketch that I think should be incorporated into the article. A passage:
TAB
TAB
Having come to power saying that her agenda was to pare down Wasilla to ‘the basic necessities, the bare bones’, she surprised its citizens when she redecorated the mayor’s office at a reported cost of $50,000 salvaged from the highways budget; its new red flock wallpaper matched her bold, rouge-et-noir taste in personal outfits. Another $24,000 of city money went on a white Chevy Suburban, known around Wasilla, without affection, as the mayormobile. She hired a city administrator to deputise for her in the day-to-day running of Wasilla’s affairs and employed a lobbyist in DC to wheedle lawmakers into meeting the town’s ever-expanding list of claims for congressional ‘pork’ (so named from the antebellum custom of rewarding slaves with barrels of salt pork). That expenditure, at least, paid off: during Palin’s six-year tenure as mayor, the federal government doled out more than $1000 for every man, woman and child in Wasilla. Her pet project was a $14.7m ice rink and sports complex, which opened in 2004. It is said to be lightly used, it has left the city servicing a massive debt, and a Jarndyce and Jarndyce lawsuit continues over the bungled way in which Palin acquired the land on which it’s built.TABCut, Kill, Dig, Drill London Review of Books Vol. 30, No. 19, 9 October 2008, pages 7-10, Jonathan Raban 24.17.191.27

MPT
Hi it has come to my attention that it is only the english articles that uses """"MRT"""" instead of """"MPT"""" which is used in the rest of other language wiki articles especially the Macedonian one. Debunking the romanized alphabet argument, it could be seen how even the logo has put """"MPT"""" in a romanized alphabet form therefore should be the one to be followed. It is practice here in wikipedia to use the official naming used by the one being described in the article no matter what their translation to english might be such as Volkswagen which in direct romanized translation is """"Folkswagen"""" but the former prevailed due to it being the one used in the official logo of the company albeit being romanized too. I understand your argument on the main article """"Macedonian Radio Television"""" that is why I kept that because its original name would not make sense in an expanded form here in english wiki. But its acronym should not be meddled upon especially it has a logo to prove it and the main article could provide the knowledge why MPT and what is its translation to english.Lastly the MRT 1 and MRT 2 pages should be really up for a disambiguation as the MRT worldwide may refer to Mass Rapid Transit or an equivalent rail term.

 Scope and Motivation 
Some Wikipedians have formed a project to better organize information in articles related to Ireland.  This page and its subpages contain their ideas; it is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of other Wikipedians.  If you would like to help, please inquire on the talk page and see the to-do list there.

The vast majority of this project was unashamedly ripped from another project: Wikipedia:WikiProject The Beatles, and the  of this project extends recognition for the tireless work involved in formatting, text, policy and many other aspects by ,  and himself.

For more information on WikiProjects, please see Wikipedia:WikiProjects and Wikipedia:WikiProject best practices.

This project has been created in an attempt to improve existing articles relating to Ireland, and to help with the creation of needed articles. It aims primarily to provide information in consistent format for articles on places in, or related to Ireland.  On top of this, it aims to get the main Ireland article to featured status, whilst aiding the maintenance and improvement of the Ireland Portal.

 Northern Ieland has a population of approximately 1.7 million.

 One of the greatest aids in this project for assessment and improving of articles, are the  logs found here Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Ireland articles by quality/1 and here Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Ireland articles by quality/2. Please take a look at the entries there as it will guide you on which articles need assessed, and will also guide you as to what might be necessary to improve individual articles.

Articles and categories relating to Ireland are extensive and work needs to be/is being done across a multitude of areas.  In order to gain the benefits of collaboration, please update this page with any relevant """"to do""""s.

Recent developments

 Belfast has been successful as the Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography's collaboration of the month. For anyone who's interested in helping to get the article up to FAC standard, there are many resources and a guide available on the UK Geography Project page.

 This Ireland Project is currently being re-vamped in line with the Belfast one.

I find this flat out statement misleading, as there is  recent research establishing that
quantum entanglement effects are faster than the speed of light (or possibly even instantaneous) or at least bounded i.e. the entangled particles know when to change at least 10000 times faster than the speed of light,  and that now slower than light signals are occurring.  The argument that even though the particles change instantaneously upon measurement but cannot be realized FTL - I find entirely misleading, as the actual change does take place FTL - and most reasonable people look at the problem of communication as the actual change between two distant objects, not how fast the change is actually ascertained (it would be like saying the speed of electricity isn't actually what it is because the brain cannot deduce information passed to it as fast as the electricity - which in my opinion is entirely misleading.)

 Transactional and transformational leadership 

Dear Synchronism, I would be happier if next time you research a little bit more on the notability of the articles you're proposing to delete before tagging them. Both theories are widely known among the leadership scholars, and a google or google scholar search would sufice. Also, it helps if you check the history page. There was some indication that some sort of bibliography existed before in transformational leadership, as the """"years"""" were cited after the authors. In a couple of clicks, you could have discovered the bibliography that was deleted by some editor in the past. Happy edits,   

A google hit count is not the same as a corpus token count. Anyway, ghits and corpus tokens don't equate notability.  I clearly have different opinions on this subject than you, so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't conflate those differences with any complaints you have about my editting activity.  You responded to my proposed deletions sufficiently and then some. And for the record: I do look at page histories.

""":Editors,

Thank you for the quick replies! My original thoughts were that it's painfully obvious to any reader that the UK is a country, and that this does not need pointing out  an equivalent example:

""""The United States is a country consisting of fifty states and a federal district.""""
can be reduced, without loss of clarity, to
""""The United States consists of fifty states and a federal district.""""

But very well  I can see that it's been decided to emphasize the UK's status as a country. Fair enough.

GoodDay, Jamesinderbyshire:  You're both very right, of course, but I think there's a chance we could preserve these subtle complexities AND use clear language *at the same time*. Perhaps there is a synonym for country that we can use that would eliminate this awkward wording altogether? I noticed that the """"Four countries of the United Kingdom"""" article uses the term """"sovereign state"""". Would the following work?

""""It is a sovereign state consisting of four countries: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.""""

Alarics: I realize the issue has been discussed before, but I feel that the issue has often been tackled from a political perspective - with pro-devolution/independence editors wanting to de-emphasize UK's status as a unitary state and with nationalists wanting to do the opposite.

I am a Canadian reader, without a lot of knowledge about UK politics or how the country operates. I am approaching this issue purely from a writing/editing perspective. I am simply trying to make this article as *clear and concise* as possible, without losing all the subtle complexities and compromises that various editors have negotiated into the article. I'm certainly not trying to set any new conventions, and I certainly don't want to set off any edit wars.

There is clear discriminatorics actions who have to stop and being alone against 10, it is difficult but not all impossible.

I do reply to those attacks, but I have the dignity to leave place for the other users, and to dont revert their texts and to in fact reinsert their answers and questions with mine who were deleeted with theirs.
The excuse of archiving is very thin seen in the light of the real purpose, and rearrching in less than 24 hours, after only 4 posts, is unacceptable and to spit at wikipedias face.
Do you think that all wikipedians are idiots and cannot see what you are trying to do?
I was called a troll, a lyer many times, insulted, and anyway terminated my contributions and answers to this with: """"kind regards"""", that was until the joke went too far, and the insults too loud, and the circus was too obvious that I used a more direct language, but it was not before you started those mass reverting actions disguise as archiving that I really went angry and asked for proper explainations.

I dont accept this.
You have no rights to do so and your insistency at grabing at wikis morality and set of rules to cover up for your diffamations is both hysterical and an hypocrisie who do not fool anybody.
i can see that you have all a long time training at doing so as you exchan´ge each time who is going to bear the hat...this way each person remain innocent as the guilt is dispearsed among as many as possible.

 Canvassing 

Hi KaragouniS, you may not have been aware of it, but the kind of vote canvassing you've been doing for the football template is rather seriously frowned upon. Can I ask you to stop? Thanks,  ☼ 
Ah yes, just going to say the same thing. └ ' / talk ┐ 

Honestly, I have no idea what's going on in the football pages. Apparently there have been precedents and some perceived consensus among football editors that only world championship teams should have such templates. Nothing I personally care very much about, to be honest.  ☼ 

No, KaragouniS, Greek users should not have been notified before it was put up for deletion.  All the other templates of the group are deleted, so it's clearly ripe for deletion.  And to notify all the Greek football users individually means slanting the !votes towards keep for that reason.  This is an encyclopedia for everyone, even when it comes to Greek football templates, and the !votes should be universal. └ ' / talk ┐ 

I am the third about canvassing the votes. Please do not do it again. It is divisive and disruptive.

Hello. Thank you for your recent edits regarding football players. Your edit included one or more links to the page defender, which is a disambiguation page. This type of page is intended to direct users to more specific topics. Ordinarily we try to avoid creating links to disambiguation pages, since it is preferable to link directly to the specific topic relevant to the context. You can help Wikipedia by revising the links you added to defender to refer directly to the most relevant topic, such as defender (football) by writing out [[defender (football)|defender]]. Regards,   

As a typing tip, you might also consider using the Help:Pipe trick. That is, type only [[defender (football)|]] which will automatically produce the correct [[defender (football)|defender]] when you press save. -) Silver

I question the very supposition that natural rights should be conjoined with legal rights, as I have recently brought up again below.  

The reasoning here seems to me to suggest that there is connection between the two (or at least to suggest in some way that there SHOULD or OUGHT to be a connection); this is a moral argument, not a legal one.  The POV is not neutral.  This question comes up in the very opening paragraph of SEP entry for legal rights, the issue: """"Whether legal rights are conceptually related to other types of rights, principally moral rights""""  [].  We need to talk about what is being inferred here by these two entries being together. I too believe the entries need to separated, as to link them suggests a direct link between legal and moral rights.

You even misquoted from the original. This not even sneaky vandalism - it's blatant, purposeful, organized, and relentless.

To reitirate my point on Ordu:talk, your sources are not NPOV. Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view I never argued with you about their Academic credentials even though the specific claims made by them are uncorroborated by any other Academic dead or alive. Dardian, the originator of your claim himself has not ever explicity said """"there was genocide in Ordu"""". You are interpreting - which is your POV on top of his POV!!

"(The following is not a formal request to be unblocked)

Thank you AnthonyBradbury your comments made sense. The issues I raised relate to the ANI thread still remaining open. Both Erpert,  NEEnt, and now you as an administrator have said that the matter is 'closed.' 

Despite me being blocked 5 days ago and despite Erpert closing the thread and stating no further comments, another editor whatamidoing, removed that and continued making false, baseless claims, quoting inaccurate details, that easily be proved. Further, entirely separate matters, to what my block was for, are now being discussed 'after' I was blocked. Without me having an opportunity to present clear contrary evidence based purely on the objective editing history. And have a fair minded neutral and independent administrator to judge both sides. 

These editors knew there was a ANI thread, but did not comment for 2 days until I was blocked. After I was blocked they then and only then, stuck the boot in, without any facts to back up their false claims. They may have waited until I was blocked because these baselss claims would have been proven false immediately, through me providing diffs and objective facts to the contrary. In fact, they only ceased when I asked for a temporary unblock above to respond! They would have kept 'hammering away' with baseless false claims, providing no facts to back them up and all the while, me being unable to provide the facts. 

I have made some very solid edits to numerous articles. I respect Wikipedia. I respect Wikipedia's policies. I accept the reasons for my current block and would appreciate, after such a significant period, ie. 2 full weeks, to start afresh and be provided an assumption of good faith in my editing rather than editors judging me already. I think all editors, after being blocked should be given the benefit of the doubt. Not to have this thrown in their face for ever more. That's not right. 

I know a lot about some topics. Very little about other topics. My reliable sources have good. My editing and additions have been good. Productive in many different articles. I completely reject being 'incompetent' as whatamidoing states, without me being able to respond. Simply because of differing points of view. I understand whatamidoing and Bilby are very experienced editors who have made great contributions to Wikipedia as editors. No-one is disputing that. They obviously gain a great deal of enjoyment from the project too! Does that provide these editors 'unequal' rights over less experienced editors who are also adding value to the project? Where they can make false baseless assumptions? I realise I have had some previous conflict with the same small group of editors in the past. But that says nothing about my edits being productive and of benefit to the project. 

I believe strongly in the principles of assuming good faith amongst editors. I did not think blocks were punitive whereby other editors can 'mock' the person who has been blocked? Nor are blocks an opportunity to make false, entirely baseless assumptions about an editor's competence. Is the ANI thread closed or is it not closed please AnthonyBradbury? I am hesitant to ask this through a formal request unblocking request. So could an administrator tell me if this ANI thread that was abruptly re-opened by whatamidoing, after the block was already applied, and the thread closed?",0

The shortest reign is believed to be that of Luis Filipe of Portugal who was assassinated at the same time as his father on 1 February 1908. He could thus be claimed to have been King of Portugal for 20 minutes.[1] However the Portuguese monarchy lacked automatic succession and so any claim that he was de facto king does not hold up to scrutiny.

This appears to be a case where someone has corrected something without realising how dumb it ends up sounding. If I'm reading it correctly it's saying... Luis Filipe was the shortest serving head of state. Actually we kid, he was never the head of state so he can't have been the shortest serving. The article then gives no hint as to who was the shortest serving head of state who actually served.",0

I have to agree with Alecmonroy: A > B is no different than B > A.  What I would recommend is to completely reorganize the section by criticsm, instead of the """"Pros"""" then """"Cons"""" approach.  What I mean is, say the general stuff first, like who is doing the criticizing, who is doing the responding, etc.  Then outline one criticism.  The immediately afterwards mention responses to those criticisms.    Then go onto the next, and so on.  What seems most important to me is how neutrally the prose goes from one to the next.  If it's something as simple as """"A says x, but B say y.""""  Then that's still set 'em up and knock 'em down. Also, using this format, it almost requires a bit extra emphasis given to explaining the criticisms in comparison to the rebuttals.  It is, after all, a criticism section, and if you're going to lump them all together in only a single section, they should get their due weight.   """,0

Oh I completely agree. I have kept to editing these concepts to a minimum for this. Ontology is """"to be"""" or """"on to"""" and this is in Greek by categorization. Ontology (and metaphysics by proxy) are nothing more then to categorize something. If you get a chance to look at the Bradshaw link to his book, notice that he uses the Greek words in Greek with Greek fonts. This is because the meaning to the words have been so drastically changed that for people to say them now in some cases means that the original lessons and knowledge (epistemology) has been lost.

Nope.  The word """"hippie"""" was in use before it referred to the hippie subculture.  Read Hippie (etymology).  Unless you can find a secondary source showing that the Rolling Stones were using it to refer to the subculture, then you don't have a dispute.  We don't do original research.  The Fallon citation isn't sourced to Fallon: it's found in multiple sources that make that claim.  Take a look at the citation in the Hippie article: Perry 2005, p. 19; Sinclair, Mick. (2004) San Francisco: A Cultural and Literary History. Signal Books. p. 205. ISBN 1902669649; Singleton, Carl. Wildin, Rowena. (1999). The Sixties in America. Salem Press. p. 334.

The addition of McCleary's """"numerous theories abound as to the origin of this word"""" is a great start in the right direction.  The next step is to find sources for additional theories.

 Comment from IP 

I was a Sophmore in High School when the 37th division was sent to the South Pacific theater of war. Three years later, in May, 1945, I was a replacement joining this Division where I earned my combat badge in June of that year. June 30th did not see the end of combat for this Division. I was an 18yr. old replacement and a member of Company D, 145th Infantry Regiment when we were sent deep into the Cagahan(Sp?) Valley of Northern Luzon with the assignment to thwart the fleeing soldiers of Japan from reaching the dense forested hills bordering that Valley. Our Company was engaged in many firefights with these retreating Japanese army units. My last combat missions were ended soon after the Dropping of the atomic bombs on the Japanese main land in early August. While my combat experience was very limited, I did come face-to-face with my own mortality during these few months of combat experience. When I came home in 1946, I remember the resentment I felt that my parents had to come with me before I could register to vote in my first National election. I was still under the legal voting age of 21.

On another subject, the Name of Medal of Honor winner, John J. Petrarcal is new to me. There is a famous ballad about the only Medal of Honor Winner about whom I had ever read, and that Medal of Honor went to Pvt.Roger Young, 148 Infantry Division,37th Division  for bravery on the Island of New Georgia, in the Solomon Islands in May of 1942.

I in no way want to detract from John Petrarcal, but I wonder, are there possibly two heroes to recall?   Citations: Personal experience and 37th Division written History.

"Questions over status

As already mentioned above the legal status of this constabulary IS a grey area.  I am a serving officer in the Met and many of my colleagues are unaware of the powers and remit of borough constabularies such as the WPP.  If serving front line police officers are unsure, then I have to say there is a definite grey area for the public.  I have done some research and discovered some interesting points which the article does not in its present form represent.  As a result, I and it would appear an anon editor have edited the article to try and make a better and objective article which reflects reality.  As it was, the article was subjective and questionable.  However these edits have been reverted without explanation – apart from comments such as ‘this is the truth’.  In effort to explain my edits and prevent an edit war I set out below my reason for altering the article. 

London Borough Parks Constabularies are, as is correctly quoted, established under sec 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provision Order Confirmation 1967.  This act allows London borough councils to establish a body of constables who have the power to enforce parks bye-laws in their respective parks.  It does not make these constables ‘police constables’ and does not allow police services or forces to be established.  No police powers are given to these parks constables (with the exception of parks bye laws) over and above those which everybody is entitled, often referred to as ‘any person’ powers or as in the case of arrest, ‘citizen’s arrest’.  

In comparison, officers from Home Office forces (such as the Met, Kent Police etc) can point to the Police Act 1996 as the basis for their establishment, jurisdiction and powers as police constables.  BTP officers can point to the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003.  Ministry of Defence Police officer can point to the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1986.  I could go on…My point is that all these police forces have a legal basis and with the attached powers to call themselves police officers and the organisations they work for police services/forces.  The WPP does not, unless someone can point to a piece of legislation that I have missed.

So the article started by saying, “Wandsworth Parks Police is a Police Service successfully run…”.  Two points about the opening sentence.  Firstly, its NOT legally a police service but a borough parks constabulary.  Secondly, the comment regarding ‘successfully run’ is highly subjective and without basis.  All organisations would like to be thought of a successful, but without any citation it should not be in an encyclopaedic article.

Under legal status the paragraph starts by mentioning the Met and working closely with it.  Irrelevant to legal status me thinks and again subjective.  Why mention a home office force in the legal status paragraph of a parks constabulary.  This paragraph should merely be about the legal status of WPP and its constables.  The paragraph rightly states that a magistrate swears WPP constables in, but not as ‘police constables’ but as ‘parks constables’ due to the legislation involved.  Once sworn in the parks constables have executive powers to enforce parks bye-laws in their boroughs ONLY.  Criminal law is not included.  However, just like the general public, parks constables can enforce criminal law in certain limited circumstances relating to indictable offences only.  This is commonly known as ‘citizens arrest’.  Due to changes in arrest powers with SOCAP in 2006, non police officers, such as parks constables need to be aware of the necessity criteria to make an arrest lawful.  My point is that the article read like the parks constables had police powers – they don’t (apart from the bye law aspect).  The paragraph then goes on to state that parks constables come under PACE.  Well this is obvious and irrelevant, any arrest by anyone is under PACE (as amended by SOCAP).  What it doesn’t do is give parks constables any more power than Joe Public (apart from the bye law aspect).  For all the above reasons, the last sentence of this paragraph (“They are always Parks Police Officers regardless of the technicalities of whether or not they are in the act of enforcing bye-laws.”) is not a true reflection of law and quite frankly wrong and misleading.  There is no such thing as a parks ‘police officer’. 

I had added at the bottom of the article two paragraphs with cited evidence which brings into question the status of parks constabularies and their use of the word ‘police’, blue lights and use of batons etc.  These were deleted without reason.  They are legitimate sources which shed light on the grey area.  You may not agree with the report and committee’s results but they are in the public domain and support my contention that there IS a grey area and WPP are treading on thin ice on occasion.

 Signpost exit poll  
Dear Wikipedian, you recently voted in the ArbCom election.  Your username, along with around 155 other usernames of your fellow Wikipedians, was randomly selected from the 2000+ Wikipedians who voted this year, with the help of one of the election-commissioners.  If you are willing, could you please participate (at your option either on-wiki via userspace or off-wiki via email) in an exit poll, and answer some questions about how you decided amongst the ArbCom candidates? 

  If you decide to participate in this exit poll, the statistical results will be published in the Signpost, an online newspaper with over 1000 Wikipedians among the readership.  There are about twelve questions, which have alphanumerical answers; it should take you a few minutes to complete the exit poll questionnaire, and will help improve Wikipedia by giving future candidates information about what you think is important.  This is only an unofficial survey, and will have no impact on your actual vote during this election, nor in any future election.

"The same could be said that as the president of an organization that is openly biased against breast implants, you're understandably against them.  I am all for voicing your opinion about what you believe in, but it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia entry.  As an objective third party, I can most definitely say that the current iteration of the article is quite biased towards the associated risks and not the device/procedure itself.  As a relatively new Wikipedian I came upon this article to see what all has been written about a subject I've been curious about for some time now, what I found was an article that has been butchered by people with agendas.  Why is it that an overwhelmingly large portion of the article is about the risks of Silicone breast implants when most implants used today are saline?  Why is there absolutely no information about why women get implants?  I would be more than happy to help expand these subjects but I believe it will be quite pointless until those with agendas have moved on, or take their discussion on the controversy of breast implants to the proper page. aktornado",0

 NPOV again 

First of all, I'm Brazilian and PRO Lula. I want a more neutral article. Not all the people in Brazil, I know, like him. But not all the people hate him. Every one knows what NPOV means, it would be rather a Multiple Point of view. So, criticism and good things must come together. Althou, Wikipedia cannot agree with bias, hate or fanatism.
Here is a list of some alterations I made and a bit of opinion:

 Biography: it is alright. It is a standart biography...
 Elections... """"In the second round of the 2002 election, (...) and became the president of Brazil."""" instead of """"to become the president-elect of Brazil"""". Just a bit of grammar.3
 The Government - Political Orientation: some time before, I transfered a piece of text about the radical-left-wing of PT from this article to PT's article. I DID NOT DELETED it. I just put it in a better place, because it is not a personal problem of Lula, but a problem for the party. Every one agree? The external links about it i tranfered to PT's article, too.
 The Government - Reforms and Important Laws. When I first wrote it I put each item as a section (I was pretending to write a piece of text for each one). It was oversized and so, following a sugestion, I changed it in a list. All right?
 Deleted: """"Unfortunately, there has been no control over the program on behalf of the government and """"Bolsa Família"""" has been transformed into mere populism."""" - It is not the common sense. It is a political point of view of an action of the government. Populism is a dangerous word that must be avoided. Maybe we could use another phrase instead, like it: """"Althou, there is some criticism on the efficency of this project."""".

The AfD ended in August, 2007, but the single didn't hit the charts until October, 2007.

Regards,  (TALK) 
On further research: And that could be the answer. Billboard's web site says: Most of the charts in Billboard are either pure sales or radio charts. The only exceptions in which we mingle sales and radio data are two of our signature charts: the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (as well as two charts based on the same data feeds as the Hot 100: the Hot 100's Bubbling Under chart, which ranks the top 25 titles that have not yet reached the Hot 100, and Heatseekers Songs, which reflects the most popular songs by new or developing acts, defined as those who have never appeared as a lead artist in the top 50 of the Hot 100, or the top 50 of Hot 100 Airplay prior to Dec. 5, 1998).Doesn't address Bubbling Under R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles chart, but the logic is pretty much the same, I suspect.

Of course, of course, Pharos, I am familiar with Judaism (I edited to """"Feature Artice"""" the Names of God in Judaism)...

It is not called List of people that claim or claimed to be God.  My contention is that the article needs to narrow its scope to become useful. For example, in Sikhism, (and Andries is correct in regard of non-idolatry), their gurus are considered to be of divine providence (see the halos behind any Sikh guru portrait...).  For example if we call this article, """"List of people that claim or claimed to be the Creator"""", it will be an appropriate distinction.

 """"fringe theory"""" 

The article currently contains the sentence:

 Richard Stallman says that proprietary software commonly contains """"malicious features, such as spying on the users, restricting the users, back doors, and imposed upgrades.""""

This is problematic on various levels:

NPOV - """"neutral point of view (NPOV) means representing [...] all significant views that have been published by reliable sources"""" - Stallman's view is hardly a """"significant view""""
undue weight - """"Generally, the views of tiny minorities should not be included at all""""
It is a Fringe theory / conspiracy theory, backed by absolutely zero evidence (from WP:FRINGE):

""""An idea that is not broadly supported by scholarship in its field must not be given undue weight in an article about a mainstream idea,[1] and reliable sources must be cited that affirm the relationship of the marginal idea to the mainstream idea in a serious and substantial manner.""""

""""We use the term fringe theory in a very broad sense to describe ideas that depart significantly from the prevailing or mainstream view in its particular field.""""

A conjecture that has not received critical review from the scientific community or that has been rejected may be included in an article about a scientific subject only if other high-quality reliable sources discuss it as an alternative position.

""""Care should be taken with journals that exist mainly to promote a particular viewpoint. Journals that are not peer reviewed by the wider academic community should not be considered reliable, except to show the views of the groups represented by those journals."""" - The FSF is clearly an organization with certain political views, clearly not a reliable source.

""""Quotes that are controversial or potentially misleading need to be properly contextualized to avoid unintentional endorsement or deprecation. What is more, just because a quote is accurate and verifiably attributed to a particular source does not mean that the quote must necessarily be included in an article""""

""""The best sources to use when describing fringe theories, and in determining their notability and prominence, are independent reliable sources.""""

""""Points that are not discussed in independent sources should not be given any space in articles.""""

""""Independent sources are also necessary to determine the relationship of a fringe theory to mainstream scholarly discourse.""""

User Pnm stated """"His perspective belongs in the article because he's prominent critic."""", but that is highly debatable, is his view (the particular one about spyware/backdoor) discussed in reliable sources?

 Ununseptium (in some time) 

Hi, Double sharp. As you know, there's that At FAC going on at the moment, but, in some time, it will be over, and there's also that ununseptium article waiting for the spotlight. I came to ask some help from you with that, I hope it won't be too difficult for you (it shouldn't be, but there may also be those RL issues, that's why I'm asking some time before I could actually start).

I think the article is great. It was a FAC in 2012, but it was failed due to prose quality. It's, however, not 2012 now, and some work will be required. I would love you to help me check things against accessibility. I was writing that article with non-technical readers in mind (and it actually turned out to be among the easiest to do so among all superheavies). I don't really expect to get that """"oh, wow, I knew nothing, but now I seem to get it"""" from all readers, but I want it to be at least a stable """"well, it's not easy, but I seem to get it."""" I think History and Naming are fine, and so is Nuclear stability, but those last two subsections need some look at; some examples of what I want to improve are """"the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s27p5"""" (because what does that mean? We need to explain it) and """"1.67 D"""" (we say it's a """"relatively small"""" value, but how small, really? Some examples should help a little bit). And also, maybe you've seen some superheavies predictions since then?

I will also check the data available. Wil think how to merge the German experiment into the story (I actually love the story of the discovery the way I wrote it). In the end, will ask for a thorough copyedit.

But that will happen later. Again, the start is not scheduled for tomorrow. What do you think, could you help me with that?  

Sure, I'll help you! I remember how you wrote the discovery: it was really neat. I haven't gone looking for new superheavy predictions in a while, but I'll go looking for them and I'll see what I can come up with.   """,0

In fact, everyone disagrees.

The idea that the Stone Age antiquities in Northernmost Fennoscandia could or should be associated with the Kvens is patently absurd, and not endorsed by any archaeologist I am aware of.

Unfortunately, I don't know the literature on this field that well, just the general background. -) So I know how most of the techniques work, who some of the experts are on a couple of the topics, and I can point out if a particular source doesn't seem to understand the science. But I would say that it's too broad a topic (and not enough is known) for it to be covered in the scientific literature as a single unit. 

That said, these reviews might be useful - please let me know if I can explain anything for you. I've just added them to a couple of articles, so you may come across them in Wikipedia as well. -) I can also recommend more sources on any specific topics of interest. 

Gene therapy is the field that's furthest along. Related articles of interest include vectors in gene therapy (aka delivery methods) and genome editing. There are also techniques such as SCNT (where the entire nucleus is replaced - this is how Dolly was cloned), but I hesitate to consider those genetic engineering. 
Another field that comes to mind is regenerative medicine, although that article isn't nearly comprehensive. This (and the related field of tissue engineering) mainly focus on applications such as the growth of organs for transplant, starting from stem cells. However, it doesn't currently use much genetic engineering; the closest it gets is genetic reprogramming (I was extremely surprised to find that article didn't exist; I've just created it.)
As far as I'm aware, the use of genetic engineering to give humans new traits (as opposed to prevention or cures) is mostly speculative, although the techniques should apply in the same way. Synthetic biology is the closest (in that it attempts to devise new traits), but it's still just beginning and is extremely far from any application in humans. I imagine that most of the descriptions of technology will be like this (not yet applicable to humans but could be in the future), other than that which applies to human cells in culture.
The scope of the article is uncertain to me. Most of the sources that use """"human genetic engineering"""" as a viable description discuss ethics rather than science. (Of course, the ethics is important as well, but my familiarity is with the science.) There is a lot of scientific detail that can be discussed, but as I mentioned above, the science itself doesn't usually use such a broad categorization. 
The science is moving quickly. An article written in 2012 may have a significantly different background context from one written in 2011. 
Modification is easiest at the zygote or blastocyst stage. There is a bit of information on how this is done at transgenic mouse. (It's not done in humans, of course.)
There are a lot of people who use language such as """"the next stage in human evolution."""" (This is something I removed from the article.) I think I also saw it in a couple of respectable sources when I was editing this page, but it's at the least imprecise/poor wording and (at least in my opinion) should be attributed if included. It is valid under a broader definition where """"evolution"""" simply means """"change over time,"""" but it implies some mechanism of progress or goal-directedness (""""stages"""") - so it is somewhat misleading when applied to biological evolution, which doesn't have these properties.

Something stands out about the championship match of WrestleMania XV
After taking a look through some old notes, I think I noticed that the only time that a """"heel"""" won the major championship of the WWE from a """"face"""" at any WrestlaMania is at the 1999 WrestleMania, when Steve Austin won it from The Rock.   In any version of the major championship {WWE Championship, World Heavyweight Championship), the only time I remember seeing the """"heel"""" leave the major championship match of WrestleMania as the champion is only when he entered the match as the defending champion (such as Chris Jericho successfully defending against Edge in 2010, and the Miz successfully defending against John Cena in 2011). Otherwise, the """"face"""" typically wins the major championship match, especially when the face is the defending champion.
This may just be speculation, but probably the reason that Steve Austin as the """"heel"""" got to win the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 15 is because it was held in his home state of Texas. ..
.. So, this major championship match of WrestleMania 30 should be quite interesting in the way it unfolds, as there are two possibilities; if in the Bryan/HHH match, Triple H were to win, the triple threat major championship match would have all three participants as """"heels"""", including the champion Randy Orton, making it so that no matter who wins, the champion would be heel regardless of who the champion is, barring a """"face turn"""". On the other hand, if in the Bryan/HHH match, Daniel Bryan were to win, the triple threat major championship match would have two heels including the champion Randy Orton, and one face, obviously being Daniel Bryan - and if that's the case, with the history being the way it is with this sort of thing, they would almost assuredly mean they would have to have Daniel Bryan win the big championship match, as WrestleMania history usually dictates. Although, we never know how they might possible go against their own history. Plus, there's no telling whether they will even have Daniel Bryan defeat Triple H to get into the triple threat match at all. 
 
But they could surprise everyone and have the championship match end up being a fatal-four-way match, in which case anything could happen. But I think the majority of us might agree that the one least likely to come out of the championship match with the championship is Batista; he's the only one of the four guys to disappear before long, since he hasn't been there. But also, being that Randy Orton is the """"heel"""" and that he's had the championship since October, he too isn't likely to be the champion after that match. So, if we were putting odds on it, all historical facts considered, the two most likely to have the championship after that match (be it a triple threat or fatal four way, if that were to happen) is either Daniel Bryan or Triple H - Daniel Bryan because he can be the hero of WrestleMania as the good guy, or Triple H because he hasn't had the championship in five years and because he's the boss.
But as I say, to my recollection, only in 1999 did a heel win the major championship at WrestleMania.   """,0

Hello, I was recently banned and then rebanned for a fortnight and then banned from contacting others or even writing on my own talk page.

The final block of me being able to even write on my own talk page about how I was blocked unjustly and the inherent problems that I could spot in the process really took the cake and I think that moderator named Tarc (but the others too) need to be seriously reprimanded and even stripped of their tools because this was serious abuse of power and it was taken to an excessive level that shows clear abuse I think.

Ryulong HAS been bullying and tried very hard to keep a false QUOTE on the JEREMY CLARKSON page. Using sock puppets I was able to force him through the aid of other editors, to acquire the ACTUAL quote and SOURCE it... what a criminal I am huh?!

Ryulong on the other hand, repeatedly deleted my DISCUSSION TOPIC in his attempt to place the FALSE INCEST statement on the page.

If you are going to quote someone claiming that they've made jokes about INCEST, then you should back it up with a source.

Isn't WIKIPEDIA about accuracy and integrity?

It's all there in black and white.

Also - I did not email tons of users... I left messages on approx 4 pages. I thought I was messaging people that had problems with the guy too. AFTER I did that, I discovered that the guy had been nominated for ADMIN... this was really bad news.

This all started with a group of Anti-American editors that PROTECT the Jeremy Clarkson page. Both incidents have since been corrected as I was relying on fact not ambigous anti-American information.

I am not a BULLY. I am not politically motivated. I am not a vandal. My issues have been about FACTUALISING the political works of crooked admin who abuse the 3rr rule and cite PERSONAL ATTACK REACTION as personal attack.

I hope you will actually look into this. You seem to have taken a great interest in it, why not be wholesome and fair and look into my claim?

Thanks for reading.

YourCousin  

I'm honestly not here for a fight or debate, I just ask that you please look into what I've talked about (the bullying and dicscussion topic deleting) and let me know what you think. 

I have a proper USERNAME with nearly 2,000 edits. If I use that to communicate with you or edit the Jeremy Clarkson page, the ADMIN and editors there follow you around undoing your work and getting their ADMIN buddies to block you. So I have special IDs for such pages. Sorry. They made it that way. I DO NOT VANDALISE.

Today, I tried to tell my VALID story on Ryulong's admin nomination page and his #3 supporter, MR LEFTY was there within 120 seconds to delete and censor my story. This is unfair. The whole vote is now unfair because of such censure. 

If you are not crooked, then please at least tell me, """"YES, IT LOOKS LIKE HE DID THWART YOUR DISCUSSION AND TRY TO KEEP THE WRONG QUOTE IN THE PAGE""""... that's all. That's how it all got started. I am 38 years old, I don't find INCEST as funny as Ryulong.

Please respond. I would appreciate it.

YourCousin 

Ha ha... I've just noticed that you're from TEXAS... I AM FROM MIDLAND TEXAS!!!(but living in the UK for now) 750 miles from Houston I think, but damn man!! don't you see who these Anti-USA guys are? Don't you recognize the Don't Mess With Texas attitude from me? LOOK AT THE REVERTS!

This all started because the page said that YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PASSPORT to buy a drink in USA and that machine guns are legal. This pissed me off because Anti American people in Britain thrive on this mis-information.  
My revert war with Ryulong was down to him wanting to keep a statement that said that ALL AMERICANS HAVE INCEST.. the quote was false, but he went al great lengths to keep it, stating that it didnt need a source. 
I think that if you say that someone else said that an entire COUNTRY(THE USA) has incest, that you should have to back it up. Isn't Wikipedia about FACT and ITEGRITY?

The page now has the real quote which is not much better but at least it does not say it about ALL AMERICANS and at least it's a real quote with a real source!

DUDE!! LOOK AT THE PAGE! PLEASE!!!

I've been stitched up majorly!!

Look at some that have clean up notices on them and look at some of the better ones. If you do this you will be better able to judge the content. 

You may use published sources that are not on-line. So long as they are reliable and ultimately verifiable by someone who would take the time to look them up to check the information.

Wikipedia has increased the need for Encyclopedic Value. Older articles that are not verifiable are being removed. The ones that have long standing clean up notices will either be rectified by interested parties or will ultimately be removed. Those notices serve to tell the public that the article does not meet the standards of reliability of an encyclopedic article. 

It appears that the Orchestra has been in existence for 50 plus years. It is not an emergency to get an article published. The heading ==Acclaim== jumps out as promotional. This is puffery and self aggrandizement. The article must be neutral in tone. The references or footnotes must back up statements in the article. for example use a statement such as - The orchestra has been well received by audiences in Country A and City B. Put in the references. the references themselves may be full of congratulatory language but avoid putting in the article. By way of illustration, if a news article from Country A said this is the greatest orchestra in the world and got a five minute standing ovation from the audience, you would use that as reference with regard to the aforementioned statement but would not put that directly in the article. If the article is in a venue brochure it is of little value but if it is in the Country A's leading newspaper then it is of value. Ask yourself, what would make this youth orchestra worthy of mention in an encyclopedia. That critical viewpoint will lead to a better article.",0

This is really smart. There's an entry saying someone blanked a page. How clever. But I am using this IP and I certainly didn't blank any page.

Wiki's omniscient henchmen suggest registering an account. It's no longer a wiki then is it? Registering an account is not a good idea anyway. Far better is to stop blocking IPs like this. Most people are on non-static IPs anyway so the idea is 'last millennium'.

What you really need is to filter out the junk that gets people pissed off in the first place. If Wikipedia had any quality at all - and not just a bunch of do-nothings who patrol and feel tough about it - and there wouldn't be any vandalism at all.

Dohn, see my reply to Powers about Google searches, above. I regard these as crucial for our titles to take into account. That is how many web users encounter our articles; Google knows that, and gives our titles great prominence. This is not understood well by WP editors.
I consider the behaviour of WP's own search prompts important, even if these are a second consideration after Google has been taken into account. Under """"my scheme"""" in its completeness, or some scheme that I would accept, one might type as far as """"Catholic Memorial"""" and get a better, more comprehensive DAB page that would include several that are not readily findable now. As things stand, prompts show a couple of DAB pages with identical content (is that kosher?), and two specific article pages: for Massachusetts and Wisconsin. Under the proposal in this RM, it is hard to say how things might go. Not usefully for the reader, as far as I can see.
I regret that because of commitments in the world at large I have little time to take this further (though I have, you will agree, commented in detail already; thanks to you, for doing the same). For me the essential point is broad. I don't really care about individual cases of confusion arising from bad RMs; I would like to see a more sophisticated understanding of titles generally, for our millions of articles. Things are at a low standard right now.

What struck me immediately was that the presenter's great-grandparents had been in service, and she likely would have been as well had society not changed. I don't think I would have been though, more likely hanged or transported for insurrection. It reminded me of what motivated me to work on workhouse, and the programme briefly mentioned in passing an extraordinary (to me anyway) magazine called The Servant's Magazine, which I just had to create an article on.

I'm indifferent. I have work to do on-wiki, but I also have plenty to do off-wiki. If you believe that the welfare of the project will be better served by an unblock, then consider yourself free to do it, within what is allowed as to reversing administrative decisions. Probably Future Perfect should be consulted, unless there is consensus that his block was involved (notice the dispute section above, and if more information is needed  that section was not accompanied by evidence about the existing dispute because I didn't want to write it as the first approach. But, if asked to do so, I would.)

Please do not unblock me if it would cause more disruption than it would prevent; the block will expire in a week anyway and delaying unblock that long is not likely to cause serious harm. On the other hand, comment on the propriety of the block is welcome here, and there is also an open RfAr/Clarification. I had filed that, and it was over comment in it that I was blocked. Possibly I should have a transcluded section there, in my section of the RfAr, and I'm going to need guidance from ArbComm as to any limits to be placed on what I can say there.

I could be unblocked under a provision that I only edit the RfAr page, though that's problematic here because I was blocked for editing the RfAr page! Not sure I've ever seen anything quite like this before.",0

 Deletion of section on Possibility of Mars having enough water to support life 

I'd like to point out that BatteryIncluded has deleted this section. I won't try to argue with him because I have had a fruitless argument on the """"life on Mars"""" page on this very topic. He is convinced that the cosmic ray arguments that make dormant life impossible over hundreds of thousands of years periods in the surface of Mars also make it impossible for life to survive even if reproducing every year (although cosmic radiation levels on the surface are comparable to the interior of the ISS). I gave up arguing the point with him.

However I'd like to point out that there has been a major conference earlier this year in February (with 38 scientists presenting the results of their researches) [The Present-Day Habitability of Mars 2013 - Program]

You can watch the video presentations and decide for yourself if the current prevailing scientific opinion is that the surface of Mars is potentially habitable or uninhabitable. It is true that before the Phoenix lander possible salty brine observations in 2008 the prevailing view was that life on the surface of Mars is impossible. But that is no longer the consensus and it would be hard to find a single researcher in the field who holds that opinion today. I have put a copy of the section into my user space as I frequently use it for reference and found it a useful resource. Please note I did not write this section myself, only added a couple of sentences to it.

 Collapse by consciousness? Face the consequences! 

If we take the """"collapse by consciousness"""" viewpoint then:

 Consequence 1.

In famous experiments with entanglement (Aspect's, and
other), thousands of entangled pairs are created and measured, each
pair during a microscopically short time; no human observes individual
results in real time (and usually, never at all); rather, a computer
registers them, calculates frequencies (statistical averages) and
displays these to a human observer.

Does it mean, thousand of collapses? No; rather, a single collapse
after the whole experiment. No definite values for individual spin
projections; only a definite value for the average.

 Consequence 2.

Do you believe that human consciousness acts on the microsecond scale?
Probably not. Probably, on the scale of seconds. Then, a collapse
takes about seconds. Then, entanglements could be relevant to
faster-than-light communication only on distances of million
kilometers (or so). Definitely irrelevant in all experiments performed
for now (on the Earth) or planned in the near future.

I've encountered a number of problems with the navigation popup tool and Opera 8 for Linux:
After showing for a few seconds, the popup expands with between one and five pages of mostly Chinese characters.  I assume this is supposed to be a page preview.
The popup always has a broken image link on the right side.

Sure. What do you mean? I am in the process of writing a little welcome and how to. John, if you recall the minor dispute about the Estonia links really caught me off guard and I was a bit thin-skinned in taking criticism for what I thought was my helpful addition of a couple of links. I learned from that and other experiences here that practically every article has two sides, and that you can't just go in and naiively think you're adding objective information, when that info most likely has already been debated. I was also caught off guard in that the other contributors to the site took me for a Neo-Nazi! (See comment from DLX to that effect.) They were quick to jump to that conclusion, I thought, based only on a few bits of info gleaned from my posts. Anyway, I'm trying to make it clear that I do not do anything on Wikipedia because of what I do for a living. And I wanted to point out, with the """"About me: Who cares"""", that I do not participate here to draw attention to myself or to please my employer.  

 BTW, John, can you take a look at the dispute (there is a BRIEF reference on my user page) involving user THF or Ted Frank. Do this only if you have time to look at all the backroundthere is a lot of it on his talk page, some on the talk page for tort reform in the united states, and some on sonic's rendezvous band's talk page and deletion discussion page. I believe this user has violated several rules and policies and, in general, the spirit and purpose of Wikipedia. I have asked Cool Hand Luke to look at this but so far he has not. He only made a comment about something I did in response to being attacked by this user. Thanks for your consideration. Perhaps DLX can look at this issue too. I hope that both of you have concluded from our earlier discussion that my approach may have been ill-considered, but my purpose and intent was to make a good-faith contribution, not to disrupt and certainly not to enforce any particular politically motivated point of view.

I too have never heard the term """"chip romney"""". I'll remove it as soon as I finish writing this- it's unofficial, and isn't a nickname of sorts.
According the the Romney Marsh page, it does extend into Sussex, so by all means we should re-write the location to include this.
I think what you are referring to in your third point was a bit of a mistranslation. Where I don't really know anything about the place of Romney Marsh, I think the editor who wrote that part meant that one of the reasons Romney's were such a success in this area was because of their hardiness. Perhaps this could be re-written too- but as I said, I don't know too much about the place, so I'll leave that to other editors.
For point four, we really need to find external sources to back this up.
For the black points, we should write a section that incorporates a world-wide view. This article is generally focused on one or two areas of the world, so we should really include the general standards for each country. In Australia, for instance, at the shows I've gone to pink on the nose is generally looked down on, but if it's a 'good' sheep, this is minor, and is overlooked quite a bit. Discoloured hooves, however, tend to have more weight on a judge's decision. It's really a matter of who's judging. I'm not sure about other countries, but I do know in the US pink has a lot more weight on a judge's decision than most other countries.
Agreeing with you on your 6th point. Crimp also needs to be defined.
Point 7- you seem to know more on the uses of Romney wool. Keep in mind that we'll need to find reliable external sources for this information.
Point 8- Romney interest in Australia has dropped off considerably, but as you say in NZ is still very high. Again, see what I said before- the article needs to incorporate a worldwide view.
Altogether, the article needs expansion, more reliable sources and a worldwide view. With enough work, we could even get this up to GA standard. ''''''  talk |

Test
Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s–1970s was a group retrospective exhibition of social documentary photography held at the Art Gallery of South Australia from 28 May to 1 August 2010.Art Gallery of South Australia Exhibitions Candid Camera website

Candid Camera had its roots in Six Photographers, a groundbreaking exhibition held in Sydney in May 1955, which concentrated on what was still a relatively new development in Australian photography and featured the work of Max Dupain, David Potts, Axel Poignant, Gordon Andrews, Kerry Dundas and Hal Missingham.Robinson, Julie """"Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s–1970s"""" Art Gallery of South Australia exhibition catalogMcDonald, Patrick """"The Way We Were"""" The Advertiser, 20 May 2010 AdelaideNow websiteNewton, Gael """"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988"""" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055) The work of the first three of these artists is also represented in Candid Camera. Six Photographers, an artist-initiated show that featured 200 images at a time when exhibitions of personal photographic work were rare, was regarded as sufficiently influential for the Art Gallery of New South Wales to commemorate it with a show of the same name featuring the same six photographers, more than 50 years after it had first been presented.Newton, Gael """"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988"""" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055)Newton, Gael """"Silver And Grey: Fifty Years Of Australian Photography 1900-1950"""" Angus & Robertson, 1980 (ISBN 0207141096)Art Gallery of New South Wales Exhibitions Archive AGNSW websiteAllen, Christopher """"Decisive Moments"""", The Australian, 27 February 2010 The Australian website This second version of Six Photographers featured 29 images, many of them shown in 1955, and concentrated on works from the same period (the late forties through to the mid-fifties).

Candid Camera, while about half the size of the 1955 Sydney exhibition, covered a significantly wider range of artists and looks not just at the foundations of Australian social documentary photography but at the era that curator Julie Robinson clearly regards as its golden age – the fifties, sixties and seventies.

In line with the statements issued by the six photographers group, Candid Camera featured “images which appear unposed, spontaneous, or with their subjects captured unaware”. Though the majority of the photos in the exhibition (more than 80 in total) were taken in Australia, images by Australian photographers working overseas were also included.Allen, Christopher """"Unguarded Moments"""", The Australian, 17 July 2010 The Australian websiteEmmett, Patrick """"Candid Camera"""" ABC Television interview, originally broadcast on Stateline, 28 May 2010 ABC website Subjects included youth subcultures, newly arrived migrants, nuns, a number of prime ministers (though not all were in office at the time of the photo), musicians such as Bon Scott of AC/DC, and ordinary people in everyday settings: at work, at the beach and at bus stops.

Photographers represented in Candid Camera included Max Dupain, David Moore, Jeff Carter, Max Pam, Robert McFarlane, Mervyn Bishop, Rennie Ellis, Carol Jerrems and Roger Scott and a number of others. Of those named, all have work held in the permanent collection of National Gallery Of Australia. Mervyn Bishop is the only Aboriginal Australian to have been included, and though his work has primarily been in New South Wales, Robert McFarlane was the only photographer to be born in South Australia. In this last regard, Candid Camera was very different to Century In Focus, an earlier large-scale photographic survey curated by Robinson, which dealt only with images taken in South Australia.Robinson,",0

"Finding consensus is frequently impossible when parties refuse to communicate completely. One of the classic problems with consensus communities is that it can take a lot of time to discover the underlying unities, and some don't have the patience for it (or, simply, the time). A few people, in addition, really don't want to find agreement. It, or the process, might whack their agenda upside the head.",0

"this article fails to explain camphene's contribution to the alternative fuel market during the peak of whale oil usage during the mid-1800's (1840-1860???)

Lovins and Co reference camphene and claim it contributed 10% of the market of lighting energy. If true, that would make camphene far more relatively significant than our current alternative energies like wind, solar and so forth
Winning the Oil Endgame, Lovins, et al. http://www.rmi.org/images/PDFs/Bookstore/WtOEg_InnoForProfit.pdf

i would suggest expanding the entry on camphene and perhaps linking it to other alternative energy fuel source articles to help readers understand historical developments in alternative energies

it is not clear how 1850's camphene was prepared? was is ethanol from brewing/ distilling then added to turpentine from timber production???

I don't have the expertise in this area or I would attempt to answer these questions

thanks for listening",0
"""==Australian electoral division infoboxes== 
I would appreciate it if you would fix up your 'allegience' portion of the table per the Australian standard. 0-5.99 is marginal, 6.00-10.00 is fairly safe, 10.01> is safe. Thankyou.   
It's better to go by the AEC than the ABC. Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Australian_politics/Archive_2#Election_campaign_articles where we established consensus that 0-5.99/6-10/>10 should be used for this page.    

Per the link above, the Australian Electoral Commission as well as SA's State Electoral Office use 0-5.99 marginal, 6-10 fairly safe, and >10 safe. On wiki we have also used >20 as v.safe. This is what has been agreed upon per the consensus in the link above and is used on all pages that relate to it such as the other link above. Thanks.     
    
Ah. Well, per the link above, there is a ref which is http://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/hass/staff/pendulum_new.pdf - a very good resource, post-redistribution, and then the standard 2004 results from the AEC which are in the division page refs, such as http://results.aec.gov.au/12246/results/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-12246-190.htm .     
    
No sorry.     
    
Nice work with all the infoboxes, but it was previously agreed here that infoboxes were superfluous to the article (you'll note that I preferred them to be included). In the interests of consensus, please raise this issue at the above link before adding any more, otherwise there may be a lot of removal, as I had to do earlier! Thanks.     
    
On another note, can I suggest that the infoboxes include the electorate's namesake?      
   
Additionally (I sound like I'm quibbling, I know - I do like the look of the new infoboxes) - are you able to make a template? This would make the inclusion and maintenance of the infoboxes much, much easier.      
    
The ones being used for the Sydney ones are out of date, representing the electorates as of 2004. I don't know if the others are uploaded yet.      
   
I've fixed the template up now, and changing them to templates. I hope you don't mind, but I removed some of the categories - I don't think anywhere provides information on population or density, and the """"last election"""" section is redundant as there's a table on that further down - and (I don't know if this was you) I'm making the allegiances according to the marginal-fairly safe-safe criteria used on the AEC, and I added the classification (inner metropolitan etc.) to the tables. If there are any problems with this please let me know!      
    
 Aussie Cricket Team History of Shirts    
    
Hey, you have a great collection of Aussie one-dayer shirts there and I wanted to know where you got the info from? From the looks of things you made it all in MS Paint and for me, using Microsoft PowerPoint and having a good cricket shirt template I could rack up all those (with the real logos) at sharp quality and accurate colours. Just wanted to know if I needed your permission or anything. I shouldn't really, but hey it won't do me any harm.

Leuren K Moret
 
You asked if Leuren Moret has a PhD degree. She does not; she dropped out of the UC Davis doctoral program in Geology in the mid-1980's. I have an e-mail from the Department confirming that fact. Moret has done NO independent scientific research. She was given co-authorship of three papers by two UC Berkeley doctoral candidates, now both former Department Heads of major universities. I will gladly correspond with you or anyone else interested in Moret. My information is not posted on Wikipedia because I am considered the original source since I am the one who made the California Public Records Act request to Lawrence Livermore and I am the one who has found and corresponded with her former peers.

"Composition of the list (table) 

1. Removed the info on Falcon X Heavy and Falcon XX, since those are just proposed concepts that haven't yet reached nowhere near the project stage. 2. Removed the info stating that Saturn INT-21 had one launch. It has never flown, the booster used for Skylab was an actual Saturn V with the 3rd stage modified into Skylab itself. The entry for Saturn INT-21 should probably be deleted altogether, but unlike two heavy Falcons it was under development coming much closer to becoming an operational vehicle, so I'm not sure. 3. Added clarification to Space Shuttle entry that it is regarded here as an integrated launch system, and not a standalone heavy booster, also removed the note stating:  'Like Soviet Energia-Buran system, despite of integrated design of rocket and orbiter, US Space Shuttle may be comparatively considered as launcher for such superheavy payload as manned spaceplane. But it should be noted that the orbiter could not hold more tha 25,000 kg.'  Such reasoning is not entirely justified. It can be considered as such only with serious reservations, since Shuttle's Orbiter acts de facto as a returnable third stage which cannot be replaced with anything else and has to be brought back to Earth, whereas other boosters can hypothetically (or practically, like Saturn V - Skylab case) have the load they put in LEO modified.  And certainly the Shuttle system cannot be part of this comparative list based on similarity with Energia-Buran (the note says 'like Soviet Energia-Buran system') since Enegia booster could be adapted to carry basically any appropriately configured and balanced payload piggybacked on its side, not just the orbiter.",0

The Tea Leaf - Issue Four

Hi! Welcome to the fourth issue of The Tea Leaf, the official newsletter for the Teahouse! 

Teahouse pilot wraps up after 13 weeks After being piloted on English Wikipedia starting in February, the Teahouse wrapped up its pilot period on May 27, 2012. We expect this is just the beginning for the Teahouse and hope the project will continue to grow in the months to come!

Thank you and congratulations to all of the community members who participated - and continue to participate!

What you've all been waiting for: Teahouse Pilot Report is released! We look forward to your feedback on the methodology and outcomes of this pilot project.
....and if a pilot report wasn't enough, the Teahouse Pilot Metrics Report is out too! Dive into the numbers and survey results to learn about the impact the Teahouse has made on English Wikipedia.
Teahouse shows positive impact on new editor retention and engagement 

409 new editors participated during the entire pilot period, with about 40 new editors participating in the Teahouse per week.
Two weeks after participating, 33% of Teahouse guests are still active on Wikipedia, as opposed to 11% of a similar control group. 
New editors who participated in the Teahouse edit 10x the number of articles, make 7x more global edits, and 2x as much of their content survives on Wikipedia compared to the control group. 
Women participate in the Teahouse  28% of Teahouse participants were women, up from 9% of editors on Wikipedia in general, good news for this project which aimed to have impact on the gender gap too - but still lots to be done here!
New opportunities await for the Teahouse in phase two as the Teahouse team and Wikipedia community examine ways to improve, scale, and sustain the project. Opportunities for future work include:
Automating or semi-automating systems such as invites, metrics and archiving
Experimenting with more ways for new editors to discover the Teahouse
Building out the social and peer-to-peer aspects further, including exploring ways to make answering questions easier, creating more ways for new editors to help each other and for all participants to acknowledge each other's efforts
Growing volunteer capacity, continuing to transfer Teahouse administration tasks to volunteers whenever possible, and looking for new ways to make maintenance and participation easier for everyone.
Want to know how you can lend a hand at the Teahouse? Become a host! Learn more about what makes the Teahouse different than other help spaces on Wikipedia and see how you can help new editors by visiting here.
Say hello to the new guests at the Teahouse. Take the time to welcome and get to know the latest guests at the Teahouse. Drop off some wikilove to these editors today, as being welcomed by experienced editors is really encouraging to new Wikipedians.

I don't know if there is a policy about YouTube not being used, but I tend to replace YouTube links anyway because they are forever removing videos and if something is true and noteworthy, there would be more than just a video source.

This article is indeed biased due to the use of adjectives projected upon the EDL. Within the wiki talk page there appears to be sufficient evidence that the characterization of the EDL has not been fact-based, but in some cases the opinion of opposition groups. This very argument is taking place on the talk page of the UAF where they have successfully garnered favorable edits to their own description with the omission of the term left-wing, yet the EDL ‘s group type currently stands as “far right-wing”.  Even when the nature of a topic is agreeably abhorrent, the moment one describes said topic with words such as atrocity or (insert)phobic, the subject has become tainted with opinion.  As the world descends upon Wikipedia to learn about these groups due to recent events; it is vital that factual information be provided. I’ve never heard of the EDL until a few days ago, yet someone like myself, untainted by prejudice; can see this article is biased at face-value. Lacking an omnipotent author, the introductory description of the EDL should largely come from how the EDL describes itself. Any evidence to the contrary should be cited properly where Wikipedia provides.

At the beginning of this case the arbitration committee let it be known that the case was about Nina Green, despite LHvU's opening statement.

I'd really appreciate it if you could post on my talk page something about this investigation having been resolved, so people don't think I'm some sort of evil malicious editor. I'd be glad to answer any questions. Thanks!  """,0

Hi Ron, thanks for creating the Chain Ring article.

"There was one serious push for the Upper Peninsula becoming the state of Superior in the Michigan Legislature. The push was made by Dominic J. Jacobetti Sr. was was probably the most (in)famous Michigan politician ever; he served 40 years in the Michigan House of Representatives and died before term limits could move him out. Jacobetti pushed for U.P. statehood in the legislature, although polls conducted in Marquette and Ironwood suggested that Upper Peninsula residents did not want to become their own state. I did a fairly large research project on Jacobetti and a good portion of it was dedicated to his pushing the U.P. as the 51st state. I can add a bit about this later from my research paper which is well documented and backed by sources from the Northern Michigan University/Central Upper Peninsula Archives which contains a wealth of material about the subject. - An NMU PoliSci student",0

My name is Dean Estes. I met Snakefinger (Mr. Lithman) in 1981 when he and his band played on the front lawn of our high school. One of his band members, a former Dead Kennedy, had attended the school and made this cool event possible. I don't know why Steve Crabtree claims that Lithman was American and was not of European descent. Technically it may be true that the UK is not part of """"Europe"""" despite being a charter member of the EU, but Mr. Crabtree's claims risk giving an false impression. Phil """"Snakefinger"""" Lithman was English, as is easily verified and as was clearly obvious when the man spoke. Perhaps Steve meant that Snakefinger was living in America? (Specifically San Francisco.) Two years later I was fortunate enough to befriend one of The Residents. While I was savvy enough not to ask certain questions until enough trust had been earned, I do recall, during a discussion of the The Residents' remarkably unique sense of harmonization, asking if N. Senada had actually existed. My Resident acquaintance simply smiled and shrugged his shoulders, which I knew was a nice way of saying """"we aren't going there,"""" so I didn't pursue it. I believe it's pretty obvious that """"the mysterious N. Senada"""" never actually existed when you review the various things that have been said about him. Isn't the amusing play on the name of the Baja Mexican town """"Ensenada"""" clue enough? However, this is another case where the question of whether or not such aspects of the Residents mythos """"matter"""" is perfectly valid. Of course it doesn't really matter. As one of the people who actually does know the answers to some of the speculation here, it's so strange, seeing how some people post misinformation with conviction (intentionally?) while others deny facts. For the most part, to quote an old Eno lyric, """"those who know, they don't let it show.""""  -) Mystery and myth are more fun, and I think it's safe to say that's part of the point of the Residents' myriad mysteries. Nevertheless, while Snakefinger protected The Residents' secrets, he wasn't secretive about his own """"real"""" identity or history at all. My apologies to Steve if I've misunderstood him.""",0

the only problem with all of this is that Wikipedia IS evil.
With all of the rules and all of the noise, what it still comes
down to is a mob of people doing whatever they want as a mob, against reason, against fairness, against logic, and against truth.
Theres no way to deal with abuse and no recourse for the abused. The place runs on ad hominems and pack psychology. It panders to the lowest common denominator, and in the end its articles are well neutered of any actual depth content or meaning. """"Neutrality"""" as a buzzword is used to emascualte a topic so that it has no political
implications or consequences. The same standing is given to a pov warrior and a pet admin as is given to a knowledgable expert. Opinion rules here, not wisdom, and not even any real form of neutrality. Wikipedia IS factually evil. The question here, is how
to go about fixing that problem. Denial won't help.

Well, enough bothering with pearls and swine for today, my """"contributions"""" file should speak for itself. I have been involved in 3 vfds since showing up, each one of which was run on ad hominems and straw man attacks. I have been blocked on trumped up charges by a pov warrior and his pet rogue admin. I have sought from every corner of Wikipedia some sort of actual problem solving process to adress patent abuses, all to no avail. Wikipedia is in fact evil, and it deserves to fail as an encylopedia unless it can
solve its problems. Unless wikipedia can figure out how to not be a mob groupthink social experiment where any idiot, fool, con artist,
or propagandist can assume equal footing with knowledge and fact,
Wikipedia is just a big fat doomed social experiment, which will die
because enough people will recognize that it is in fact evil, and go
do better and more important things with their time, like start A REAL online Encylopedia that includes logic and knowledge and truth and basic criteria for defining abuse and basic methodlogies for dealing with it.

I've been meaning to work on the page for a while, but have been preoccupied with life stuff. Many others have worked on the page while its been up and have helped with its shortcomings and many more have used the page as a resource (both are contingent on the page remaining up and accessible).

Is it possible to reinstate the page, and if not what needs to be done to make that possible?

thanks,

"Mild notoriety only within Wikipedia?

Outside of Wikipedia, it has an Alexa ranking currently of 35,000, which also far exceeds Wikitruth's of 100,000 or so.  It has been in an increasing number of news reports as well, up around 20 from reputable sources now, and the frequency of these is increasing as well.  

It is known for things outside of Wikipedia too:

1) As an example of censorship - Wikipedia has gone to pains to censor it.  This is relevant to people who have no idea what Wikipedia is, because this is a critic site that is not allowed to exist.
2) Cyber stalking, hate speech, and many other issues which Wikipedia Review has hit on, and it has been viewed by some pro-Wikipedia loyalists that Wikipedia Review is an example of these, and that it should be discussed in a context that does not include discussion of Wikipedia, or of its criticisms of Wikipedia.

It is the first and largest place for criticism of Wikipedia.  In such circumstances, notability is clearly established.

I'm happy to believe that the name """"Blackbeard"""" is used to describe a character in an upcoming movie. The issue for this article is why that is sufficiently significant to the modern cultural understanding of Blackbeard, for it to warrant inclusion in the article on the historical figure. Simply stating that Blackbeard is mentioned in a modern-day film/book/comic/play doesn't tell us anything about how the historical figure is interpreted, and risks being indiscriminate information which does little to advance our understanding of the topic. I suspect before we include the fact that Blackbeard wll be mentioned in yet another modern movie, we would need to know how this mention is of enduring cultural significance. I also doubt that the real-life Blackbeard can be presented in a historically accurate context in the otherwise fictional universe of POTC> More likely, and with all respect to Ian McShane, it is likely Blackbeard will simply be a large black-bearded pirate who has matches in his beard and says """"Yarr."""" An entertaining figure no doubt, but not one that advances this article, which is about the real-life Caribbean pirate.

I don't mean this to sound snarky, so my apologies if it comes across that way. It's just that articles like this can quickly amass extensive and fairly trivial lists of mentions, including every time the subject is even referred to in sitcoms and the like. Check out the page history from about a year ago, to see what I mean. I'd prefer not to return to simple lists of mentions, even when Blackbeard is a major character in the film/novel/comic/TV episode. Instead and for what its worth, I support Parrot's suggestion of mentioning it at the film's article, where it has apropriate context.

I'm not sure the OED is particularly helpful here, as it is very slow-moving, and often imprecise, being more concerned (from what I can tell) with describing casual usage than precision usage (and yes, I do have it; micro-print edition; I'd love to have the full-size version, but I don't have that kind of money laying around.

From the OED perspective, there """"isn't"""" any difference at all between these words other than """"jargon"""" never refers to slang.  I think a lot of people would have problems with these definitions.
Anyway, to get back to your real point, if these terms are used more interchangeably in the UK than they are in the US, there is no harm at all in making them more specific/accurate to Yankee (virtual) ears, since there won't be any effect at all on British ones, if you see what I mean.  I think this is especially true in the case of that article because most of the terms are jargon rather than slang (some are of course slangish — """"action"""", """"velcro"""", etc. — but they're in the minority"""").  And it's not that the OED-based usage of argot/patois/lingo would be wrong from an OED-based perspective, simply vague (the meaning of all three words in the the OED is basically """"slang or jargon"""".  -)  Anyway, glad we're not really arguing.

Research on Italian Somalians

I appreciate your improvements,Middayexpress. I have done some research on books about the Italian Somalians and I hope you can find what you need. 

About the catholicism in Somalia, here it is the exact words in the Tripodi book:""""Il vescovo di Mogadiscio, don Franco Filippini, dichiarava nel 1940 che vi erano circa 40.000 Somali cattolici, frutto del lavoro missionario specialmente nelle aree agricole del Giuba e dell'Uebi Scebeli"""" (my translation: the Bishop of Mogadischu, Franco Filippini, stated in 1940 that there were nearly 40,000 native Somalians of catholic faith, consequence of the missions mainly in the agricultural areas of the rivers Juba and Schebelle). If we add that there were 22,000 Italians in Somalia in that year and the aproximate population of Italian Somalia was calculated in 750,000 (there were no exact census), we have to agree to what writes Tripodi: 62,000 catholics in Italian Somalia (to whom we have to add the temporary Italian troops stationed in forts), or nearly 10% of the total population of 750,000. Of course there are other calculations of the 1940 population of Italian Somalia without the Ogaden, but most scholars agree in the 750,000 - 800,000 range.

I have written that 'The Italian Embassy calculated in 1993 that most Italian colonists used to have illegitimate children with Somali women and this fact has created a group of Italian Somalians with Italian roots, that now amount to nearly 50,000 descendants in all Somalia', because in page 38 Paolo Tripodi wrote the following:L'ambasciatore italiano considerava l'uso del concubinato un serio problema durante gli anni della colonia. Un problema che aveva generato -secondo lui- quasi 50.000 Somali con almeno un nonno o bisnonno italiano negli anni novanta. (my translation: the italian ambassador believed that the wide practice of concubinage during the colonial years had created the problem that nearly 50,000 Somalians had at least one grandfather or a greatgrandfather Italian during the nineties).

"I would agree with 115.189.224.101 that an inoperative ILS could hardly have contributed to the accident. Although the pilot was relatively inexperienced on the 777, he has close to 10,000 flying hours according to one of the reports i have read. I just refuse to believe that a pilot with that level of flying experience cant land on a runway in clear, broad daylight without automated assistance. The crash in my opinion is similar to the crash of Turkish Airlines flight 1951 where although the aircraft was a B 737 - 800, none of the 3 pilots who were in the cockpit noticed the drop in airspeed until it was too late for recovery. Wonder if we should add the Turkish Airlines crash in the list of similar accidents??",0

"""COPY OF MAIL JUST SENT TO THE WIKIEN_I LIST
In answer to the point of no legal threats - 
The legal reference was to the fact that I was
being threatened with various forms of complaint that
would need defending against, by the AFF couple, at
the same time as the block began, thus obstructing my
actions. I don't see that as a legal threat to sue
anyone. The point is one should not have personal
feuds from outside Wikipedia brought into it, and if
any harrassment that would be a wrong in the world
outside Wikipedia had been effected during the block
which it had blocked me responding to, then that
clearly would have been a legal wrong, because
Wikipedia can't opt out of the world. It is not
isolated from the existence of those factors in
society as a whole.

e.g.in the argument about Nazism that's going on here,
you are taking a position against having Nazis' target
groups put in danger, and you are doing that because
it's an outside world legal issue.

""""Wikipedia is not a democracy"""" needs quite a sharp
answer given to it. For the reason of keeping itself
in passably right relationship with the outside world,
i.e.readers, Wikipedia holds a policy on neutrality of
content. But the only way this policy genuinely exists
and is not a lie to readers, is if unconditionally
anyone who falls victim to crowd psychology can lay
claim to by right, not have to beg for by favour, any
measure that prevents a force of group numbers keeping
a bullying bias in place without having to find NPOV
ground. Now, """"laying claim to"""" anything, inherently
means being entitled to anything.

This is actually a case-study in how society emerged
from the Middle Ages. To have any credible claim to
work by any principles, a society must show they
operate reliably fairly, and to do that means that
people are entitled to it. No way out of that. Hence,
as soon as any group tries to follow any policy code
like neutral POV, immediately people are entitled to
things and all things are not dependent on favour. So,
it stands absolutely logically proved:

either * it's wrong to say to any user ever """"you'renot entitled to anything"""",

or * it's wrong to say to the public that Wikipedia has a neutrality policy that works.They can't both be right because anyone can see they contradict each other head-on. At least one must be wrong. Which is it?end of copy. Right, what this means is perfectly clear. Unless Wikipedia can answer the question I put there, """"which is it?"""", then Wikipedia is illegal. It's as simple as that, and I'm immediately posting so in every single aspie forum I belong to. I will also be asking real-life organisations to file details on it as being part of a hate campaign. The illegality is shared by every person who does not leave Wikipedia. Unless - there is an unless - unless the question is answerable. There are only 2 answers: if it's the second answer, no neutrality policy, then Wikipedia would stand obliged by its own public admission to shut down, while if it's the first answer, the mob is not in charge and people are entitled to things, then this block ends. It's as simple as that.
Now, I have a right to challenge the block and this has been the challenge. The block forms part of a group-bullying hate campaign to establish that the mob is in charge, and if that is not the case, Wikipedia has absolutely firmly no other choice than to admit that people are entitled to things, and that inherently means it is not a """"legal threat"""" to say so!!! That means being  entitled ''' to challenge any admin who claims it is. Now, people outside Wikipedia are going to see whether this has been passed on to every place for challenging blocks, and then what answers it gets.

"United Kingdom
I think the United Kingdom itself maybe be emerging to be an early 21st century super power with the US as the world hyper power. Here's the reasons for me thinking this:
Second to the US in world diplomacy
Second highest defence budget
Second largest navy in terms of tonnage
Second most power projection capability
Second largest aircraft carrier fleet with second largest aircraft carries being built after the Nimitz aircraft carriers
UN Security Council seat and founding member
Head of the Commonwealth of Nations (the largest organisation of states after the UN)
The British monarch is also Head of State of 15 other countries such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
Major player in NATO and EU
Large North Sea oil and gas production
London being one of the greatest cities in the world 
City of London being the world's main financial centre in terms of number of amount of money that passes through it each year and largest gathering of financial groups.
Pound Sterling one of the world's top currencies alongside US Dollar and Euro
Second highest growth for major developed economies after US.
Its own nuclear missiles on nuclear submarines which have joint longest range with US nuclear submarines
Largest number of over seas territories
Carried out major invasions of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. 
Was only the nation to actually invade Afghanistan and Iraq alongside US forces (Other forces came after US & UK forces had secured the countries)
Second largest force in Iraq and Afghanistan 
Leads the fight against Afghan rebels in Helmand province
Controls southern Iraq and large areas of Afghanistan
Leads NATO force in Kosovo
The leading nation in tackling global warming
A leading country in the Middle East road map to peace
Most involved in Darfur issue
Second most involved in Iran nuclear issue
Single handedly resolved Sierra Leone issue
I think since the end of the Cold War to present the United Kingdom has played the second largest role in the world after the United States, and after all the role a country plays in the world is what defines a super power. Also the United Kingdom demonstrated that it can single handedly and quickly defeat a regional power and quickly resolve a conflict when it won the Falklands War. This is more than what can be said for such countries as the United States or Former Soviet Union. After the Second World War and during the 1950s the United Kingdom was considered to be a super power because of the role it played in the world but the after effect of the Suez crisis made this disappear. The Falklands war and Thatcher-Reagen era displayed the UK was preparing to retrieve its status as being on the same level as the USA and USSR. Soon after this the Cold War ended and with no Soviet Union left to counter the United Kingdom in any way (like in the Suez crisis) the Thatcher-Reagen duo had worked and the United Kingdom set in motion activities to reclaim such a postion it had in the world that it had in the world before the Suez crisis in time for the beginning of the 21st century. The 1990s was a bit of a prelude to today and saw the United Kingdom slowly begin to prepare as being a power equal to the US and former USSR by being eager to greatly contribute to the Gulf War and and Yugoslav wars and grew more involed in Western Africa by sending troops there to resolve conflict in Sierra Leone and was testing its place as second most powerful in the world to the US and in being a semi super power again. Soon afterwards September 11th happened and the War on Terror that followed gave the United Kingdom just what it needed to reassert itself on the world stage and came just at the right time to have given the United Kingdom time to perpare and try out its future after the end of the Cold War and for the beginning of the 21st century. Today the United Kingdom is easily seen as being second most powerful on the world stage diplomatically and even militarily and could be called a semi super power. People have started to raise this issue called the British Moment in the 21st century. The United Kingdom also acts very much as a deciding force in NATO and the EU in which policy they take or their futures in whether it decides to side with the US or EU and can have an effect around the world. It also greatly influences the other 52 members of the Commonwealth of Nations which it heads by its monarch and is the largest body other than the UN. Not to mention its influence and veto power of being a permanent member of the UN Security Council.",0

"Philatelic categorization 

Hello.  Can you please bear with me re the categories as I have a massive amount of data to input.  Unfortunately, I do not have very much time to spend on the project and all my data has to be reformatted to meet Wikipedia’s tagging standard.

I have amended the categories because they lacked structure and there is need for a systematic approach.  A friend, who is a postal expert but only an occasional computer user, told me he was going round in circles trying to tie up relevant articles.  I am an IT professional and even I struggled to make any sense of the category structure.  

There should be a single root category and in this case philately is the obvious choice since that is the umbrella term for the entire pursuit.  Philately itself is a hobby or pastime or subject or whatever so it is entirely reasonable that it should also be a sub-category of those wider categories.  I found that philately had such as postage stamps, postal markings and postal history as sub-categories but philately was also a sub-category of each of those, which is nonsense and does not help new users.  Equally, similar articles such as the postage stamps of a particular country were categorised across the board instead of being allocated to a single category within a hierarchical or relative structure which non-IT people like my friend can easily navigate.

After I made a few amendments to the philatelic/postal categories, I asked my friend to try again and he found what he was looking for immediately.  This is the benefit of a structured, systematic approach.

Whereas philately is the root, it splits into two main sub-categories.  One of these is philately ‘’per se’’ which could be defined as the study of the physical aspects of stamps (e.g., watermarks, types of paper, gums, etc.).  The other aspect is the actual issue of the stamps for postal purposes and this is all done at the behest of a postal authority (on the chicken before egg principle).  Anything to do with issuing stamps and organising collection, sorting and delivery of mail is done by a postal authority which is why we believe it must rank as a main sub-category along with “physical” philately.  The term “postal authority” is a catchall for any organisation that has issued stamps and processed mail: national government, army of occupation, foreign postal agency, etc.

Having said all that, I agree that it is a good idea to categorise types of stamp independently of a country’s issues and, on that basis, “postage stamps” should be a sub-category of “philately”.  There is a clear difference between the two disciplines.  I will endeavour to make use of that difference, especially as our inputs will fall into both of those categories.

As I say, please bear with us as we have a massive input to make and it will take some time to accomplish.",0
"Look Kevin, Trouton was a very smart physicist and a fantastic experimentalist, if he for a second anticipated that his calculations would give a null result do you think that he would have devised and undertaken the experiment?

I've seen this in action on living politicians - for example a statement of fact that they are employing their spouse on public money being censored out.

To the point in hand there is ample and remarkable coverage of this man being 'most hated' in respectable printed newspapers - so put a paragraph on this phenomena.....there's actually a refusal to claim he was criticized on social media on this talk page even though a presidential candidate (h Clinton) posted on twitter in relation to it......actually *rejecting* that social media reacted to this individuals actions as it demonstrably did. No room for truth or reality on Wikipedia when it comes to living corporate figures or politicians - even when the material is making news headlines.

Internet PR - scum of the earth. IF they had been around in 1944 they'd have taken money from Hitler to groom his Wikipedia entry and 'editors' would have 'surprisingly' gone along with it.""",0

"Please don't return the article to a misleading and innaccurate title. The subject and the contents are not just about the hacking, but about the controversy over the e-mails themselves.

If there is a better title let's use that one, but this one is a clear improvement over the improperly narrow title that was being used previously.
An article's title must reflect the article contents. An effort was made to split off the controversy over the e-mails, but that was reverted.

I think Daqu is exactly right - and if not, could somebody please explain why not?

That is, why not say:
""""An involution is an element of order 2.  A Coxeter group is any group generated by finitely many involutions.""""??

If true, that lets somebody know exactly what a Coxeter group is without knowing what the word """"presentation"""" means, or (worse) having to know or accept on faith any theorems about presentations.

Then the stuff about m_ij and so on could be presented as consequences of the definition.  And those who know about presentations could then say """"Ah, yes, and in fact the class of Coxeter groups can be defined via presentations"""".

I think in general definitions should involve just as little apparatus as possible, and only involve extra machinery when that significantly shortens and simplifies what is being defined.

An easier definition should never depend on a harder definition.

Of course, if i'm wrong and this is not what a Coxeter group is, somebody please explain and give a counterexample, and thanks in advance.

Hi, thanks for contributing to the Crème caramel article. I have a few comments which I hope will help you edit this and other articles more effectively.

You have changed 'flan' to 'Flan', arguing that 'flan' is a proper noun. Do you have any evidence for that?  Why is it not a common noun like other names of dishes, e.g. pizza, roast beef, moussaka, etc.?  Do you have any reliable sources backing up your claim?

 Parting thoughts on Jmh649 RFAR 
This is getting posted on every arb's talk page and I will courtesy notify Doc J. I am appalled at how low the standards of wiki admin behavior have sunk. We've seen admins lose their bit for nothing more than one wheel war and yet here we have multiple instances of involved protections, edit wars, hounding new users, involved blocks, etc, and absolutely nothing gets done about it. Why? So Doc J can """"adjust""""? What about all his victims? What do they get?diddly squat, just like in the real world. I actually truly hope Doc J can change, but that is not what wiki history teaches us. Wiki history teaches us he will lay low until the heat dies down then steadily go back to his old ways and he'll be back at RFAR within 6-30 months from now. Just like the arb case from my day when a drafting arb came within a hair of posting sanctions on Willbeback but didn't and what happened? Will kept going on in the same old fashion and two years and countless victims later, Will loses his bit and gets banned. And Doc J gets to use a secret mentor? He'd only not disclose that person if he felt the community would not accept the mentor, such as the mentor wasn't neutral or some such reason. By not taking this case and not issuing any guidelines or admonishments, especially with several extremely weak comments by the arbs (ie, how can some of you see nothing wrong in his behavior) all AC did here was send a clear signal to admins that there are no more admin standards of behavior and admins can do whatever they want and get away with it scott free. This juxtaposed with those who lost their bit for one wheel war also shows there is no consistency at all in AC's rulings on admins. At a minimum AC should have issued a statement on unacceptable behavior rather than turning a blind eye to the RFAR. This is an unacceptable precedent for which the community and AC will pay for many times over in the future. The UN can do a better job of fixing things than wiki and AC can, and that's really sad. This is a classic case of how those committing harmful acts rationalize their behavior and others rationalize excuses on their behalf. See you at """"RFAR/Jmh649 2"""". talk """,0

"Re:How to cross-wiki images? 

Good news for you: since all the images at the Spanish wikipedia are placed in commons:. there is no need to cross reference them, you just use them! Just be careful to change Imagen with Image.

A not though on the naming of the articles. Except for provincial capitals, the default convention is to name cities and towns with their name only. If there is an ambiguity (e.i. Carlos Pellegrini is also a former-president), then you add the Province's name after a comma:
Carlos Pellegrini, Santa Fe.

OurMed
Hi! My name is Marilena Tsangaroulis and I'm on the Volunteer Committee of an online healthcare movement called """"OurMed"""".

At OurMed, we're committed to creating an interactive health site that uses a global, collaborative tool like with Wikipedia but goes an important step furtherwe verify all content by healthcare professionals like yourself.

We launched the Wikipedia version last year (OurMed's Site) , and this year we’re adding a host of important features that will make Ourmed an extensive site for unbiased and user driven clinical research/tools for physicians as well as user friendly resources for patients and consumers. You can have a peek at our new design here: (Our New Site in Development)

Although we have a section on editorials in the new site, the new one will emphasize non-commercial, unbiased informationall entirely free. The organization is governed by a non-profit Board made up of Healthcare professionals, the former head of Wikipedia, Florence Devouard, former accountant of Wikipedia Oleta McHenry and other professionals.

Here's a short video of our plans: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAqbMl1dVk

 Nixon's Enemies List 

I noticed, that you compared former User:Raphael1/Persecution of Muslims to Nixon's Enemies List and would like to note the differences:
 My article does not list enemies or Wikipedians I do not like. Instead my list documented blocks of administrators I disagree with.
 Nixon has been president of the U.S. when he compiled the list. There's a big difference, whether those in power create a list of political opponents or """"powerless citizens"""" critizise those in power (admins in this case).

 Do think Wikipedia will ever have serious competition? 

I got to thinking about this question when I was invited to join in using Google Plus, Google's answer to Facebook (which if you have not been invited already, I would love to be the one to invite you! I believe you still have to be invited by a current user, it hasnt gone totally public as far as I've noticed). We have seen Myspace get eclipsed by Facebook to where they are predicting Myspace will be shut down next year, and now we see talk that Google Plus may be the serious competition to Facebook now (and I agree, I enjoy the extras more). So, have you ever seen anything that has made you think """"wow, if someone ever did X, it could really do some damage to Wikipedia editor count or reader count"""", were you ever """"worried"""" that Conservapedia for instance might threaten Wikipedia's popularity for instance? Would there ever come a time were you would encourage the Foundation to put out tv commercial's for instance, if a serious competitor did ever cut into Wikipedia.  """,0

"Facts need to be substantiated by objective reasoning: numbers and hard evidence. No one yet has any clue as to what genes work to produce hair form and yet we here such facts, probably from the view point of some American or Western person who's most familiar dark skinned group are people with mostly recent West AFrican ancestry. And admixture with whom, themselves? As i've said we barely have an itch on the genes in the field (we may be getting closer) and i have friends who have no recent relatives with less curly or coily hair, all black skinned black people and the oldest son has almost curly hair, while the daughters don't. Also, the straight hair i see in the tropics is like that of most mammals that live in the heat, sort of rough looking, and not smooth and oily like that of Northern Eurasians, or like Penguin feathers or whatever it is on walrusses. The fact is that there are Mountains up and down East Africa (where we originate), in Northern Africa, and in West Africa, whose populations are usually less heavily pigmented than other groups (Ethiopia is familiar) possibly because of the angle of the UV rays (like elsewhere). It's unscientific to speak definitively on an issue all based on subjective posterings, ie, admixture. Further, the article isn't about admixture but what selective factors may be at play here. Unless you're aim is to tell people whose ancestors may have had nappy hair that they formerly had such, which would not be very possible at the moment let alone smooth. Again, who says the whole range has to originate from admixture instead of slow evolution of diversity (which decreases on its way to Eurasia, so you'd have to hypothesize on they instantly loose diversity in comparison with others, including Native American groups who weren't even there long enough to become depigmented.",0

"""

 The Lede altogether 
First of all, let my say I apologize for what was described as an """"uncivil"""" debate between the user """"Tippx"""" and myself.  I'm willing to work this thing out like mature adults if he is.  But the attitude of """"my way or the high way"""" comes and it's going to go nowhere and probably end the same. 

First of all, I have to say I agree 100% talk with your assessment of """"Currently the lede is too brief to do this job properly, which perhaps gives the impression that mentioning the detainee incident so prominently is giving undue focus to one particular event"""".  That's exactly the impression I got.  I felt Tippx was trying to put too much emphasizes on something controversial partly b/c at the same time, he insisted a couple facts in the Early Life section were """"overwhelmingly positive"""" as he stated. 
But forget the Early Life section for now. 

Lets talk about improving the Lede section because I agree it does need improving. It's just a bunch of short complete sentences. Which is why if you look at my edited version, I combined some to make it flow while also adding in diminutive additional facts but at the same time. I didn't make one fact override the other.  I listed basically the Key things about West's career and that was it. Nothing was more emphasized. And I actually, as you can see, came to agree that West's exit from the military did need to be mentioned but to a certain degree. While that is a Key thing in West's career, it's one of many. I listed he won this past election but also lost his first election; Listed after he retired, the jobs he took up before his first bid for election; And I did it all in chronological order.
Felt it was balanced, cited, and edited well. But ofcourse, the user reverted it and his only explanation was a different one """"sounded better"""".

But off of that, and onto how we can get it right...

First of all, I'll be clear... It's legitimate and cogent, and I'm going to insert back, the fact that former Congressman Josiah Wall was the last black Florida Congressman and also the last EXACT YEAR is substituted for """"In November 2010 he was elected as the first African-American Republican Congressman from Florida since the 1870s."""". It's not that much more lengthy and listing the exact year and the last person, who indeed was the last black Rep from Florida, I feel does no harm and doesn't for a sec take a viewer completely out of the main subject. And also, justified to just say in the """"2010 Mid-term election"""" rather than """"November 2010"""". Everyone knows our elections are in November but when a reader 15 years from now may be reading, the fact it says mid-terms will immediately thwart the curiosity of whether this subject's election triumph was in a Presidential Election year or Mid-Term year.

And it also it's rational to just put he's """"Republican Representative-elect....."""" rather than """" """"He's Representative-elect from Florida....."""" and the """"He is a member of the Republican Party"""". Those can EASILY and rationally be combined. No requisite for deliberation there.

As far as what   and (talk contribs) say about the interrogation incident. Qwurxian, your statement of """"you cannot factually state that it was due to pressure, that it was to preserve his benefits, because he was afraid of being convicted, or any other reason.....""""...... I guess one would feel we need an exact statement from West's mouth as to EXACTLY WHY then OK, I guess find a statement by him saying WHY, but one would assume it was at least two if not all three of what you mentioned by simple coherence. We'll leave that open.

And we'll leave else to be be dealt with. 

And we can figure out how to combine and get the right Lede we're looking for as well as anything else.

 About Rancière's book: The Names of History: On the Poetics of Knowledge

The book in particular does not tackle the French Ravolution in particular, since it's focusses more towards a philosophy of history direction. However it does discuss the different historiographic approaches taken by different historians in the matter of understanding and explaning of The French Revolution -particularly the works of Michellet and Furet. Therefore I would consider valuable to discuss whether to incorporate some of Rancière views, condensed in his book: """"The Names of History: On the Poetics of Knowledge"""" in this page o not.""",0
"Sorry for horning into your talk page, but I'm still drafting the remount service article and hope to do one on the remount concept as well. Early on the Army decided that it was cost-prohibitive to maintain whole herds, so they used the remount stations to house selected stallions and then contracted out with local horse breeders to provide mares. Robinson was the main headquarters once the Remount Service really got organized (after World War I), but as Montanabw pointed out the majority of the actual stations were in the West. One thing the remount service is credited with (as it was only in operation on a large scale for about 20-25 years) was an overall improvement of the quality of horses in civilian service. This was because the Army didn't (and couldn't) buy all the animals produced by the program and the breeders were allowed to keep those that didn't meet standards or were otherwise unneeded.",0

 novaseminary pov pushing,and section blanking.  So everyone is aware of his pov editing, I have copied some of his history here.  I ask other editors not to restore his versions as they are pov and section blanking.
Here is a little histoy on novaseminry. More can easily be found. I include it here to show the type of editor he is.
 
Request topic ban of User:Novaseminary for persistent disruptive editing at Douglas Tait (stuntman)
 
User:Novaseminary has tried unsuccessfully to get the Douglas Tait (stuntman) BLP deleted twice before. Here, and here. But having failed at deletion twice, for two years now, Novaseminary has also failed at WP:LETITGO. He persistently challenges the BLP's notability and threatens to start a 3rd deletion attempt. He also regularly violates WP:DE. He edit wars and disruptively edits almost on a daily basis, pushes POV, attacks other articles because they are mentioned in the BLP, creates suspect disambig stubs, insists on irrelevant or dated edits, violates OR, uses citation tags to edit war, like here, here, here and here, removes sourced quotes and attacks and fights to include and spreads unflattering and irrelevant material about the BLP's subject over several editor's objections.
 
But Novaseminary is also knowledgeable of WP rules. So knowledgeable that he uses WP to argue & defend his indefensible actions, even as he ignores all the WP rules & policies that his tendentious editing violates. He cites the rules that give him cover, and just ignores those that expose his tactics as disruptive. Recommend an immediate topic ban. Not just for the Douglas Tait (stuntman) BLP, but for all the articles sourced in the BLP. Otherwise he will just retaliate by continuing to disrupt them. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:A449:F5CE:8339:FCA2 (talk) 
 This looks like a content dispute. Have you taken this to WP:DRN as a first port of call? Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) 
Unfortunately, it's more than a content issue. It's a persistent, long-term pattern of disruptive behavior. So per WP:DDE, ANI """"may be the best first step."""" 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:A449:F5CE:8339:FCA2 (talk) 
The article would probably benefit from both these editors leaving it alone. Drmies (talk) 
Fact is, unless admins enforce it, don't count on it. Otherwise I wouldn't have had to come here. I've suggested several times that Novaseminary just take a Wikibreak from the article. He refused. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:3533:DED5:47AA:B44 (talk) 

 
I found this at WP:RFPP and have spent more time than I'm willing to admit looking through it all. 3RR violations from dynampic IPs are really disruptive, but similarly I think we can do without Noveseminary's bizarre obsession with this person. I'm going to give Novaseminary time to respond, but I strongly lean towards a topic ban for both users. – Steel 
 You know what? I'll accept that. If Novaseminary is topic banned, I'll voluntarily self-ban. My only request is that the last edit before the ban is monitored/reviewed by uninvolved 3rd party/parties to insure no Novaseminary POV. Thanks. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:3533:DED5:47AA:B44 (talk) 
I've never violated a single guideline or policy at this article. The IP seems to care more about how this person is presented favorably than about the nietrality of WP, but it tough to know what else if anything this IP has edited. This article was one of several resume-like PR/POV articles i've come across over the years. I, and others, tried to make it neutral and then kept it on my watchlist. Almost everything i've done i've discussed at talk. I have only even edited this over the last few weeks because an IP came along and removed well sourced text without discussion until posted at a NB. Novaseminary (talk) 
I would also point out, I only nominated this article for deletion once, with no consensus. I actually came across it at the first successful AfD nom made, not by me, but another editor. The IP seems to think I have had it out for this person, but I have been only one of several editors to do things the IP apparently disapproves of, but that I think comply with policy. (At one point the article cited several non-RS articles written by a single publicist, for instance.) Novaseminary (talk) 
Our IP user has agreed to a self-ban from this article providing you do the same.

 There is nothing indicating anyone being harrassed, per the descriptions given in WP:HAR
 The claim of """"disruption"""" is one-sided and removes the relevant history of how this became a dispute. I have caused no disruptionI have responded to them, as will be outlined
 The origins of this dispute are in the complaints, since verified, of longstanding racist ranting and anti-Semitic personal attacks by . That was the first disruption that I responded too, as this editor's rants were a constant disruption of the editing process and his dispicable rants were a flarant violation of WP:TALK
 I filed a complaint at WP:ANI and was told to """"shut the hell up"""" by an editor who then archived the case.
 I filed a new complaint at WP:WQA here documenting the racist rants, and Jew baiting personal attacks by . There I was falsely told by  that there was """"consensus"""" on WQA to """"let it go, even though all there was on WQA was the """"shut the hell up"""" comment"""" and more rants by . This complaint at least resulted in some recognition of the problem with this anti-Semite, and a warning to him.   
 When  continued his disruptive editing and racial/anti-Semitic taunting, including characterizing the Holocaust as the """"Holohoax,"""" I filed another WP:ANI documenting 's continued violations. ultimately this resulted in corroboration once again, and a 3 day block of the racist editor. However, in the course of what should havee beena simple case, given the glaring evidence against , there were disruptions by other editors and harrassment of me in the course of that filing. Among other things I was

  Told that my complaints against this vile racist """"looks like a bit of a hit-job, designed to get him blocked for disagreeing"""" This """"blaming the victim is where I questioned why it was that I was being charged with orchestrating a conspiracy (""""hit job"""") against a clearly racist, anti-Semitic editor. Bringing up the latent anti-Semitic undertones in that accusation is not """"harrassmentif anything, the contention that I was somehow conspiring against this editor is harrassment.
 Challenged about my complaint about the use of """"Holohoax"""", when it was quite clear to anyone taking a moment to read that it was being used in a noxious manner by  (and which is now agreed)
 Told that I was somehow violating 's """"free speech"""", when {WP:TALK]]'s first, bold faced advice is Article talk pages should not be used by editors as platforms for their personal views. I questioned if somehow anti-Semitic rants were an exception to this rule, since I was being told I was somehow impinging upon the anti-Semtic editor's rights and free speech. I still question that.
was told by user ''' AGAIN to """"shut the hell up: Can you read, Boodles? This is getting ridiculous. I told you in no uncertain terms to shut up and take the dispute off the wiki about 30 hours ago''' Bizarre complaint about forum shopping, since his first obnoxious rejection is what made it necessary.  has yet to receive any serious actions against him for his nasty personal attacks and flagrant msiuse of WP:ANI, just some pointless wrist slapping.
 Was told by  that I """"dragged most of AN/I into your personal feud"""" as if I am somehow responsible for what they posted, and as if my response to anti-Semitic attacks was """"my personal"""" issue, rather than one that should concern the Wiki community. All they needed to do, if they wished, was to review the evidence and comment.

Daniel 9:24-27 Daniel tells of the comming of the messiah Jesus. This was a prophecy and the Magi or wise men read the prophecy and identified the Mesiah well in advance. This proves that for men of faith prophecy is fact not mere speculation. Jesus told Thomas, """"more blessed is he that belives without first seeing"""". I have posted an article by Pastor David Bay for you to read which explains in detail the prophecy of Jesus's comming.

THE UNPARALLELED PRECISE PROPHECY

Daniel 9:24-26, """"Seventy weeks of years, or 490 years are decreed upon your people and upon your holy city Jerusalem, to finish and put an end to transgression, to seal up and make full the measure of sin, to purge away and make expiation and reconciliation for sin, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint a holy of holies. Know, therefore, and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem until the coming of the anointed one, a prince, shall be seven weeks of years, and sixty-two weeks of years; it shall be built again with city square and moat, but in troublous times. And after the 62 weeks of years, shall the anointed one be cut off (killed) and shall have nothing and no one belonging to and defending Him...""""

The remaining one week is found in verse 27, and refers to the last seven years of earth's history, the period which we know as the """"Great Tribulation"""".

The term """"Weeks of Years"""" was a common Jewish term. It meant literally seven (7) years. The term comes from God's commandment in Leviticus 25:3-4 to farm a piece of land for only six years, allowing it to lie fallow for the seventh. This seven-year period came to be known as a """"week of years"""". Therefore, Seventy Weeks of Years was 490 Hebrew years.

Note this prophecy contains three parts:

    1. 7 Weeks of Years (49 Hebrew Years)

    2. 62 Weeks of Years (434 Hebrew Years)

    3. 1 Week of Years (7 Hebrew Years)

At the precise point in history when the 7 + 62 Weeks of Years occurred, Israel could expect Messiah to announce Himself as Messiah. What great news! This means that Israel could not miss Messiah. All they had to do was to count, be cognizant of current events in Israel as they unfolded, and be aware of this prophecy.

This study will show us several things:

    1. Why the Wise Men knew the time for Messiah was close.

    2. Why Israel missed Messiah.

    3. How this applies to us today.

Let us now consider the meaning of the prophecy.

I. The Duration of the Prophecy

This prophecy stipulated that Messiah would be presented to Israel and would be killed after 69 weeks of years had elapsed from the specified starting point. When we multiply 69 times 7, we understand that the time involved here equals 483 Jewish years. Since the Jewish calendar contains 360 days, we can easily see that God is talking about 173,880 days. Therefore, we can expect that 173,880 days after the prophecy started, the Messiah would present Himself to Israel as Messiah-King.

II. The Starting Point of the Prophecy (Daniel 9:25a)

In this verse , God said the prophecy would begin """"from the going forth (the issuing) of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem..."""" At the time God gave Daniel this prophecy, Israel was a slave nation under Babylon; however, God had foretold that this slavery would last only 70 years. This 70-year period was rapidly coming to a close; indeed, non-Jewish history records that the Medo-Persian emperor Artaxerxes issued such a decree on March 14, 445 B.C. Therefore, precisely 173,880 days from this day should bring us to some significant event in Jesus' life which presented Him to the nation Israel as Messiah.

III. The Mathematics Of The Prophecy

A. The First Seven Weeks (49 Jewish Years)

If you study the book of Nehemiah, you will find the account of the Jewish pilgrimage to rebuild Jerusalem following King Artaxerxes' decree. The prophet Nehemiah assumed charge of this rebuilding effort, which was carried out in such extreme hardship and danger that the builders carried swords with them as they were building the walls. Thus was fulfilled precisely the prophecy in verse 25b,""""...it shall be built again with city square and moat, but in troublous times.""""

This effort began in 445 B.C. and culminated in 396 B.C., exactly 49 years, just as foretold.

B. The Second Period (62 Weeks of Years, 434 years)

Daniel 9:26 foretells that the """"anointed One"""" would come after this period and would then be killed. This wording is understood by most conservative scholars to refer to Jesus Christ, not at His birth, but at His presentation as the Messiah-Prince. (2) """"",0

You clearly know very little about the repertoire of the 10-string guitar and as little about the difference between multi-string guitars and the type of guitar that Narciso Yepes invented (which is NOT simply a multi-stringed guitar or simply a 10-stringED guitar).

It belongs under Classical Guitar, and it deserves its own definition.

Also, please educate yourself as regards the repertoire for the 10-string guitar rather than claiming stupidly and falsely that no one of any significance but Ohana ever wrote music for 10-stringed guitars. You are not informing anyone, only showing your own bias and/or ignorance.

 Crocus olivieri istanbulensis 

Dear Rivertorch,

This taxon is one on the three subspecies of Crocus olivieri.
Its correct name is Crocus olivieri Gray subsp. istanbulensis B. Mathew. I have corrected it. 

I hope the anonymous user will not change it again.

Best regards,  (To reply) 

Hi Réginald. If you hadn't arrived on the scene, I was going to ping you. I removed the Turkish image and link, since I didn't think they were germane, but I left it to you to fix the taxonomic details. Does Mathew's classification, as it appears in the article, contain all the known species of crocus?   

Hi River,
The page contains all the recorded species, but not the infraspecific taxa (i.e., the numerous subspecies). Originally Crocus olivieri subsp. istanbulensis was for this reason not included. For consistency reason including it required to mention also -as I did- the two other subspecies olivieri and balansae.
The issue is: if we want to be fully consistent we have to mention also all recorded subspecies (with their distribution as for that of C. olivieri?), among others the numerous subspecies of the variable C. biflorus. A niggling work! I am afraid that the page will become too scholastic.
Your advice about this issue?
Best regards,  (To reply) 
PS: You can find a quite complete list of species and their subspecies on the NCBI taxonomy browser. Type """"Crocus"""" in the """"search for"""" bar.  (To reply) 

Thanks for the link—that's a great resource. I don't think we should worry about its being too scholastic. My main concern would be with consistency: I'm not sure if there are comparable articles that also list all subspecies. The information about subspecies certainly should be available on Wikipedia, but should it go in the main article or in the more specific articles about each species (of which there are now only a few). I don't know.   
For consistency reasons I have added the other subspecies reported in the NCBI taxonomy and cited the source. I agree that additional paragraphs or articles should be written for the most representative species, in which a detailed description of their subspecies would then be done (as e.g. I have done in fr:Crocus).  (To reply) 
Okay. I'd be happy to help with creating new articles and refining translations, if you want to go that route. Just remember I don't know what I'm talking about ;-)    

Dear River,
I have removed again the the logo of the Sultanbeyli District Municipality, that User:Terzinator had added again to Crocus, explaining the reason for doing it (see User talk:Terzinator). Hopefully, he/she will not add it again!
Best regards,  (To reply) 
Thanks, Réginald. I don't do edit wars, so I'm glad there's someone else diligently watching the page. I see that the image appears to lack any copyright info or fair-use claims. I try to avoid any involvement with enforcement of image policies, but if it gets added again I will see if it can be deleted on those grounds.

""":::::From the diffeology article: """"Differentiable manifolds also generalize smoothness. They are normally defined as topological manifolds with an atlas, whose transition maps are smooth, which is used to pull back the differential structure"""" (emphasis mine).  The point is not whether differentiable manifolds can be defined without an atlas (I already pointed out that they can also be defined with sheaves), but that the classical definition that most mathematicians are still using is the atlas definition. Markus is correct that the choice of an atlas for a topological manifold doesn't matter, but to be a manifold I will contend that it must have some atlas. Defining the sphere as a set of zeroes is implicitly embedding the sphere into another space. It has already been pointed out several times that a topological sphere does not have a unique differentiable manifold structure. How is the differentiable manifold structure induced by the embedding, and (more to the point) how can one understand the corresponding differentiable manifold structure on a topological sphere without mentioning this embedding? Topological spaces are not equipped with embeddings a priori. That a sphere with a differentiable manifold structure has a topological embedding into euclidean space does not at all imply that the differentiable structure was induced by this embedding. -

""":: Hmm, Thinking about it, getting involved in a more elaborate argument around the question the question of rigor or lack-there-of is fairly useless. To me, the SI's dismissal of Black Mask seems like a ideal example of rigor but I suspect we'd disagree about a lot. I'll boil the general argument down to the point that the intended mission of wikipedia is producing a neuteral summary of generally agreed facts about historically significant actors, in this case the SI. The question of Debord's dictatorial control is clearly a partisan position, therefore it should hardly be presented prominently (though it's certainly a fact the many have claimed this). The split with the Nashists was *A* significant event during period of development of the Situationists. But to call it *THE* significant event is to make earlier development of group more important than the latter development. Debord and Sanguinetti's book """"The Real Split In The International"""" could just as well be called the """"fundamental split"""" if you took later Situationist developments as more important. Naturally, a neuteral account would take neither position - it could still mention one or both. 
Your claims that my lack of interest in the Nashists represent anti-Scandinavians racism might perhaps be considered another instance of your humor, perhaps? In anycase, the studies of the SI that come to mind are Sadie Plant or Len Bracken. Even Greil Marcus has some useful stuff. Indeed, in the clearly partisan Bob Black essay the introductory paragraphs still winds-up with a somewhat more balanced view of the group than the current entry here (though clearly there's still a """"revive the honor of forgotten Second Situationist Internation"""" thing going on). 
In anycase, I reviewed the history of text and it seem that the first or two paragraphs are essentially tacked-on afterwards. This explains the disjointed quality of the text as a whole - it clearly needs rewriting. 
As far as links go, certainly inclusive links are another option - it is simply that the entry would have to be vastly MORE inclusive than the present entry if you wanted to include all links to comments and critiques on the Situationists.

This is a very simple non-issue. Bagramyan enlisted into the DRA army and fought within its ranks in very crucial (and famous to Armenians) battles against the invading Turks. When you join an army, you are going to fight by its side which Bagramyan did, especially during that time when the Turks were a few km away from Yerevan. The battles (especially Sardarabad) were battles that would determine life or death of the newly established republic. What he joined, became or did after or during the fall of the DRA has nothing to do with what he did prior to it.

By the way, the amount of energy the Earth receives from the Sun is not related to its surface area; it's proportional to the solid angle it cuts out of the sphere of radiating energy from the Sun.

"I vividly remember my Elementry school days, when the other kids would shun me and not let me into their stupid little groups. The boys were all friends, as for the girls, they had two groups. One was the popular girls group, and the other was the unpopular girls group. You may think that I would at least have fitted into the unpopular girls group, but I didn't. They locked me out of their little group and wouldn't even talk to me. They teased me mercelessly and so did the popular girls group. I never got invited to any parties after 2nd grade; I never had any friends. The boys basically ignored me (until 7th grade when THEY were the ones who teased me mercelessly), while they flirted with the other girls. All the other girls would talk about was boys (when they weren't bragging to each other about thier home life). They never let me play with them, and the teacher didn't make them include me. In lunch and recess I would just sit alone or cry alone. In 6th grade one of the kids told the teacher to throw me out the window. The teacher just shook his head. Kids are cruel, and I will never, ever, NEVER forget the torture I endured as a child. Yes, I do think kids are buttheads.",0

I'm sorry to disagree but, at Wikipedia, secondary sources trump primary sources.  This seeming contradiction to your experience with academic papers actually makes perfect sense when you understand the rationale.  When you write an academic paper using primary sources, you are performing """"original research"""" based on your understanding of the sources.  Whether your work is respectable and legitimate enough to be considered by the academic community is based on some sort of peer review (usually a peer-reviewed journal or an editor at a respectable publishing company).  Wikipedia has no such mechanism for vetting submissions and so it relies on the concept of a verifiable reliable source which, in plain English, means """"a published source which has been through some kind of peer-review process"""".  If a Wikipedia editor writes text that is based primarily on primary sources, he is vulnerable to the charge of performing """"original research"""".  All we can say is """"Unknown Wikipedian X believes A, B and C based on his own interpretation of the primary sources.""""  If we cite a secondary source, at least we can say """"Published author Y asserts A, B and C based on his peer-reviewed interpretation of the primary sources.""""  There is still room to debate how reliable """"published author Y"""" is (he could represent a fringe POV, for instance).  However, in such a debate, Wikipedians bring more information from other secondary sources to either assert or refute the reliability of """"Published author Y"""".  The basic principle here is """"not published => not reliable"""".  And self-published doesn't count.    18:09""",0

 Your incorrect statements on my talk page: Urartu TH 

As was decided by Penwhale on the AE page , """"Urartu TH (talk · contribs) blocked by Sandstein for WP:NPA/WP:AGF issues separate from original request which was not actionable.""""

 I have been here for a month - Irrelevant.  Especially given lack of productivity.
 I swear I don't know anything about this """"Systemex"""" thing. - True or not your own lack of respect for WP evidenced by your curious responses is probably enough to generate support for a block.  I.E., even if you are a totally new user, you have not set about improving the encyclopedia, which is the expectation.
 I am innocent - you have made more nonconstructive statements in your brief month as Bookish than is warranted.  Further, you seem to be trolling.
 I am only being targetted since I commented on that deletion article - The block reasons seem to be a.)suspected sockpuppet, b.)non-constructive edits.  Ask yourself, do you think constructive wikipedians want others around who seek attention by writing in such an unprofessional manner.  I actually gave thought to jesting in my response on the very AfD you were reprimanded for.  I don't like being involved in a debate with a person who doesn't help others to understand his position.  Your response could have been acceptable if you had said the version of the page that you voted on is crap because the x y and z claims are so baseless that they must be a joke.  The woman has a www.imdb.com page that is referenced on the page.  It is conceivable that because of its brevity you might have been confused about its veracity and validity.  However, she is noted in the msnbc.com page that you should have seen as referenced.  There is little reason to question whether a Veronica Finn exists meeting the description on the page version you saw.  The only way to improve the encyclopedia on contestable issues is if everyone attempts to enlighten others on why changes should be made.  Saying this page is crap does not help.

"Depends what you consider nu metal bands.  Please make a list.

On the List of Nu metal musical groups, only Korn and Kittie overlap (and I didn't even add Kittie to the Alternative metal list; someone else did).  All others that overlap are filed under Instigators/Progenators (which means they aren't nu metal artists).   

 Pretty much all of them on the list are correct. However, the 'insigators' were simply some of the first Nu Metal bands. Ive listed them below:

 Deftones
 Fear Factory
 Godsmack
 Korn
 Rage Against the Machine
 System of a Down

 They are all Nu Metal bands. If there is a Alternative Metal genre, it needs defining as exactly what it is. Gothic metal's and symphonic metal's 'Sound, Constructs and Lyrics' sections make for good templates for writing down what a genre consists of.

There is another source for Tavernor on his derivation of """"plus or minus"""" 
and why he chose """"Smoot's Ear"""" for his title:
http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N43/smoot.html
This is an account by Marie Y. Thibault of Tavernor's speech at MIT 
about his book, with Smoot in attendance.

Both his Preface and his speech have similar structures concerning 
Smoot's Ear and """"plus or minus"""".
Both appear to be explanations of his choice of title.
Both open with """"+ 1 ear"""".
It's presented by Tavernor as the historical basis, i.e., the 
historical measurement as shown by the 1987 plaque, and the 
decades of paint on the bridge.
Both derive """"plus or minus"""" from """"+ 1 ear"""".
Neither states that the historical measurement was """"plus or minus"""". 
Thibault gives a direct quote from Tavernor 'The significance of
Smoot’s Ear is that is stands for an approximation, a “plus or
minus”'.
""""Smoot's Ear"""" is a component of the historical measurement,
""""+ 1 ear"""".
""""stands for"""" is clearly not an historical recounting,
but a reference to Tavernor's interpretation.
He's distinguishing the earlier """"Ear"""" from his contribution,
""""plus or minus"""".

If """"plus or minus"""" were already part of the historical record, it
wouldn't be necessary or desirable to begin with """"+ 1 ear"""".

""""Plus or minus"""" was not part of the historical record, it was
introduced (for purposes of this discussion) by Tavernor as
his interpretation, not part of the historical record.   
Tavernor's account in the Thibault article is clearer on some of 
these points than the Preface, but both seem to achieve the same 
basic end, explaining how the """"ear"""" in """"+ 1 ear"""" from the
measurement on the bridge leads to the ideas in the book, beginning
with """"plus or minus"""", i.e., uncertainty.

Tavernor isn't trying to say that his treatment was on the bridge,
nor measured on the bridge,
quite the contrary, that he took this human measurement, with a
component obviously intended to provoke, inter alia, the notion
of uncertainty, and related it to the whole history of
measurement and made a book of it.

It doesn't matter how many times Tavernor says
the bridge measures 364.4 Smoots plus/minus an Ear.
He could say it 300 times.
He might even say the length of the bridge is 360
Smoots plus or minus an ear.
That has its own truth.
These are only a couple of simple derivative forms 
out of a host of possible derivative forms.
From what are they derived?
Tavernor tells us.
He begins his Preface and book and speech on this subject with
the historical measurement, 364.4 smoots + 1 ear.

Tavernor's first reference citation within his book, for the 
Preface, which certainly seems to be the one he considers most
important, is to what he calls a corroborating interview 
http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5043041
That's the one I quoted earlier 
[ 2005-12-07 ]
""""Now how long is the Harvard Bridge if it's measured in smoots?""""
Mr. SMOOT [himself]: 
""""Three hundred and sixty-four point four, plus one ear.""""
It'd be pretty incongruous to argue that he found """"plus or minus""""
there.
Also, he repeatedly cites WP, which at the time, didn't have
""""plus or minus"""".
Contrary to my initial thoughts when his Preface was being
put forward to re-write history, that he was 
not well situated to know about this, he does make it clear 
that he carefully checked into the bridge.
He is a distinguished scholar and an architect who
happens to be in a Dept. of Sociology, who wrote a book that 
seems to be a good read.

Tavernor's Preface was cited on the 
morning of New Year's Day, 2008, as support for the edit of 
Smoot to add ±, but the Preface actually refutes the 
edit by its reference to + 1 ear.
± didn't arise on the bridge; it showed up in Tavernor's
Preface.
Tavernor quotes the 1987 plaque to that effect.

If no one can say what from Tavernor's Preface seems to a) conform 
to WP:NOR and b) support the current language of the 5 
articles, then, yes, this would be an excellent time to revert to 
something only a minor copy-edit different than the language which",0

Tips on vandalizing this article

The best way to complain about a nonexistent, vague plan to do something you can't define is to post your boring opinions on Wikipedia. It doesn't matter that the existence of any """"North American currency union"""" is part of a larger insane conspiracy theory involving Jews, aliens, and Bush doing WTCgo ahead and have a furious debate about something imaginary, muck like two nerds standing outside a comic book store arguing about whether the Hulk can beat up Superman. Under no circumstances should you worry about the war in Iraq, the repressive enforcement of American drug laws, cronyism in the Justice Department, or discrimination against homosexuals in marriage lawsissues with actual relevance to justice and prosperity in America have no place in Fictitious Debate Land. It's important that the people who obsess enough about politics to put unreadable chunks of diarrhea into Wikipedia articles about their pet political theories be the most uninformed and uninsightful people in the world regarding actual political issues.

In all seriousness: there is no North American currency union, there is no plan to create one, the only place it exists is in science fiction. It is unworthy of an article at all, and having one just shows how far Wikipedia is gone into the thrall of conspiracy theorists and obsessive autistic nerds who can't figure out what is and is not important.

""":::::: Dear Chris, It took me a while to uderstand what happened. Finally I came to a conclusion that you exploded (see your """"seen in the above insulting comments"""" which I couldn't find above, if you think they are above please quote them) because we are just from different cultures. I'm guessing (and correct me if I'm wrong) that you just don't accept the culture like mine. You say """"where you stand in your own mind with Einstein, Landau and Feynman against a world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools"""". Why do you think that """"Einstein, Landau and Feynman"""" are with me against the world? My guess: since they all are atheists who don't believe in the supernatural as you and this ironically mentioned """"world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools"""". So we offended your feelings. And we are insulting your culture.

 If I guessed right (and if I did, you won't protest since it would be to stand against your God, so you have an option not to respond) please accept my appologies since I never meant to make fun of your faith. I just don't believe it is true in a scientific sense so the offense is somehow automatic if an atheist (who is never offended by someone elses opinion on the scientific truth) discusses science with a believer. I should be taught by experience, since BB proponents are always offended by my texts and until now I'd never understood the reason, before I read Zimbardo, that is, and learned about deep feelings of those people. Deep feelings that atheits like myself don't have and that's why I've never uderstood them earlier. 

 If I'm wrong (you don't believe that there is a God) then I have to think that you are just a fool if you are feeling offended by my disagreement to a certain scientific hypothesis (actually considered by me an unscientific but to be PC we can't discuss it anymore). So suddenly the discussion became an ideological one. Advice to BB folks: state up front that you are supporting an idea that there is a God and then you won't need to feel offended since no one is going to discuss BB with you. Otherwise you'll be automatically offended by atheists like Einstein, Landau and Feynman since they don't understand fully the issue and the deep feelings that religious people have.

Calm down, don't exert pressure when you can talk in normal tone.

I suppose you have evidence for this?  The page you asked me to click says Ali knew persian and furthermore it quotes a Shia hadith which claims the following masterpiece of comedy:
Ali, then came up to the princess and asked: """"What is your name?"""" The princess replied: """"The daughter of Jahan-shah"""". Ali said: """"and so Shahr-banuyeh you will be called"""" (""""the bride of the land"""").

Do you honestly believe that?!  That claim is embarrassingly stupid.  So what evidence you have that Ali knew Persian?  And what evidence you have that Shahrbanoo, who was clearly captured by the Arabs, married Hussayn willingly? Oh, and for your good information, there is plenty of solid historical evidence that her name was Shahrbanoo, and the Arabs didn't gave her that name.  Even if and Arab knew some Persian, what are the chances they knew the difference between the double meaning of """"land/country and city"""" for """"shahr""""?  At any rate, the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo, and if her name was given by Ali to her, the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name.

"I received a notification of this discussion on my phone on my home from work. I have read the article and while it is a worthy student essay, it is not encyclopaedic in tone and as well as the editorialisng there are errors. The discussion on rotavirus immediately grabbed my attention. It's about 20 years out of date and is sourced to a 1985 paper by de Zoysa and Feachem. This publication was important and influential at the time but has long been superseded. There has been major progress in prevention of rotaviral diarrhoea in the past 15 or so years, which the article completely ignores. It has also been known for some time that improved social conditions do little to control the incidence and prevalence of viral gastroenteritis and this is why the WHO, many years ago, supported vaccine development. I'm not convinced that there is much here – once it has been updated and the editorial comments removed – that is not already covered in our other articles which include Gastroenteritis, Rotavirus and Rotavirus vaccine.  While I applaud the contributor's enthusiasm for a subject that has been the main thrust of my research in real life, I think the salient points of this article should be merged with Gastroenteritis if they are not already covered. I don't think this contribution is worthy of a stand alone article and certainly not a GA.",0

Aristotle himself called the Spartans a monarchy numerous times in the Politics.  I don't understand why you keep trying to call them a republic.  Furthermore, your comments above don't seem any improvement to me on the language in the article now, which is very clear that republics come in many shapes and sizes (in fact, limiting them all to two so-called models seems more restrictive to me than it should be).  Use of the words """"genus"""" and """"species"""", as I've remarked to you before, is a misapplication of taxonomy to political science.  It may be useful for purposes of casual analogy, but we cannot resort to it in an encyclopedia article, or we will confuse and mislead our readers.  You have yet to demonstrate that any authority refers to a government such as that current in the United Kingdom as a republic.  As noted in this paragraph, Aristotle himself describes Sparta as a monarchy  one in which the monarch held weakened powers, yes, but fundamentally part of the """"monarchy"""" category.  Your ideas have the merit of being an unusual take on republics which has given all of us cause to consider political terminology, but I am afraid your quotations, though well cited, do not appear to me to compel us to accept your two model theory of republics  it's original research, something Wikipedia is not.   20:37, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)""",0

I will not try to make excuses for my actions, nor will I try to do so for my fellow students as I do not speek for them.

"TCO take:  

1.  I agree with y'all's impressions of the article.  The major thing is to decide what should be in there and get the content.  Right now, it seems very uneven and ad hoc.  Some topics not covered at all (commercial aspects, development of big science).  Some places where they blather on about a quote wrt pure research.  I'd like a little more on the major fields themselves as subheaders, etc.  I bet any one of us would come up with something sort of different, but in any case it would be an improvement over what is in there now.  And if we toss it around, hopefully can cover each other's blind spots and be better than any one singly.  Definitely writing out an outline of topics (perhaps with approximate number of paras) would be a good starting point.

2.  If Dana is just itching to get going on footnotes, would say, why don't you go ahead and pick a format (especially if you are going to do most of the work).  I trust you to put what is best for us out there.  Only caution I would have is that if  you are quivering to redo the citations in this current article, just realize 50%+ of the content may be changing.  It's just not in the state where we have the right content and just need polishing.

 First sentence 

Hi there! Thanks for the edit, I really appreciate you helping to improve the article.
I have something to say about your edit, however, and I wanted to take you aside a moment and work this out.

The problem sort of exists with the original too, and i've been trying to think what we can do about it.
See, a sizable chunk of people still do know it as 'the alien from alien', and our job is to correct those people when they look it up.

Its a problem with the article I was planning to tackle after the xenomorph issue was settled (if it went that way). The way you have phrased it sounds like its just some uncommon secondary name, which is not ideal, but neither was the way I did it.

Basically it needs to say """"You might know this as alien, but you would be wrong"""", but in wiki language. I've hit a brick wall with how to do that. I'm hoping you might have some ideas for that.

Do you think we could work out some nice sounding way to introduce the article a bit better than it currently does?

February
By my logic, the first two meanings (lack of either a full or new moon in a month) can only occur in Februray, as the lunar cycle is 29.53 days, and the shortest non-Feburary month is 30 days.  Feburary, being 28 days (or 29 in a bissextile year), is the only month that is less than the full cycle, and that therefore can miss either a full or new moon in the month.  As the cycle from dark moon to dark moon is less than 29.53 days, it is also impossible to occur outside February.

"Hmmmm, are you suggesting stripping discussion of the pentarchy in the lead or are you suggesting different phrasing (if so what do you recommend)?
My understanding is that it was Constantinople's position that Rome objected to (which, granted was at the core of Justinian's pentarchy) but not the idea of the patriarchate system as a whole. Even so, though, it's not like Rome pulled out of future councils or in any other substantial ways severed itself from the emperor at that time. In other words, it is certainly true that there were many violent disagreements, some of which led to temporary schisms, but to my understanding Justinian's system, even if not everybody liked it, became a practical reality (one that indeed helped fuel the fire that pushed Rome further and further away).",0

"""Note from the subject book::

Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta:
«And he did not have to flatter anyone, support anyone, or manage anyone's life. His mind and intelligence were free and dwelt constantly on his service to his spiritual master. He saw his present circumstances as a preparation for a greater task before him. Despite his advanced age, he felt that he had barely begun his work. Yet he felt confident. He had his vision of a world association of devotees. It was not an idle dream, although he was not certain how it would all come about. But he knew his duty. For the present he would go on describing his vision, the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters, in articles and books. But as soon as possible he should go to the West. Westerners, he had concluded, were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding; more than his fellow Indians, they would be open to the message of the Absolute Truth. He knew he should go. And he would go-if Kṛṣṇa desired.

Abhay lived frugally in Vṛndāvana, keeping exact account of every expenditure and every receipt. He carefully kept a ledger, just as if he were running a substantial business, even though his purchases were only a little milk, a few vegetables, charcoal for cooking, bus rides, and his major expenditure, postage.
-
Abhay composed a Bengali poem, """"Vṛndāvana-bhajana."""" Its opening stanzas were especially self-reflective and personal.

I am sitting alone in Vṛndāvana-dhāma.
In this mood I am getting many realizations.
I have my wife, sons, daughters, grandsons, everything,
But I have no money, so they are a fruitless glory.
Kṛṣṇa has shown me the naked form of material nature;
By His strength it has all become tasteless to me today.
Yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ:
""""I gradually take away all the wealth of those upon whom I am merciful."""" 
How was I able to understand this mercy of the all-merciful?»

Śrīla Prabhupāda is here in the ADVANCED AGE of 61– his supporters, friends and family left him broke.

Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta another reference:

«Prabhupāda's most ambitious literary undertaking, the completion of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, was to be no less than sixty volumes. He had begun in India in 1959, and all along he had been aware that he was attempting a gigantic task at an advanced age. Now Kṛṣṇa was giving him opportunities both for writing Vedic literatures and for travelling, and he was working at an amazing pace.»

Prabhupāda is here in ADVANCED AGE of 63 starting to write his Bhaktivedanta Purports – I guess in India it was an advanced age, but not in Florida.

 Mind Pollution and Sin Star votes 

I have to take issue with your count in closing the vote on Mind Pollution. By my count there were, as you said, five votes for deletion — from myself (the nominator), BDAbramson, Mgm, KissL, and DV8 2XL — and only two votes to keep — one from Factitious, and four from sin-thetik, the article creator.

I also disagree with your count of votes for the related article, Sin Star. By my count there were five delete votes — the same five who voted to delete Mind Pollution — but you only counted four, one merge vote from Factitious, and three keep votes from sin-thetik, the article creator.

I would suggest that in the future when closing votes you check the history to determine the authorship of unsigned votes. I also think the quality and nature of the arguments presented are more important than the raw vote count. I would like to renominate these articles, but I'm not sure what the rules on that are. I guess I'll have to go read the deletion policy.

 Arbitrary omission of """"See also"""" reference to One-hitter (smoking)

Revision as of 20:43, 22 June 2011 (view source)Mjpresson (talk | contribs) (→See also: the ol' one-hitter...RIP)

This is one of over a half dozen deletions of """"See also"""" references to the One-hitter (smoking) article from various other articles, as if intending to isolate that article from readers and steer them toward joint-smoking instead.  Note the apparently taunting editing statement.  

The same editor has repeatedly deleted from cannabis articles, including this one, (a) photos of small-dosage inhalant utensils which, properly operated, mostly vaporize rather than burn cannabinoids as compared with combustion-based """"joint"""" smoking; (b) the Australian Department of Health warning against mixing with tobacco which can lead to """"unintended nicotine addiction"""" (this """"traditional"""" mixture is considered a prevalent meaning of the word """"joint"""" in Europe and some other places, and children investigating cannabis get drawn into a life-shortening habit that has nothing to do with cannabis); (c) any references to articles on wikiHow.com which accurately describe how to make one's own dosage moderation utensils; (d) any possible text describing safer, more economical procedures of cannabis consumption than hot burning cigarette papers.  (Not surprisingly the same editor, quoted above, has prosecuted this writer on Administrators' Noticeboard/Incidents for attempting to introduce such information.)

Admittedly there is a shortage of really clear, descriptive photos of one-hitter utensils available from WikiCommons, and the ones used until now, here and on articles like Cannabis smoking and One-hitter (smoking), were not ideal.  Editors are urged to find and supply illustrations that show (a) a really small crater 5.5 mm is best; (b) a long flexible drawtube so users can see what they are doing during the lighting process and get more vaporization, less combustion.

The promise inherent in the title """"Cannabis consumption"""" includes a duty to inform Wikipedia readers of utensils which (a) are cheaper in initial cost than a plug-in electric vaporizer, though the latter is best; (b) are safer to use and less wasteful of extremely expensive herbal material  than cigarette paper; (c) can be made locally """"in your garage"""" rather than purchased from monopoly corporations like Tops and Bugler; (d) can be used without adding tobacco (""""Toke pure""""), thus avoiding risk of """"unintended nicotine addiction"""".

Thanks for your intervention on this page.  I agree you're probably right to remove the lengthy footnote, but my reason for supporting your removal of the reference would be different, namely that as time goes by some information loses its topical interest and becomes more abstruse (which is, I imagine, the reason it was placed in a footnote and not in the body of the text in the first place).  I therefore appreciate your placing the information on the talk page, for you never know, a serious researcher rather than just a casual visitor who takes a general interest in primary legislation may derive genuine satisfaction in finding it there; the very distinction, I hope you will agree, that marks an encyclopaedia (which should be an extensive knowledge resource) apart from a penny guide-book.  A few points however:
You have left some external links (Blair, Kelly) which had relevance to the detailed former footnote but not to the article.
There is a balance between referencing all statements and introducing clutter.  
The bullet-point statements are accurate (and, in point of fact can be verified easily enough by looking at the linked pages).  And as to technology, if you have a way to put a reference on a footnote using the edit pages, then you are a lot cleverer than I am.
Your criticism is a little disparaging.  It may of course be both accurate and justified, but pejorative language such as yours is quite difficult to read with a constructive attitude.  Perhaps it needs charity?  May I suggest that for the sake of the average grump you adopt the style of academia (which I admire but am no part of), which is to achieve a result coming up with an improvement rather than a half-baked detraction?",0

Some Pakistani Khatris have migrated to Afghanistan (Kabul, Herat) and speak languages like Pashto, Dari, Urdu, while some Hindu and Sikh Khatris also live in Afghanistan and are involved mostly in the mercantile business.

Truth is that Khatris have been Afghanistan and nearby regions long before emegance of Pakistan. Remember that Afghanistan has had many Kshatriya rulers, see Hinduism in Afghanistan.",0

"""

The first issue here is use of use of the word """"revealed"""" religion, which was completely well sourced, but you have reverted (and again, you have also done some massive modifications without any consensus at all), to show some two theories. Your whole argument is based on one sentence from one source, while I would provide several references below. But, before that, your one source does not even contradict it being a revelation. 

From your own one source:

Page 78: """"...Guru Gobind Singh's work is best understood as the fulfillment of Guru Nanak's revelation. The Sikh organization had taken on the semblance of a State during...""""

So your own source is describing it as """"Guru Nanak's revelation"""". Now, my addition was well-sourced, and I can add here tens of other sources. But, I believe, at this point, there is no need to even share them, since your own source agrees with revelation. 

Next, you keep quoting the sentence on """"not being Prophet, but illumined soul"""". As per your own definition, """"Prophet is one who utters divinely inspired revelations, believed to have come from God"""". In this sense, since your own source says revelations, it is completely fringe and weak to consider even the """"non-Prophet"""" aspect as reliable. Especially when there are 10s of other reliable sources that also use the words """"revelations"""" and """"Prophets"""". And further, again, even in your own source, when describing """"Guru"""", the author quotes:

""""On account of his divine prerogative and attributes the Guru, though human in form, is godly in spirit. God speaks to humanity through him. God enlightens the seekers of truth through him and his word.""""

The author also states, """"Guru Gobind Singh tells Bhai Nand Lal .... (Guru is) the Light which is eternally God and represents God's Being in pure form. It is because of the consummate perfection, that God is in the Guru and the Guru is in God."""" 

So, I have not even brought it any of the other 10s of sources, and your own single source is so weak (and on the contrary, it actually supports """"revelations"""", """"God is in the Guru"""" """"God speaks to humanity through him""""). As I had said before, it is you who needs to get consensus before your massive unexplained edits that you keep performing. 

And finally, as a general advice, the fact that Sikhs consider the Gurus to be direct messengers sent by God, and the Guru Granth Sahib to be the word of God, is one of the most  basic and fundamental beliefs in Sikhism. I am surprised you are not aware of such a basic and fundamental aspect.   """,0

 Wikipedia """"Patricia Cornwell"""" page libelous, being used for felony fraud crimes 

The main Wikipedia """"Patricia Cornwell"""" page is not only libelous, defamatory, false and misleading, but it is also being used to support felony crimes of fraud and extortion. The page itself is a felony criminal act of obstruction of justice, because it uses the Wikipedia public forum to give a false report of previously committed crimes. Wikipedia contributors may face felony indictment as well as civil charges by maintaining these materials online.

Demand is hereby made that you stop these criminal acts on the Wikipedia site, and that you remove the libelous, defamatory, false, fraudulent and misleading material that violates Wikipedia's own policies.

The page is the alleged biography page for author Patricia Cornwell, a page which appears to have been seized by partisans under Cornwell's influence or on her payroll. These partisans have authored false and fraudulent material, and reject and delete factual material that displeases Cornwell.

I am Patricia Cornwell's leading biographer, and also one of many victims of crimes committed by Cornwell.

The Wikipedia main page on Cornwell is a brief piece of pro-Cornwell propaganda, which hides and falsifies her long life of multiple scandals. A large part of the page is a libelous attack on myself, with a criminally fraudulent report of the crimes Cornwell committed against me.

As shown in court filings and public documents, Cornwell hired thugs to threaten to have me illegally jailed and murdered, and funded a fraud scheme in a Southern court to try and ban my freedom of speech. Your Wikipedia page falsifies the report of these crimes, and mounts a highly personal libelous attack against me.

Patricia Cornwell is a longtime friend of the President Bush family and some FBI agents, and has used these connections to escape prosecution for a series of crimes and offenses, clearly evident in public records and court documents.

Your Wikipedia page, seemingly written under the sway of the criminal Cornwell, hides the real facts about her life. A few words of sycophantic praise for Cornwell, and then a brief section on """"Controversies"""" which ignores her actual huge history of scandals that is evident from court records and published articles, like when Cornwell was sued for stealing the private autopsy reports of murdered children and copying them nearly verbatim into her novels.

You are invited to read Cornwell's genuine biography, widely available online, """"Patricia Cornwell Biography: Crime, Bribery, Scandal and Mental Illness"""". Researchers can already have an advance copy of my upcoming biography book on Cornwell, which extensively quotes primary sources and which can background a Wikipedia article to replace the libelous propaganda you have now.

It seems the main purpose of your current short Wikipedia Cornwell """"biography"""" page is to launch a libelous attack on myself, to try and discredit my work and my upcoming major book on Cornwell.

I have tried to begin to edit out the falsehoods and fraudulent statements in your article, but the Cornwell partisans who control the Wikipedia page immediately re-installed the pro-Cornwell lies and libelous propaganda.

The specific attacks on me in your Wikipedia article, are direct propaganda in line with Cornwell's hired thugs. Regarding the specifics of these false statements:

The article accuses me of making public """"plagiarism"""" accusations about Cornwell, regarding a book that she delayed and re-wrote after my private protests. The Wikipedia statements are false, deceptive and misleading. The Wikipedia claims are propaganda, originally laid out by the Cornwell lawyers to set up the lawsuit to ban my freedom of speech, propaganda they set out in a fraudulent article that, as documents show, was planted in the Republican Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper by the Cornwell lawyers themselves. The Times-Dispatch is a newspaper closely tied to Patricia Cornwell, and the """"reporter"""" who wrote the fraudulent article never met me and never interviewed me.

The actual facts are that I publicly criticized neo-Nazi activities by Cornwell, her written threats advocating book-burning and the banning of free speech, and her demands that I be totally silent about her. The Cornwell lawyers have tried to pretend that the controversy was instead about accusations of """"plagiarism"""" after Cornwell already re-wrote her book, accusations they themselves fabricated to distract from the real issues.

The Wikipedia article sneers about the absence of major similarities between Cornwell's book and my earlier novel. But it does not disclose the fact that Cornwell re-wrote and revised her book substantially after my private protests over her announced stor",0

your requests for info
VoluntarySlave, FrancisTyers, Aaron, I have already answered most of your questions above. I won't be caught in your mind games. I have answered your questions. Intangible has. TheIndivdualist has. Answering once is enough for any of us.

As far as the big section about Proudhon: Proudhon called himself an anarchist, agreed, but could not tell the difference between anarchy and government. So we may as well include a section on Daffy Duck and his influence on the movement.

This is an article about anarchism. Not Russian anarchism. Not European anarchism. Just anarchism. So it's not a big leap to assume that American anarchism (or the anarchism of other countries) should be included.

There is more on American anarchism that needs to be in the article. These edits are just a start.

I'll find references to show how Jesus was anti-authoritarian and revolutionary and he most certainly was. I can't account for why the revolutionary direction to his desciples was not included in the article  Jesus, I didn't write it. I can imagine why, though, LOL.

You, socialist-communists just keep dominating this article like it personally belongs to you. It doesn't. You do the same thing to, or worse, stuff that you accuse other editors of doing, and then harass them to no end. Like what you are doing to Intangible right now, which I just discovered today.

One of the great things about Bayesian stats is that you can do things directly rather than indirectly, as in frequentist stats. For example, in frequentist stats you can't attach a probability to a hypothesis, so you can't talk about the probability of the hypothesis given the data. Instead, you have to mess around with the probability of the data given the hypothesis, which is not really what you want. Bayesian hypothesis testing is thus very simple in principle (though the sums may get hard in practice). You attach a prior probability to the hypothesis, multiply by the likelihood and divide by the probability of he evidence to normalise it. The point I was making was that probabilities of zero and one make poor choices as priors. (I am not saying that Bayesian stats generally has a problem with zero and one as probabilities, just when they are used as priors.) Your mention of linear models and so on suggests that you are thinking in terms of Bayesian methods of parameter estimation, whereas I was thinking in terms of Bayesian hypothesis testing. 15:28, 20",0

Ten? """"It's not clear where they came from, or just what use was made of them."""" Apart from the fact that we do know where they came from (Smolensk - are you actually reading any of this?), I couldn't have put it better myself. There is consensus.

I think this sums it up very nicely:

""""The last known use of the Mk V in battle was by units of the Red Army during the defence of Tallin against German forces in August 1941. The four Mk Vs previously operated by Estonia were used as dug-in fortifications. It is believed that they were subsequently scrapped.""""

""""In 1945, Allied troops came across two badly damaged Mk V tanks in Berlin. Photographic evidence indicates that these were survivors of the Russian Civil War and had previously been displayed as a monument in Smolensk, Russia, before being brought to Berlin after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.[6] Accounts of their active involvement in the Battle of Berlin have not been verified.""""

Fletcher is wrong about the number of vehicles, but the facts about them can be established separately. Assumptions about them cannot. We can establish 1941, but not 1945.

(Btw, at Tallin two of the Estonian vehicles moved under their own power, and two were towed into position. Info not yet published, so that is FYI only. Don't put it on Wikipedia.)

"Osteosarcoma Risk 
I have edited the statement regarding the association between neutering and osteosarcoma (OSA) because it was far stronger than the citation, or the literature in general, supports. In a single study of a single breed with a known risk for osteosarcoma far higher than most other breeds, the data showed the total lifetime exposure to sex hormones was negatively correlated with the incidence of OSA. The incidence of the disease was not statistically different between neutered and intact animals overall, though it was different between animals neutered at less than 1 year of age and intact animals. And there is no reason to suggest these findings would support a general relationship between neutering and OSA incidence in other breeds or mixed-breed dogs. Given the questionable clinical significance of the finding (intact animals actually died slightly, though not significantly, earlier than neutered animals overall) and the much more thoroughly demonstrated protective benefits of neutering on life expectancy and other kinds of cancer, I do not find this study sufficient to support a general assertion that OSA risk is a meaningful disadvantage of neutering.

 Comparison between articles, as far as notability judgments, are often inconsistent. This happens when small numbers of people respond, and for gray-area topics it can admittedly be very arbitrary which way the decisions go. I'd say this article has maybe a 25% chance of surviving this AfD nomination. Most current cryptocurrency articles clearly meets GNG criteria; while Wikipedia articles like Dogecoin attract ever-accumulating non-RS references that should doubtless be removed, its core is based on articles in the LA Times, the Guardian, CNN, NBC News, CoinDesk, and half a dozen other established news sites. Vertcoin has only one, the International Business Times, but surprisingly that was deemed sufficient to meet GNG. There is never really a """"final process"""" on Wikipedia, since a removed article can be reproposed when new coverage comes out, or an approved article can be renominated for deletion a while later (though it can be frowned upon if it's done frivolously). If it is deleted, I would wait for more clearly reliable-source coverage of the topic before trying again. There's really nowhere else that I think Reddcoin would be usefully mentioned in Wikipedia at this point, as it just doesn't seem noteworthy to independent sources. Auroracoin caught a lot of press because of its nationalistic hook, and Mazacoin kind of followed on its coattails, but other 2014-launched alt coins have needed to do something fundamentally different to attract much notice (e.g., Ethereum). Alt coins like Vertcoin and Reddcoin seem to offer almost no innovation, just minor adjustments to standard parameters, and have little purpose other than the creator and early adopters trying to make money off later investors. Reddcoin's """"use it to tip people on social media"""" comes several years after Bitcoin was used to tip people on social media. Maybe it will catch on due to better UI integration; time will tell, but it hasn't caught on in independent media so far. One way to try and game the system is to cause a quick price jump, which can be done a number of ways; IBT, ForexMagnates, and ForexMinute are prone to provide coverage even for some temporary price manipulation, and being idiotic news sources they treat any spikes as signs of popularity.

Edits by Keraunos

Hi, Keraunos. I see you added to, and rearranged, some of this article. I ameliorated some of your additions for accuracy. Below are listed my ameliorations of your edits and my reasons for them:

 You added the edit """"because the temperature of the cosmos rising toward infinity as the final singularity of the big crunch is approached will provide a potentially infinite amount of energy to power the cosmic supercomputer.""""

I take it that what you tried to explain here is the energy resource. But actually, that isn't physically accurate. The universal heat diverging to infinity doesn't provide usable energy. Where the usable energy comes from is the gravitational shear (i.e., the universe's Taublike collapses along different axes with each cycle, called Mixmaster oscillations), which provides a temperature differential across the universe whereby usable energy can be obtained. Hence, I went ahead and cut this edit of yours.

If people read further into the body of the article, under the section """"Outline of the physics of the Omega Point Theory,"""" some of this is already explained, with references provided for further research (with a number of the references available online for free).

 You added a bit into here: """"the Omega Point represents the resurrection of the dead followed by an infinite-duration afterlife as an avatar in cyberspace, which could take any imaginable form within the metaverse of the cosmic supercomputer due to its virtual nature.""""

I kept the ressurection link. I understand from reading your user page that you're into science fiction and transhumanism, but one should avoid loading up this article with needless science fiction terminology and transhumanist terminology, as well as computer terminology which isn't that accurate (such as """"avatar""""). The term preceding your edits, """"simulated reality,"""" already expresses the ideas you're getting at, and people can follow that hyperlinked text if they're not sure what that means.

 You added most of this: """"engulfed by artificially intelligent life as it approaches the point of maximum expansion, which, according to Tipler, will occur 'between 5 X 10^16 and 5 X 10^18 years from now (in proper time)'.""""

One should be more accurate in their terminology, as most people think of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as meaning intelligence via artifically created programs. Yet if uploaded human consciousnesses become a reality, then the programs of their minds would be natural, but on an artificial substrate. Hence, I'm changing this to """"From that point on, the entire visible universe would be engulfed by these 'mind children' as it approaches the point of maximum expansion,"""" with """"mind children"""" referring to the previously defined mention of the term.

I also removed your quote of Tipler's estimation as to when the universe will be engulfed, as that is from his 1994 book The Physics of Immortality, yet later cosmological observations have been able to define the Hubble shift more accurately, which is what that estimation is based on. So Tipler's current estimation is different now. For more on that, see:

F. J. Tipler, """"The structure of the world from pure numbers,"""" Reports on Progress in Physics, Vol. 68, No. 4 (April 2005), pp. 897-964. See also here. Also released as """"Feynman-Weinberg Quantum Gravity and the Extended Standard Model as a Theory of Everything,"""" arXiv:0704.3276, April 24, 2007.

 You added the section """"Criticism from string theory.""""

I kept pretty much all of this, while editing it slightly to improve the style and formatting. I changed the section title to """"Implications from string theory,"""" since Brian Greene doesn't actually offer any criticism of, or even refer to, Tipler's Omega Point Theory in Greene's book that you referenced.

This section, as it stands now, might have to go entirely, as it appears to fall under Wikipedia's rule concerning original research. As it's written, it's a valid deduction that the Omega Point singularity would be obviated if string theory disallows singularities and if string theory is true, but it's an original deduction.

 You moved the """"See also"""" section to underneath the references. You also added a number of links therein.

Based upon Wikipedia's """"Featured articles,"""" it appears that the preferred location of the """"See also"""" section is where it was previously, before the references. Hence, I moved it back. I removed the link """"metaverse,"""" because it's a science fiction term that's perfectly explainable with more acce",0

Here's a good look at the next-generation Toyota Prius. The inside word from Japan is that the '09 version of the landmark hybrid will deliver both better fuel economy and more power. Engine size increases to 1.8 liters. New batteries and refinements to the Hybrid Synergy drive — maybe even a solar panel on the roof and eventually plug-in capability — could up city economy to 80 mpg. It may not look it, but the body will be all-new, growing 1 in. wider, but getting 1 in. shorter in overall length.

 Final Words 
Hi original proposer here. I see there's pretty much no way of winning this one and bow to the overwhelming concensus. I almost give up. I like Kevlar67's suggestion regarding the spelling in articles about the NHL or any other US-centric ice hockey article. I checked around, and the spellings are """"defencemen"""" in the NHL article and probably many other places that might have a better arguement for it there. I will raise the question again in the future after I find out how """"Defens/ceman"""" is spelled (or if it is) in the inscription on the James Norris Memorial Trophy.

Hi Pigsonthewing,

As someone who has been silently observing your behaviour over the past few months on Wikipedia, I am worried by what I perceive to be a downward spiral of petty fighting, vindictiveness, childishness and bad faith on your part.

Certainly not. The alphabet has been copied """"as is"""" from Swedish, and it has been so since Mikael Agricola began writing Finnish. Fortunately the Swedish alphabet contains enough sounds like Ä and Ö that Finnish speakers didn't have to design any new letters. Then again, unused letters like Q and Å remain. The last changes to Finnish orthography with respect to the alphabet were the changes from 'C' to 'K', 'X' to 'KS', 'TZ' to 'TS' and 'W' to 'V', in the 18th and 19th century. 'C', 'X', 'Z' and 'W' remained in the alphabet but were no longer used.

For what it's worth, I suggest you refrain from pushing the """"socks"""" remarks around, as it only seems to add fuel to the matter. Given that an SPI has been opened and Checkuser denied due to Stale accounts and behaviour evidence alone, it serves no purpose to accuse him further, just as it serves no purpose for him to accuse you of stalking. No one is going to win that type of argument. Also, I suggest you stop calling cowboy """"Jake"""" from now on, as it also implies that he is someone he claims not to be. Clearly he is determined to push his case, and the only way to make it go away is that you ignore him altogether. Socks are a complex issue as they come in different forms. But if you give them enough rope, they'll eventually hang themselves with it. Challenging suspected socks non-stop is sometimes considered uncivil and may seem like a personal attack without confirmation.

"Could anyone explain me what happened on the film commentary? At the beginning Vince Vaughn started eating chips. Then Ben Stiller arrived 10 minutes after the commentary started and then started arguing with the director Rawson Marshall Thurber and even burping sometimes. After about 25 minutes Thurber becomes very annoyed with the stupidity of Ben Stiller and leaves the studio. Then both Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn did anything besides commenting the film, with Vaughn even threatening the crew at the studio. After about 40 minutes from the beginning of the commentary a woman comes in the studio and tells Ben that if he doesn't move his car it will be towed. After this both Stiller and Vaughn leave the studio with almost an hour left in the film! The two men of the studio crew then, in total embarassment, put on the commentary of There's Something about Mary. This proves the complete unprofessionality of Vaughn and Stiller. They behaved awfully, Stiller, after 5 minutes of his arrival wanted to leave and Vaughn insulted one of the studio crew members and, after Thurber went away they began criticizing him.

Roc Nation Template
Hi there ,

I'm sure you a nice person, but I would like to know the reason of why you have removed just the name of Tinchy Stryder and no other names on the Template:Roc Nation just under reason of """"Reverting edits by block-evading sockpuppeteer"""" when In fact I have been unblocked since 16 September 2011, and all the edits I have made to the Template:Roc Nation since the end of my ban have all been in good faith and correction of information and also of other WPA edits I have made from the knowledge I have on a specific WPA, have been made after my 1 month ban from the 16 August 2011 to 16 Sep 2011. So I just don't understand what you mean by """"block-evading sockpuppeteer"""" and when Tinchy Stryder's name was on the template way before I had made any edits to the template, and all I persume is that the reason why Tinchy Stryder's name was on the template in the first place was that he is a key member of Roc Nation due to him being co-owner of Roc Nation UK-based subsidiary Takeover Roc Nation record label and entertainment company, the same goes to Stargate (production team) who are the co-owners of the Roc Nation US-based StarRoc record label and publishing company. I would be grateful if you can give an explanation and if bias reverting of WPA edits, which is what this looks like in my oppinion is allowed by Wikipedia as I'm pretty sure it is not. I would like to think this is not a biased issue as I'm sure your a nice person . Thank you.   """,0

"Introduction & the article 

Hi new poster here, ive been following the article for a few weeks, I have reviewed the external links good and bad and have a few ideas.  The controversy that surrounds this organization seems to be based between nichiren shoshu(in japan) and sgi(international) with alot of the groundwork coming from japan where the organizations originated from.  After looking around and comparing to the other religions and sects, i propose we seperate the criticisms from each article and make a new article that, most likely, will be a cite war.  
  The benefit is two-fold.  First, the articles relating to each sect of buddhism talk about THAT buddhism, what they do, where they came from, etc etc, and not talk about the criticisms that anyone may have about them(similar to the anti-christianity criticism article and others).  This is the most NPOV solution i can up with.  Also, having a criticisms oriented paragraph in the intoduction seems extremely bias against an organization that promotes culture and peace(i have seen some demonstrations, nothing on a global scale or read about the political party, has anyone btw?)  Secondly, in the split article section, the details can come out a little more clearly as they arent presented on the article talking about a buddhist sect, its an article about how the sect is impacting the world.  It just seems a bit more accurate.  
  Hopefully i will have a viable solution setup after i do some more reading about editing etc... Thoughts?",0

5-Bzuk, one of the guy with i have major problems and a arbcom case opened, arrives swiftly and posed a lot of tags about the horrendous contributions

6-Ahunt 'corrected them'

7-I notice that that process has cutted out several important parts of the article i posted 

8-I add them, WITHOUT revert all the work he did. 

9-Ahunt arrives and revert my adds

10-I protest with this issue 

11-Ahunt replies me that if i don't want to be edited my contributions, then i do not post them

12-I note that this is NOT a reply on my points, but rather a bit trolling statement: he says that since everyone can edit, so every change, deletion and worsening article is accepted, while when i make edits on some articles i am reverted at will. 

13-BillCJ arrives to Akra talk page and complaint: i offensed Ahunt!

15-I request a unblock

16-John swiftly denies it.

 Ok, now you've screwed it up 

Originally the article title was under """"Constitution of May 3, 1791"""". This is the title under which it passed GA review.

There is some discussion about the name above , with alternative names suggested by an anon IP and pretty much opposed by all established editors who have been active on this article, including on bringing it up to GA.

Then however, before the discussion was concluded and any kind of consensus reached User:TCO moved the article to """"Polish constitution of May 3, 1791"""". There are several problems with this title some of which have been raised above, one big one being that it is not the name as used in most sources.

Then User:M.K moved the article to """"Polish-Lithuanian constitution of May 3, 1791"""". There are several problems with this title some of which have been raised above, one big one being that it is not the name as used in most sources. Actually this one's used in hardly ANY sources.

MK also messed with the """"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polish_constitution_of_May_3,_1791&redirect;=no """"Polish constitution of May 3, 1791""""] redirect which makes it pretty much impossible to manually move the article back to its original title without admin tools. Whether this was done deliberately as a salting or not, I have no idea.

The thing is that in order to move this article what SHOULD'VE been done is to have a proper REQUEST MOVE. Now we got a title which is not used by any sources and trouble moving it back.

Here's the break down on stats:

For """"Polish-Lithuanian constitution of May 3, 1791""""  we have 2 hits. That's right two. And one of them is Moliere's Tartuffe so I don't think particularly relevant. The other hit, from Time-Life books, doesn't even have snippet preview so we can't check whether it's actually about the topic.

For """"""""Polish constitution of May 3, 1791""""  we have 39 hits. That's thirty nine. Browsing through some of the hits, a lot of these seem to be very outdated (i.e. contemporary with the document).

For """"Constitution of May 3, 1791"""", the original title that the article passed GA under, we have  87 hits. That's eighty-seven. 

For """"Constitution of May 3"""", without the 1791,  we get 114 hits. And it looks like most, if not all, of them are in fact about this document.

So """"Constitution of May 3"""" or """"Constitution of May 3, 1791"""" greatly outnumbers other variations that have been invented here on Wikipedia. Per WP:PRIMARY, WP:NOR, and WP:NC the article should be moved back to its original title. Then if there still any doubt about what the sources call this document, someone can start a proper WP:RM.

 Inaccuracies in Modern day legacy: France 

Hello, to whomever may be watching this page. Although I have introduced myself elsewhere on Wikipedia, primarily on the SNCF page, this is my first message here. My name is Jerry Ray, and I am a consultant to SNCF, the French railway company, in Washington, DC. Last year I began reaching out to editors to help address inaccuracies related to the Holocaust in the SNCF article. Now I would like to bring editors' attention to similar issues within this article. 

As editors here will no doubt agree, this is a difficult subject, but one in which it is highly important to get the facts right. My aim here is to provide a revised version of the current """"Modern day legacy"""" section. This new version, with which I have had some assistance in researching and writing, represents an improvement in several ways. First, it presents a clearer overview of what was at stake in the Liepitz case. Second, it describes the US controversy more accurately, which was not limited to California. Third, it better describes how SNCF handled it and other viewpoints in the case, some of which is retained from the current entry. Lastly, there is a short final paragraph describing actions taken by SNCF in the modern era relating to this episode. 

Here is what I suggest:

{{Collapse|1=
France

In 2001, a lawsuit was filed against French government-owned rail company SNCF by Georges Lipietz, a Holocaust survivor, who was transported by SNCF to the Drancy internment camp in 1944. Lipietz was held at the internment camp for several months before the camp was liberated. After Lipietz's death the lawsuit was pursued by his family and in 2006 an administrative court in Toulouse ruled in favor of the Lipietz family. SNCF was ordered to pay 61,000 Euros in restitution. SNCF appealed the ruling at an administrative appeals court in Bordeaux, where in March 2007 the original ruling was overturned. According to historian Michael Marrus the court in Bordeaux """"declared the railway company had acted under the authority of the Vichy government and the German occupation"""" and as such could not be held independently liable.

Following the Lipietz trial, SNCF's involvement in World War II became the subject of attention in the United States when SNCF explored bids on rail projects in Florida and California, and SNCF's partly-owned subsidiary, Keolis Rail Services America bid on projects in Virginia and Maryland. While bidding on these rail contracts, SNCF was criticized for not formally acknowledging and apologizing for its involvement in World War II. In 2011, SNCF chairman Guillaume Pepy released a formal statement of regrets for the company's actions during World War II.{{cite news |title=SNCF, French Railro",0

searchlight has indeed been sued successfully many times. Someone has altered this fact to suggest that this isn't the case, while providing no proof. I'm changing it back.
 As a magazine, it bases itself on the one of the prime journalistsic principles of not revealing its sources. Amongst those sources have been Ray Hill, Tim Hepple, Matthew Collins, Darren Wells and Andy Sykes.  - isn't this rather contradictory!? Its sources obviously have been revealed, although I shall leave it in. """"prime journalistsic principles"""", however, is rather too complimentary-sounding for a NPOV article.
 Hepple has been discredited somewhat, but that is in no way a reflection on Searchlight's modus operandi. - no idea what's this is supposed to mean. It makes no sense without an explanation. I have therefore removed it - if whoever added want to reinsert and explain, fine.
 few minor NPOV tweaks, along with a little reprasing for better flow, and grammatical corrections (""""MP's"""", etc.). IT is still rather slangy in places, and this ought to be rewritten.

Right. Well, here's what I've done just now. 

Changed section heading """"modern philosophy"""" to """"philosophical topics"""", to move the article more in line with Lac's proposal. The text there still reads in a historical sort of way, but that shouldn't distract the presentation of the broader themes and ideas presented. A single paragraph in the philosophical topics section was transferred a section up into the historical section, under the subheading """"modern western philosophy"""".
A bit of text in the rationalism-empiricism subsection misleadingly implied that Locke was a """"naturalist"""", and Hume the first empiricist. This is obviously wrong, so I changed it.

Something problematic: the sentence """"During this era, religious philosophy did not play a large role in the struggles that occupied secular philosophy"""" is either misleading (assuming """"secular philosophy"""" to mean """"not on the face of it pertaining to issues of God, etc"""") or trivially true (assuming the same to mean """"completely non-religious philosophy""""). Assuming the former, and assuming we take """"this era"""" to mean """"the Modern era"""", it counts as a counter-example that Descartes was completely religious; that God was his one of his clear and distinct solutions to the dilemmas in the Meditations. Locke's generally secular outlook on politics had great stake in religion: the man thought atheists were not to be trusted, and was at pains to advocate religious toleration on grounds that did not have to admit the fallibility of religion. The more stark example of Berkeley, already mentioned in the text, is an understatement: it is not just his disputes with Newton, but rather, absolutely anything that Berkeley said, which could not be divorced from his religious views (including his theory of vision). Malebranche is another example. It's my impression that there wasn't a genuine """"cooling off"""" from appeals to religion until the late modern period. So I recommend the sentence be scrapped.

What do the three edits Feb. 24 have to do with the sock puppetry investigation of COI from 2006 and early 2007?  This all seems like a big stretch to formulate a grand conspiracy theory where there isn't any. Editors were aware of the COI back when it happened (years ago) and dealt with it.  The article is edited and watched closely now. 

Are the only recent edits those three attempted additions to the Barack Obama article? Hardly a high crime it seems to me.  What you're really upset about is that someone did an unfavorable (but accurate) story about how all attempts to include any mention of controversies or criticisms in the Obama article were reverted. News flash, many of us have had the exact same experience this editor had. If we block users for editing under """"false pretenses"""" so be it, but lots of editors post on other sites about their experiences here. This hardly seems like some grand scheme to bring Wikipedia to its knees.  

This check user investigation, however, and the AfD certainly look like an overeaction that only adds fuel to the fire. Klein said he asked someone to make the edits to see what would happen. He reported on the experience and those he witnessed of other attempts to edit the page that are easily viewed through the history.  This hardly seems like something worth making a federal case over. The only mischaracterization is yours: """"under false pretenses to incite a block and, through off-wiki agitation, bring disrepute on the project and trigger a major meltdown on the Obama page."""" The fact is the editor in question arranged for an attempt to make a reasonable edit to grotesquely biased article and reported on the experience.  That it's not favorable to Wikipedia is certainly cause for reflection and consideration of how we can improve our handling of issues like this in the future.  I know when something messed up is noted on another site and people here are made aware of it there's usually an effort to fix it.  That happened in this case, but the guardians of the Obama page made sure nothing changed.  So be it. If it upsets and embarasses you as it does me, do something to fix it.   """,0

Your accusations are false and malicious. You hurl accusations to justify your attempt to enhance POV editing in the article. There has indeed been bullying on the article but it has been directed AT me, not by me. You are obviously looking at this is a very biased manner. You punish Wikid for making a joke about a swine that offended The Magnificent Clean-Keeper. Yet, you punish me when I complain about horrible words being directed at me, including the repeated use of the """"F"""" word by The Magnificent Clean-Keeper towards me. There has been a great deal of harassment directed towards me, yet you totally ignore it or never looked into it. Then you make the totally false charge that I  misused mediation. That is outrageous. The mediator turned out to have a srong bias. He could not fulfill the role of an impartial mediator, in my opinion. To say that rejecting a mediator who had openly expressed a strong bias is wrongful is just more bias on your part. I agree that Wikipedia is not an advocacy site, and that is the exact point I have tried to make.

"I don't want to make a meal of the door identity question. I just want any arguments which are presented as logical arguments to be correct. Devlin pretends to present a logical argument but gives no justification for his last step. Some people thought it was obvious, some people thought it wasn't obvious. When Devlin was informed of this he suddenly began to doubt, himself. 

 In order to justify Devlin's last step you need to explain why the question of which particular door he opens (door 2 or 3) is irrelevant to the question of whether or not the car is behind door 1. You can say it is obvious, or you can write out the argument if you think it is not obvious. If you say something is obvious, but you are challenged (as Devlin was) you are obliged to fill in the details. This is not pedantry. After all, by opening door 2 or door 3 he does dramatically change the chance the car is behind door 2 or behind door 3! Some readers are uneasy here. Devlin was uneasy. Nijdam screams murder.

 The more you put in the more you get out. I don't think it's a big deal. But let's at least be clear as far as the logic is concerned.

 If you want to argue that switching gives the car with probability 2/3, then you have a very easy job. The simple solution. Switching gives the car if and only if your initial choice is a goat, probability 2/3. Combined doors: it's as if you are offered the option of exchanging door 1 for doors 2+3. 1/3 versus 2/3. Very intuitive, completely true.

 If you want to argue that switching gives the car with probability 2/3, given you chose door 1 and the host opened door 3, you have a little more work to do. You'll need somewhere to use your (natural) assumption that the host is equally likely to open either door if he has a choice. For instance, you could do the simple solution first and then say that by symmetry the conditional probabilities are the same.

 I think the whole idea that some solutions are correct and others incorrect is a waste of time. Every solution is correct in its own terms. Let's just be clear about this.

 Secondly, like it or not, everyone who is trained in elementary probability is going to figure out the conditional probability of finding a car behind door 2 given the player chose door 1 and the host opened door 3. Like it or not, the article is going to contain a heap of material on conditional solutions. On wikipedia we are not supposed to make original syntheses, but my job as a mathematician outside of wikipedia is to do this. I like to show people the synergy between simple and conditional, the easy bridges, the smart ways to avoid doing blind computations. I would also like to counter the Morgan et al. propaganda!",0

 Outline of knowledge WikiProject update - 04/02/2009 

Hi everyone.

Things are going slow again.  Where have you been?!

Maybe what you need to get you going is a little competition...

 Who are we competing with? 

Encyclopedia Britannica.  Specifically, with its Outline of knowledge (presented in its volume called the Propaedia).  Currently, they're kicking our asses.  You've really got to check out their Outline of Knowledge (available only in the encyclopedia's paper edition - not the online version).

Portals. Informally, of course, just for the fun of it.  There are around 600 portals.  We're about 100 behind them, with about 500 outlines.  Let's blow past them and leave 'em in the dust!

 Confusion in editors at large 

Now that the country outlines have been moved to the encyclopedia proper (article space), recruiting help on these is of high priority  it will soon be time to alert all relevant editors to the nature and function of these and how they relate to other country coverage on Wikipedia.

However, I've noticed instances in which editors do not understand the nature and function of outline pages, and complain that they are redundant to articles.  Well, ya.  (That's the point of an outline - to provide the essentials in a structure for greater understanding, for easy viewing and faster reading, and to provide a topical guide).  

A few editors over the years have viewed outlines as redundant to portals, not understanding the purpose and scope of outlines, nor the benefits provided by their structure and standardization.

These problems of misunderstanding need to be solved before """"going public"""", to prevent their expansion as the community's awareness of these pages increases.  Consider the response we'd get now if we announced these pages on the talk pages of 500 WikiProjects, 500 article talk pages, and placed links in 500 see also sections, etc.

That could be a nightmare.

So...

 Encyclopedic and administrative support 

I've been working on a couple things that will help alleviate confusion and hopefully reduce the need for editors to ask questions and seek advice.   They're drafts, still under construction.  Please look these over and jump in and help complete them (directly or by providing feedback):

First is an  article draft, intended to replace the current Outline article.

Next is a  on the Outline of knowledge and its outline pages.

Let me know what you think.  Do they help you understand outlines better and how to develop them on Wikipedia?  What is missing?  How can they be improved?

Late Night Live's theme music is Elana Kats-Chernin's Russian Rags, which Adams calls the """"Waltz of the Wombat"""". The previous theme was Bach's concerto for oboe, violin and orchestra in C Minor, BWV 1060: III. Allegro.

I'm going to waste my valuable time to answer your charges, because right now the world doesn't need me.  I have no clue why you refuse to add a colon so that you can indent, but I'll ignore your refusal to be a good Wikipedian, because my job isn't to convert you into a civil person.  That's your choice.  I have not participated in the Clinton article in the past because I have personal insight, and I cannot be NPOV, but I will comment herein.

Admiration for Khrushchev, a man who had nuclear missiles pointed at the United States:
""""a reformer and fascinating character..."""" page 162, My Life, hardcover.

Nikita Khrushchev was a reformer given the fact that he replaced Stalin.  He was also fascinating.  By making these statements, there is no indication that someone is a Communist.  I admire Steve Yzerman, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't make me a hockey player.

Admiration for Karl Marx:
Clinton gives an adorable story about visiting the grave of Karl Marx in London while plotting his """"conscientious objector"""" status to avoid serving his country in the Vietnam conflict.  Evidently he had a problem with putting an end to the communist-led genocide in Vietnam.

How many conscientious objectors were there to the Vietnam war?  Thousands?  I don't know the fact.  As for going to the grave of Karl Marx, it is a tourist site.  It does not make someone a communist.

There is furthermore a cute anecdote about visiting the USSR while that state was developing and distributing weapons to kill Americans in Vietnam and elsewhere, see pages 167-171, My Live, hardcover.

Cute anecdote?  I'm glad a future leader of the US visited the USSR to learn about it.  We were not at war with the USSR at the time, he had a legal visa to enter the country, he did not help build the weapons, etc.  

There are lies about Richard Nixon all throughout this book.  He accuses Nixon of being a """"segregationist"""" even though his administration started affirmative action and the Minority Business Development Agency within two months of coming into office.

I think Congress put Affirmative Action into law.  A lot of politicians in the 60's were segregationists.  And if Clinton made an error in his biography, wow, I'm pretty sure that never happened in the past.

Clinton also fails to mention that the Republicans began the civil rights movement immediately after the Civil War (during which they led the Union armies) and out-voted the Democrats on every significant piece of civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s: the civil rights acts of '57, '60, '64, '65, and '68.

After the Civil War, the Republicans were the progressive party and the Democrats were the party of the South.  Ancient History.  As for the more recent Civil Rights acts, Northern Liberals of both parties ensured the acts were passed.  And Lyndon Johnson basically flogged his party with the body of JFK to force passage of these laws.  The Southern Democrats who fought the acts are now Republicans.  Wow.

The Republicans out-voted the Democrats in favor of these bills by margins of about 20 to 25 percent despite Clinton's dishonest caricature of Republicans as """"segregationists.""""

See Above.

Moreover, he accuses Nixon of being a traitor on page 141 of My Life.  Well, at least Nixon did not abandon his country at a time of war and never criticized the United States on foreign soil.

I'm an ex-Navy officer, and I've criticized this country.  I'm glad he did.  The Vietnam war took the lives of too many kids, it was poorly run, etc. etc.  

Clinton wrote about his admiration for Hispanic people in """"My Life.""""  Recently, Al Gore went to Saudi Arabia to say that Muslims are being terrorized in the U.S. by the Bush administration.

Huh?  You see something wrong with Hispanic people?  And what's Al Gore got to do with your rant about Clinton?

But it didn't seem to bother these civil rights champions when they sent a ridiculous commando squad to seek out Elian Gonzalez, a seven-year-old LEGAL immigrant who committed no crimes while living with his family in Miami.

Discussed that.  You were wrong.

 Requested Changes 
The current version uses e.g. a BBC source for sorta dubious claims. Neither the lede nor the main text treats various crucial topics, namely
 Science of team science  Science, technology and society Sociology of scientific knowledge Science studies Sociology of knowledge
  Romanticism in science Humboldtsches Bildungsideal Humboldtian science  Positivism dispute Crucial issues, not treated at all. We have a separate stubby entry for Wissenschaft btw. 
 Research Criticism of science Protoscience Merton thesis Mertonian norms
 scholasticism Multiple discovery Heroic theory of invention and scientific development
 scientific misconduct Research ethics Crucial aspect, not treated at all so far
 Science journalism (the current section about Media perspectives is rather amateurish)
 Science Wars The Two Cultures  White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Dead white European mengender studies The controversies about female or minority perspetives, especially in the STEM fields are neither mentioned and need to be treated properly.  Wilhelm Dilthey distinction is crucial, as well Steve Woolgar and of cause Bruno Latour.
 * We Have Never Been Modern Laboratory Life Science in Action (for the record, calling books published by the Harvard University Press """"fringe"""" needs some courage ;)

That said, the current version is far from being complete. I would refer to improve the article instead of defening the status quo. If you have an issue with my sources, comment them under the reference entry.   

Science (from Latin scientia, meaning """"knowledge"""") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about nature and the universe.""""... modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by mathematics; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions.""""—J. L. Heilbron ( ) In an older and closely related meaning, """"science"""" also refers to a body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied. A practitioner of science is known as a scientist.

In modern usage, """"science"""" may refer as well to a way of pursuing or producing knowledge, not only the knowledge itself. Especially in the anglophone world """"science"""" is often restricted to those branches of study that seek to explain the phenomena of the material universe.Oxford English Dictionary The German approach of """"Wissenschaften"""" in the tradition of Humboldtian science and Humboldtian education ideal is more generic and includes all sort of scholarly endeavours with philosophy still as a common denominator. The The Two Cultures the German Positivism dispute and the US science wars refer to ongoing controversies about the role of natural sciences and the humanities. The controversies refered as well to the longstanding dominance of male White Anglo-Saxon Protestant scholars in e.g. US universities and the use of """"Dead white European men"""" as role models. It has lead to various attempts, as in gender studies to involve e.g. female or minority perspectives in science and as well a backslash defending the important role of the classics.Bernard Knox, The Oldest Dead White European Males and Other Reflections on the Classics (1993) (reprint, W.

Doing research and providing evidence
Michael, you had agreed that you would start doing research and provding evidence for your changes, but you are still making random edits without providing evidence. Please stop doing that. Your latest offences include:
 REAL Women of Canada: You changed the description fropm """"social conservative"""" to """"conservative"""". The organization's website addresses only social issues, and not economic ones, therefore it is appropriate to describe it as """"social conservative"""". If you want to change that description to """"conservative"""", you must provide evidence. 
social democracy: you included Belinda Stronach on your """"list of social democrats"""". You did this after many of us worked for months to stop you from putting this absolute nonsense into the article on her. 
Union des forces progressistes: you made changes that I had reverted even though I asked you to provide evidence. You didn't provide evidence, you just made the change to what you thought was right.

I understand what the confusion is about. But for clarity, let's clear this out: These are the contentious edits and their summaries:

 """"That feels like WP:WEASEL""""

 """"Inferred by TBA status""""

 """"To me, this says """"they're on the entry list, but we don't really believe it will happen""""

 """"Same as before""""

Crucially you only went to the talk page after making these edits. These edits were then followed 4 hours and 24 minutes later by three edits to correctly format the footnotes after you were again reverted by User:Twirlypen 2 hours 28 minutes later

 """"If this is going to be done, it should be done like this (need to make two more edits before changes are fully visible""""

Now I have two questions:

1) Can you understand why contributors could consider those first four edits as edit-warring, especially considering those summaries.

2) Why did you not indicate in your edit summary for the last two edits of that contentious set of four that you were reformatting them and thus making consistent with community opinion if that was your goal and why did you remove the content entirely in the first place if you only wanted to reformat?

I still don't think you actually broke WP:3RR because the policy clearly states a series of continuous, uninterrupted edits can be considered to be one revert. I can understand though that this is deemed to be a minor edit war.   """,0
