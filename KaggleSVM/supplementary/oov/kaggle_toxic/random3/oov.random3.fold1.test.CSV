As to which of the two versions is better, I don't like how the Library of Congress article is written, and disagree it is high-quality writing. I see nothing wrong with the article narrating the events of battle; its lack of perspective on whatever you mentioned (I'd appreciate simpler English here) is easily mended; if you take the time to do so, that is.

"The criticism from Clive James is not a critique of Ashbery so much as it is about the poetry establishment or poetry industry. James is saying that it converts promising poets like Ashbery into product factories, and that the product is deemed by the establishment to be amenable to further reshaping by the industry to suit its purposes. That's what James says, but what he is getting at, is praise for Ashbery, rather than the negative that was suggested above by Sighrik: that Ashbery could have produced more great stuff if he had not been so converted by the industry. I would say that this is an important piece of criticism on Ashbery, to the extent that those who consider themselves to be working outside the industry (oddly, this includes many university professors) have come to view Ashbery as something less than the real thing, or that he became part of the established industry because he was not a true innovator. James's suggestion is that the conventional university attitude toward Ashbery is not fair or accurate. Even though it is a bit roundabout, I would put the James critique back in the article.",0

Evidence
Admin  was admonished in the  WebEx and Min_Zhu arbcom case """"not to use his administrative tools or give warnings in content disputes in which he is involved.""""   This is evidence of recent involvement in a content dispute, where FM reinserted a WP:BLP—WP:OR—WP:ATT violation (edit summary rv guettarda was correct) without participation in talk. (Furthermore, he  continued this behaviour against another editor in an unrelated issue, which Wales said was not warranted and worthy of a bigger discussion).  He is also  blocking outside the scope of the arbcom decision, even if one incorrectly asserts that I am party to it, including blocking (17 February 2007)  for contributing to (not voting!) a  deletion discussion; this was not an article, and participation is not disallowed.  FM then removed evidence that showed he was acting inappropriately.  He also made a previous block on 20 July 2006, incorrectly citing the arbcom decision of 'associated articles', while first providing no evidence, then false evidence (diff he provided was not to Ken Ham), to justify his accusation and inappropriate block.  (Note that KillerChihuahua removed evidence from that page, claiming that it was posted by a banned user, while no one in that decision was banned from Wikipedia; therefore, the removal was inappropriate.)  

 The reason and contest of the block is obviously that the blocking admin acted inappropriately by placing a block against someone on the 'other side' of a content dispute (and removing evidence by deleting a post that was not his own) in the first place.

 Bar Association of San Francisco  

Hi, you deleted my post for the Bar Association of San Francisco.  I have permission from the author and the Bar Association to use the language from the Bar Association's website under GFDL in the post.  Should I get a confirmation e-mail from the author to you directly or should I give you the e-mail address of the author to get that confirmation?  I'm still learning the ways of wikipedia, didn't realize I needed to have a confirmation e-mail sent directly before posting!  Also I would appreciate it if you could send me the deleted post or repost it because I do not have an archived copy with all of the external news links I put in to show its notoriety.  Thanks!

  
Apologies for the delay in replying, I only just noticed your post. Essentially, there are a number of problems with the article besides the copyright infringement. The article had a promotional tone and feel, largely as a result of copying the material form the association's website. With WP articles we try to maintain a neutral point of view so it may be a better idea to write the content in your own words. The article alo didn't cite reliable sources for much of its content in order to help support the claim that the association is notable. What I'd encourage you to do is rewrite the article, in your own words, using the information from the various sources to guide you and having very little dependency on the association's own website. If you feel you still need the deleted material for this please let me know and I'll strip out the references and provide them to you. If there's anything else you feel you need, or if youb have any questions, please let me know. Many thanks, moff 

 Oxford Wikimania 2010 and Wikimedia UK v2.0 Notice 

Hi,

As a regularly contributing UK Wikipedian, we were wondering if you wanted to contribute to the Oxford bid to host the 2010 Wikimania conference. Please see here for details of how to get involved, we need all the help we can get if we are to put in a compelling bid.

We are also in the process of forming a new UK Wikimedia chapter to replace the soon to be folded old one. If you are interested in helping shape our plans, showing your support or becoming a future member or board member, please head over to the Wikimedia UK v2.0 page and let us know. We plan on holding an election in the next month to find the initial board, who will oversee the process of founding the company and accepting membership applications. They will then call an AGM to formally elect a new board who after obtaining charitable status will start the fund raising, promotion and active support for the UK Wikimedian community for which the chapter is being founded.

You may also wish to attend the next London meet-up at which both of these issues will be discussed. If you can't attend this meetup, you may want to watch Wikipedia:Meetup, for updates on future meets.

We look forward to hearing from you soon, and we send our apologies for this automated intrusion onto your talk page!

  

 Thanks

 Removal of The Mesothelioma Society 

I put a link to the The Mesothelioma Society (www.themesotheliomasociety.com). I have read about 80 sites covering mesothelioma and I thought their coverage is the best of the 80 sites. Someone removed the link, citing general Wikipedia guidelines but did not mention any specifically wrong with the site. It is clearly not a lawyer or spam site. So I have undid his deletion. If anyone believes that sites is not appropriate, I would love to hear why.

  

James, this site adds nothing of value to this article.  I see zero useful, reliable content to supplement our article. It doesn't look like anyone is linking to it from off-Wikipedia, either, (other than a comment spammer):

Neither these other associated sites sites you (or someone) added anonymously to our Fentanyl‎ and Celecoxib articles‎:

Notability of Dieagram

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

"HD DVD winning? 

The section previously stated that on January 8, 2006, at the Consumer Electronics Show, it had been said that hd dvd was ahead of bluray. however they didn't cite it. I looked and the article I cited said they were neck and neck. 
    
OK, my reasoning on the cnn article was probably weak, but it still may be true. 
Bluray's website claims to have passed hd dvd, but I doubt that that is a very reliable place to look for info. Can someone find something else or revert it back? (I don't know how to do that)

 An except of analysis from the """"supposed"""" unreliable source 

www.zimbeckchess.com
IT IS A RELIABLE SOURCE. Here is the analysis which I was simply trying to source from the page itself. Some of this is already in UON could I source that instead for the EXACT SAME CHANGE? My site, which is my lifes work as a master was deemed unreliable by non-chess players. Here is the analysis in regards to the pinksi line.
These guys wont understand it because chess is too complicated for them but lets us hope that some other strong player who cares about how low quality wikipedia chess articles are will come by and confirm that my add was reliable instead of these random non-chess players burying it in revisions. This is a public outcry for any sign of intelligent life.

Here is the analysis of the Pinski line which even a beginner should understand. This is FROM THE SITE Zimbeckchess.com which was called unreliable. Will someone please get rid of this dusty Pinksi line already?

Here it is with HOUDINI annotations and evaluations. Or is Houdini not WP:RS?

Thus, the analysis on this page is a lie with one players opinion inserted. 
www.zimbeckchess.com is where this was sourced. It was deemed unreliable because the random guy that edited wanted to war with me because he did not like what I said when I said I felt the Halloween was """"Playable"""". Don't dare play this line anyone! Someone will play this dusty Kaufman line and win a pawn by force!!! Kaufman the all knowing all seeing eye atop the pyramid and Euwe and 100 year old player who would not even be able to beat my laptop in chess. Beware the innocuous PINSKI REFUTATION THAT IS NOT REALLY A REFUTATION

Maybe if I was Carlsen this guy would stop undoing my edits and saying my """"personal website"""" was unreliable. Or maybe not! Maybe Carlsen can not edit Wikipedia. Maybe this is Carlsen in disguise!! Think of how many people RELY on wikipedia. People RELY on experts in their fiedls. But what happens when the experts get ignored?! I guess my master title in chess is toilet paper. So are my chess puzzles. My """"self-published"""" book is probably garbage. Maybe I should delete my """"personal"""" website because its not Krabbes site which this guy likes better because he likes Krabbe better than Zimbeck. In his eyes, judging Zimbeck by one comment made about the opening being playable. What this guy does not know, is theory changes and thats why they call it theory. OR ELSE WE SHOULD JUST CLOSE THIS PAGE AND ALLOW NOBODY TO EDIT IT BECAUSE IT MUST BE FACT!!! AFTER ALL SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT EVEN KNOW HOW TO PLAY CHESS THINKS A DUSTY PINSKI LINE REFUTES THE ENTIRE OPENING AND IT DOES NOT EVEN ENGAGE IN THE SACRIFICE.

Islam does intrinsically promote religious fanaticism, does promote violence and ill-feeling towards non-Muslims, does seem to spawn many terrorists, and is intrinsically hostile to concepts such as equality, tolerance, democracy and human rights.

I thought a phobia was an irrational fear of something. 

I admit that I do fear Islam, the belief system, but I don't consider this a phobia. It seems quite rational to me. I just don't want to see many more countries becoming anything like Iran, with sinners being put to death for commiting """"crimes"""" that are merely breaches of Islam.

 In response to Claude's last two posts.  Backwards of course.  Regarding NRMs - if you'll check the list, you'll see that Assemblies of God, Calvary Chapel, Foursquare, and CMA are all considered both NRMs and denominations.  Just a note.  Also true of the Vineyard Movement, of which there are many comparisons to GCA.  You're right that GCC doesn't like the denominational nametag,   but just like Vineyard many outsiders consider it to be and there is little actual semantic difference.  As far as what a movement is, a couple definitions I found were """"a diffusely organized or heterogeneous group of people or organizations tending toward or favoring a generalized common goal: the antislavery movement; the realistic movement in art."""" and """"An organized effort by supporters of a common goal: a leader of the labor movement.""""
 I say all that to say this.  Movement is a very ambiguous term, more appropriate to an idea.  You're right that GC does use the term frequently.  However, I think the best factual definition, and most suitable for our purposes and for accuracy within the title and intro, is """"GCAC is an association of churches"""".  That's what the AC in GCAC stands for.  Really, that's what we actually see in existence - churches.  Somehow we need to differentiate - I think we need to start with definiing the article as about an association of churches, because we have to pick a topic - that is one thing plaguing us at present as editors.  So let's start with something real, then trace the history of that association. and the present.
 I will re-edit the Today section.  It is not NPOV at present.  What I objected to was not the quote but rather your original sentence before it.  I was confused about the date, couldn't find it in your reference (I was in a hurry).  We need to focus on what we're doing here - we're putting facts up.  We don't need to interpret or extrapolate.  That quote from Bovenmeyer seems to be about  church leadership, with one sentence relating that to autonomy.  For that reason, while I think it should stay, it would be wrong to put that forth as the best description of the GC view of autonomy and congregational polity since neither of those is the topic.      Again, your statement isn't found in the quote.  The quote itself is fine, and appropriate - i don't see any reason that it needs a qualifier - as the quote i put above from the cong. polity article says, leadership/authority is a common integral part of cong. polity, and as we all have said there is no """"typical view"""" - if we're going to have cong. polity as a term in the GCA article, people need to go there and read it (also someone needs to put some serious work in on that article).  I don't have any problem with  deferring to leaders - i just want accuracy here.  Also note that there is a difference between an article in an official publication by one man and an official stance of the org (which is listed in several places), especially given the independence and autonomy of the churches within GCA.

Hi i have spoke before about adding my site as an External link and was told that it has no real need for the page etc. Although i now see other sites which offer the same kind of services and was wondering if you had a change of heart ?

Because of the constant """"doubt is our product"""" propaganda from the tobacco industry, the public did not fully become cognizant of the risk until thirty years after the science was solid.

 Factual error and substitution of opinion for fact concerning reconstruction of infratructure

The inference about problems in infrastructure is factually inaccurate. There is ample documentation available online, at sites such as www.enr.com (site of Engineering News-Record, the world's leading construction and engineering professional journal) and the U. S. Department of Defense news site at http://www.defendamerica.mil/, of the extent of reconstruction and new construction in Iraq, especially in remedying deterioration and neglect dating to the Saddam regime.

Northern Ireland (, Ulster Scots: Norlin Airlann) is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland[2]...

2 In common with the other constituent parts of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland is sometimes referred to as a """"country"""" (example). The UK government also refers specifically to Northern Ireland as being a """"province"""" (UK: example; NI: example) or a """"region"""" (UK: example; NI: example). Regardless of the choice of term, it is likely to be unsatisfactory and can imply a preferred political perspective:
 """"One problem must be adverted to in writing about Northern Ireland. This is the question of what name to give to the various geographical entities. These names can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences. ... some refer to Northern Ireland as a 'province'. That usage can arouse irritation particularly among nationalists, who claim the title 'province' should be properly reserved to the four historic provinces of Ireland-Ulster, Leinster, Munster, and Connacht. If I want to a label to apply to Northern Ireland I shall call it a 'region'. Unionists should find that title as acceptable as 'province': Northern Ireland appears as a region in the regional statistics of the United Kingdom published by the British government."""" - J. Whyte and G. FitzGerald, 1991, Interpreting Northern Ireland, Oxford University Press: Oxford
 """"One specific problem - in both general and particular senses - is to know what to call Northern Ireland itself: in the general sense, it is not a country, or a province, or a state - although some refer to it contemptuously as a statelet: the least controversial word appears to be jurisdiction, but this might change."""" - S. Dunn and H. Dawson, 2000, An Alphabetical Listing of Word, Name and Place in Northern Ireland and the Living Language of Conflict, Edwin Mellen Press: Lampeter
 """"Next - what noun is appropriate to Northern Ireland? 'Province' won't do since one-third of the province is on the wrong side of the border. 'State' implies more self-determination than Northern Ireland has ever had and 'country' or 'nation' are blatantly absurd. 'Colony' has overtones that would be resented by both communities and 'statelet' sounds too patronizing, though outsiders might consider it more precise than anything else; so one is left with the unsatisfactory word 'region'."""" - D. Murphy, 1979, A Place Apart, Penguin Books: London and it is situated in the north-east of the island of Ireland. It shares a border with the Republic of Ireland to the south and west. At the time of the 2001 UK Census, its population was 1,685,000, constituting between a quarter and a third of the island's total population and about 3% of the population of the United Kingdom.


Snowded, what is it that you find incorrect about this? The phrasing used is verbatium copy of how Northern Ireland is described on that 10 Downing Street webpage you keep wheeling out:""""Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom...""""
Your approach is based on a cherry picking of sources. The copy you oppose is neutral, source-based and explains the issue clearly, factually and fairly. If there are specific issues with it then critique it. Don't just say, """"I don't like it"""". rannṗáirtí anaiṫnid (coṁrá)

 What is the relevancy of his ethnicity? 
His mixture of ethnicity's is very American common bringing in the curious """"everyman"""" theme that is so quintessentially American.  This has intrigue for readers who, just as the experts, are trying to puzzle out just what drove this person to do what he did.  Astute readers are going to want to sift every clue available to them as their desire to correctly understand his motives, his personality drives their efforts.  To simply gloss over and erase out information to make him appear ethnically neutral would be both dishonest and a disservice to readers putting in some real effort to understand him. Trying to understand a serial killer, and the social fabric they navigate through is complex as it gets and any clues are appreciated.  

Is it relevant to mention he was of Italian and Filipino descent?  He was born in California which makes him American. 
His looks were such that he tended to blend in everywhere and anywhere, so yes, it is relevant.  
However, feel free to move that information deeper into the article.  
I don't understand how readers are supposed to draw the conclusion that being of Italian/ Filipino descent makes it easier to blend in.  The way the information is presented seems to form an impression that his ethnicity had something to do with his criminal actions.  My conclusion is that it is irrelevant and should be deleted. 
No, it made it easier for him to blend in in Miami.  
The following section, """"Since he was of mixed race (his mother was white, and his father, Filipino), he blended in well in the diverse Miami Beach scene"""", all looks to me like original research.  Are there any references to support that this is a published conclusion?   
Just to clarify, I don't mean the part about his parents ethnicity in and of itself (that is documented), I'm referring to the idea that it had some special advantage which helped him fit in.  From my readings on this subject his ability to fit into the Miami scene was due to his gay lifestyle more than any other factor.

"Legal Action Pending 
 
I urge you to read the long history records on the Ronald Ryan article and discussion pages. There have been defamatory and false edits against Ryan and his living family menbers. We know meatpuppets are using various fake IPs to add false material and to removal of factual material. In one of many recent disgusting edits by meatpuppet/s, Ryan was accused of having sexual relations with his own daughter. In another disgusting edit Ryan was accused of being born a homosexual. Ryan is dead but his family members are alive to take legal action against these meatpuppets. 

Ryan’s surviving members of his family will continue to correct the distorted, manipulated opinions and views of one book author Mike Richards, whilst all other referenced material is ignored, vandalized and removed. The scapegoat/excuse being used by these meatpuppets is wrong as it is outrageous. Members of the Ryan family are alive and well. 

Supporters of Ronald Ryan will forever unite on the facts of his case and execution. We will continue to contribute the facts, based on the hundreds of references that diagree with Richards personal views. Facts like: There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to prove Ryan fired a shot. 

To put it bluntly, the meatpuppets refuse to allow any contributions on the facts of the Ryan case. Their hatred for Ryan is rather sick and disturbing to say the least.

 Proposed wording on the """"generalities"""" of autoformatting 

Since the key members of the pro-autoformatting side—UC Bill and Locke Cole—have conceded that the results of the previous RfC on “son of autoformatting” would likely repeat itself if we conducted an ArbCom-sponsored RfC (∆ here), where Locke wrote , I am tempted to ask that you, Ryan, issue a declaratory judgement due to their default. I can’t help but suspect that they knew all along that the previous RfC was a fair measure of the true community consensus when Locke dragged us all to this ArbCom. However…

I instead propose that we do as Locke proposes: present autformatting to the community in a more generalized manner, not attached to any specific implementation such as UC Bill’s “son of autoformatting” as described above.

I have added the necessary qualification.  Regarding the original lead, it was a mess.

The widely used and agreed format is that for any organization listing particularly notable alumni, members, ect. in the article is OK; however, simply listing people for the sake of listing them dosen't add any meaningful content to the article as, unless the person is notable, then why would anyone else care about it.  Wikipedia is not a directly for simply listing information.  """"Notable"""" is quite universally agreed to mean that the individual is important enough to have their own entry in Wikipedia.  So if the person isn't important enough to independently warrant their own biographical page then it's simply irrelevent to list their name in the article as having once been associated with an organization.  

In regards to the above comment attempting to establish 'notability': Being mentioned in a local student run newspaper hardly counts, in its own right, as credible evidence for establishing that someone is notable enough for the rest of the world to know, or even care, who they are.  There is some precedent for establishing a chronological 'list' catagory, separate from the article itself, for long established offices or other leadership positions when that list would contain a number of notable indivduals (see above) with links to their biograpical articiles.  In such cases, there isn't much harm in filling in the list with 'non-notable' individuals for the sake of continuity.  However, in this case as this is still a very new organization and none of the names are, yet, notable it dosen't really make much sense nor does it add any meaningful content.  Perhaps is 30 years when, potentially, some former Berry leaders have gone on to notable careers such a list would be justified, but at the moment it would essentially just consitute pointless self promotion (citing the above previous concerns that this article appears to have been mostly written by those directly associated with the topic of the article).

 Harper's Island 

While the statement you refer to regarding J.D.'s death is indeed from Karim Zreik, Karim was not a producer for the episode in question.  The wound on JD is quite clearly visible here within the episode, and would not have resulted from a bludgeoning.   
Regardless of what you say he is someone who read the script, saw it happen and told the actor that he would die that way. So due to that we must honor what he said for it was the way the show was going, and not just assume that since it looks like a stab that it is. Since this site is about stating the facts you need to leave it the way it was written in the show and not put your opinionated thoughts on the matter.
 There is no reference to the script whatsoever in the blog entry, so how can one base their thought on assuming the script was read by someone who has no stake in the episode in question?  As a matter of further reference, direct from CBS, it is stated as a """"knife wound"""" here.  As such, I have again reverted the article and added the appropriate external reference.  I also ask that if you are going to continue to make edits and call into question revisions, that you register an account so that actions can be more easily tracked/disputed/resolved.     """,0

"Hi there, 
I am a new user (about two months) and live a peripatetic life, migrating from Nepal to St Paul Island, Alaska with frequent stops in Othello, Washington, where I grew up ages ago (I'm 51). I have had several 'careers' but now work as quality control and health and safety person (seasonally) for a small fish processing plant on St Paul island to finance my travels.
 
My WP editing is mostly typos and usage stuff (see slaying slews on my user page), adding links to deadend pages, and I have started participating in some AfD debates, although not many. I have created one new article, the short and rather minorly important Corfu slide.
I've had one small run-in with another editor (see Re: my copyvio tag on User talk:Noroton)regarding my mistaken blanking of an article for copyvio. I apoligized to him although I'm not sure if the article had been cleared although the notice was removed.
 
The primary reason I requested adoption was that I am looking for some direction on copyvio matters. I hit the random page button alot and also work on deadend pages and I seem to be seeing tons of stuff that violates copyright, obvious cut and paste jobs about companies or persons, usually with a link to the copyvio right at the end of the article! 
Looking at WP:CV I seem to get conflicting directions. The first box advising proposing speedy deletion and leaving the article intact, the second box (titled 'Article?') saying to revert if possible, if not then blank the page, etc.
Then I see this, '...Some cases will be false alarms. For example, if the contributor was in fact the author of the text that is published elsewhere under different terms, that does not affect their right to post it here under the GFDL. Also, sometimes you will find text elsewhere on the Web that was copied from Wikipedia. In both of these cases, it is a good idea to make a note in the talk page to discourage such false alarms in the future...,' in WP:C which would seem to allow most of the things I have tagged and/or deleted!

I have done different things at different times, deleted copyvio and left a stub if I think it notable, proposed speedy, blanked and listed (the 'Article?' option), and with one exception, my mistake which I apologized for, I haven't received any feedback + or -. I must admit that the laziness rather than the legality of it is what bothers me about this as in most cases the website and article creator are probably one and the same, but still...
Here is some examples.
 

New page, West Wisconsin Telcom is a copy from the 'about' page of, you guessed it, [Wisconsin Telcom]. The page was created in one edit by a user with no other edits and no user or talk page. 

Marriage Equality New York Inc, is copied from: here

Altoona community theatre which is copied from hereand here

What is the proper way of dealing with this?
 Propose speedy delete and leave page intact?
 No clean revert so blank and use copyvio|url=www.wwt.net/aboutus.php, and the rest of the stuff in the 'Article?' box?
 Leave it for someone else to deal with and mind my own business?

Wikipedia can be a little daunting to newcomers as there seems to be much jargon, abbreviations and references to seemingly conflicting WP pages and policies. I have no problem being bold but also don't want to be a jerk. It would be great to have someone with experience to check with on occasion.
OK, that's what I'm really wondering about right now. I have stopped doing anything about copyvio for now other than adding pages to my watch list until I get some direction on this.
Thnx,",0

That's why it should be renamed Historical portraits of jesus.   and   you both seem to be confused about the difference between historicity and historical portraits. John, you seem to think that biblical scripture is accepted as being historically accurate and Akhilleus you seem to think that the historical methods used to provide a historical portrait of Jesus are different than the historical methods used by muslim scholars to provide a historical portrait of jesus. Both of your positions are christian POV. Neutral POV here would be a secular one, and from that perspective, Islamic portraits by muslim scholars can be included. That is, unless the name of the article is changed to Christian historical portraits of Jesus. Perhaps this article should be merged with """"The Quest for the historical Jesus"""" article.   """,0

 Comments from RHB 

I am approaching this as someone who knows very little about the subject. I will give some high-level comments mainly on structure and content. There are copyediting and prose issues as well, but it is probably worthwhile to tackle the general problems before going into specifics. Before I start, one general point that you will see often in my comments is that there are at times new subjects that are suddenly introduced. Although wikilinks help, a clause or a few words of explanation would smooth the flow of reading for a person not familiar with the subject.

Background to the mission
This section seems a little long relative to the rest of the article. Unless there is a significant expansion planned for the rest of the article, I would recommend reducing this section. There are small details that do not add very much to the Augustine story, e.g., the origin of St Martin’s Church, the fair-haired slaves theory, the pope writing to various kings.
Bede is suddenly introduced without explanation.

Arrival and first efforts
The mission turning back to Rome is not explained. Is there a significance to what happened?
It says “…on the one hand… on the other hand…” but the two items mentioned do not seem to be in opposition as expected when this phrasing is used.
Augustine established first at Canterbury. Since he was the originator, it might be good to give a reason why he chose the location.
The Archbishop of Arles is suddenly introduced. Who is he? Was he based in Arles (in modern-day France) or in Kent? The existence of an Archbishop implies a significant Christian population existing on British soil. This then brings more questions to mind.
It says """"That Christmas…"""". But what year is that?
The king became a saint after his death, but the sentence may be in the wrong place. Did the king die shortly after Augustine's arrival?
In the same paragraph, some information of the existence of Christians before Augustine's arrival is given. This info should go before the discussion of Augustine's arrival.
Mellitus and Justus are suddenly introduced without explanation.
The sentence """"A theory by the historian S. Brechter…"""" is either a run-on sentence or is incomplete.

Additional work
After the first sentence describing the two episcopal sees, there is a sudden jump to after 1066 and a discussion of a cathedral. How are they linked? Also what cathedral is it? The description of the archeology seems out of place in the """"Additional work"""" section. Is it meant to show that Augustine managed to build new churches?
If Aethelbert was only the King of Kent, how was he able to summon bishops outside his realm?
There is a sudden introduction of the tonsure.

Further success
Concerning """"temples and usages"""" is that """"temples and their use""""? The """"former… latter"""" construct does not work very well here.
Concerning the quote """"whoever wishes…"""", who said that?

I would recommend reading the article out loud. I think you will find some sentence structures that seem a bit complex or difficult to understand. Following the corrections, a good copyedit/prose check is needed. I give as an example, the sentence """"As to why Pope Gregory…"""" could be made better as in """"Nothing is mentioned in the sources on why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission"""".

I hope this has been helpful.   """,0

"I had created the sock to (1) upload rare Selena pictures that are not on the Internet, with this advantage no one would suspect it to be non-free (2) I had believed that since I live in Hartford, Connecticut and at the time I was vacationing in Orlando, Florida, I thought that I wouldn't get caught (3) When I was waiting for a review, I believed that my sock would help speed up the process and promote the articles. I really didn't believe I could get caught, however, I did. I am deeply sorry to have the community distrust me again. I have taken a month to think about what I have done and I am sorry to have done this. The first time I did a sock was to promote the Selena Project, however, I was also told about Jonaboy1992 (an old name I had used before I wanted to change it). I didn't know of the rule then, however, I agree that I should have been blocked for the other user I used to help promote the project. Now looking forward, I want to come back and continue to expand numerous articles as I was doing. I had expanded two articles in one day, I also had another Selena fan helping me with the Amor Prohibido page. I was teaching him the ropes of Wikipedia. I don't mind being mentored, however, Robert is the only person who stood by me. The last two came and go. I will admit, that I have some maturing to do if not a lot... however, Wikipedia is a community of people coming together to create a comprehensive site for information. Even though I was working by myself, I did worked well with others such as the GA reviews and translating articles from Arabic Wikipedians. I hope I can come back, I know that my English isn't the best even though I am a native speaker. Not everyone is perfect, and everyone has a strength... my strength is expanding Selena articles. While growing up with a family who had loved her before she was murdered and growing up with my mother who continued to play her songs, I grew to become very intelligent in Selena information. So its very easy to me to expand articles based on her. While away, I was working on several articles on the Simple Wikipedia.

Well as for Bynes her father's surname doesn't really match either, does it? I find surnames in 2006 can be grossly misleading and don't necessarily mean much. In 1900, sure, but at this point everyone's changed their names and intermarried enough that you can't tell who is what by last name. Why wouldn't Eli's father be Jewish? He's Joseph Cross, also the father of actress Flora Cross, who is Jewish but whose mother is apparently not Eli's mother. There are seemingly a bunch of Jewish """"Cross""""'s out there, anyway. Well in the case of footnotes the point is really - the list is called a list of Jewish people - so the most important part is really whether the person themselves is """"Jewish"""". The mistake I guess many made before is thinking that the most important part was whether one of their parents or something are Jewish. I think adding a quote about Elvis' ancestry however is important since in his case it is a big stretch and it's for the most part, something that biographers added on after his death, so it would definitely be helpful. But in cases like Bynes, Lauren Storm, plenty of others it's really mostly irrelevant if they are not """"ethnically"""" fully Jewish (and besides, that can be found out in their entry), same for the other X-American lists, establishing that someone is Italian-American is good enough, for example, on List of Italian American actors, I'm sure Tina Majorino's mother isn't Italian (with Italians, unlike Jews, you can obviously tell that if someone's mother's maiden name is """"Black"""" they are most likely not Italian) but the source just calls her Italian, so that's good enough for us. Family tree stuff isn't the most important. Plus - of course - most of the quotes in the numbers for people who are half already say they are half - but I'll go over them below here. As for practicing Judaism - well of the people who are half and whose one non-Jewish parent didn't convert in the 1980s - LaBeouf was raised Jewish/practices and the source quoted says he is Cajun also, Scarlett wore a Star of David to a bunch of events, Jake Gyllenhaal was raised Jewish, and the quote says he is only Jewish on his mother's side anyway, Grey raised Jewish, Flynn's mother apparently converted, Feldman raised Jewish and the quote says his mother wasn't, Carter quote says his father is Jewish only, Bynes says she is """"Jewish"""" and we don't even know which parent (actually for the longest time Wikipedia, under someone's assumption, had """"Jewish mother"""". But this was removed once I came in and started purging these assumption games other editors played and started putting in only verified facts )), Bilson quote says she is half Italian half Jewish, ditto for Baldoni, Paxton quote says all we know, that she is Jewish (maybe her non-Jewish parent converted), Peck grew up with a Jewish single mother, he doesn't know who his biological father was and he was likely Jewish anyway, Prepon we don't know which parent, Reed's brother had a Bar Mitzvah and sources/herself have called her """"Jewish"""", Schwartzman - dunno, Sigler mother converted, Thomas raised Jewish, and the source says his father isn't anyway, Vuolo father converted, Wilson raised Jewish, I think that's about it. So, as you can see, for a large number of these, the quote already says that they aren't """"ethnically"""" all Jewish if that was relevant. OK, as for JInfo, yes, it seems to definitely fall under """"some guy's website"""". It does sometime cite sources, right? But often it doesn't. So I would say, yes, generally do not use it.  """,0

See also Wikipedia:Manual of Style (spelling).    

 Feral Dogs 
Something about what is said about feral dogs in the article doesn't match with observations on feral dogs. Actually it doesn't even match with some articles in wikipedia. E.G. the Dingo is a feral dog too and they are excellent hunters, as well as the Carolina Dogs, who even seem to have some unique hunting skills. It's also wrong to assume that feral dog packs lack the social structure of wolf packs, you should browse for """"Tuscany Dog Project"""" (thats a study concerning this topic) and the dogs there, although not completely feral, have a very complex social structure in their pack (check the german version of wikipedia if you like, there's a full article). Also wolves don't form packs on general, in Italy and in Germany as well many packs only consist of the parents, their current litter, and the litter of the last year. In Italy, there are many solitary wolves and many who only live in pairs, as well as quite a few packs of feral and semi-feral dogs who can hunt prey wolves aren't capable of and who are competing or interacting with wolves (depends on the situation). So all in all feral dogs aren't that poor.168.224.32.15  

The dingo has had thousands of years to revert back to a semi-ativistic state. Domestic dogs havent had that amount of time to become fully fledged wild animals.

While domestic dogs do form packs, there is little monogamy, cooperative hunting, or mutual puppy care.129.12.200.49  

In all cases? If known cases of adoption, care for puppies by aunts (I admit, there is no prove for care by males), monogamy and cooperative hunting. As a matter of fact, these things aren't as common among wolves as most people think. Don't you think, you generalize to much?
E.G. Erik Zimen (a famous cynologist in Europe) witnessed no monogamy in his poodle group. Observations by Eberhard Trummler and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas came to different results (the first observed dingo/wolf/dog-mixes and the latter Sibirian Huskies), as well as Guenther Bloch in his studies in Italy (two groups and one pack of near-feral dogs, mostly or entirely mongrels). You should keep in mind, that there isn't much data concerning this topic and it wouldn't be the first time that an observer didn't really observe and just judged by what he/she already thought to be true. Remember, for a long time people thought, that wolves would generally form packs with an alpha on the top and an omega on the bottom of the pack or that dogs would always search the nearness of humans, because """"they are born that way"""". Both """"Facts"""" have been proven to be wrong since at least the 80's, although they are still in the mind of many people.  

Laughter in dogs?
It seems like the whole paragraph was POV and/or derived from unreliable sources, so I commented it out for now.

 Facts 

I think I'm finally starting to get the hang of this Finding of Fact malarkey, Brad.

The scenario: Bishonen has been focusing her energies for the last few weeks on her attempt to get an editor called Nina Green banned from Wikipedia. When Bishonen realises that Nina Green is indeed going to be banned

She posts to the arbcom page in green text: FoF perfectly normal. Arbcom pages are like little rainbows.
At the end of a talk page post about the green text, Bishonen suddenly decides to refer to it as """"dye"""":  FoF Not at all forced or contrived. Lots of people refer to text as dye. Or if they don't, they should do.
Bishonen ends her post with  """"Green dye!"""" which reads as """"Green die!"""": Fof Pure coincidence. Nina Green couldn't have been further from Bishonen's mind when she wrote """"Green dye!"""". Bishonen hadn't though of Nina Green for at least 30 seconds.

FOF: This entire sequence events: Bishonen wants Nina banned, gets what she wants, posts in green text, decides to call text """"dye"""", and ends her post for no apparent reason with """"Green dye!"""" is just a random bubble of billion-to-one-coincidence. Bishonen could just have easily chosen blue text, and it would have made perfect sense to end her post with """"Blue Pigment!"""".

Martial Race
This is a British invention .Martial races are intellectually inferior people who would fight someone's war and get killed for somebody.This is one of the reasons why Pakistan invaded India 4 times .There are many martial tribes in Pakistan who assumed that they can defeat a bigger Army(indian)as one pakistani is equal to 5 Hindus.It has been proven wrong again and again.
It should be noted that Nairs never challenged the supremacy of Brahmins and Kashtriyas(Varma).They were always obedient servants who fulfilled every wish of their masters.

Faith?
Faith can mean 'complete confidence in a person or plan, etc.' Faith can also mean 'Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence'. When a theist speaks of his faith, it is argued, he refers to the latter definitions. When he wishes to assert that """"atheists have faith, too"""", the only definition that fits is the first[citation needed], but his argument implies the latter definitions, nonetheless (see equivocation).

Quite often theists have used the argument that life occurring from no life is highly improbable to the point of near impossibility. This is also the case with many of the """"proofs"""" of God such as those by Thomas Aquinas, which would also be more in line with the latter than the former.  Now while they may be wrong in their assumptions to come to the conclusion of the probability of life or the existence of God, what they are speaking about would be more in line with the latter definition that the former in their argument.  The validity of what they are saying does not impact what they """"wish to assert"""", so they may indeed be asserting both points at the same time. Perhaps a qualifier such as under a purely theological perspective would improve this paragraph.  Or change to """"the definition that usually fits within context(the only definition that fits) is the first"""". 

I could be wrong, just thought I throw out this point.198.178.190.1  """,0

"Hi, I didn't add mile, rather all the others besides US, UK, Canada; did you *READ* the four separate references as to where the mile is used in Canada?  Not everyone drives a train, but obviously trains are a very important part of the efficient, affordable bulk transportation of goods.  Whether or not they are in common use, they are there every day on Canadian railways and every race at the track.  This isn't a popularity contest, it's merely a statement of things as they exist in certain aspects of transportation in Canada.  If one wants to conduct a locomotive on a Canadian railroad, they had better learn about the mile and the foot or they will have a hard time getting a job.

Also, would like to point out that the nautical mile and thousands of feet of altitude are also used exclusively in Canadian airspace; this practice is so prevalent it has spread to one of the most metric countries in the world:  Russia.

So there are definitely sectors where these units dominate, pop culture aside, and they need to be reported as such.  Canada probably shouldn't be the first listing as the mile is only used in specialized sectors.  Perhaps hearer to the end along with Puerto Rico and Turks & Caicos?  I just left Canada after US UK and put the rest in ABC order because it took a long time to find all those references.  Feel free to reorder and otherwise clean it up however you see fit.  I also have US Territories (and British?) interspersed with actual independent nations; they should probably be separated.",0

The Wallace line demarcates biogeographical continents, which to a large extent coincide with the geological continents. On those grounds, East Timor is not a part of Asia. On the other hand, it seems that geopolitically East Timor is considered a part of Asia.
There are two problems I see with your position.
Firstly, Oceania is a geopolitical continent, not a biogeographic or geological one. From the geopolitical point of view, East Timor is in Asia. From any other point of view, Oceania doesn't exist. Either way, East Timor is not a part of Oceania.
Secondly, reputable sources have been presented, which state straight out that East Timor is in Asia. They may not state their criteria, but they are unambiguous in their position. You, on the other hand, are unable to present any sources, and are relying entirely upon reasoning. I salute your reasoning, but the fact is the sources win.

The inclusion of 'high-accuracy' was a reluctant compromise, following the suggestion by Paine for 'fair-accuracy'. My approach is to remove calculus entirely from mention, given that there is no supporting evidence that it does anything remotely close to solving the paradoxes  when considering the infinite orders of magnitudes below the Planck length, that calculus spans, but which cannot be proved via experimental evidence as being at all relevant.

So, what proof do you have that calculus actually tracks the movement of physical things? None, beyond some crude classical approximations. Perhaps then the article should reflect that fact. Please feel free to replace 'high-accuracy' with low, or rough, or crude, take your pick. 

From the Wikipedia: """"The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material.[1] All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable, published source using an inline citation.""""

Can someone clarify the dates and modify the dates in the relevant articles please? Vulcans and Victors must have been operational in 1982.

                                                       HOW OBAMA AND ACORN STOLE THE ELECTION OF 2008

Overview:
Presently, ACORN is under FBI investigation for massive voter fraud and other serious  crimes in connection to the 2008 presidential election directly concerning Barack Obama  who was one of its principles. It's a matter we take very seriously,"""" FBI spokeswoman  Bridget Patton told the Associated Press. """"It is against the law to register someone to  vote who does not fall within the parameters to vote, or to put someone on there  falsely."""" 

Acorn is the largest of a plethora of radical left wing groups with more than 1,200  neighborhood chapters in 110 cities across the country with a national budget of $37  million who's sole purpose was to suddenly prior to the election spring into action  after quietly building up over the years to gerrymander the 2008 presidential election  through massive voter fraud. However, they claim to be nonpartisan but are radically  left wing with actual communist memberships. Most of their funding comes from U.S.  government grants. Further, to that end their intentions were to bring in and harbor  hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens from various countries and placing them in HUD  public housing and """"choice"""" voucher programs awarding free houses to illegal aliens at  taxpayer expense while wantonly neglecting the disabled who desperately needed housing  thereto. This was coerced into action through legal threats to these agencies citing  civil rights laws. 

Through these intimidations, using civil rights laws it further precipitated first the  collapse of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when these impossible  mortgages collapsed in the fall of 2008 along with the other forced """"minority"""" bad loans  at HUD which led to the collapse of the mortgage industry starting a domino effect that  led to the failing of all top five investment banks on wall street and the mess we are  in today in February 2009. The government initiated """"bailouts"""" (really government  theft) and gifted itself nearly ten trillion dollars in """"stimulus packages"""" as an  excuse to fix this smaller two hundred billion dollar bad mortgage problem. Most of  this on debt to China who has precipitated this by pegging the dollar and implementing  grossly unfair trade practices initiating monstrous trade deficits and debt we will  never rise above. Although President George Bush(R) played his share in ridiculous  deregulation, ACORN with backing from Barney Frank(D) the chairman of the House  Financial Services Committee which oversees housing and banking industries really  initiated the whole debacle by forcing these ridiculous minority loans.  

The case details: 
95% of polled U.S. citizens object to illegal immigration and open boarders.  Nonetheles, Maricopa County Arizona is a microcosm, analogues to how the influx of  illegal and legal immigration is causing huge population increases raising serious  questions about their rising undue influence upon our elections, particularly the  election of Barack Obama of late and the fairness, legality and constitutionality  thereof as assessed by CNN and announced by prime-time television CNN anchor Lou Dobbs  upon his analysis of the latest census figures ramifications. Such is the case because  in Maricopa County, much like other counties in the United States population not  citizenship determines voting districts. And there's clear, mounting evidence that  both illegal and legal aliens are replacing long time residence and partisans using  people that can't vote as """"filler people"""" to fill up the extra people needed to make up  a given district along with the people that favor their political party. Such is  particularly the case because the census figures don't distinguish the difference  between legal and illegal aliens and most of the illegals are coming across the border  from Mexico who is actively investing in and interfering in our electoral process.  v=8oTQoZifckU&feature;=related 

Polls in Mexico indicate that the majority favored Obama and the election results  showed clearly that such """"minority"""" voters such as """"Hispanic"""" and """"African American""""  voters overwhelmingly voted for him and clearly won the election for Obama.

Lede
 Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section, the lede of this article adequately defines the Osvetnik submarine class, establishes the submarine class' necessary context, and explains why this submarine class is otherwise notable. 
 The info box for the submarine class is beautifully formatted and its content is sourced within the prose of the text and by the referenced cited therein.
 As I stated in the articles for the two Osvetnik class submarines, is there no free image of an Osvetnik class submarine for the info box? This is not a deal breaker for GA, but it would certainly add to the article's aesthetics.
 Could one more sentence be added to the lede regarding the distinguishing design features of the Osvetnik class submarines?
 The lede is otherwise well-written, consists of content that is adequately sourced and verifiable, and I have no other comments or questions for this section.

Description and construction
 I suggest starting out the first paragraph of this section by explicitly naming the Osvetnik class.
 While this is a separate matter from this article and its GA qualifications, are there plans in the works to craft an article on the Simonot design?
 Should Maschinenfabrik be spelled out either in parentheses after """"MAN"""" or with """"MAN"""" in parentheses after Maschinenfabrik?
 The section is otherwise well-written, consists of content that is adequately sourced and verifiable, and I have no other comments or questions for this section.

Service history
 I suggest adding a comma after """"On 14 September 1943.""""
 On 10 April, Osvetnik and Hrabri received orders for an operation, but operation did not proceed. Is this because they were subsequently captured by the Italian XVII Corps? If so, this should be made explicit in the prose.
 There should be a wiki-link to Scuttling in the prose for those readers not familiar with this act of deliberately sinking a ship.

 I noted your question on SqueakBox's page and figured that I was """"certain other editors"""".

I went to the main RfA page and his was not listed. I agree with the others that Squeak had to be watching or stalking for this so as to attack it at its earliest possibility. His """"oppose"""" was two minutes - TWO MINUTES - after the """"I accept"""" was put on the page, and as has been point out, long before it was officially live.
 Anyway, I have seen him in discussions and don't always agree with him, but I support the RfA. As for off-wiki happenings, that's part of the problem with having them... it strengthens the """"secret society"""" feeling that a lot of people seem to have (from the oft-made references to """"The Cabal"""" - something I have never made reference to).

"Question 

I hope you are not suggesting that - for the first time in my 7,200 content edits to wikipedia - I have somehow suddenly started adding inappropriate contentious content to wikipedia? As explained on WP:ANI, out of the blue and without consulting me, Hipocrite added the content I have been carefully preparing over 3 days. I added a small summary at the beginning, which was required. Actually, as others have suggested, various bits can be pruned and the inline citations tightened up. On the other hand what was there before was not a proper history section:  unlike mine it was not a summary of secondary sources.  I don't have any plans to edit anything other than the history section, which no other editor had thought of doing up until now. Without a history section there was absolutely no indication what debate had gone, why that was and amongst whom.",0

 Question 

Sarah, there is something that I've wondered about for a long time that is related to COI editing.  One need look no further than my user page where I quote Chris Hedges: """"They control our systems of information."""" and add: Surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporate-approved encyclopedia.  At a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easily-led, lame-brained, losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy.  What, if anything, is presently being done?  I'm aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to """"prove"""" that he had no COI related to the articles he edits, and I've heard of this incident dozens of times since, where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest.  Many times I've wondered how Wikipedia went about finding this so-called proof. If I put myself in a position in which I was editing for pay but denied it, how could it be proven that I was?  I mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have WP give him/her the WP Stamp of Approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please.  They can now proudly display their badge of approval and anyone who questions them is now seen as a disgruntled editor in need of a reality check.    """,0

Its true. Ive been insulted,  called names such as a """"snivelling little dog"""" and been talked down to by some other members and some other things. And they certainly seem to make out that they have an advantage over new users! I do keep neutral, as ive learnt when i created and edited many articles. But i do feel that the flags should be kept as a mere sign of respect and also since it will make it easier to sort out and see what countries they pledged allegience for NOT where they were nessarially born. Ive now changed it from country to allegience, And like i said they have the flags for WW1 vets page and also the world cup page , So come on.

And im not really intending to be rude as you seem to make out since if i didnt do anything then id get trampled on , like they say he who stays in his defences is beaten - Napoleon.

Same case here, I had to fight tooth and nail to keep my case in some of those articles and edits intact (Many of which they did eventually change their minds) And it may give that impression to you , But i can assure you i read EVERY message i get even if it doesnt look that way and i reply or act as i see fit.

Status and Advice 
I deleted it, both as copyvio and because it would be considered promotional in any case.  

A Wikipedia article  needs to be written like an encyclopedia article, not a press releasedon't praise the organization or person, say what they do. Don't talk about the overall importance of the subjector use adjectives of praise. . Remember not to  copy from a web site, even your own  first it's a copyright violation, but, even if you own the copyright and are willing to give us permission according to WP:DCM, the tone will not be encyclopedic and the material will not be suitableas this was not.

You will need to rewrite the articles to Wikipedia  style; a good place to start learning it  is    our guide to writing Wikipedia articles .  

First, give the basic informationthe source should be the CV birthplace and date, degrees, previous positions. If there are published books, list them in formal bibliographic style.  List the 3 or 4 most influential articles similarly, getting citation figures from Scopus or Web of Science or Google Scholar, or some other appropriate source. Do not include conference presentations, book chapters, and other minor published work. Such a list needs to be frequently updated, and belongs in the CV, not an encyclopedia.  

Include major national level offices and awards, but not minor ones and certainly not student awards. Be sure to list editorships (but not mere editorial board membership) we consider it very important, and you should add it to the articles for the relevant journals also, with a link to the bio. AQ award is worth mentioning; a nomination for an award is not. 
 
It is not necessary to cite the basic information in detail to other than the official CV. However, give  references providing substantial coverage from  3rd party independent published reliable sources, print or online, but not blogs or press releases, or material derived from press releases. For any part you quote directly from a published bio, include quotation marks and a reference. Do just just say """" It has been widely covered by press outlets such as The New York Times and Forbes."""" Give the reference in full, including the title of the article and a link to it.  

Pay particular attention to the way we make links to other Wikipedia  articles.  Avoid WP:Peacock terms: do not use words of praise, ofr state that the person is important: the contents of the article will show it. 

Don't just give a general list of all the fields he is interested in. Say briefly what his research has shown, with citations. 

Include only material that would be of interest to a general reader coming across the mention of the subject and wanting the sort of information that would be found in an encyclopedia. Do not include material that would be of interest only to those associated with the subject, or to prospective studentsthat sort of content is considered promotional. Keep in mind that the goal of an encyclopedia  is to say things in a concise manner, which is not the style of  press releases or  web sites, or CVs,  which are usually more expansive.

"Wikipedia Campus Ambassadors wanted at LSU 

Hi!  I'm leaving you this message because you are listed as a Wikipedian in Louisiana.  The Wikipedia Ambassador Program is currently looking for Campus Ambassadors to help with Wikipedia assignments at Louisiana State University, which will be participating in the Public Policy Initiative for the Spring 2011 semester.  The role of Campus Ambassadors will be to provide face-to-face training and support for students on Wikipedia-related skills (how to edit articles, how to add references, etc.). This includes doing in-class presentations, running workshops and labs, possibly holding office hours, and in general providing in-person mentorship for students.

Prior Wikipedia skills are not required for the role, as training will be provided for all Campus Ambassadors (although, of course, being an experienced editor is a plus).

I'm sorry to see that Greg is getting on your last nerve.  You know that there are people that understand and agree with your point — so stop pushing it.

My (inadvertently) driving Gerry away was a real eye-opener for me.  I disagreed with him quite regularly, but I never felt he was actively disruptive.  The same goes for PmAnderson/Septrasomething, who hasn't really contributed to the debate for a while.  The useless point/counter-point we're participating in with Greg and Tony is driving away all the people who might otherwise come to a reasonable conclusion (or at least legitimize the debate) if we weren't monopolizing things.  You've already suggested a Wikibreak for the same group that I just did (in fact it's partly what gave me the idea) and I think we should just abide by it, whether or not the other """"side"""" does.

 Edit request from Jayjoanz, 14 February 2011 

Please add the following information to the """"Public Image"""" section of Lady Gaga's page:

Lady Gaga's public perception is always amongst the most controversial of topics in popular culture. Debate about her style and influence on youth stems from her unceasing desire to walk the thin line between daring and inappropriate. The pop stars ability to command the attention of her fans and critics is unmatched and with a growing list of hit records she has solidified herself as a marketable brand. Her 2.8 million Twitter followers and 5.2 million Facebook fans represent evidence of her ability to move product (Hampp, 2010). With opposing ideals about the negative or positive impact of her music, fashion, and public statements there is little question that the benefits of her talent outweigh the detriments. Her fan base and customer base are similar in nature because they are both drawn to her outspoken and outrageous personality (Hampp, 2010).

Works Cited
Hampp, Andrew. """"GAGA, OOOH LA LA: WHY THE LADY IS THE ULTIMATE SOCIAL CLIMBER."""" Advertising Age 81.8 (2010): 42. Communication & Mass Media Complete. EBSCO. Web. 13 Feb. 2011.

  

I think that section already basically says that.  Also, we don't list how many Twitter followers and Facebook followers a person has because there's no way to really verify that information  are those real people?  Are there any sockpuppet accounts?  Anyway, the article basically says all that already.   

 Drug-taking? 

Shouldn't something be said about her drug taking. She admitted it on her CBS 60 Minutes interview that she smokes A LOT of pot while writing music, while drinking whiskey. It's mentioned on other musician's articles, so why not here? 90.193.141.136  
I'm surprised her former cocaine habit isn't mentioned here as well, seeing as she's talked about it in multiple places now (60 Minutes, Vanity Fair). 128.163.242.6  

 Edit request from Cvachov, 18 February 2011 

1986–2004: Early life

Lady Gaga was born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, to an Italian American family, in New York City on March 28, 1986,[11] 

...in Yonkers. NY...

Yonkers is it's own city and not part of New York City, it is located in Westchester County, not one of the five boroughs. 

  

 Per the cited source, """"Birth Place: New York, NY."""" It does not state Yonkers. If you check the talk page history, you'll also see that this issue has been researched and discussed at end, and established consensus is that she was not born in Yonkers. —' (talk) 

 Early Management requested addition 

Frank Fredericks, a fellow freshman at NYU, recognized Stefani's talent when they competed against each other in a campus talent show.  Fredericks began managing Stefani in the Spring of 2005, booking her shows at the nearby club the Bitter End.  They worked together for over year, until she began working with producer Rob Fusari.

 Followup on Abed Khan article 

Salaam,
I last posted here over two years ago about the English Abed Khan article after I noticed that you had written on the talk page. I've finished sourcing nearly all the claims in the article, but I am missing a bit of information and I had a quick question for you. The section about Khan's broadcast of Jobab Dao in Kolkata is an important one. However, I cannot find any English-language sources for these facts at all! (I have scoured hundreds of Google search results for """"abed khan"""", to no avail.) I was wondering whether the Bengali-language Abed Khan article had cited any sources for the claim that Khan broadcasted """"Jobab Dao"""" in 1971.

If you don't have the time or aren't able to find anything, that's totally okay. I just thought I'd see if we could track down a source for those claims! Dhonnobad,   """,0

 Article About Sizzla You Can Use 

Babylon has set up a system designed to keep black people enslaved and ashamed of their culture. The system is so structured that the only way for black people, is to look to the east and seek repatriation to the continent of their origin guided by the Trinity of Haile Selassie, Marcus Garvey and Immanuel and thier teachings.

 This is the message of Sizzla and it influences his music to the extent that he is being looked upon as the teacher and the inspiration for Jamaican youths who want to retain the basic culture of their African origins.

Sizzla's songs speak to poverty and hopelessness that pervades young Jamaica and obviously oppressed youths worldwide. Like Bob Marley, a couple of generations before him, he delivers a message which speaks to poverty, homelessness, police brutality, cultural pride and political and religious oppression.

        Born Miguel Collins,  Sizzla is a product of one of Jamaica's uptown ghettos, August Town.

        One of his earliest experiences of how unfair the social system is in Jamaica, was while he was in his mid-teens. In order to get into a Technical High School so he could learn a trade and have a better chance of earning a living, he had to leave High School , go back to pre-high and then apply to get into a High School which taught trades- Dunoon High School, where he studied Mechanical Engineering.

        Dunoon has a reputation of association with some of the best dancehall deejays from the city, including Shabba Ranks and Lady G. So with an inner inclination towards music, it wasn't surprising that while there, he started recording music.

        It was Homer Harris, the same man who gave Buju Banton his first break, who introduced him to top Jamaican saxophonist, Dean Frazier, (Musical Director for Philip """"Fattis"""" Burrell's Xterminator Family).

        """"Fatis"""" was delighted with his potential, decided to record him.

Sizzla, who had originally planned to follow in the footsteps of his mechanic father Aston, suddenly had a change of heart. He abandoned his mechanic training, came under the influence of Buju Banton and Shabba Ranks' cassettes and decided to stick to music.

        The auto industry loss was a tremendous gain for the music industry in Jamaica and indeed around the world.

        Since the start of 1997, Sizzla's popularity within the music industry has grown so rapidly, he is considered a musical phenomenon. His tunes fill the charts and sales have been so trmrndous that every reggae producer wished he had a Sizzla song to release and every sound system wants a Sizzla dubplate to be current.

        Touring with the Xterminator Family and star perfomer Luciano, has gained for him, tremendous experience and exposure and now Sizzla is about to move up the ranks and make his name as a musical prophet and messenger, in his own right""",0

 stradbroke galleon etc 

Hallo Hesperian
Just thought I should send you a copy of my comments on the end of your little witch hunt. Yes you won, bully for you, I hope it makes you feel like a big man. I look forward to when I bump into you in the flesh so we can sort this out the old fashioned way; face to face. that will be fun!!!

hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by """"mainstream"""" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the """"mainstream"""" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails. Gregjay (talk)

 Redirect from hoax page """"Hamlet of Denmark"""" 

Hello ! I just wanted to point out that the redirect that you created from Hamlet of Denmark should point to Prince Hamlet (which is the article dedicated to the character) and not to Hamlet. Best regards! (talk) 
 I thought about it, but the play also has King Hamlet, the ghost. (I have no preference either way; if you believe Prince Hamlet would have been a better target, I might reduce the protection for a while, so that you can change it.) -   
 Well, I confess that I have absolutely no idea about how to find whether people who search for """"Hamlet of Denmark"""" are more interested in the prince or in the king. I would say the prince, but it would be only a conjecture. Given the ambiguous nature of the expression, your choice seems the most reasonable.

 WP:OUTING 

Any edit that """"outs"""" someone must be reverted promptly, followed by a request for Oversight to delete that edit from Wikipedia permanently, Unless unintentional and non-malicious (for example, where Wikipedians know each other off-site and may inadvertently post personal information, such as using the other person's real name in discussions), attempted outing is grounds for an immediate block.

Posting of personal information
Shortcuts:
WP:OUTING
WP:PRIVACY
""""WP:OUTING"""" redirects here. For the alternate meaning of outing, as in excursion, see Wikipedia:Meetup.
For the Wikimedia privacy policy, see Wikimedia:Privacy policy.
Posting another editor's personal information is harassment, unless that person voluntarily had posted his or her own information, or links to such information, on Wikipedia. Personal information includes legal name, date of birth, identification numbers, home or workplace address, job title and work organisation, telephone number, email address, or other contact information, whether any such information is accurate or not. Posting such information about another editor is an unjustifiable and uninvited invasion of privacy and may place that editor at risk of harm outside of their activities on Wikipedia. This applies to the personal information of both editors and non-editors. It also applies in the case of an editor who has requested a change in username, but whose old identifying marks can still be found. Any edit that """"outs"""" someone must be reverted promptly, followed by a request for Oversight to delete that edit from Wikipedia permanently. If an editor has previously posted their own personal information but later redacted it, it should not be repeated on Wikipedia; although references to still-existing, self-disclosed information is not considered outing. If the previously posted information has been removed by Oversight, then repeating it on Wikipedia is considered outing.

The fact that a person either has posted personal information or edits under their own name, making them easily identifiable through online searches, is not an excuse for """"opposition research"""". Dredging up their off line opinions to be used to constantly challenge their edits can be a form of harassment, just as doing so regarding their past edits on other Wikipedia articles may be. However, if individuals have identified themselves without redacting or having it oversighted, such information can be used for discussions of conflict of interest in appropriate forums. If redacted or oversighted personally identifying material is important to the COI discussion, then it should be emailed privately to an administrator or arbitrator – but not repeated on Wikipedia: it will be sufficient to say that the editor in question has a COI and the information has been emailed to the appropriate administrative authority.

If you see an editor post personal information about another person, do not confirm or deny the accuracy of the information. Doing so would give the person posting the information and anyone else who saw the page feedback on the accuracy of the material. Do not treat incorrect attempts at outing any differently from correct attempts for the same reason. When reporting an attempted outing take care not to comment on the accuracy of the information. Outing should usually be described as """"an attempted outing"""" or similar, to make it clear that the information may or may not be true, and it should be made clear to the users blocked for outing that the block log and notice does not confirm the information.

Unless unintentional and non-malicious (for example, where Wikipedians know each other off-site and may inadvertently post personal information, such as using the other person's real name in discussions), attempted outing is grounds for an immediate block.

Threats to out an editor will be treated as a personal attack and dealt with accordingly.  """,0

 problem is this 

I, too can see that it could have been an honest mistake.  However, him attacking me shows he has no AGF.  He even denies making the edit.

The correct response would be for him to give an excuse of an error (whether or not it is an honest excuse).

Attacking me is not the solution.  Having administrators attack me shows they are not fair.  They should have tried to mediate a solution which might be """"it's possible that this was an honest mistake.  whether or not is was, the user did make the edit despite his denials.  at this point, we'll do nothing.  please, everyone be careful when editing""""

"Request to unblock Matthew2602 

Hey Hersfold, myself and other editors were discussing random things on the RuneScape Wiki IRC channel when somehow the conversation turned to User:Matthew2602 wondering if he could be unblocked here. I've known this user for quite some time now, and can vouch for him in saying that he is not a sockpuppet of that user, who neither him nor myself have heard of before his blocking. I think that it is safe to assume that the IP that both Matthew2602 and the sockpuppeteer was dynamic, and used by multiple users. Perhaps other users were also unjustly blocked during that case; who knows.

Once upon a time, I woke up one morning in July two years ago, only to find that I was blocked from editing on the only wiki that I was active on at the time, mylegonetwork.wikia.com. That wiki had about 20 active users then, and upon some very quick investigation it seemed that I had been caught up in the autoblock of a user who was blocked for one day for some minor policy violation. Anyways, I got an admin to unblock me and went on my merry way. A few hours later, when talking with him and other users on the IRC, I found out that he lives in the southern United States. I live in Alberta, Canada. We were both using the same IP. Beyond my nice little story, I've known User:Matthew2602 for months. I know that he is a good user with only good faith intentions, and I also know that he would like to be able to edit here again. It would be nice if he could be unblocked without large quantities of bureaucratic pointlessness, but that can happen if needed.

Let us examine what is considered """"Black"""" in the context of this very article. At the very top it states:

""""It is also used to categorize a number of diverse populations together based on historical and prehistorical ancestral relationships. Some definitions of the term include only people of relatively recent Sub Saharan African descent (see African diaspora). Among the members of this group, dark skin is most often accompanied by the expression of natural afro-hair texture (although a recent scientific study notes that human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations). Other definitions of the term """"black people"""" extend to other populations characterized by dark skin, including some indigenous to Oceania and Southeast Asia""""

This article even mentions Oceanians and Southeast Asians (such as the Great Andamanese, Native Fijians, the Ati,  and the Melanesians) even though these groups genetically have more in common with neighboring Asian populations and are very distant from other people who are considered Black Africans. Ethiopians are black Africans. Some of them have Middle-Eastern ancestry (Ethiopia is a short boat ride from Arabia), but that automatically does not make them an entirely mixed population; nor does it change the fact that their roots are mainly in Africa. Sicilians have some Middle-Eastern ancestry, but they are still considered European. Ancient Romans certainly referred to Ethiopians as black. They used the term """"Ethiopian"""" to describe all Black Africans they came across, regardless of their location outside of East Africa (read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_expeditions_to_Sub-Saharan_Africa)

I went to the Beta Israel page and found two very clear references: 

Ephraim Isaac (1974), The Falasha: Black Jews of Ethiopia. Dillard University Scholar Statesman Lecture Series.

Simon D. Messing (1982). The Story of the Falashas """"Black Jews of Ethiopia"""". Brooklyn. ISBN 0-9615946-9-1

Here's more from another article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Israel#Black_Hebrew_Israelite_immigration)

Rebhun, Uzi, Jews in Israel: contemporary social and cultural patterns

""""The Israeli government has airlifted black Ethiopian Jews to Israel and given them citizenship in the same way it has been a haven to Jews oppressed throughout the Middle East and Africa""""

""""She told RT: “They don't want poor or black children and Depo-Provera gave them the opportunity to have control. If she [a patient] keeps taking an injection every three months, she is not going to have children – you know it is a 100 per cent secure from children I think.”

Hedva says the policy is working – the number of black babies in Israel is decreasing, but there are no official statistics to back up her claim. For community workers and Ethiopian women here, statistics are unnecessary – they feel their reality speaks for itself.

The Health Ministry admits it issues the drug, but says it was never its policy only to administer it to Ethiopian women and reduce the number of black babies in the country.""""

I would say that makes Ethiopian Jew's a valid part of this article.

"""=Unbalanced critique===

The psychotherapy article needs a balanced critique section. The current article contains a section called """"criticisms and questions regarding effectiveness"""" in which a few random studies have been cited, and a laundry list of random arguments are put forward. It is not a comprehensive precis of the effectiveness literature. The article neglects a wide body of work that points to a) the success of some types of therapy with specific types of disorders, b) discipline-agnostic characteristics of therapist behaviour that contribute to success, c) superiority of psychopharmacology & psychotherapy combined, vs either intervention on it's own, d) characteristics of clients/patients that seem to benefit most from psychotherapy, and e) vested interests of stakeholders in swinging research to one side of the debate or the other and other inhibiting factors - consider the two APA's, the various laws and licensing authorities, the separate academic communities in psychiatry, philosophy, social work, occupational therapy, the professional jealousies, the profound neglect of mental illness and psychological wellbeing in public health and health insurance, and the impact of the pharmaceutical industry's deep pockets on the dominant discourse.  

Please note that I am editing anonymously in protest against the tyrrany of the editing majority. Wikipedia's non-negotiable, amateur editor norm might be appropriate for certain article categories, but in more nuanced technical spaces there is invariably a segment that make nuisances of themselves by wanting to debate every word and angle. I have watched the development of articles on schools of psychotherapy since the early 2000s, and I'm afraid time and multiple amateur edits have not improved them much. In the specific case of psychology their mistakes add to the perception that this is a wishy washy discipline void of a body of knowledge and ANY facts. I suspect that this is partly why self-respecting people who are knowledgeable don't want to be involved in what is otherwise a very worthy undertaking.

"""rather crude ancestor of the vaccine. 

The source is a biography of Louis XVI """"Louis XVI le Roi Bienfaisant"""" (Jean de Viguerie, on the various, and often contradictory, influences of the french government prior to the revolution), where a section is devoted to the innoculation of the royal family, and makes note of how the intendant of Franche Comte had financed physicians to do it through his province, and how it was later used by Washington on his continental army.  

The truth
He actually died on December 31. It even says so in a book that I have!

User:SandyGeorgia

The discussion is now here  having been persistently deleted from this discussion without one moment's regard or consideration for the absent individuals who initiated and later participated without conclusion thus far.

Nobody has at any time suggested that  

Zeraeph The final deletion was done by a Wikipedi Administrator.  Adminstrators have the final say around here. He told you clearly to take this through proper channels.  

Of course, to do that, you (or someone) would actually have to come up with hard facts pulled from the history of this article.  So far, not a single person, even you, has been able to present a single fact to support any complaint at all.   Even though you have been asked and asked and asked.  To every single request, you claim you are being victimized by people attempting to control and manipulate you.  

This is the fourth time today that you have dragged this topic back onto this page, even after an administrator told you not to.  Your link here is to an Administrative page.  Why?  Why not move this interest that is solely yours onto your own talk page or create a new talk page in your own Wiki pages?  

You are forgetting, I did NOT initiate this discussion. The people who did have a right to expect it not be deleted without resolution.

Their concerns are different from my own and have yet to be addressed.  

Those supposed concerns of others were voiced back in July and neither of them have ever posted again about those supposed concerns, either here or on any of 3 cabals.  It appears that they have zero interest, realizing they were just complaining and their griping had no validity.  After all, their irritation was that Sandy was removing inappropriate unfactual unsubstantiated material in order that this article achieve featured status.  Sandy was Wififying the article for Wiki excellence.

On the administrators page above, you have been instructed by administrators to use ARBCOM instead of this or any other public article talk page.  You have already refused to do so on the grounds that you cannot be expected to unearth her every single improper edit, but no one is asking you to.  Just pull up the last ten - or even the last five times when Sandy has done an obviously inappropriate ungrounded edit in this article (since the """"original complaintants"""" have only complained on this talk page).  

Strangely, on my planet, July is not USUALLY considered to include 16 August  and .

Even stranger, you are posting regularly from a shared AOL proxy server  something which would usually be dynamic and not repeated on two consecutive logins and, coincidentally,  

Note this Wiki link -  Where you had already filed your first Cabal against Sandy.  And she is commenting on it on JULY 20th.  Perhaps you can explain where and when you filed that grievance against her?  The one you dropped, requesting  it be closed a day or two later after refusing to give any reasons for your requesting the Cabal.  Your complaints on that occasion were also vague and you refused to give specifics - even to direct any one to articles and dates for reference.   

I think you will find that you were referring to the """"supposed concerns of others were voiced back in July"""" which were actually voiced on 16 August  and .

whatever....I did NOT say I would edit war, in fact I said I would be careful NOT actually edit war, but to simply place a word that belongs in the article, that Nova keeps having issues with.   Are you saying that I don't have the right in the """"future"""" to ever put in anything simply cuz Nova would object?     My hands would have to be tied, you're saying??

I don't like how you jumped the gun and twisted what I said around, where I specifically said I would NOT """"edit war"""", but would not put up with suppression of facts, simply cuz Nova doesn't like them. Also, the """"personal attacks"""" are merely facts about this individual that can be easily looked up. I'm not the only one who doesn't like him or what he does.    Actually at this point I don't care...I'm tired of the insanity.....I have other things to do, and this nonsense is too time-consuming anyway.  For real.   This person Nova made it """"personal"""" long before I did, with his actions.    Again, there are others who feel the same way....  I'm not the only one he's upset with his constant edit warring and disrespect.  So you looking only at me, and misunderstanding my words and my intent.    I was seriously planning to be done with Wikipedia for a long while anyway. (I have other accounts and even other IPs anyway.....but I probably won't even use them, as I don't really care to be wasting time on this stuff, anymore.)  Nova has no business on Wikipedia. He's an insufferable joke.  And I don't care that it's a personal attack. Since I'm blocked anyway, I might as well make it worth it.   He should just get lost from all articles, he adds nothing but aggravation and a barrage of insanity.    

Again, I'm NOT the only one who's been a victim of his crazy nonsense.    Yet that nutball stays unblocked, yet he is the CAUSE of it all the problems.    Interesting.  As I said, whatever.....I contributed a lot to WP in 5 short months (my first edit in Feb 2008 does not count, as that was just playing around....I got serious with WP in February 2010....)....with meaningful additions, corrections, source editing, vandalism removal, grammar correction, section adding, creation of a few articles.....etc.   I never even intended to get into this, it was all an accident when I couldn't find some topics on WP that I thought would be, so I decided to create some articles....and then get caught up in this stuff.   Much to my chagrin.   I have better (for real) things to do.    I don't care that much that I'm blocked......but it's the principle that it's sort of unfair, and you misunderstand (and actually twisted) my words around.....and this maniac (more personal attacks, so I'm making it good) gets off basically scott-free.......EVEN THOUGH I CAN SHOW YOU EXAMPLES OF WHERE HE'S BEEN AN INSUFFERABLE TARD WITH OTHER PEOPLE TOO.    You'll overlook that of course.     Cuz Nova knows how to manipulate WP and WP Admins fairly well, I've noticed.    Though I know that some Admins see his nonsense too.    

Anyway, again.....to re-iterate.....I did not say I would """"edit war"""" but would simply exercise my rights to put in words in an article, despite Nova's own constant edit warring and neurotic objections to everything.    And I said I would be careful NOT to violate 3RR as well as NOT brazenly """"edit war"""".     Of course you see it as a threat to """"edit war"""" anyway...

  Sir/Maam:

Thank You ! For the heads up about needing to sign corrections to pages. All of the information I have added to the article on Walter Butler, the Loyalist, can easily be verified by using “www.footnote.com” for the Revolutionary Pension Applications or by consulting the """"Bloodied Mohawk"""", which Picton Press and I published in 2000, which footnotes the primary source document of every fact printed within the book. I think it important to note that the """"Pensioners"""" name possibly three different Patriots as the killer of Walter Butler. I have posted on my website “www.fort-plank.com” a page with all of the known references to Walter Butler's death which can be readily found in PRIMARY SOURCE materials. I hate using secondary and tertiary sources for obvious reasons and am very pleased that “wikipedia.org” has dramatically increased its documentation requirements for its articles! Thank You!

Please do not add original research or novel syntheses of previously published material to our articles as you apparently did to Walter Butler (Loyalist). Please cite a reliable source for all of your information. Thank you. Deconstructhis (talk) 

I must in all fairness ask what the problem is with “original research? Are you implying that original and authentic research is not appropriate for “Wikipedia”. There is way, way to much trash out there on the “internet” which cannot be, in any way, verified. My additions to the Butler page were not suppositions, rather eyewitness statements as to what really happened to Butler. 

Unfortunately, the webmaster of http://www.nyhistory.net/~drums/wbutler.htm is a personal and friendly acquaintance of mine, but he, and many other historians have bought into the early undocumented histories of the Mohawk Valley, most of which I have spent the last twenty-five plus years trying to authenticate as at least seventeen of my own ancestors fought in the Mohawk Valley during the Revolution, and regurgitated their unbelievable and unverifiable “facts” as their own research.

Please, do not misunderstand: I am not upset, get confused!!! I would really like to see all of the content of the Internet be so reliable that anyone could simply look it up on the web and then contact the repository of the original document, pay the appropriate fee for copying it, and then have their own private library of primary source documents.

Hope this finds all well!

P.S. The “copyrighted material” that I incorrectly posted in Wikipedia was an article entirely of my own production and which was copied from my master copies of the 100+ pages of primary source data on my “www.fort-plank.com” site. This can be easily verified by my publisher, Picton Press, and a plethora of fellow researchers, some of whom agree with me and some who do not.""",0

She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance 
to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts 
for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

Me and your daughter.. got a special thang goin on
You say it's puppy love (arf arf arf)
We say it's full grown (ARF ARF WOOF!)
Hope that we feel this.. feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
but you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
on the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too long
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Askin what happened to the feelin that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything is cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, 
and graduation

CHORUS:

Now you and your girl ain't speakin no more 
cause my dick all in her mouth

Another specialty of this village is that there is no Brahmin family here. All the families bear the surname of Moharana (Carpenter), Gaya (Yadav), Behera (Fisherman) and Sahu.  There is no sign of work. They all are farmers. The main occupation of our villagers is cultivation.
It is a small village with only sixty families. Its population is about five hundred only. It is sixty kilometers away from the Bay of Bengal (Sea Beach, Puri). It looks green as there are many green trees in our village. The place of Maa Yashomati is situated in the first of the village. There is also a big pond near the temple.

Our village has been awarded by the Kalyani Team, Door Darshan, Bhubaneswar for the cleanliness and purity of atmosphere. The villagers do not differ on any issue. If at all there is a dispute, they sit together at Bhagabat House and settle it amicably by all villagers.

The radiation emitted by each body is proportional to the 4th power of its absolute temperature and is not dependent on the temperature of the other body.

"To me a nemonic is supposed to provide an easy way to help you remember something.  It shouldn't be hard to remember or hard to remember how to use.  The second nemonic, I feel, is quite complicated, has much information buried in it, is hard to learn how it all goes together, and takes a significant amount of memory to remember how to use all its various parts.  Given that, is it really a nemonic?

A second thing I want to do is give for consideration the nemonic I learned way back when we used paper trig tables.  Sorry, I do not know a reference for it.  And I can not edit it in, because I don't know the markup here on Wiki.

It is:  OH,  AH,  Oh-Ah,  Ah-Oh,  HA,  HO  (Say it moderately fast).
Sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, cosecant are:  O/H,  A/H,  Oh/Ah,  Ah/Oh,  H/A,  H/O.

Unlike the soa-cah-toa nemonic it gives all six common functions.  But I like to teach only the 1st three, OH, AH, Oh-Ah (simple enough), or even only the first two, OH AH  and have them (students) memorize only Sin, Cos, and Tan   then have them learn and understand that tan= sin/cos and the last three are inverses of the 1st three.

It might sound a bit like a tongue twister at first, but it only took a my high school trig class about 15 minutes to learn it and a good part of that time was laughter  and it is silly enough to be memorable. I still use it after 45+ years and some of my today's students have picked it up too as the one they prefer (over soh cah toa).",0

Thanks for your kind words about my comments. I'd disagree, though. I'm not convinced that GoRight was, exactly, baiting WMC, he was, more accurately, confronting some clear double standards. The edits which got him blocked for harassment were echoes of what WMC had said, and which had been supported by, as I recall, Schulz. Whether it was true or not, those comments were set up, GoRight just noticed it and said it, violating User:Abd/Rule 0. I'd call it uncivil, but on a scale not worse than what had preceded it, and certainly, because of it's mirror nature, more just.

I've tried to reach out to Connolley, but he rejected it, which is sad. I suspect that he's a good man who has fallen into some bad company. (Maybe they are all good men who have fallen into a bad constellation, some pattern that reinforces the worst aspects of the way they are working here.) The incivility serves no obvious good purpose from any POV except one that would hate the project to be successful, and I'm sure that's not Connolley's POV.

In any case, I have not denied the uncivil aspects of GoRight's edits, I've merely noted that they are easily explainable as a natural response to what clearly appeared to him to be an abusive cabal, and what he was seeing confirmed what was in the Solomon source. I believe that he is now able to see beyond that, and that he's learned to not make accusations that involve assumptions of bad faith. I draw a distinction between noting a reasonable suspicion that something is off, and claiming that it is off. I might note that a user shows characteristics of a block-evading sock, but I won't claim that the user is a block-evading sock unless I'm prepared to back it up with sufficiently solid evidence. I'll only state the former, as well, the suspicion, if the suspicion is clearly reasonable, so I'd just be stating the obvious, which sometimes must be said.

And that's how I've treated sock puppetry charges against me: if there was some reasonable basis, not matter how shallow, I didn't charge abusive SSP filing. GoRight clearly went too far, but he didn't keep it up. Meanwhile, he was blocked in outrageous violation of block policy, and I'm mulling over whether or not I should do anything about that. Baley has denied that there was any error in the block, and this is what actually might make it necessary to go for an RfC. It's pretty clear, it's not marginal. But, of course, RfC isn't the first step. The first step would be something like what I just did on User talk:William M. Connolley. The next step, for me, would be to attempt to identify someone Connolley might trust, to give him a friendly nudge. Has to be a friend, not merely an ally.",0

Hello Rigadoun, your query raises a puzzle for which I would welcome your input.

I'm sure we agree that editing without a reference source is a terrible idea, and articles should have lots and lots of in-line references to indicate where all the material came from.

But what if all the material comes from one single reference source?  In such a case, I could, in principle, add a footnote to every sentence, which would cite the very same source.  But this seems a little bit inelegant and reader-unfriendly to me.  I felt it better simply to declare, once and for all, that everything in the article came from the same source.  Yours sincerely,   

Josef Friedrich Anton Fleischmann

Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Nathu La incident. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as you. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Sino-Indian relations. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will continue helping to improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Sino-Indian relations - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled """"Click here to contest this speedy deletion,"""" which appears inside of the speedy deletion ({{db-...}}) tag (if no such tag exists, the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate). Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit the the page's talk page directly to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact one of these administrators to request that the administrator userfy the page or email a copy to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

"I have only just noticed that you are changing the names from common to scientific because you are starting to do the Australian snakes (all of which I am watching). You do have a good argument, although I do not fully agree. The problem is that you are not going about it the wrong way. Since it is policy, you should be first trying to change the policy before mass changes to the encyclopadia. The policies are there to create consistency. All you are doing now is making it more confusing. People expect to find the common names on Wikipedia, because that is the way it is done at the moment. Also, it seems you haven't read the Tree of Life guidelines properly. In it, it says that common names should be used where there are formal common names (such as birds) or there is a relatively unique common name. Otherwise use the scientific names. For example: White's Tree Frog is unique, and therefore the common name should be used. However, if you look at Litoria chloris, the common name cannot be used. Its common name, the Red-eyed Tree Frog has a disambigous page, explaining why that common cannot be used, and states that Red-eyed Tree Frog is not unique. 
The entire issue is trying to account for the most ammount of people. If someone wants information on a snake, writes its common name into the search box, and comes across an article with a strange latin name, they may be off-put and think they wrote the wrong name, and it redirected to the wrong place. Especially if the article did not have a photo. If a scientist wants to look at an article, and puts in the scientific name, and it is redirected to the common name, they will be aware of what the common name is. In fact, you will find that in most scientific papers, they will use the common name, stating the scientific name once in brackets so their is no ambiguity. A lot of articles use the scientific name because their is no common name. There is no other choice, and there is no problem with this. 
Please, bring this up on WP:TOL talk page before changing any more articles. You cannot create consistency yourself, and all you are doing is making it worse. If policy is changed other people can help, and it is possible to get all the articles changed. Policy needs to be followed, otherwise the encyclopaedia becomes a jamble. Thankyou.",0
"Stange Behaviour By Editor McGeddon
I am not sure how such a simple process of factually updating a wiki page has turned into what i can only describe as a strange obsession by a person calling themselves McGeddon. I have no idea what this persistent person who i can only describe as an INTERNET TROLL's motives are. I have been asked to update prominent south african artist wiki pages with factual information that is flattering to the artists therefore promoting South Africa. If that is a crime then i apologise but the fact is i have no connection to the artist apart from the country i live in and the love of art. In response to the Thandi Zambo and Thandi Moyo, they are both me, I couldn't remember my password for Zambo, which is my maiden name, so i made Moyo, which is my married name. This strange person McGeddon, who obviously is a very empty person with nothing in his life is harassing me and vandalising all my hard work. I see he does this to everyone, it's probably because he has no power in the real world. Anyway i am moving on from this project and i will have to change my username when i look at other south african artists to update their pages to save myself from harassment from this TROLL. I admit i am not an expert at editing wiki pages but instead of assistance from this McGeddon he choose the vindictive route flexing his technical knowledge. He must hide behind his computer and live out his useless existence. Regards Thandi Moyo (nee Zambo)",0

The POV rule does not ban the citing of POV material; the rule bans the writing of POV Wikipedia articles. If no one could cite any POV articles, no major exposes could be cited here.

Without a metatheory, one does not have a truth predicate, which complicates things for realism, because the whole point of that philosophy is that sets really do exist and actually do have the properties ascribed to them. One could argue in favor of a disquotational definition of truth, but that merely pushes the problem around, leading to the same problems as full second-order semantics for arithmetic.   Also, not having a metatheory means that one must treat set theory differently than other branches of mathematics, such as group theory or linear ordering theory. This seems like a difficult distinction to justify. 

I do think that the """"no metatheory"""" interpretation of ZFC (or Zermelian set theory, if you prefer that) is somewhat common, because it is one way of avoiding the issue that what is called V in the object theory cannot be distinguished from a set in the metatheory. One consequence of my original point is that it would also be coherent to interpret this no-metatheory language merely as a way of making statements from the viewpoint of a person inside a particular model of set theory. Moreover, this interpretation is entirely compatible with the viewpoint that there is an objectively-defined collection consisting of all sets, if no additional meta-level principles such as the ability to force over V are added. However, if one already viewed """"all sets"""" as merely a façon de parler with no objective referent, as I think you are proposing, then it's not clear why one sort of disquotation (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets"""") is better than another (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets in the model at hand""""). — Carl ( · talk) """,0

"What Britannica says about the early populations of the area 

Macedonia: History – Encyclopaedia Britannica

Macedonia owes its name to the ancient kingdom of Macedonia (or Macedon). Centred in the southern part of the region, (i.e. present-day Northern Greece) this kingdom seems to have been largely Greek-speaking, with Thracian and Illyrian admixtures. By the 4th century bc, it had extended its rule northward into the Balkan Peninsula and throughout the Mediterranean. In the 2nd century bc, Macedonia was made into a Roman province. When the Roman Empire was divided in the 4th century ad into eastern and western halves, Macedonia became part of the eastern half, which became the Byzantine Empire. By this time the population of Macedonia had been largely Christianized. Macedonia’s Greek ethnic composition was overturned by the invasion of Slavic peoples into the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries AD.

Paionia (historical region) – Encyclopaedia Britannica

Paeonia,  the land of the Paeonians, originally including the whole Axius (Vardar) River valley and the surrounding areas, in what is now northern Greece, (Republic of) Macedonia, and western Bulgaria. The Paeonians, who were probably of mixed Thraco-Illyrian origin, were weakened by the Persian invasion (490 bc), and those tribes living along the Strymon River (in western Bulgaria) fell under Thracian control. The growth of Macedonia forced the remaining Paeonians northward, and in 358 bc they were defeated by Philip II of Macedonia. The native dynasty, however, continued to be highly respected: about 289 bc, King Audoleon received Athenian citizenship, and his daughter married Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. Under the Romans, Paeonia was included in the second and third districts of the province of Macedonia. By ad 400, however, the Paeonians had lost their identity, and Paeonia was merely a geographic term

I am confused here.  I posted something about both of the publically funded Waldorf schools in Sonoma County, not an 'individual school,' and that information comes from official sources (so it is properly sourced), and the information provides information which contradicts the 'Official' Waldorf position.  I do not believe that the 'official' statement of the Waldorf committee reflects their reality.  Anti-immunization is so highly correlated with the Waldorf schools I have looked at as to be close to official policy.  Waldorf schools in the US  education as practiced in the US includes a substantial anti-immunization    

 Concerns over immunizations 

The current text refers to a 'consensus statement' which is a dead link.  This page http://www.waldorfanswers.org/QuestionsMore.htm refers to a growing anti-immunization movement within and outside of Waldorf schools, but again refers to the same dead link as the 'consensus statement' on vaccinations.

The article does not cite a verifiable source on the policy of Waldorf education towards vaccinations.  The article does say """"Studies have found Waldorf pupils to have a lower incidence of allergies and allergic-like symptoms, an effect which correlated with the extent to which they lived an """"anthroposophic lifestyle"""" generally - in particular with reduced use of antibiotics, antipyretics, and measles, mumps and rubella vaccination""""  Which is a deep violation of NPOV - to assert a correlation when there is a deep selection bias in the cited studies.

 High Tech Postcode Recommended 

An Irish Cross Party Parliamentary (Oireachtas) Committee has recommended the implementation of a unique Identifier Postcode  for Ireland according to """"The Post Codes Report"""" as reflected in the Irish Examiner. The code now recommended will be such that it can be supported on google maps, iphones and GPS and will be capable of a unique postcode for each property.

The report questions any plan to introduce a broad area code which is unable to identify properties and states that the proposal for a D04 123 type code may make address ambiguity and problems with finding properties in Ireland even worse.

The report is from the Joint Communications Committee of the Irish Parliament and includes members of most political parties. It was published on 31 March 2010 and will lead to a significant revision of existing proposals

Late on 1st April, the full report was released and is available for download here There is considerable mention of the use of GPS in relation to the new code in the report and both the HSE and the GeoComputation Centre in NUI Maynooth are quoted as being strongly in favour of a code which provides a unique identifier such as is achieved with a GPS related code..

"I am just lazy.  I have it on automatic and sometimes forget to take it off.  You did not appear to notice that, or if you did, you are deliberately not noting that.  Sometimes, I feel like I have to keep it on, though, because of YOU specifically stalking every contribution I make like you're my mother.  Go away, please.

I know, you want me to hold the burden of proof.  Anglo-Frisian and Old Norse have the most extreme maritime influences, including those Non IE Roots discussed on the Talk:Germanic languages page where you bureaucratically assaulted me also.  As formerly stated(before Diderot POV pushed the article with a massive edit) on the Non IE Roots page(), Celtic is another language group holding a considerable amount of Non IE Roots.  Apart from any Basque influences, Celtic seems to have Non IE terms concentrated mostly in the British Isles, where they were joined by the Anglo-Frisians and Norse.  It is blatantly clear to anybody that the Mediterranean influence on High German is astounding.  The older Nordic and Germanic writings appear less structured and thought out, but the more evolution into current speech, the tongues have been so standardised by latinisation, especially.  One cannot seriously refute that the Anglo-Frisian and West Norse tongues follow the least marked latinising structures on their tongues of the Germanic languages(and especially borrowing scientific terms), apart from writing them in latin script, with a few native letters especially in Icelandic to this day.  The Baltic East Norse tongues gained a considerable conversion by the influence of the Low German speakers of the Hanseatic League in their everyday life, most notable in the Hanseatic Cities, like Visby on Gotland.  Since High German has been standardising itself all throughout Germany, having a marked effect upon such others as Austrian and Swiss German, all the dialects of Germany and even in Eastern Europe are suffering at the officialisation and BBC type overtaking.  See the German language page for more information in this regard.  To let your paranoid self know that it's ok, I haven't edited there, because that's not my area of specific study, although it's helpful to know.",0

 Now I see 

So basically, your plan is to find any single record which disagrees with all other records and that is the one you are going with.  In the case of Mike Sharperson, Social Security records suffice so you change his birth year to 1960 - even though all other sources say 1961.  But, in the case of Larry MacPhail, Social Security records agree with all other sources that his birth year was 1890 so instead you use his draft records - apparently the only source that shows 1888 - and change all references to his birth year to 1888.  Except in the case of MacPhail - as well as Casey Stengel and Chief Bender - his own gravestone disagrees with you (yes, there is a picture here)!  Doesn't that mean that MacPhail faked his date of birth for the draft and not the other way around?!  And Stengel's fake birth certificate was the one that said 1889?  You say Chief Bender's sister found his birth certificate in 1942 and it said he was born in 1883.  Then why did he have 1884 put on his gravestone when he died - 12 years later?!

This tactic of yours gives the appearance that records are only good enough for you when they make you look like the hero investigator - the one who cut through all popular misconceptions and """"found the truth once and for all"""".  Social Security records are gospel in one case (Sharperson) but are bunk in others (MacPhail and others).  If you're really writing a book using this tactic - and without pointing out that those dates are the lone exceptions - then you should really be ashamed.  And if your editors and publishing company don't point out the error of your ways, they should likewise be ashamed.  And if you think that research like that is going to be permitted on Wikipedia, then you are mistaken.  Please do read WP:ATT and its related pages and understand that your lone exception style of research is the exact opposite of how we do things here.  —  """,0

In particular: In the second interval, both A and B should be flatted; in the third, there is no G# in the original tetrachord; in the fourth and fifth, there is no B natural in the original tetrachord; in the sixth, there is no A natural in the original tetrachord.

I'm also not aware of Webern or Schoenberg using this tetrachord much explicitly.  There might be a few of them here or there in their music, but I'm pretty sure it's not a significant feature of either's music (as it certainly is in Carter; I don't know about Perle).  I don't think either Webern or Schoenberg even knew of the special properties of this tetrachord.  The literature on Webern and Schoenberg that I know certainly doesn't mention this.

You have absolutely no evidence to suggest that I am a reasonable person, so I suggest you withdraw that insinuation.

Also, you have been blocked per Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Orbiston.

Now, as for my not having replied to every single one of your points, well yes, when you present me with a wall of text of that nature, brimming with implications and assumptions and accusations and who knows what, I will indeed pick out the specific points that spring to mind. I'm not here to write essays explaining things to you. And in fact, much of this discussion should be happening on the talk page of the article, not here. But, since the template I used invited you here, I will entertain your questions here for a little while.

First, I don't see any """"bizarre wall of steel"""" around Murphy's article. I see a single-purpose account (Orbiston) repeatedly and determinedly trying to insert negative material, and a small selection of other accounts and IP addresses (some of which were single purpose accounts, and some not) dealing with that. Orbiston was neither being """"reasonable"""", nor trying """"to do no more than mention SM's sexuality"""", nor was he willing to abide by Wikipedia's policies. That's why he got blocked - not """"aggressive censorship"""".

I haven't used the word """"conspiracy"""", so I have no idea where you got that from.

The Wikipedia page Stephen Fry mentions Fry's sexuality with due weight - I think one or two sentences out of a very lengthy article that has more than 150 references, as against 5 (currently) for the Murphy article. Also, Fry has publicly campaigned on gay rights and related issues - he deliberately makes it a part of his public persona and his internet fame. Murphy has not done so.

Now, imagining for a moment that your postulated scenario is correct, that the only reason that Murphy's sexuality was mentioned in published sources was that a """"disgusting tabloid exposé"""" was planned, then I don't need to explain to you that such material is not the sort of thing we use to evidence commentary about a living person on Wikipedia.

I'm making this reply on an """"I'm started so I'll finish"""" generosity basis, but really you have no right to make accusations of this nature, here or anywhere else. Don't do it, please.

As you are an investigative journalist, I recommend to you the website and forum http://wikipediocracy.com/ - that site has amongst its """"trustees"""" a number of individuals who consider themselves """"professional journalists"""" in the USA, and I am sure that many of them share similar concerns to yourself about places where young gay men can express their feelings.

What's with the line about the Black And White Ball of Truman Capote's?  Is it really a pertinent biographical detail to say that Ms. Lee was extended an invitation?

Why a recluse?
I came to this article to discover why exactly Harper Lee became a recluse. It does not really say for sure. I would be interested in knowing that if anyone happens to know.

She didn't exactly become a recluse. She just doesn't give interviews or write novels. She does have friends and family and she travels frequently.

You're right. Feel free to correct typos and other errors yourself.

Oxford

Does anyone know what college Ms. Lee went to at Oxford and what she studied while there?

I believe she was studying law when she went to Oxford for a one-year exchange program from the University of Alabama. I can't find a reference to which college she joined.

 Wikipedia limits itself to information that is verifiable. Since there is no verifiable information about Lee's literary ambitions (and not much about her private life at all), the subject is not detailed here.  

NY Times
New York Times had a January 31 (2006) article with an update on Lee's life.unsigned comment by User:160.39.187.226

Claims of descent from Robert E. Lee

Our article claimed that Harper Lee was a descendant of the Confederate General. A reader sent an e-mail to the Robert E. Lee Memorial Association to confirm this. They advised: I regret that Harper Lee is not a descendant of General Robert E. Lee.  There is a chart of Gen. Lee's descendants on the Stratford web site www.stratfordhall.org.  Click on """"history"""" in the left navigation bar, then click on Robert E. Lee, scroll to the bottom of his page and see the link to his family tree.  General Robert E. Lee has very few descendants, considering that he had seven children.  None of his daughters married and only two of his sons had children.  I hope that this information is helpful.

The claim has been removed from our article.  
 Thank you for your research and correction. (direct link to Lee's family tree)

You really don't seem to have got the hang of WP:NPOV/FAQ policy, and are advised to follow it carefully. Oh, and blanking your talk page is your right but it isn't impressive. . , talk 

I blanked the page because there was a lot of unnecessary old stuff on it.  

I know the NPOV extremely well and I'm always fighting against the EXTREME POV of Evolutionists.  The stuff I changed on Flood Geology is an example of extreme evolutionary POV.  I changed it to reflect reality.  Problem is, most Eovlutionists are completely unable to see their own POV.  And most of the editors of Flood Geology are not geologists.  I am an undergrad paleontologist.

Stop edit warring please
Stop edit warring on Flood geology to insert fringe claims, or you will be blocked. Please read WP:3RR, too.  | talk .

This topic is about a fringe belief so it ought to accurately reflect what flood geologists actually say.  But it is nonsense and full of misinformation and outright lies.  Not one of the editors defending the Evolutionary faith are geologists.  They just keep repeating the same nonsense debunked by creationists ages ago.     
The topic is about a fringe belief, so it ought to be written from a fringe point of view..? No, that's a mistake. For the amount of attention, and kind of attention, that is appropriate to what creationists have or have not """"debunked"""", see WP:UNDUE. Try to take Wikipedia policies on board, or you will find yourself blocked.  | talk .
I didn't say """"written from a fringe POV"""" I said it should reflect what flood geologists actually say, not what enemies says they say.  There is a big difference.  If critics wish to comment on what flood geologists actually say, fine.  But at least the actual position of flood geologists should be accurately presented.  As written, the page is deeply flawed and pushes a single POV.  The problem is that most evolutionists are totally ignorant of and blind to their POV pushing.  They actually think that they have no bias!! I am very familiar with WP policies, which I why I'm trying to get fair hearing instead of the deeply biased presentations currently on WP.     
You're misrepresenting your edits.The reason I warn you against edit warring is that you have recently reverted three times, within a short period of time, to insert one and the same change to the article: from """"This was interpreted as being the result of massive flooding, though it is now known that they are the product of ice age glaciations (an unknown phenomenon at that time)"""" to """"This was interpreted as being the result of massive flooding, though it is now interpreted as the product of ice age glaciations (an unknown phenomenon at that time)."""" And you say that change is about """"the actual position of flood geologists""""? No it isn't. You're changing, over and over, the description of the position of mainstream science. That's the exact opposite of what you claim to be doing. If you're """"very familiar with WP policies"""", I have to suppose you simply don't like them. I'm afraid I'm going to enforce them just the same: don't edit war any more, on this or any other article, or I will block you.  | talk .
And you honestly don't see the POV in """"known"""" versus """"interpreted""""?  Good grief.  You could say """"generally interpreted"""", """"almost always interepreted"""" or possibly someting like """"the current consensus is that it is"""" and they would all probably be acceptable.  Consensus is an opinion.  Present it as fact and you are pushing POV.  Unfortunately majority POV is generally accepted as no POV on WP.  That is a serious flaw, and a significant hit to WP's credibility.  Also, it take at least two to edit war.  It does no good to cry """"foul"""" when another editor is as determined as you are over a differnce.

 Super Mario RPG lists 

You asked why List of locations in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars was redirected to Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars in Talk:Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. I have restored the list of locations, and we are discussing it on its talk page. Could you please take a look? If you have time, please also look at List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and Smithy Gang. Thanks!  

Currently, Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars has two lists pertaining to it (List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, and List of locations in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars). User:TTN decided it would be best to merge the lists into the main article and split Smithy Gang into those articles. I recently merged Smithy Gang into the list of chatacters by removing the non-notable characters, and I have asserted that a cameo section in the list of characters is valid, per Wikipedia:Trivia sections and Wikipedia:Handling trivia that uses Alex Trebek#Cameos as a good example. I have suggested that we rename the articles per Wikipedia:Requested moves#Requesting potentially controversial moves to something along the lines of Characters of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and World of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars or Mushroom Kingdom (Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars) just like Characters of Final Fantasy VIII and World of Final Fantasy VI or Gaia (Final Fantasy VII). I believe if these articles are to evolve beyond a non-notable list, they should be renamed. For example, List of Final Fantasy VII locations was merged into Gaia (Final Fantasy VII), because a World article is notable, but a simple list of locations is not. That is why there are other secions of the article to make it a World article. It simply has not been renamed yet.

TTN believes the citations in the development and reception sections of the list of locations, books and magazines, are trivial sources. When I added that the 3D perspective of the game is reminicent of Equinox to the main article, TTN removed it since my souce was """"the opinions of the Nintendo Power player's guide writers"""". Although it was actually Nintendo Power magazine, I do believe a magazine is a reliable source, and I gave a page from Next Generation Magazine which also said the same thing. In addition, I was surprized that TTN said that it was from the players guide, since he claims to own the players guide for the game. He has not verified this, since I asked him for citations in May, """"Could you look in the back of the Player's Guide and tell me what “types” of … Magic? I forgot what they call it in the game … well, anyways, what types of Special Attack or whatever it is (actually, could you find out what it's called?) there are? I remember some vaguely when I owned the guide like “Fire”, “Jump”, “Electricity?”, etc. Could you provide a citation, like the page number with a quote in context?"""" TTN replied that he was going to """"get to it"""" (User talk:TTN/Archive 5#List of locations in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars). TTN claims the player's guide is """"at the bottom of a box that's behind at least five others in a cramped space"""". Seeing that TTN did not recognize that the page was not from the player's guide when I provided a scan of the page in question from Nintendo Power shocked me. However, I have continued to assume good faith by not questioning TTN's honesty.

Per Wikipedia:Consensus#Consensus can change, I have offered five different reasonable, temporary compromises that might integrate my idea with TTN's.
Go over the list of characters so we can delete non–notable characters 
Rename the articles by following the steps at Wikipedia:Requested moves#Requesting potentially controversial moves. 
Cut down the geography section list of locations by cutting it into the regional maps the adventures use when traveling from one to another. I can get pictures and write the fair use rationals, and someone can cut down the text that has no citation and does not allude to other media. 
Write the concept and creation and reception sections for the list of characters 
Write the concept and creation section for the main article

"MSU Interview 

Dear Jimfbleak,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar",0

"oh the classic SM/DF response. That was only one of a range of clumsy stupid errors added into the article. For example, we put the first title held by a monarch first. James was James VI of Scotland long before he became James I of England. So everyone agreed that that was the order they should be in. But in typical SM/DF style it was decided, 'screw everyone else's agreement, I am going to unilaterally change it. (Like Adam tried to screw up naming conventions, and even when voted down still ignored the decision and did it Adam's way, leaving everyone else to rename articles and clear up the mess by returning things to the agreed formula. 

Second, there was a long long long debate about when to describe a modern monarch as British. It was agreed to apply it to after 1707. But Adam decided to ignore the long debate and do it his way, his way on the naming of election pages (who cares if everyone else uses a totally different system and votes down his suggestion!), his way on referring to peers, his way on using the word British, on how to describe James VI/I, his way now on the History of the Soviet Union, his way on how names on a list should appear (the different way to everyone else's, he unilaterally changing lists to suit what he wanted, even when everyone else screamed 'what the hell are you doing'.  Other people put a lot of work into getting a consensus. Adam ignores the consensus and does it the way he wants. And gets miffed when people end up undoing his garbled stuff and return things to the agreed way.

Yes there has been an improvement, cp. DF was actually nice to work with for about 4 days, then suddenly became an ogre on idolatory and various other pages. The immediate reaction was 'oh God, here we go again'. Even Mav let out a sigh about DF's behaviour, and Mav doesn't normally do that. Most of us are fed up trying to explain to SM/DF where they are wrong, only to be ignored and blatently untrue rubbish dumped into articles. So we aren't been called rascists and nazis, big deal! SM/DF's behaviour is still way of the mark. It is as if Adam goes onto wiki with the basic approach of 'now where can I cause grief today?'. And we have all had enough of it.  05:15 Apr 13, 2003 (UTC)",0

 A quick question on Aaron López 

I'm guessing that the nationality standard being used here is the same as the one I'm using on the all-time MLS club rosters: nationality by national team (including youth national teams), and in cases where there is no national team participation, nationality by birthplace.  Aaron López was born in Mexico, raised in the US, played ODP, but never made an appearance for a US youth national team...and thus counts as Mexican, correct?  You indeed have him listed as Mexican here, and since this is the most exhaustively-researched list on Wikipedia, I assume that you are aware of everything I mentioned and based your decision on those factors.  So, anyway, I'm popping in to double-check my impression: ODP does not count for purposes of determining nationality, correct? ''' 《Defender of Open Editing》''' """,0

"I think you don't see what I mean. My concern is not with the content but with the terminology. The word 'basin' has three definitions: a structural/tectonic one, a sedimentary one and a geomorphological one. All three seem in some way to apply to the London Basin (and the exact boundaries of the London Basin may differ depending on the definition!). The word syncline only has one definition, a structural one. The original sentense called an apple a kind of pear. 
I agree with you that the synclinal structure is essential and should be discussed, preferably in the header of the article. But a syncline is in itself not a sedimentary basin. It is a structure on its own. The occurence of a syncline at the core of a basin is, however, usually not accidental. When strata are folded, someone may of course think the synclines will form a basin. In nature though, uplift is never quick enough to create structural basins in this way, certainly not at the scale of the London Basin. Erosion will remove the anticlines and sediments will fill the synclines almost instantly (instantly in geologic time). As folding continues, so will erosion and sedimentation. Eventually a structure will form which is both a structural syncline and a sedimentary basin (a basin in the sense of: a place where sediments have accumulated). This model is called syn-tectonic deposition (or syn-depositional folding). As far as I see, this may well be the case for the London Basin, but I am not sure since we haven't found conclusive information in the sources yet.
There is another way how the strata can be folded into a syncline: pre-tectonic deposition (or post-depositional folding). It is important to find out which of the two models applies. The test will be that in a syntectonic basin, the strata will wedge out in the direction of the edges, while in a pre-tectonic basin, the strata will on average have the same thickness everywhere. The outcrop pattern on the geologic map doesn't show the difference, because the map is not detailed enough.
That the older strata of the Chalk are also folded by the syncline is clear, but I don't see what that has to do with the basin on top of them?",0

I may be wrong but your reference to WP:HiddenFunction concerns hiding text not to a collapsible table.
'''As of December 29, 2006, this technique is disabled on this wiki. The class hiddenStructure still exists in the CSS, but now outlines the text in green instead of hiding the text. This is to find any remaining instances of hiddenStructure in templates. Note that this only disables use of the CSS class hiddenStructure. It does not prevent use of similar tags like display: none or visibility: hidden.

The collapsible boxes contain information that serves as an addendum to what is in the article. It adds to the reading experience by making the page neater. The example I used with the """"Genes"""" is a prime example, looking at that abortion is enough to give somebody a headache.

The collapsible boxes I added in the Auschwitz concentration camp and the Mathausen concentration camp articles, among others, makes the pages look neater and more interesting. Nobody has complained about:WP:ACCESS.

Now that I'm unblocked, I can post my reply to you.

You are again using the same tactics you used a few weeks ago, in an apparent effort to censor me, and to prevent me from trying to improve this page by adding more credible information.

Immediately after challenging me this last time, you had me blocked so that I could not respond.  One wonders what you are afraid of. You appear to fit the profile of those who use sneaky maneuvers to block people or to otherwise prevent edits containing information you disagree with, from ever seeing the light of day on Wikipedia. As reported on CNN and ABC last month, these tactics are why Wikipedia has been attacked so much lately, and why it's being taken less and less seriously as time goes on.  Such behavior is slowly turning Wikipeidia into a bit of a joke, and has helped diminish it's once significant potential for good.

Your attempts at censorship reminds one of the scene in a movie years ago where a person who was about to be exposed on the front pages of their local newspaper, got up early the morning it was to be delivered, and ran through their neighborhood picking up all their neighbors' papers, in the misplaced belief that their neighbors would never learn the truth that was on the front page of that morning's paper.

Interestingly, rather than trying to support your allegations of danger and harmfulness with solid facts and evidence, you and others who share a common point of view that poppers are bad, continue to attack those who actually possess a high level of knowledge about these compounds. If you don't like what people with whom you do not agree try to post, rather than debating from a position of solid facts and underlying supporting documentation, you try to 'shoot the  messenger'.

For example, in addition to your maneuvers to block me and prevent me from replying to your attacks or to post edits with accurate and clarifying information on nitrites/poppers, you attack me by implying that my screen name, 'Allabout' means I sell poppers.

You are wrong.

You also imply that I  am """"associated with http://www.allaboutpoppers.com/"""".

Again, you are wrong. 

However, I happen to agree with those who say that the 'All About Poppers' site contains a great deal of credible information, supported with solid evidence. I've spent a great deal of time reading the site, and digging into the information presented there. I know of other similarly credible popper sites, as well.  Would you say I am """"associated"""" with them, too?

As the record clearly shows, over the past few weeks, you and others (Some of whom may be one in the same, perhaps using proxy servers to mask true identities to try to avoid being charged with sock puppetry),  have engaged in an ongoing effort to prevent myself and others, with whom you do no agree on the subject of nitrites and poppers, from contributing to this page with some of our knowledge.  That is wrong, and you know it. (I note that, today, you have somehow successfully removed/erased the history that was showing up on the site's 'history' page. This history showed the """"summary"""" comments for various edits.  It now appears you've allowed it back  in.)

You say, """"just tell me: If this is all wrong and misleading......."""".

I have not said """"this is all wrong and misleading"""". There is information on this page which is accurate, and there's information on this page which is not accurate.  But, when someone who is knowledgeable makes an effort to correct the inaccuracies on the page, they have been attacked with ongoing and relentless efforts to try to prevent their edits from remaining on the page. The record is very clear in that regard. (Again, as anyone can see, you have removed or erased the history for this page up until two reverts you did late on Jan 4, 2006)

You ask me """"why did you use this disclaimer"""". 

I wondered if those of you who have put up such a resistance to having more accurate information posted on this nitrites/poppers page, might have some personal hang ups or prejudices about some of the people whom they perceive as primarily using poppers recreationally. Are you homophobic?  Opposed to consenting adults making informed decisions about whether or not to have fun and take pleasure from something you may not agree with?  Anti-drug crusaders? Feel obliged to fight """"sin"""" and """"pleasure"""" wherever you find it, perhaps based on some deeply held religious beliefs? Or simply just believe that if you give people information, no matter how accurate it may be, that might indicate poppers may not be as harmful as some would like us to believe, that people will flock to them, and that somehow the end of the world will appear?  Much as in """"Reefer Madness""""?

The disclaimer was meant to try to appease those fears.  Unlik",0

""":Moncrief, do you even know what a shepherd is? I used to work on a cattle ranch, so I know a bit about this stuff. To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, """"A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others."""" The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.

I am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a """"rodeo cowboy"""" to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd. But since I don't want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page, I'll settle for that as a compromise. Chris

 Quoting emails 
Increasingly, some parties are quoting emails from the leaked archive (ex. . I thought that this was not to be done (""""No quoting of any email is to be done by persons other than the author or intended recipient(s)"""")? Am I mistaken? | talk  
I believe the intention of the provision you have quoted, is to prevent wide-scale quoting of entire emails and entire email exchanges; that is the assumption I will work off when taking affirmative action (as opposed to reactive action, such as this), although I invite you to have the Committee comment on my interpretation of it. Regardless, I'll ask Offliner to paraphrase what you wrote on the mailing list, although having him do this could be to your disadvantage as it provides him the opportunity to represent what you said on the mailing list in whatever way and with whatever language he chooses.   
Daniel, I don’t mind you removing my entire section (at your discretion) for as long as you read it, by going back to my post, and relating to the particulars listed in it. However, there’s nothing in the initial provisions of this case indicating that you’re supposed to prevent only wide-scale quoting of entire emails and email exchanges. – That is your own interpretation of the warning which needs to be confirmed by the Committee. Meanwhile, quoting of illegally accessed emails includes also explaining in ones own words what’s in those emails, which in a way is even worse, because paraphrasing other people is obviously tainted by personal agendas. Cheers,  talk 
Quoting, out-of-context and possibly doctored emails is creating, IMHO, more problems than paraphrasing, as it gives an air of legitimacy to this harassment campaign. PS. Offliner is not the ony party quoting @s, Russavia is doing that as well. | talk  
(edit conflict) I'm charged, as the Clerk of the case, to interpret the directives I receive. Until such a time as I am explicitly overruled by the Committee, how I interpret those directives is how the case will be run. I have interpreted the directives and disallowing the quoting of the contents of emails, allowing the subjects of emails, and allowing the paraphrasing of content of emails where said paraphrasing. If you're concerned about mis-paraphrasing, the other alternative is to give permission to be quoted; otherwise, your emails can and will be paraphrased within reason. If you believe a paraphrase is misleading, you are free to address it in your own evidence section.
These are the rules for the case.   
And in response to Piotrus, either allow yourself to be quoted explicitly, or refute the paraphrasing in your evidence section, or else appeal my decision to the Committee by email to arbcom-l@lists.wikimedia.org.

""") This tort reform debate is extremely hot in the sense that although there are no reasonable people in favor of tort reform, it is the position pushed forward by the owners of Conngress and the courts. Still, those owners of government do not get to vote in this country (USA), and they must convince the voters to vote for the political candidates that will do their biddingsuch candidates are nearly always a member of one or the other of the two major political parties (about half from one party, half from the other). So the hot debate is not so much a partisan debate along """"party lines"""" (note you will not be able to see such lines ona cloudy day, so don't bother to look for them), as it is along the lines of which elected or appointed officials are willing to come out of the closet as kept mistresses, and openly do the bidding of their masters. It's a true nail-biter. The """"debate"""" has been keeping """"voters"""" on the edge of their seats for years, even though numerous laws have been passed that could count as tort reform, if the counters were honest. For example, the 1995 Securities Litigation Reform Act, and numerous court decisisons (there's one in front of the Supremem Court nowwonder if the little guy will win?) which limits the ability of defrauded mom and pop investors in teh stock market to sue fraudulent companiesmany of which are operating under the guise of a Fortune 500 firm, as Enron did.

(This paragraph is about the article on tort reform and how to make it better, and asking for collective discussion. Please do not delete from discussion on tort reform article.  ) Tort reform is everywhere like love in the 60s. It is the wave of the future. Someday all of us will wear ankle bracelets and be glad we are not behind bars thanks only to tort reform.

(This paragraph is about the article on tort reform and how to make it better, and asking for collective discussion. Please do not delete from discussion on tort reform article.  ) So, in conclusion, it is plain that an objective or neutral POV on tort reform will be difficut to achieve. Nonetheless, I applaud those who tried to square the circle and turn lead into gold. However, anyone claiming to be attempting to achieve neutrality on tort reform is by their own admission working for the devil. RUReady2Testify

"Importing Module:Convert 

At my test2 talk (last September), you mentioned that there is currently no way to import a page from test2 to here, but that in principle test2 could be added as an import source (diff of your comment).

My reading of Help:Import shows that I do not have the rights to do an import, even if it were possible. Also, it seems unlikely that test2 would be added because import looks like a big deal (although something specifically for importing modules conceivably could be done, and no doubt someone like  could import stuff if required.

There's no rush, and we'll see what takes place when Scribunto is enabled in a day or two, but I would like to import Module:Convert and Module:Convertdata to here for easier comparison with the existing templates. My current intention is to create the modules here with a copy/paste and a suitable edit summary including a link to the source (I would do that after the Module namespace is created here).

The next issue would be to create a template to invoke the module. Obviously it won't be Template:Convert. I could do a user subpage then test with something like {{User Johnuniq:convert|...}}, but that is klunky, and would be unsuitable in an article if I get bold enough to see how it goes in an article with some convert templates. Another possibility would be to create a standard template, something like [[Template:Xconvert]] or [[Template:convertz]] ( exists).

Do you have any thoughts about the copy/paste or template?",0

 Would you take on a project?? 

There are two users, currently both with a week-long block for edit warring over an article Che Guevara (photo), although the blocking admin is vacillating, suggesting an RFC which I know is useless. One of the editors, User:Redthoreau, I tangled with a while ago and ultimately ended up nominating the article in question for FAR, Wikipedia:Featured article review/Che Guevara/archive1. The other editor User:Damiens.rf I don't know, but his current complain is that 61 quotations in an article is too many. 

The blocking admin User talk:EdJohnston wants to handle the situation constructively but does not know how. I suggested to him that someone like you, an experienced editor might be willing to be a neutral editor between the two, focused on article quality.

I suggested you (and perhaps also User talk:Geometry guy) to direct the warring editors to concentrate on article quality. My experience in the past with User:Redthoreau is that he does rather well when a """"father figure"""" type takes an interest. Some of his obnoxiousness, I believe, is due to youthful aggression and ignorance. I think he would respond positively to someone whose goal was to produce a quality article. As he dominates all things Guevara, the only way to improve the Guevara articles on Wikipedia is to move  Redthoreau over onto the side of the forces of good.

Since the focus would just be this one article, and your job would be to render advice/judgement on article criteria, I think the job would not be unduly burdensome. Redthoreau had a past mentor-like relationship with User:Coppertwig and did very well when pointed in the right direction behaviourally. (Of course, you may not be quite the right model there!)

Would you consider taking on this project? It might be just up your alley. I figure that since Redthoreau is not going to go away, he may as well put all that energy into writing articles that don't have 61 quotations in them. How about it?  — (Talk) """,0

 Request opinion of Muslim editor 

Hello. Could you please stop by Talk:Christianity and give your opinion? We are debating whether the word 'monotheism' should be included in the intro to the Christianity article. According to most dictionaries, the definition of monotheism is The dogma or belief that there is one God. Now, all Christians believe there is one God and all Christian creeds (such as the Nicene Creed and Chalcedonian Creed) profess a belief in one God. The point of contention is the Holy Trinity. Christians believe that God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit all make up one [[Ousia|essense] of God, i.e. are three parts of one God (known as hypostasis). Now, several editors think that because this is different from the Islamic view of Tawhidand they alledge Muslims think Christians are not monotheistic, but [[tritheistic]we cannot say Christianity is monotheistic like is done in the Islam article. Many editors content, however, that the definition of monotheism is based solely on belief, not truth. So if Christians believe their God is one God, they are by definition monotheistic, even if they may not be right. All it takes to be monotheistic is to believe there is one God. Others, however, think we can only say """"Christianity is a monotheistic religion according to its followers."""" Again, some editors (including myself) have issue with this because it's basically like saying """"Christianity believes it believes that there is one God,"""" which of course is redundant. In my opinion, monotheism by definition is the belief! None-the-less, we would like to know from a Muslim editor: 1) Do Muslims view Christianity as tritheistic? 2) If so, does this view affect that fact that Christians think their God is one God (even though they may not be right), and if not, aren't Christians by definition monotheistic? Sorry for the long post, but there's a lot of debate I had to summarize. Thanks, — """,0

Not sure what all this Joel Campbell / NASA 399 / Langley / impersonation business is - seems irrelevant.

Sorry, did Bastun just claim to be an outsider to this article?! Codswallop. Yes, I was sugesting Off2riorob was an outside opinion, since he'd never edited the article before. Are you suggesting that his opinion isn't valid because he posted before you, but if he was asked and he reiterated his previous comments that he'd then become an outside opinion? 

Have you actually read WP:NOTCENSORED? If you have, perhaps you could actually explain which part of it is relevant to your argument.

Naturally you might not have seen that, but a look in the talk page archives would have shown you the nature of the dispute.

There is no attempt to """"censor"""" this information from Wikipedia, it is currently sat in Gerry Adams Sr. without a problem. However there's no direct relevance to this article, since Adams states he has no recollection of being abused and wasn't aware of it until the 1990s. Why would we write about Gerry Sr. on the Liam Adams article, should it ever be created which I doubt will happen in the near future at least. That would be synthesis of the gravest order, attempting to imply a cause-effect link because one case of abuse and another when nobody has said Liam Adams was a victim of abuse by Gerry Sr. 

It would seem that Bastun is very much swimming against the tide of consensus, having failed to offer any cogent explanation as to exactly how this information is relevant to this particular article he's now making wild accusations of censorship. Tiresome. 303 """,0

I stand by my deletion on the skepticism page. I didn't delete the whole article by any means. I removed the part about false skepticism because it is unprovable and inhereintly doesn't go together. False being the opposite of truth, and skepticism believeing nothing to be certain. To be a false skeptic is impossible to prove and is not a view point but a chance for people to oppose halocaust deniers and such in a biased way on the wiki. I believe that most likely the halocause for example happened, but I am not going to say it is """"false skepticism"""" nor are the """"sources"""" any more reliable or proving anything. So you know how to report better, have better contacts, and tend to have a majority(or enough active members) to back your agenda. Then martyr me and get it over with. It is better to delete it since I legitamately believe it to be unsalvagable and completly opinionated to the point that is pushes a biased agenda. The whole point of the page is for the reader to decide what is skepticism and to go from their. Lets make this more of a history book and less of a language arts book. More of a tratise on the basics of known science rather than meta physics and quantum theory.

Therefore the discussion should continue at Template talk:Infobox musical artist until the fields and labels of the info box are altered to be in line with this proposal.

 Borisoglebsk 2 

After testing of the new Russian """"anti-high-tech"""" Borisoglebsk 2 in Ukraine, this new Russian weapon system appears to jam all communication as well as GPS-system. Hence a question about all other """"high-tech"""" weapon rises. This has suddenly frightened American military as well as NATO. According to (a right wing) Swedish morning newspaper, with good international reputation.
I can't see what was undue in my contibution. Can America just take it for granted that F-35 can't be stopped by Borisoglebsk 2 ? It doesn't seem so to me. OK it's early days still, but fact is neither the American Airforce or NATO know if the Borisoglebsk 2 system will make the F-35 inoperable. But EMP pulses from huge nuclear detornations and from the sun is no news. Neither is jamming. I think all possible counter weapons belongs to the weapon article. (Also if/when an anti-Borisoglebsk 2 weapon is invented.) 
Generally ,if the best assult weapon can be made inoperable by a even better defence system, such matters goes together. And it's not I who ask whether the F-35 stands up towards the Borisoglebsk 2, according to the source, ist it NATO and America who wonders. (Presumably Russia as well)   """,0

The claim of the ideal state of affairs can only come about, if it includes this criteria is false:

The claim:

The marginal rate of transformation in production is identical for all products. This occurs when it is impossible to increase the production of any good without reducing the production of other goods.

This is a false claim with the following counter-example:

The United States no longer sees horse-carriages that have been replaced by the automobile.  The increased production of the automobile reduced the production of the horse-carriage implying that Pareto efficiency never existed or could never exist, because it cannot account for all things including future technology that greatly improved the efficiency of all things by the automobile (the United State production capability after adjusting for inflation and other economic factors from 1950 to 1990 and the automobile and resulting highways was just one technology influence of this).  The automobile technology is about 120 years old, and the horse-carriage has been around since time immemorial, but the horse-carriage is now is very uncommon and replaced by the automobile.

Since by definition to counterfeit is to: “try to deceive by pretense or dissembling.” the propagation of a false definition of the word ‘Ebonics’ as being a synonym for BE, AAVE other English language based appellations, with the intent to deceive, is larcenous counterfeiting. Given that by definition """"to steal and pass off the ideas or words of another as one’s own"""" and using a """"created production without crediting the source"""" is plagiarism or literary theft, when use is made of the word Ebonics (an original idea and word coined by Dr. Robert Williams as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, this deceptive pattern of practice is ‘plagiaristic’ dishonesty or ‘literary theft’ that violates national and international laws protecting ‘intellectual property’ rights. This kind of plagiarism or stealth of ‘intellectual property’ via literary theft and the intentional perversion of the truth should not be tolerated and the authors of articles and books as well as publishers of dictionaries including Wikipedia, progating counterfeit and plagiaristic definitions of the word Ebonics must be held accountable.

Jorfer's complaint above is actually deeper than just whether or not 0.999... = 1 .  His issue, rather, is rather the concept of limits actually """"applies"""" to """"real life"""".

The reason that an infinite series in the real number system has a sum equal to the limit of its corresponding partial finite sums is that the real number system is defined in such a way that two numbers which differ by at most an """"infinitesimal"""" quantity must be equal.  The article Archimedean property has a section that explains why the reals have no non-zero strictly positive infinitesimal numbers.  Since 0.999... and 1 differ by at most an infinitesimal quantity, and the only such quanity in the reals is zero, 1 - 0.999... = 0 and thus 1 = 0.999...  """,0

"""

 To attempt to briefly several of Ed's questions from what I can only hope is an Eastern Orthodox Christian POV:
 * Nothing """"compels"""" a just God to """"enforce"""" a person's separation from Him, save the principle of the person's free will. If a person chooses not to love God, or chooses a life separate from God, that amounts to the same as choosing death, since they are cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of life. Looking at the word """"perish"""" in John 3:16, in Greek it is in neither active nor passive voice, but rather """"middle voice"""", which means a better translation would be """"whoever does not believe in him will destroy himself"""". Living in the presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God's love is sometimes described as a """"river of fire"""". Hence both God's goodness and justice are preserved, as well as each person's free will.
 * Also, Jesus did not have to die. To say that he was forced to die would imply that some external force or law is greater than God and forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy has always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus chose to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death's power was overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that's not the same as saying that God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting the Cross like a steed.
 * The Jews did not have to accept Jesus as their Messiah. He simply was their Messiah; it was not an elected office, and their choices did not change this fact, did not prevent his triumphant death or his resurrection. Many Jews did believe in him, many more did not.
 Hope this helps. I'll have to look another time at whether or how any of this should affect the article, as I'm obviously coming in very late to an old discussion.  17:15 Sep 9, 2002 (UTC)""",0

I feel the need to revive the discussion of Hcobb's POV edits, especially with regards to the F-22 and F-35 articles. He has reinserted content that was previously removed because of question to its weight. Now, as the editor who initially removed that content, I'm open to discussion and defense of it should Hcobb wish to do so, but his edit summary on reinserting it was only """"Noting other shoe dropping."""" That is not a counter or a defense. When I removed his content again, he responded with his characteristic outlash on the talk page that made no attempt to connect his comments to the edits he is complaining about. He did so with a highly inflammatory thread title that was directly opposite to the claims made by his own source. I have since responded and renamed the thread title. On F-35, he continues his campaign of attacking edits on the subject, even so far as inserting content that, when he brought it up on the talk page, had little support and was directly questioned.

Such material would be better placed at Hungarian prehistory or Pannonian Basin before the Hungarians, with  links to Great Moravia where appropriate. The current article is almost 200 kb long, and needs more concise summaries more than it needs additional sections. When deciding how much space and depth to devote to a particular aspect of a topic, it is important to take recourse to general sources and reflect their coverage. Beyond the reliable sources threshold, the trustworthiness of a particular source is less important for determining weight in the treatment of a topic than is its generality.

Well, this is definitely Start-class. The usual problems which Stub/Start articles have (fair use rationales, reference formatting etc) aren't there, which is great! Nevertheless, there's still some way to go to get this to B-class, but this can easily be attributed to the fact that the game's only been out for a week. Here are some ideas to improve the article:
You have some good screenshots, but one showing the actual gameplay (interface et al) would be useful.
The gameplay will be largely the same as EQ2, but it's still a good idea to include a brief overview and a link to EverQuest II#Gameplay. Information on new features could also be merged to this section.
Try converting the list of zones to paragraphed text, which is nicer to read.
To make the article easier to navigate, you might want to rename the History of Kunark section to Story and include any other plot details.
Lead needs expansion per WP:LS: summarise the entire article in three or four paragraphs.
Any information on the development of the expansion? When was it announced? Was it on show at any big game shows? Were there any slippages in release dates?
When enough reviews of the game have been released, create a Critical Reception section.

 More discussion on ANI 

Ryan has posted on ANI as follows.  Since I cannot reply there, I reply here.  

Ryan: Peter has been blocked previously on a different account for a harassment campaign against FT2 off wiki. 

Comment: This was hardly a 'campaign'.  Consisted of one off-wiki post on a blog that was deleted the next day.  Arbcom has the full details, these have been agreed.

Ryan: Now he resurrected a new account to evade the block and ended up getting blocked again by Thatcher - after discussion, Thatcher decided to unblock. 

After discussion with Arbcom.  The details of the discussion were private, and have never been disclosed by me or Arbcom or anyone else.

Ryan: Now, Peter has continued this off-wiki harassment campaign, turning to soapboxing his ideas about FT2 on WR. 

The basis of the original 'ideas' have now been admitted as true by certain members of the Arbitration committee.  The new 'ideas' are simply that in effect, FT2 is enabling the paedophile lobby.

Ryan: Today he decided to bring the harassment back on-wiki, claiming FT2 made a CU block to """"support the efforts of paedophiles"""" - the gravity of the harassment is large, coupled with the fact that he has a previous account blocked for exactly the same thing. 

As I have said a number of times above, I said that the effect of this action by FT2 is to enable the pro-paedophile lobby.  Please attend carefully to the grammar of the statement. The effect is that already the Pederasty has been reverted, hideous mistakes and all, such as quotations from Aristotle that never existed.     """,0

Alright, Ched; I can see you are a reasonable person, and I appreciate you taking the time to reply.  I admit that I have taken this too far.  Some of it is an attempt to flush people out and try to understand what is happening.  I have made dozens of edits to to wikipedia over the years (usually not logged in) and I do try to improve it.  It's a great resource; we all know that.  I've had a very small percentage of my edits reverted over the years and it never bothered me.  To give a little history: I read the article and towards the bottom it mentions (2 sources, btw) how 2 Indians were shot, killed, and eaten.  I thought to myself, """"wow, that's pretty surprising; I had always heard that no one was murdered and they just ate people who had died naturally.  I should probably try to emphasize this so other people see it too without having to read down 30 paragraphs.""""  It seems to me that there is quite a difference between eating someone who's already dead, and killing someone to eat them.  Call me crazy.  Anyway, first I added a subheading and also put a mention in the opening paragraph.  I acknowledge that adding it to the opening paragraph was probably overkill, but doesn't this incident at least deserve its own sub-heading?  I challenge you to find the mention of the killings in the current article.  It is very difficult to find without reading the entire article.  And how many times in modern history have people in the USA been killed so they could be eaten?  I suggest to you that this is a noteworthy and highly unusual event.  Anyway, I will stop now.

I also find it weird that all your interventions have always been to support one side against the other as can be confirmed by your edit history.

 SC Info 

Im almost positive that this is not the place I'm supposed to be responding, but there is no reply link at your message.

Part of the reason for my """"offense"""" is that I think your being unfair in referring to it as spam.

If I was just posting """"Hey! Come visit my site,"""" without any contribution, that would be one thing. But, when I posted anything from my own site, I had news attached to it.  You didn't have a problem when I posted the news of the departure of the producers and writers of the movie and linked to RopesOfSilicon.com, and you also didn't have a problem when I posted the purchase of Dreamworks by Paramount and linked to Yahoo! News, but when the news happened to come from my site, even if it is legitimate news, it's spam. I happen to be in a position that I have connections and can make alot more news than other sites. But that shouldn't make the news any less relivant in getting it to people. 

When I take the time and care enough to try to make sure the info is correct, only to have it removed and replaced by the same wrong information, it's very frustrating, and it does come back to us at Ubisoft. For example, someone came to the official forums and said they saw on Wikipedia that Tom Cruise had accept the role of Sam Fisher in the movie. Well that is not true. So I had to correct him and that has happened a few times with a few wrong pieces of information. Which is why I went to the extent to find the correct info. But, if you are not in control of the other pages...and judging by the fact that the incorrect info that I removed has been replaced, it seems those who are in charge seem to perfer having incorrect information posted, so my hands are tied. 

Frankly, I'm getting tired of trying to help and getting railed back for what I see as petty reasons everytime.

"PROBLEMS ON KURDISH ARTICLES

First of all the Kurdish flag is allowed in Iran, but is not sanctioned publicly. Kurds have it in their homes and are allowed to have them. It is certainly not criminal in Iran for Kurds to have the Kurdish flag or symbol as many of my friends do. So edit your statement about it being criminal in Iran. Need I remind you all, that Kurds are ethnic Iranians and have historically enjoyed the greatest liberties in Iran as opposed to the mainstream discrimination Kurds face in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey?  
It is usually Israeli sources, with increasing American and British help and aid, that intentionally falsely claim that the Kurdish flag (which fly the Pan-Iranian colours as does the unofficial flag of the Azerbaijani people and the flag of Tajikistan) is prohibited in Iran. FLYING THE KURDISH FLAG IN IRAN IS NOT CRIMINAL AS MENTION IN ISRAELI SOURCES. 

Furthermore, I go on to read that there was research done that basically proves Kurds and Jews are genetically the same. It seems to me that certain individuals who I can see are Israeli are following the Israeli states policy of editing articles in lines with current events in the Middle East. Kurds are Iranians just as how Russians, Serbs, Poles, and Bulgarians are all Slavic peoples. Israel, the USA, and Britain are trying to create conflict in Iran as was done in the former Yugoslavia by creating problems along ethnic lines. This is called ‘balkanisation.’ The Israelis are doing this covertly through operations in Iraqi Kurdistan.

Propaganda for dividing and conquering people starts with definitions then the manipulation of history. I am an academic in the fields of anthropology and history and an Iranian from a minority group that is neither Persian nor Kurdish. I can tell you that Kurds are definitely ethnic Iranians in all senses from tradition to language, history, culture, identity, and genetics. I am alarmed by the current purging of internet articles that have hidden agendas trying to separate the Iranian identity of Kurds. 

As I was told by a Kurdish professor, Mr. Eskandari in Tehran: “Kurds are Iranian and the entity of Iran as a state and nation was founded by the [main] ancestors of the Kurds, the Mede who established Iran as an empire. One problem that has compounded the issue is that people misuse the term Persian and Iranian. Persians are Iranian, but all Iranians, like the Kurds and Ossetians, are not Persians.”

The Mede and other similar Iranian groups are the ancestors of the Kurds, but not the only just like the ancient Persians are the main ancestors of the modern Persians, but not the only ancestors. 

I ask all the honest people on this site who wish to enhance knowledge not to take part in this fabrication of fact. There was a time when the Turkish government tried to convince Kurds that they were “Mountain Turks” and now there are powers at play that are either trying to disassociate the Kurds from their Iranian identity and origins or make whole generations of proud young Kurds forget or be unaware of their Iranian ethnicity. This is due to geo-strategic schemes. These forces are trying to victimize a whole group of people from knowing their own proud history and culture which is genuinely Iranian. The covert foreign policy of Israel, Britain, and America comes at the expense of the Kurds and even their history and culture.

I was rather intrigued by the addition made by 76.191.230.178, """"that on June 5th, the United States sent Israel ammunition and jet fighters"""", taken from Quigley's """"The Case for Palestine"""" (p. 162). Quigley's book can be viewed on both Google Books and Amazon, where this exact statement appears with a reference to page 216 in Donald Neff's """"Warriors For Jerusalem"""" (1984). I troubled myself to the library and found the relevant paragraphs. In an episode titled """"June 5: Israel Attacks"""", Neff says the following about president Johnson (top of page 216):
""""He also received a message from his friend Arthur Krim. A memorandum to the President that day read: """"Arthur Krim reports that many arms shipments are packed and ready to go to Israel, but are being held up. He thinks it would be most helpful if these could be released.""""
Under the message the President had scribbled: """"1,000 rounds of 105mm artillery shells cleared. 2,000 fuses - availability, Gas masks. New Requests: A-4 jet fighter-bombers Hawk antiaircraft missiles.""""
Before the day was out, Krim was informed that gas masks had already been dispatched to Israel and he left a message for Johnson expressing his appreciation.""""
That's it. The rest of the page deals with various people he met and communicated with, and has nothing to do with arms shipments of any kind. In short, Quigley's assertion that """"on June 5th, the United States sent Israel ammunition and jet fighters"""" is unsupported by the evidence he provides. The only thing documented as sent are gas masks. There's no indication if and when any ammunition had even been dispatched and an Israeli request for jet fighters, possibly made on June 5, somehow becomes jet fighters sent to Israel. In light of this I am deleting the sentence from the article.   """,0

"Why Lineal shouldn't be here 

Let's go back to when the Lineal/The Ring title didn't exist. Back then, there was only a World Champion.

Then the title's were split. First between the WBA (Known also by othernames) and WBC, then later the IBF was recognized and even later the WBO.

When the titles were first split, The Ring Magazine created a The Ring title. This belt was awarded to all reigning World Champions. Challengers could win it by beating them. Should someone vacate it, the only way to win it would be to be recognized by The Ring as the No.1 or No.2 fighter in your division and beat the other man ranked 1 or 2 (Some exceptions were made for No.3)

Then came the unfortunate decision in the 1990s by The Ring to stop awarding these titles. But they did not stop ranking fighters. When the No.1 and No.2 fighters fought and a victor came out, that person was dubbed the Lineal Champion.

An example is Floyd Mayweather, Jr.; Lineal Super Featherweight Champion from 1998-2001 (Ring belts were awarded again in 2002).

Mayweather worked his way up to the No.2 spot and challenged No.1 and WBC Champion Genaro Hernández. He was considered the Lineal Champion because there was no The Ring Champion.

Naseem Hamed won the Lineal title and lost it in a period when The Ring titles weren't being awarded. The man who beat him for his title, Marco Antonio Barrera, was later awarded The Ring title. His Lineal title was switched with the The Ring title because the Lineal title only existed as a substitute. 

This applies for Lennox Lewis. He was awarded the The Ring title when awarding them began again in 2002. Therefore, the Lineal title was NOT on the line in his fight with Vitali Klitschko. Any objections?",0

Because there are too many assholes like User:Aboutmovies allowed to run free, making life shitty for everyone.)  

Now Mr. User:Aboutmovies, apparently having too much time on his hands, snoops through my personal communications on Pcap's talk page. And so, after putting his nose where it doesn't belong, he gets his nose out of whack, and comes to my personal talk page, and attacks me. Why? This guy clearly owed Pcap an apology. He could have offered an apology. He could have quietly slunk off with his tail between his legs, and repented in private. No, instead of doing the right, honorable thing, he instead chooses to attack me. (So who is escalating? He is.) So I called him an asshole, which he richly deserves. So then he escalates some more: he gets you to block me.  You were sucked right into his game.  You did not bother to do any due diligence. AT ALL. You should have blocked him, not me.  Once you realized your mistake, which Pcap points out to you above, you could have offered me an apology, turned around, and blocked Aboutmovies instead. Did you bother to do any of these things? No.  You fucked up.

So to summarize: Fuck off tedder. You are part of the problem, and not part of the solution. The sooner we get rid of fucking asshole admins like you, the better wikipedia will be.",1

"Lists that combine categories 

On the AfD for List of Jewish American criminals and victims you wrote Comment Does anyone think that this sort of list is substantially different from List of Jewish actors and actresses? If so, I'd like to understand exactly why.

I don't know if you're aware that in January 06 there was extensive discussion of the issue of lists that try and combine a person's ethnic or religious affiliation with something completely unrelated to that. The extreme example discussed at some length there was List of Methodist dentists. I missed that discussion, but having looked through it recently as I've watch the AfD comments I'm really disappointed that the community did not come to an acceptable consensus on the question. 

I see a difference between the list you cite and the list under discussion primarily because the 'criminals and victims' is so contentious and potentially offensive. We've seen the comments from User: GorillazFanAdam. While I can see some way in which a list of people who were victims because they were Jewish (gay, missionaries) could have merit (but I'm not sure it warrants inclusion on Wikipedia), I cannot see how a list of criminals could have the same merit. To act in a manner that is criminal is effectively a declaration that the faith into which you were born, or claim by conversion, is effectively a sham. So I am against the list of criminals and victims remaining not only because it not doing anything of value in the context of an encyclopedia but because it is potentially offensive.

As for the list of actors, I am against their creation since they do not seem to have encyclopedic value. Such a list combines two aspects of a person's life that do not inherently have value. A list of Jewish scholars of Christianity, for example, might be a very interesting list. There is a category combination that i see has genuine value. It was said that a List of Islamicist athletes has values because such athletes choose to recognise aspects of the Koran in the way that they compete (women wearing a burka [spelling?] for example). 

So I've come to the position that both lists you mention are unencyclopedic, but was willing to accept the view of a majority that a  List of Jewish actors and actresses was something I can put up with. A List of Jewish American criminals and victims is too contentious to remain.",0

Oppose - The current title is overwhelmingly preferred by the policy of using the most common name, and the manual of style specifically encourages editor discretion. The MOS is great for our writing style and when the official or common name might be unknown, but to argue that it should be used to take an official name with a specifically chosen title that is used by the absolutely overwhelming majority of reliable sources, including books, newspapers, and websites, as well as is the generally common name is fairly absurd. Our title guidelines and policies are unfortunately somewhat murky. But, what it comes down to can be gleaned from Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization), which states that """"an adherence to conventions widely used in the genre are critically important to credibility"""". If Billboard is using a style, and Rolling Stone or the New York Times or Spin or just the bulk of reliable sourcing in general largely use the official title, is it really common sense for us to be saying we shouldn't be following the sources here in order to somehow adhere to conventions and gain credibility? Wikipedia is a unique construct in that our work is so clearly tied and based off of reliable sourcing about the subject  making us stand out and go against the grain here just doesn't make much sense.There's also just the general notion (which certainly should not be the deciding factor in finding consensus) that certain lowercase words just look weird in titles. Perhaps this may give some indication as to why """"like"""" and other 3 or more letter words are very often capitalized in composition titles but words like """"a"""", """"to"""", or """"and"""" often aren't.

 Is Brian really an atheist? 

In the recently aired episode, """"April in Quahog"""", Brian can be clearly observed praying some time after the news report leads the public to believe that a black hole is going to swallow the earth. Also, at the end of the episode, Brian leaves the house saying he made a deal with someone that now that the earth is spared he would go volunteer at the soup kitchen. Based on the context of the situation and Stewie's remark in the background that the 'someone' Brian made a deal with was God, this calls Brian's atheism into question and suggests that he has developed some closeted religious beliefs (though other evidence from previous episodes might lead one to suspect that they have been there all along). There are only two other explanations for this series of events that I can think of: One would be that one of the underlying ideas behind the episode is something to the tune of 'there are no atheists in foxholes', though this is unlikely because Brian can be seen following through with his promise which a person who had temporarily reverted to religion because of fear wouldn't do, let alone that any kind of conservative message is very unlike McFarlane. The other would be that McFarlane is somehow poking fun at peoples' work righteous attitude towards religion, however this is also unlikely because in order to understand the joke, an in depth understanding of what Christianity actually teaches would be required which most people (including McFarlane) likely do not posses.

Happy New Year to you too! I hope that 2009 is a good year for you. It would be hard to top 2008 since you became an admin.

From an uninvolved editor. First off, please chill out. Being blocked is not the end of the world, and the fact that it ends in one week means you are being given a second chance. If you keep behaving this way, it's just going to escalate. No one is looking to silence you. Editing Wikipedia is a privilege, not a right, like driving a car: you'll keep getting warnings and tickets for bad behavior until your license is lifted. If you continue to break policy and tell people to """"fuck off"""" your editing privileges will be revoked. Like real life, it is the way it works. Second, you were told exactly why you were blocked: you violated copyright and harassed the editor who removed the offending material. Did you read WP:COPYPASTE like I had suggested? It clearly states that copying text verbatim from other sources into Wikipedia articles is not allowed. It does not distinguish between works of fiction or non-fiction, therefore it holds for all available written content. Even if you don't agree that the edit was a copyright violation, you should not have reacted so hostilely. If you feel people aren't listening to your side, don't call them """"fascists.""""

 Re: The Call of the Marching Bell 

I'm afraid that I've had to revert your edit.  Frst, your change from Bang-i-dara"""" """"Bang-e-Dara"""" wasn't properly explained.  The sources use a variety of transliterations; for example, the on-line translation uses """"BĀNG-E-DARĀ"""" on the title page and """"Bāng-i-Darā"""" in the text.  Is there good reason to choose one over the other?

Secondly, you seriously over-linked the article.  See Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Overlinking and underlinking: what's the best ratio?:

""""An article may be considered overlinked if any of the following is true:

""""Low added-value items are linked without reason — such as, 1995, 1980s, and 20th century""""

I've replaced some of the goods links that you added, and I've rewritten part of the article so that the problem of transliteration choice is dealt with.   (Talk) 

Hi, while I appreciate your concern for maintianing the quality of the article, I consider your reverts rather abrupt. Except for the linking of years, you do not clearly justify why you reverted other edits:
 E.g. wikilinks to rationality, pragmatism, materialism, spirituality, and patriotism). Although you later re-linked England and Europe and repaired """"articles""""!
 The reason for putting transliterations in Italics is to keep the reader aware of foreign language texts, which is a common practice
 In your edit summary, you blame me for unsourced changes. It is evident that I did not add any new texts for which I had to provide any """"source"""" but if you insist on keeping any part of text, you should provide the relevant citation 
In your edit, you have linked the word Muslim with Islam which are two different articles.
The use of i and e is problematic of transliterating Persian and Urdu texts respectively. But it is good practice to maintain the same standard in one article. The sound of """"e"""" is common pronunciation in Urdu. And as the book predominantly contains Urdu poetry, I followed the same pronunciation pattern.
Many thanks indeed for your messsage. My friendly advice would be to carefully see before any blatant reverts in future. cheers. Talk """,0

As far as I know, the concept of readymades evolved from Dada ideas. Dada-ists used garbage, newspaper-clippings, Objets Trouvees as material to make art. The objet trouvee already contains the """"pop"""" idea of using everyday materials - like newspapers - instead of more classical materials - like paint and canvas.
Duchamp added to this concept by using readymades, he also gave the idea a theoretical context.
Warhol added to this development by using readymade concepts. He took a well-known concept, not necessarily its material representative, and made it the subject of his works. I would say that Warhol used ideas and images in a similar way that Duchamp used objects.
In other words, Warhol or Duchamp may or may not be credited with something, but their """"pointing and calling it art"""" is part of a development that didn't start or stop with their work.

"Hazel Eye Myth==

The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some instances can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. 

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America aswell as areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.

As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown.

Here are some examples of what true hazel eyes are;

Hazel Eye Picture On The Right

The picture on the right hand side of the hazel eye section does not match the description of hazel eyes, as it is blue with central heterochromia (brown around the pupil).

This block is even more outrageous and illegitimate than the first. You didn't even allow me to say anything; that alone makes this charade illegitimate and unacceptable. The whole essence of Dougweller's argument over the last few weeks has been that article talk pages can and should be viewed in isolation when addressing a dispute. Bbb23 and JamesBWatson agreed with him in this regard and that was the main basis for punishing me for the recent conflict that was started by Mzilikazi1939. Therefore my actions of yesterday constitute complete compliance with the rules and the comments from these two administrators. As was made crystal clear on Talk:Aesop yesterday, Mzilikazi and his friends never complied with the rules set out in WP:ERA in their latest attempt to change the article Aesop. I already tried merely correcting their illegal actions and explaining it in edit summaries and personal talk pages but they continued ramming through their illegal changes, so yesterday, even though corrections of rule breaches should not require discussion, I made the peace-making effort of explaining the matter on the talk page Talk:Aesop.

I went above and beyond what was required in order to see a peaceful resolution to Mzilikazi's edit war and I fully complied with both the Wikipedia rules and the wishes of the two administrators who had judged on the issue. If I broke the rules by obeying those administrators then the first block was obviously not valid and therefore an indefinite block now is not allowed. In fact, any punishment now would not be allowed because the alleged rule breach was entirely due to the directions given by Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, i.e. that article talk pages, as asserted by Dougweller, are meant to be viewed in isolation from other talk pages. My peace-making efforts yesterday were most certainly not a """"diatribe""""; it was a clearly and thoughtfully written explanation of what the issue was, how Mzilikazi's actions breached the rules and even how to resolve the matter. Unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi and Dougweller consistently, I included no personal attacks in my efforts of yesterday. Bb23 made the dubious accusation that I had used personal attacks in recent weeks but I reject that entirely; I never called anyone names and I never tried to rely on ad hominem arguments to """"justify"""" my position, unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi in particular. Yesterday's edit was completely free from personal attacks; that's undisputable.

The very fact that Bbb23 would describe yesterday's tactful, eloquent, peace-making effort as """"diatribe"""", an extremely strong word, is more than enough proof that he has strong feelings about the issue and, as per WP:INVOLVED is therefore ineligible to participate in an administrative capacity here. This is a breach of the same policy that User:EncycloPetey broke when he banned me years ago, causing him to be stripped of his administrator status. I was already wondering how Bbb23 could block me the first time with that non-sensical, contradictory excuse for an explanation.

If article talk pages aren't meant to be viewed in isolation then both Aesop's Fables and Aesop are meant to be using the standard English style of dates. That is what I originally insisted but for that I was blocked by Bbb23. However, if, as asserted by Dougweller and agreed to in the rulings of Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, article talk pages are meant to be viewed in isolation then Aesop's Fables is a lost cause and Mzilikazi has got away with his change there but Aesop is still meant to remain in the BC/AD state. Yesterday's edit is in complete compliance with that ruling and I even made the additional effort of explaining it on the talk page to ensure that I could not be successfully accused of making trouble. For anyone who reads what I wrote at Talk:Aesop yesterday, there can be no doubt that not only did I comply with the rules yesterday, but I even went out of my way to work towards ending Mzilikazi's conflict peacefully and in accordance with the proper procedures.(  )""",0

But this is my first time reviewing, so i'll put it on Hold. I'd like someone with more experience to look over my review and see if I got everything. (  )",0

 I think the map is a decent enough feature - it's certainly useful for anyone who doesn't want to wade through the data to see what the overall picture is! However, I agree with the poster above that the """"last poll"""" methodology is somewhat crude - it makes the map too volatile and is open to too much interpretation (if two polls come out on the same day, which is the last one?) I think a rolling average would be too difficult to keep up to date  and too prone to errors - so what I'd suggest is the following: Each poll is scored as Obama, Clinton or Tie (if the lead is less than the margin of error). Then every time a new poll is added, the person adding it does a simple count of the number of """"wins"""" each candidate has in the last three days' polls. If either candidate has a majority, they are awarded the state. If not, it's scored as a tie. If there are no objections, I am happy to go through and do this for the existing data.   20:06""",0

"""":::Re IJA offensive, yes, I think the USSR had no chances against the whole Axis in the case if Britain and the US never existed. However, in this case the Axis would never formed: Hitler was very suspicious of Japan, and there would be no Germano-Japanese alliance.""""

I think it would be REALLY difficult. Still it cannot be said it would be impossible. I'm not saying that confractuations are facts, my goal is try keep this whole thing in the confractuation zone. Therefore mather of personal opinion only. You that are trying to put confractuations as facts.

And the use of """"Britain and the US never existed"""" was too much in my view. They could simple have remained neutral while the Axis fought against the Soviets.

""""Regarding the Japanese decision not to attack the USSR (in Dec 1941 and Dec 1942), they did plan to do so in the case of major Soviet defeats under Moscow or Stalingrad. However, that hadn't happen, and the role of the Western allies was minimal in that. In addition, as some scholars believe, the Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) lesson was duly learnt by the IJA staff.""""

Minimal? Stalin loved the oil embargo that Roosevelt put in Japan. It could have been this very factor that saved his neck. The Japanese were a military government, and both the Army and Navy did put pressure for their attacks. The attack in the in the Pacific was purely desesperation. If Roosevelt didn't mather with the Soviets, it was just question to give the Japanese their oil and good will to put them against Stalin. However at this time the US was already allied with the Soviet cause. And I don't remember were I read now, but the US embassador even treath the Japanese embassador in a conversation if they launched an attack against the USSR.

About Nomonhan, the IJA staff learned some serious lessons on how to FIGHT the Soviets with it. The Army never give up of the idea of attack the USSR. Even the Navy had some simpaty for the cause if it's advance in the Pacific would not be halted. War between the two countries was probably inevitable. Get rid of the Communist treat was one of the largest security problems for Japan. Matsuoka's secretary comments this in the World at War Banzai episodie. He said: """"But when an integration against the north parted [oil] the Army naturally joined up with the Navy"""". Obviosly, only for maintein the war in China and could fight the Soviets in the future because the critical resources needed.

Battle of the Bulge: 

""""Please, clarify""""

Why you don't see the aspects of the battle from the Allied side?

Why the Soviets can loose like they did in Barbarossa and this be extremely analized by hypocrital """"intelectuals"""" like you and the causes of one supossed less than expected performance the Western Allies not be?

Battles are won by several factors. Anacronism is not nice here. The Western Allies win in the Bulge. The Soviet sucess in Bagration for instance, was not garanteed when it was launched. It could had end up much worse than in the Bulge. With even defeat.

Re::: Lend Lease:

Yes, the Soviets could produce everything they needed. Look the link I posted above. The importance of the Lend Lease is well illustrated. Also, no Lend Lease, less material produced, more casualities for the Soviet side. They would resist this and the combined offensive of all the Axis powers? Pehaps, isn't? I'm just trying to point all this is something of impossible complexity, and therefore should be let in the field of personal opinions. 

""""That means about 40,000 German tanks were not built'' And what crew was supposed to drive these tanks? Germany had a desperate situation with personnel, due to the Eastern front""""

Perhaps they wouldn't have if they could master their forces there from the start. 

Also the money and the time spent with the subs could be used to solve many other problems, produced even more refined weapons, and this includes weapons of mass destruction. 

I'm here to """"fight"""" with you as long as I can. But one thing you already admit: you don't belive the USSR could hold all the Axis countries together. Repeating, I said this would be much difficult, but not impossible. Just don't want confractuations as truth. Wars are like plane crash investigation, it's usually not one or the big factor, but several of them together. ;)""",0

Relevant/Accurate Facts?
Many of the facts or generalizations are in fact opinions.  For instance, the suggestion that one million dollars is needed to live in the US without working is highly subjective.   (one could live on $500,000 quite easily, based on the average rate of return for conservative investments like mutual funds.)  Furthermore, actual cash is not necessary - many people live comfortably on businesses worth less than $100,000 that they own.

Also, using Marxist language in the initial definition shows a political POV, as in """"The main defining characteristic of the working class is its dependence on wage-labor (or salaried employment) as the main or only source of income, because of lack of capital assets or land that could provide an alternative source of livelihood.""""  In reality, one could argue that the main defining characteristic is simply whether one is in management or whether one uses physical labor or 'brain' labor.  In today's economy, it is not simply the lack of capital assets or land that may indicate working class, but also a lack of marketable knowledge.  You can own 100 acres of rural land in most US states that would be impossible to earn a living on, while having the right knowledge could earn you a living anywhere.

Finally, the alleged sexual habits of the working class (citing research 57 and 32 years old) is irrelevant to this article unless we are going to take the ridiculous practice of defining working class by their sexual habits.  Also, judging certain sexual habits as sophisticated shows a POV and this whole section is childish. 01:11, 16 October 05""",0

 The very concept of """"discrete mathematics"""" itself is a vague illusion  

The thing is, analysis is like anything else in mathematics. It can be built up from the basic principles of counting. That is, the simplest principles that build the addition function, which we think of as the number of elements in a union of finite disjoint sets of given sizes, and the multiplication function, the exponentiation function, etc, and anything required for general talk of """"the"""" number of objects corresponding to some act of counting, that is, to prove that it is well defined. These basic counting principles are responsible for all of mathematics, including analysis. There is only one mathematics. There is no distinction between discrete and continuous mathematics that is not exposed as an illusion if you look hard enough. There are no walls. 

It's fine to think about discrete mathematics in the same sort of loose way that people think about the distinction between number theory and combinatorics. For example, the Goldbach conjecture is easily stated combinatorially, and that's fine as long as you recognise the inherent looseness in what these two areas of mathematics represent. An article about """"discrete mathematics"""" can never be very good. All it can say, is that discrete mathematics is a hodgepodge of areas of mathematics which do not implictly involve the areas of real or complex analysis, or topology, for their study.

 needs balanced perspective 

Climate change should be discussed with global warming entry – they are one and the same thing.

This has to be a balanced discussion also discussing the forecasts and uncertainties in forecasting temperature / CO2 increase which are proposed as the causes of the examples of climate change that are presented.

Discuss the politicization (sp?) of the entire issue, the role of IPCC, of Gore etc.  This is very much at the heart of the attention and emphasis being given.  

Discussion of post 1950s warming does not mention the pre 1950s temperature drop that is not explained by the forcings and “predictive” climate models. 

The forecasts / predictions are major part of the actual basis for the attention and emphasis in the carefully planned publicity campaign of the IPCC.  IPCC readily acknowledges that their role is to expand awareness to provide push for policy makers.  The 90 / 95 / etc. probabilities are without merit, are not based on independent scientific fact but Delphi polling of scientists who are doing the scientific modeling.  In fact, IPCC acknowledge that it is not possible to predict the future trajectory which is why they are developing scenarios not forecasts.  Scenarios assume a set of initial values or base starting points for the forcings and forecast how these forcings will play out over time.  This does not adequately take into account technological change that is and will continue to occur.  None of this is identified and discussed in this entry.

In this regard, some analogies with Thomas Malthus """"An Essay on the Principle of Population"""" (1798), [aka """"Malthusian catastrophe, Malthusian crisis, Malthusian dilemma, Malthusian disaster, Malthusian trap, or Malthusian limit (Wikipedia)], Paul Ehrlich """"The Population Bomb"""" (1968), Club of Rome """"Limits to Growth"""" (1972), as well as Orsen Well radio case of H.G. Wells """"War of the Worlds"""" (1936) as an example of how the media can be an  effective force in public opinion.

Both in the US and UK court rulings do not allow presenting / discussing the climate change issues without a balanced view of the issues such as mentioned here.  Wikipedia entries should also be required to be required to meet the same standards in presenting balanced views. 

The need for climate change policy is  based on economic evaluation of the future pattern of costs vs. benefit.  The Stern review – which is discussed – has been strongly criticized in peer reviewed journals because of its assumptions and approaches which very greatly favor support the recommendations, which is neither scientific or intellectually honest.  See e.g., the following references.

You seem to have missed the line at the very beginning: 'for current global climate change see global warming'. Merging them would be like merging the history of the United States with the 2008 presidential election...  

The global warming page in the terminology section states that global warming is an example of climate change, a subset as it were. The way these two articles are broken up is completely wrong. 122.104.2.224  

How so? Global climate change is purely the projected change of the climate. Global warming is an example of climate change - it is the heating of the climate. However, if temperatures drop, which many people believed before, that too would be global climate change.

"Difference between Swedish tomte and Jultomten 

From a Swedish perspective, this article seems to wildly alternate between describing a tomte and Jultomten which are very much two different things (albeit the difference has decreased over the years). Like the Swedish article correctly describes, a tomte is a mythical short grey and bearded creature that took care of the farm if treated nicely (or committed horrible mischief if not). The tomte had however nothing to do with handing out presents and existed long before Julbocken (the yule goat) was replaced by the modern Jultomten (basically a mix between a tomte and the American Santa Claus).",0

 Episodes, 

I see this a lot when you edit, but with half hour tv shows, but hour long episodes are counted as two, not one. I would say you wouldn't have to put those in, but the episode list has a section for the production code, so normally most shows,  iCarly, How to Rock , Jessie, etc. if it's an hour long episode for season one the code will be 111-112 because it counts as two and since the wikipedia asks for a production code, I think it's needed. Since itunes does not show production code order rather just list the episodes as their shown on TV, that do not include that. This is why I strongly feel that shows like Victorious (episode""""Freak the Freak Out"""") and others should be listed as two and not one. It was an hour long episode after all, and if you go back and check how many episodes Nickelodeon ordered for the first season of Victorious it says 20, which was also confirmed by the shows creator Dan Schneider. I strongly disagree that it should say 19 (along with other shows that have been edited)""",0

Russell was active in the Fabian socialist movement.  His political thought was certainly very sympathetic to many technocratic ideas, but was generally more abstract than any ideology.  Roads to Freedom makes patent his political promiscuity: Russell was willing to support any movement that would tend to push history towards human freedom, humane social relations, and the rational satisfaction of human needs.  (Although when nuclear war was concerned, he seemed to prefer social injustice to complete ruin).  On the other hand, Russell was deeply skeptical of technology and science in its influence on human society and culture.  The Scientific Outlook was his vision of a scientific dystopia—one which incorporates much of technocracy.  (For the uninitiated: it is somewhat similar to Brave New World).  Although the technocratic elements are not necessarily portrayed in a negative light, they are not left blameless for the resulting society.  All in all, it seems hard to imagine that book could be the work of an enthusiastic technocrat. — 06:39, 27 January 2007",0

More thoughts
Hi KW - I noticed this thread whilst I was on my wikibreak and since I didn't have sufficient time/internet access, I made a note to comment. Before I begin, I'd like to apologise for the accusation of harassment, whilst I was feeling harassed by your comments I believe I over reacted due to the off-wiki stress of moving house. With that agreement above, I'm hoping we can move on. I'm hoping to get RfA Reform wrapped up 2012, there's been some very good research done, a few very resonable proposals which will be brought to the community to decide on them (even if I don't personally agree with them). 
You mention above that the RfA Reform project is dead without an an article writer as a leader, though you and I disagree on what constitutes an article writer, I would love to see one of those names helping in the project - even as co-ordinator. However, since none of them has shown any interest in RfA Reform and they are all busy with other things, I'm not going to hold my breath. Please do feel free to nudge any of them though - I'm sure a comment from you would go down much better than one from me, since I haven't interacted with any particularly. 
As for the unsavoury behaviour towards editors, I am actively trying to minimise this. For example, Keepscases, I did much research into his questions in the last quarter of last year, who removed them, how they were answered and so on. I don't believe I published it on wiki, though I could dig it up for you. From that, I came to the conclusion that Keepscases questions were not a major issue - and discussed that with a few of the editors who had issues with that user. I don't believe there has been any comments regarding Keepscases since, though I know there are still editors who are unhappy with the questions at RfA.
Regarding Malleus Fatuorum, I do endorse a topic ban from discussing administrators, as I believe that would remove the majority of problems and would be a much better solution than a blunt instrument like a block. Unfortunately, that does mean also topic banning him from RfA, which is a pity because his votes generally appear to be well worded (it's the comment's outside the votes, and the comments at WT:RfA which are problematic). In any case, that's a personal opinion, which I've explained with evidence at the the ArbCom case. If ArbCom choose to disagree, I'm not going to persue that further. 
All in all, I'd love to see RfA Reform actually improve RfA - I'm not 100% it can, because of project wide failings, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to try. I'm hoping to do some work improving the de-sysop process too, I'd like to see a more clear system there too. Finally, would you mind laying off the """"RfA Deform"""" comment? It belittles the project and only serves to make things more difficult, you are the only editor who uses that phrase - so I'd appreciate it if you could drop it.  · (talk) """,0

I don't disagree with your point, except that I'm not exactly trying to appease here (I guess it sounded that way though) - I actually think both points of view have merit which is why I'd go with the Anglo-Australian type of construction (and maybe drop the Manx in the first sentence). As I said, if you had asked me before this discussion started where the Bee Gees were from, I would have said Australia, based on how I recall them being promoted in the 60s, and I also totally see the logic of considering them English so the dual wording does make sense to me.   I've looked a bit and haven't come up with anything on the web to answer that question yet - maybe you'll have more luck.   

By the way, Olivia Newton-John may be relevant here:  she is considered Australian as well, and her WIki article calls her """"English-born Australian"""" or words to that effect.  Her bio says she was born in England, moved to Australia at age 5 and moved back to England at 16 where she began recording - a pretty similar story to the BeeGees, and she's listed as Australian which might be how she self-identifies, I don't know.  But on a quick read it appears she only lived there for about 10 years, like them.

As for whether this editing is personal, I have no idea and don't want to get into it.  I do know that I  am trying to reach consensus among different points of view, on this exceedingly minor point - and as I have said, there was some fussing about it a couple of months ago and it settled down with the awkward wording, because it is accurate.  So I hope we can drop this quickly and move on to something more substantive.    """,0

 Conditioning? 
 Introduction
The emergence of reputation systems
How do we identify what is good? And how do we censure what is bad? We will argue that developing a humane reputation system ecology can provide better answers to these two general questions — restraining the baser side of human nature, while liberating the human spirit to reach for ever higher goals.

Most social interactions require matching human needs on the one hand, and quality or taste on the other hand: hunting for a reliable mechanic, looking for an interesting book, sifting through potential investments, judging the merits of proposed policies. Drawing from a distributed pool of reputations has the potential to ease the search for opportunities, ideas, friendships, cultural goods, and high–quality services; hand in hand, pressure will increase for honest behavior, competence, and fulfilling subtle human needs. At the same time, more efficient tagging of con artists, sources of spam, untrue claims, and dishonest actions can better sanction antisocial behavior, for the most part in a bottom–up """"distributed court of opinion.""""

Sustained rapid advances in information technology have created unprecedented abilities, which come along with unprecedented dilemmas. Data has never been easier to create and move around, but to make decisions one also needs to understand its context and implications. Just as important is what lies behind its face value, in realms such as speculative bubbles (Chancellor, 2000), shady financial practices (Partnoy, 2004), and the political statements that are the topic of much of our public discourse.

Access has generally become easier, driven by falling production, communication, and search costs; however, there are consequently far more suggestions, demands, and events to consider, straining our individual information processing capacity. Leaving the computational milieu alone to evolve """"naturally"""" is no guarantee that an ideal or even acceptable society–wide information infrastructure will emerge, as Brin (1999), Lessig (2001), Norman (1994), Schenk (1998), Stallman (2002), Walker (2003), and others have warned. To promote an interconnected ecology of socially beneficial reputation systems, conscious design, analytical modeling, and learning from past successes and failures is indispensable.

Filtering tools are still in their infancy — and having a better window to look out at the world can also imply that others can more easily peek in. Search engines speed up finding similar work done elsewhere; collaboration tools from humble mailing lists to community software to advanced groupware aid both individual and collective problem–solving. Yet it seems that for many important issues, all these tools are not keeping up with the increasing scale and number of decisions we must make, leading to what (Homer–Dixon, 2002) has referred to as an """"ingenuity gap.""""

Sheer computation power is not enough — another factor of 1000 in speed, storage, or bandwidth translates to a more modest gain in making better decisions, and perhaps even a net loss in other forms of effectiveness. (Indeed, if the data or assumptions are noisy enough, the programming aphorism of """"Garbage In, Garbage Out"""" applies.) Those who seek to use technology or the public space of ideas to advance their own agendas can also leverage increased computation power. There is indeed a technological revolution still in progress, reshaping commercial and social interactions — but its ultimate course will be affected by designers, activists, researchers and civil society at large. As (Fischer, 2002) said:

""""Peter Drucker argued that """"there is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all."""" Adding new media and new technologies to existing practices will not change the consumer mindsets of learners and workers. We need to explore new computational media based on fundamental aspects of how we think, create, work, learn, and collaborate ... New tools should not only help people to do known cognitive tasks more easily, but they should lead to fundamental alterations in the way problems are solved.""""
In order for computational advances to translate to widespread social advances, the tools must confer the ability to """"think smarter, not harder"""" — and use our collective evaluations of what is desirable to steer resources away from unproductive negative–sum games. Human brains provide an analogy: the difference between a moron and a genius lies primarily not in more or faster neurons, but in neurons that are wired together more effectively. In the same way, reputation systems are a generic tool that allow our observations, analysis, and actions to be """"wired together"""" more efficiently.

From my standpoint you are the confused. I'm looking at it in the 3rd person. What the alliances were in this ancient time is unclear. Fact is that the Britons were in an anti-Angles coalition and the Angles came with their whole volk to defeat them. If the Britons had contact to the former Roman Empire is unclear but possible. They lived under Roman rule for centuries and were romanized. This defeat was something like de-romanizing to them after 500 years of Roman rule. This can clearly be seen when you read and understand the Roman Britain-Anglo-Saxon battles in Germanic Wars.,0

"Fraudulent Law Degree 

It should be fair commentary to note facts in the articles already referenced concerning the REASON Judge Ware told the fabricated story to hundreds of audiences over a twenty-year period after law school.  The reason cited in all of these articles is that this fabricated story is what motivated him to pursue a law career.  Therefore, it is also fair commentary to question whether this same fabrication that he told for 20 years after law school was part of Judge Ware's personal statement in his application to Stanford Law School, as anyone who has ever applied to law school knows that what motivates you to pursue a law career is the CENTRAL QUESTION in one's personal statement.  The lack of a more thorough investigation into whether Judge Ware told the same fabrication in his personal statement to law school is a CRITICAL ITEM that should be part of the commentary, as it is more likely than not that he did tell the same fabricated story, which would make his law degree fraudulent subjecting him to immediate disbarment.  Obviously, those who would know that this fabrication was on his personal statement would have complete power over this judge's career, making him incapable of delivering justice in particular cases if those with power over him want a different result.",0

By your last sentence, (20:59 30 April) it would seem that we are, perhaps, getting a little closer to nub of our discussion. The article is about his work. The fact that a very large amount of his original work, some 4000 negetives, has survived and been kept together in just two large collections for approximately 100 years is one of the main planks of his notability. The other plank is when and where he practiced. The subjects of his photographs, the people, their clothes, their floating and their static palaces etc. etc. is what is notable.  This collection is a unique, historical, visual record of a long dead era. It is not just a collection of photos of old boats. Kirk was uniquely positioned to photograph a distillation of an aspect of society. That aspect of society existed here and there, now and then, throughout this and other countries. But it came together for a short period each year at Cowes in what I have called a distillation. He did photograph it and his work has remained together, its existence, until recently, known only to a small group.

The trustees of the two collections feel, I am sure, that the photographs are too valuable to be published willy nilly on the internet.  In any event that would be impractical and was not my intention. My plan had been to try to make the collection's scope known. Not as an advertisment but as a dissemination of information.

As an analogy consider the article about a national collection described in page 10 of today's Guardian. The article describes the collection and claims or advocates its importance.  The Collection was started as the Fawcett Library.  Biographical details of Millicent Fawcett are not central to the theme of the article, an account and illustration of the contents of the collection is.   15:00, 1 May",0

Many thanks for checking and investigating. It is a shame there's nothing more recent. From p23 of Curatolo(2003), """"Diagnosic Criteria"""", I get:
The rate of occurrence of tuberous sclerosis at birth is unknown...(paragraph continues with stats trying to come up with a figure)... This indicates that the real incidence at birth may be as high as 1:6000 (Webb et al. 1993, Cardiac rhabdomyomas and their association with tuberous sclerosis, Arch Dis Child 68:367–70)

Earlier, when talking about Hunt and Lindenbaum's 1984 study, he says """"The scientists believed that the birth prevalence might be even higher than it is now considered to be."""" I don't have that paper so don't have more details.

An editorial by Fryer (Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 1991, 84:699) says """"... suggesting a birth incidence of 1:10000"""". I don't have the Osborne paper you mention. I've seen 1:5800 mentioned but don't know its source at present.

My sources seem to use incidence and prevalence interchangeably wrt to birth. I'm happy to change it if you think it may be less ambiguous.

The list of prevalence figures throughout the years comes from Curatolo (2003), Table 2.6, page 22. This in turn is based on an earlier table by Shepherd in his short chapter """"The Epidemiology of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex"""" in the book Gomez 1999. The earlier table doesn't have the O'Callaghan figure.

Bodin (1081 – 1101), king of medieval Croatian Duklja, ushered in a new political era in Serbia.

 Reply in good faith to Ninlil from Srirangam99 

  Dear Ninhil, I thank you very much for intervening... at least this much is accepted by a neutral arbitrator that in case two authors differ in their versions, both versions must be allowed to be retained.  Since you wanted specific instances, in the book named Ancient India (1956) by K.A.N.Sastri, he has stated clearly while describing Rajendra Chola I that among the list of conquests (at one point he stated clearly thus:) 'next was the turn Satyasraya who was defeated and banished out of his capital'.  This can be contrasted with the statement in this Article that Satyasraya was able to control Chola aggression basing his contention on material from author Suryanath Kamath, without commenting on the accuracy of Suryanath Kamath's version, I accept your verdict that both versions should be allowed to be retained.  Dinesh is also erring badly when he writes subsequently in this article about Jayasimha also fighting hard with the Cholas (in fact Rajendra Chola ruled during the time of Satyasraya as well as Jayasimha and has claimed to defeat both) and also goes on to add that both sides lost and won but both K.A.N.Sastri and Rajendra's inscriptions at the Tanjore temple (courtesy the summary of Prof. Huntzsch, noted epigraphist appointed by the Archaelogical Survey of India, a body of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Govt. of India, whose finds are given in detail at inscriptions.whatsindia.com/ - a site despised unnecessarily by Dinesh Kannambadi as a POV site because its findings go against 'historical events and their conclusions' of his liking) state that he emulated his father in winning the 'seven and a half lakshas of Rattapadi' and where Prof. Huntzsch has clearly arrived at the conclusion (after reading Chola inscriptions from the times of Raja Raja Chola because it was from his time onwards that there were several wars between the Cholas and Chalukyas) that winning seven and a half lakshas of Rattapadi meant winning the war and levying tribute on the losing Chalukya king.  Satyasraya lost twice, once to Raja Raja Chola when the Chola army was led by his son Rajendra and once to Rajendra, who also went on to defeat Satyasraya's successor Jayasimha II and Prof. Huntzsch once again attests the expression by Rajendra Chola I in the inscription at the Tanjore temple, a World Heritage site ': """"the seven and a half lakshas of Iratta-padi, (which was) strong by nature, (through the conquest of which) immeasurable fame arose,[7] (and which he took from) Jayasimha, who, out of fear (and) full of vengeance, turned his back at Muyangi and hid himself"""", as the Chola once again winning the war (this time it was over Vengi with the Chola army first routing the Chalukyas near Rajahmundry and subsequently at Masangi (called Muyangi in the Chola inscriptions in Tamil langauge), causing their king Jayasimha to banish and then levying tribute on the defeated Chalukya.' These have been attested by both K.A.N.Sastri and R.C.Roychowdhuri in their two books of the same name i.e. Ancient India.  

To repeat the above, the author R.C.Roychowdhuri in his book Ancient India borrows heavily by quoting extensively from K.A.N.Sastri - this unfortunately, goes against the thinking of user Kannambadi who is repeating blindly that I have no sources - I can assure you certainly I can read and write. It is very poor in taste, the expression of Dinesh Kannambadi who has gone on to justify my previous blocking, as is evident on my talk page dear Ninhil, this was done by user Blinguen an admin probably, who barged into my talk page and blocked me without giving any reason the second time i.e. he violated two rules of Wikipedia which are being advocated by Dinesh Kannambadi and another clique at work in wikipedia, first they ask people like us, who draw from sources and post at times historical events which are not palatable to them,  that we should first post on the discussion page, but in my case I was straight away blocked on the first occasion by user Blinguen who certainly did not discuss with me on the article discussion page nor did he discuss the topic itself with me.  The second time Blinguen entered my talk page, left a comment that he did not like what I wrote for he thought what I wrote was a personal commentary (when in actuality, it was a summary of Chola historty from which I drew from Prof. Huntzsch's summary from inscriptions.whatsindia.com/ but had made the mistake (I am not shy of admitting I make mistakes) of not posting the source, but before I realized and re-entered the Chola page, I found first that I was not able to edit and found to my horror that Blinguen has arrived at a certain conclusion and blocked me without giving me a chance to explain, discuss or argue with me on the concerned topic and its contents, just as Dinesh Kannambadi is trying to do now by painting anyone whose findings",0

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

"Lorenzo Mascheroni (May 13, 1750 - July 14, 1800) was an Italian mathematician, born near Bergamo, Italy.

At first mainly interested in the humanities (poetry and Greek language), he eventually became professor of mathematics at Pavia.

In his Geometria del Compasso (Pavia, 1797), he proved that any geometrical construction which can be done with ruler and compasses, can also be done with compasses alone. However, the priority for this result (now known as the Mohr-Mascheroni theorem) belongs to the Dane Georg Mohr, who published a proof already in 1672.

In his Adnotationes ad calculum integrale Euleri (1790) he published a calculation of what is now known as the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

He died in Paris.",0

 Hu12 administrator apparent libel and abuse 
Report to a Chair:

Hello, this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for Mount Hood, done by administrator Hu12.  Toward the bottom at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mount_Hood#Climbing_Records  

The issue stems from, as you'll see in the article's history section, my interest in adding a simple climbing record listing for Dan Howitt, with the press article references.

Hu12's post:
After going through the """"google results"""" (a disturbing education of sorts), there appears to be a long line of aliases for Dan Howitt, posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related. Appears this is an attempt to use wikipedia to import offsite conflicts and further an adjenda. It has been removed. I'd suggest that Dan Howitt  read the following, Wikipedia:Wikipedia is in the real world and Law Of Unintended ConsequencesHu12

My reply:
Please remove Hu12's Libel and Vandalism above and please report this user's abuse to Wikipedia administration. Also, Hu12 of the """"google results"""" you searched most are in support of Dan Howitt, with tons of his official summit photos on Rainier, Adams, Hood, Shasta, and listings of his timing officials. You strangely give weight to the abusive chat-site gossip and unsupported libel, and your own post above is of that nature. Chat-sites with this sort of conduct are sad. I'm reporting your libel and abuse to the wiki administration.Saffron1x (talk) 

Note Hu12 cites a link above as support for his allegations of Dan Howitt.  In reading the chat-site thread, and note it's a mere chat-site and has a lot of personal attacks, gossip, unfounded content, libel, etc, you will, nevertheless, find considerable support for Howitt including climbing record photos, timing officials names, etc.  Hu12 emphasizes the allegations about the use of aliases, and this is gossip and unsupported.""",0

RfC: Incompatibility between the standard scientific notation for paragroups, and links 

Standard scientific notation for paragroups is to use an asterisk after the name for the haplotype. The very conciseness which makes this a very useful standard, reduces its usefulness as a link

"Reasons why Greece is acting like this 

One of the main rights of humans, as well as countries is the right to freely choose its name.  One of the biggest insults for me is when somebody is trying to change the name of another one.  This time I will not respond to the insults posted by User:Makedonas, User:Nestore and User:Vergina because the language they are using is unacceptable for a serious site like Wikipedia (Just to quote the last comment by User:Makedonas: This is a country which was a part of Jugoslavia,where a lot of people are Albanians,where they speak a bulgarian dialekt,and they want to have a greek name)!!!???. 
For me it is very difficult to understand the offensive position of Greeks trying to change the name of its neighboring country, so I will try to dig in the history and in the recent events in order to find an answer why Greece is doing this.
 History: Undisputable fact is that modern Greeks have very little common with the ancient Macedonians, even with the ancient Greeks!  Actually, all modern nations living in the Balkan Peninsula are modern nations created with mixing the old nations like ancient Greeks, ancient Macedonians, Ilirs etc with the modern Greeks, Slavic population etc.  For example, the most dominant opinion in our country is that the modern Macedonian nation is created as mixture of ancient Macedonians and Slavic population.  Probably the Modern Greek nation has origin from the ancient Greeks and ancient Macedonians, but that doesn’t give him a right to claim ownership of the name Macedonia.
 Another interesting fact is that the name Macedonia was virtually forbidden for use in Greece before seventies in the last century.  Actually, the northern part of Greece was called “Northern Greece”. Meantime, Greeks realized that they can benefit more if they adopt the name of Macedonia. Starting from that point, the northern part of Greece was renamed to Macedonia and many shops, airports, streets etc got the Macedonian name.  So, Greece is using the name Macedonia for its northern part for 30 years, but Republic of Macedonia is using its name officially from 1945 (that is 60 years)!
 One of the biggest fears of Greece is its Macedonian minority. It is known that a large population of Greece claim Macedonian ethnicity. Actually, during the Civil war in Greece from 1945-1949 a real genocide of the Macedonian population took place there.  Many of the Macedonian people were tortured and expelled from their homes.  Nowadays Greece doesn’t recognize the Macedonian minority and forbids the use of Macedonian language, culture, education etc.
 Very interesting fact is the following: Luxembourg and Belgium are neighboring countries. Belgium has a province which is called LUXEMBOURG! So far, Belgium never disputed that.  In our situation, Greece has a province called Macedonia, but aggressively disputes the right of our country to use its name.
 Greece claims that Macedonia has pretensions over Greek territories. Even if that is true, Greece is several times stronger than Macedonia economically, politically, military etc, so it is really hard to believe that Macedonia can harm Greece, especially by using the name Macedonia.",0

"Free Software example 

I'm not sure if the reference to open source as an example of innovation outside the 'traditional' IP model is as strong as it could be. As far as I can see, the 'standard' argument for IP protection is not that it's the only way that people can innovate, but that the overall level of innovation will be much higher with it. 

The fact that 'works of authorship can be written without direct financial incentives' does not in itself contradict the standard IP model. For such criticism to be very strong, you would have to show not only that 'direct financial incentives' are not always required, but also that 'direct financial incentives' do not act as a meaningful incentive to innovate in significant cases.

In other words, the standard IP model does not say that counterexamples cannot exist. It just says that you will get more overall innovation with IP protection that you would without it. Listing counterexamples, without also discussing their wider significance, does not in itself invalidate the 'incentives to innovate' argument. It would perhaps be better to cite studies of the effects of patent reform or something like that.",0

 Animation 

There is something very unique about south park.Because of the style of animation, it is actually possible to have an episode of south park in an .svg animation, which is a file format that allows for unlimited up-conversion of images and animation but only in a way of simple shapes,and since south park is already a somewhat brick style animation, you could theoretically up-convert it to high definition using the .svg format and it would look just like that was the normal resolution.

It would be tresspassing technically but there's a great waterfall on par with the ones you have pictures of (I think its called Fred's Hole or something like that?) out past Tamarac schools on Route 2, driving east there's an old abandoned bridge on the left past where the falls are, if you park there and walk over the bridge and follow the paths back the way you came you'll reach after about a 2 or 3 minute walk the top of the falls. I dont know if kids still go there and jump off the waterfall, but I went there once when I was 17 (all for a girl of course). If you cant get there that way there should be an official looking town-owned building before you get to the bridge, it sits (I believe) roughly right before where the falls and there should be a path from it to the bottom of the falls.

I hope all goes well with you at Wikipedia, and you're as always, enjoying the world's greatest sport.  To answer your question, yes, I am the one who left a nasty message on a user's page whose name now escapes me.  Why did I do it?  He took off the picture of Bobby Abreu that I took, looks like he tried to replace it with a copyrighted photo, and the Abreu article went for a few weeks without an image.  Now I don't mean this as anything personal against you, as I've respected you and your work for years, and you've been nothing but nice to me.  But, what I don't get is this: I can't tell you how many times I've had to re-introduce legititmate images that have been taken down by people who upload stolen images, or images of lesser quality.  This detracts from the quality of articles, and frankly, I think people who detract from the quality of articles should'nt be allowed to edit.  What I don't get is that whenever I pop-off at someone for doing this, I get busted immediately, yet no one replaced the Abreu image, or scores of others that are taken down.  Furthermore, the guy who did this is just another red link - someone who doesn't even bother to fill out a user page.  It's all a matter of common sense and etiquette - it's not the best analogy, but you just don't go to MySpace or Facebook and start putting useless garbage on other people's pages.  
Same goes for Wikipedia - you just don't go around making articles worse, that legitmate volunteers have worked for years to constantly improve.  So, I take it upon myself to discourage users who don't add to the site.  And yes, I've been blocked permanently from editing Wikipedia, but look what happened to the guy who was the ultimate reason for my block.

Constance Cumbey Update on March 5, 2005 at 10:44 p.m., E.S.T.

Squeakbox's allegations about Nazism and editing a Rastafarian page (to the best of my recollection I have never been to such a page  my knowledge about Squeakbox's Rastafarian sympathies came from his own Wikipedia page)are nothing short of libelous and outrageous.  Obviously he has never read my work.  Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same.  Nazism was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself.  Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of """"cleansing actions"""", """"master races"""" and """"aryanism"""" were standard fare in all occult reading  both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists.  As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures.  The Jews were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by Lucis Trust / Lucis Publishing Company.  Just look at the indexes (and you can do free internet searches):  """"Judaism:  evils of""""; """"Judaism, need for dissolution of"""".  I have BATTLED Nazism and racism all of my life, starting at age 4 when I told an aunt, """"that man's not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood.  You're bad because you want to move out just because he's moving in . . .""""  Squeakbox owes me an apology.  He confesses he flunked logic.  He also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument.  For that, I will give him in good Christian style, a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations.  Read the New Age books CAREFULLY and not in an altered state  you will find that they are not all peace, light love.  And people who come against them are not """"Nazis""""  the kernel of Nazism is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde, blue-eyed pagans in its ultimate world view.  I have many a New Age book from the early 1980s in my vast personal collection which tells Orientals, Africans, etc., that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway.  As regards Solana, he is smart enough to see the Club of Rome agenda for what it clearly is  a global population reduction and occult indoctrination program.  The Club of Rome banner is one that Javier Solana flies the most proudly!""",0

The part """"Former Mormons, and now critics of the LDS church,"""" was just added and it raises a question in my mind.

It seems from our article that """"official Church publications"""" and critics of the church AGREE that there have been numerous changes to the text of the Book of Mormon.  If so, the numerous changes seem to be a matter of fact, not a matter of controversy.

In this case, could the section be written in a more straightforward way?  In particular, starting the section with the views of two critics of the church seems to me to suggest that it is a matter of controversy.

New sub-catagory

I wanted to add something about the “Persian or Farsi” controversy, but first wanted to consult everyone on this. Let’s talk about both, the pros and the cons, and keep it impartial. There are valuable issues raised by renowned Persian scholars. I quote from an article on the same subject:

→ Identity Aspect: The word Persian in the mind of an English speaker, consciously or not, recalls many other historical and cultural legacies about Iran. Persian is closely associated with Persian poetry, Persian carpets/rugs, Persian cats, Persian poetry, Persian pistachios, and so on. When you refer to this language as Persian, the audience may associate it with one or more of these relevant ideas. On the contrary, the word Farsi not only voids these historical and cultural associations, but it also adds to the recent portrayal of Iran as a strange and distant society.

→ Calling Persian as Farsi, is as incorrect as calling the Persian Gulf as the Farsi Gulf. Moreover, the name Farsi is obscure and under the best conditions refers only to certain dialects such as the Persian of Iran as opposed to Tajiki, the Persian of Tajikistan or Dari, the Persian of Afghanistan, or even one may say Isfahani, the Persian of Isfahan. 

→ The use of word Farsi in English strikes a discordant tone to the native speaker. Imagine someone speaking in English about their recent trip to Paris saying, """"I went to Paris and there I spoke Francais."""" (Instead of saying French). To use the word Farsi has the same impact and may sound not only pretentious at times but also destructive of English syntax.

We should therefore avoid the use of the word Farsi instead of Persian because it not only violates historical fact but also some of the regularities of the language in which we speak. I believe that Persian is the true and proper name of this language in foreign tongues and international communities and changing it does not benefit the representation of Iranian culture.""",0

death to critics

So instead of  'every' earlier, now you are giving isolated cases, such as Theo van Gogh, Vincent van Gogh, Rashad Khalifa, and Irshad Manji who received death threats or were killed by anonymous unknown radicals.  What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji. Then you need to post evidence that this was consensus among Muslim scholars on each of these cases.  Without that, you don't have any case, and you are refuted once again  09:33, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

 """"Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals!

The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries"""" <- these anonymous radicals represent the sentiments felt by their factions in ISlam -they represent their interpretation of Islam. I also provided examples of critics who were murdered by MUHAMMAD himself. Al-Azhar is not a higher authority than Muhammad.

No, you have only provided two stories in Ibn Ishaq about Muhammad that are rejected by Muslims, such as rejected here.  Al Azhar and Muslim scholars will interpret what Muhammad did and what Islamic law says, not an anti-Islamic bigot like you. You made a bold claim that in Islam critics are to be to be killed. I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again. Since you are an anti-Islamic bigot, you can't just claim that Muhammad did this or that or Islamic law says this or that and expect that claim to be inserted in Encyclopedia. You need to provide proof. You couldn't because you were wrong. Try again, dude. You have failed quite miserably here  03:40, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Furthermore, whe opinons of secular governments are irrelevant - of course Musilm countries rejected the death fatwa against Rushdie, but this was due to international politics, not due to religion. Also, as stated before, Ayatollah Khomenie was a Shiah CLERIC. The only way to be an Ayatollah is to be born as one. Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings. This does not mean by any means prove that Al-Azhar was right, and Khomenie was wrong. The fact that KHomenie was a shiah cleric, while Al-Azhar is a sunni university is also a  gaping hole in this argument. You have no ev",0

There seems to be some confusion about the exact nature of a neutral point of view with regard to the Wikipedia cannon. Neutrality is not a licence to assert associations and intimate linkages that otherwise would require rigorous argument and analysis.

As a philosopher, I well know that neutrality cuts both ways. This protects against assertions that in fact serve hidden agendas such as attempts to sneak in legitimacy for unspeakable perversions like satanism and pedophilia. Again, the prohibition, explicit in the Wikipedia discussion of neutrality, is precisely against such brazen assertionism.

I lack the time to contribute many Wiki edits but I have been listening in on the current arbitration. I've noticed something that may be of interest.

You mentioned  here that one side Mosmac has been portrayed as """"a fragile consensus"""" and yet on the other recently start claiming the opposite.

One doesn't even need to look that far. 

Even in the current arbitration some editors are characterizing the use of """"FYROM"""" as evidence on disruptive Greek nationalists...
... yet on the other side they seem to be claiming that Mosmac wasn't a consensus to justify the move to plain """"Macedonia""""?

If I was participating I would certainly consider asking the users completing about """"FYROM"""" usage to clearly state whether Mosmac was ever a consensus or not. IMO anyone who says """"no"""" is essentially suggesting use of FYROM was valid if contentious. Anyone that says """"yes"""" is admitting it would be very inappropriate for an admin to use their special access to break a consensus. 

I'll leave it to your experienced judgment whether you see the point worthy of inclusion.""",0

As far as I can tell the ITSMPA is no different except there seems less undue vendor influence and commercial intent than some of the others.

The """"rules"""" you are asking for are probably most relevantly WP:ELNO and WP:ELYES. However an RfC such as this one may produce a valid local consensus for interpretation of these guidelines.
Following up on the comment """"as far as I can tell the ITSMPA is no different"""", a quick WP:GOOGLETEST shows ITSMPA→2,000 hits, itSMF→577,000 hits, ISACA→538,000, PMI.ORG→432,000. These numbers seem to show a distinct disparity in notability.—

However, from what I can tell, even the peer forums require a paid membership. The free basic membership doesn't give you any more access on the website than is available to the general public. I think that means this fails WP:ELNO #6: """"Links to sites that require payment or registration to view the relevant content, unless the site itself is the subject of the article, or the link is a convenience link to a citation.""""

The countries were illegally annexed, and there is a considerable difference between de facto and de jure; if I steal your car and then forge the title, it may be """"my car"""" in that I drive it, register it, paint it hot pink and invite my relatives to live in it, but a Wikipedia article on the matter would probably best be entitled """"Theft of Dojarco's car.""""  The article on O.J. Simpson's murder case at Wikipedia is entitled O. J. Simpson murder case. Calculating numbers of countries is tangential to the legal aspect, as explained above  basically, most free countries that had relations renewed relations, never having recognized the legality of the forcible annexation. Many countries did not have relations prior to the occupation, because many were not sovereign back then (e.g., India was part of the British Empire, etc.  a list is available here ). I have nothing against including information on who did and who didn't recognize the annexation within the article, and the article should include information on the """"lameness"""" of continuity, too. But if you would emerge from the innards of this debate a bit  a person interested in the occupation (or even the argument that there was no occupation) would generally expect an article like this, with a title like this. It's a frequent search term. One includes denial in the Holocaust entry, and there are separate entries on Holocaust denial and even Criticism of Holocaust denial  but this does not mean that we agree with Holocaust denial, does it? The occupation of the Baltic States is not universally agreed upon, no  but not too many things are universally agreed upon. Presenting the prevailing view and serious alternate views is what an encyclopedia is supposed to do. You write: Saying Baltics were not annexed is pure nonsence and extremist POV. Nobody here said that the Baltics weren't annexed  what some here are saying is that they were illegally annexed whilst under occupation, and that is indeed the prevailing view. Please follow the links I gave. That some are in denial really does not matter. Start an article on """"Denial of the occupation of the Baltic States"""" if you like.  09:05""",0

 Pocket billards 

The term pocket billiards is used inconsistently in the article. Does it mean:
""""Pool or pocket billiards, generally played on a table with six pockets ..."""" where pocket billiards links to pool (cue sports)
or is it a generic name for all billiard [type] games played on a table with pockets as in its is used in the section Cue sports#Major games (carom and pocket). Because if the latter then the former is confusing and is further confused by the hatnote:

(Where """"Pocket billiards"""" links to Pool (cue sports)).

In a similar way the section Cue sports#List of cue sports says that """"English billiards (another hybrid)"""" of  """"Carom billiards games"""", but in the previous talk section we have established that it is not a hybrid (as it is at least as old as all modern billiard games and modern pocket-less Carom games), and if """"Snooker (see below; popularly regarded as its own sport, not a pool variant)"""" is its own sport so is English billiards.

If it can not be decided what """"Pocket billiards"""" means in American English and Commonwealth English then we should avoid using the term, or define what we mean by it before it is used in the article. Also I do not think that sources over 30 years old, should be used to define a term like """"Pocket billiards"""" as language changes and usage of such phrases does as well. Eg if the American professional organisations  have been pressing for it to mean pool type games, and snooker professional organisations tend not to use the term, then it is probably better to define it that American way and stick with that American usage in an article such as this.

If """"Pocket billiards"""" turns out not to have one meaning, and a definition can not be agreed upon then perhaps we should alter the section Cue sports#List of cue sports so that the list is either by table type sections, or by section based on the governing bodies of the various sports.

Thanks for your comment.  I don't get much feedback about my translations.  I think the problem you have identified may be something other than a translation problem.  I have simply done a literal translation of the German text.  The comparison is with classification type A.  An R class loco will have been engineered to be able to go around corners faster than its A class equivalent.  So, eg, an Re 6/6 (bogie type Bo-Bo-Bo) loco will have a higher maximum cornering speed than an Ae 6/6 (bogie type Co-Co - less flexible).  The difference is particularly important on the Gotthardbahn, which is a very busy line with sharp curves.  This point is not made very clearly in the de.wiki article, perhaps because German speakers are likely to be much more familiar than English speakers with the Gotthardbahn.  Also, the first table in both articles is not as clear as the second table.  I would be happy to alter the first table in the en.wiki article a bit if you think that's appropriate.  Also, the word """"higher"""" may be a less confusing word to use than """"increased"""", even though the two words have slightly different meanings, and the latter is a more correct translation.

Each of the examples you give are either: (a) just two nouns conjoined by the word """"and"""" (a la France and Germany); or (b) an determined reading not to interpret """"Britain and Ireland"""" as another way of saying """"British Isles"""" (contrary to the sources on that page and a la those pedantic arguments that if it doesn't include the Isle of Man then it cannot mean the """"British Isles"""").
WRT your suggestion for a dab page links: UKGBI is about as reasonable as it gets but even when that polity existed """"Britain and Ireland"""" was not a common term for it (a la GB and GBR, not BI or even GBI, for the country code) and it isn't today.

Why not have it as a seperate article on terminology? Because Terminology of the British Isles already exits. Why not redirect to the terminology page? Because the title is an another name for the topic described at British Isles not the one described at Terminology of the British Isles.
Why are you so resistant to it being so when it is supported by secondary sources?

"connection between 4chan and anonymous and anonymous culture 

I'm not sure the extended section on 4chan users is really necessary in this article.  Here's my formal sounding original reasoning that I thought started sounding too formal:

As it stands, the lines drawn between those three things are rather thin.  While Anonymous does profit from Anonymity, and 4chan users can profit from anonymity, I think there needs to be a more direct connection shown in this article before there needs to be an extended section upon 4chan within the article.  Consider it like this:

My father doesn't like potatoes.  Turnip eaters often don't like potatoes.  My father must eat turnips.
Anonymous profits from anonymity.  4chan users profit from anonymity.  Anonomous members must be 4chan members.

I don't doubt that there are many participants in Anonymous that use 4chan, I'm just not sure it is relevant to the point of extended discussion of Anonymous unless' there is proof that 4chan was the main location where Anonymous was organized.  There have been several sites akin to 4chan both preceding and following, and in addition IRC also served as a gathering place for anonymous individuals to share information collectively - including early hackers.  A discussion of 4chan as a subset of anonymous culture should be listed on cyberculture and 4chan and if necessary on a new page dedicated to anonymous(culture).  This article purports to be about Anonymous as a loosely associated hacktivist group - the focus, thus, should be on Anonymous(group)",0

Not only that, Oswald has in his hands what people claim is left wing literature. 

The police found the picture immediately. Since the picture tied Oswald to the murder weapon, the police confronted Oswald with the picture right away. Oswald looked at the picture and threw cold water on the evidence that seemingly tied him to the murder weapon. 

Oswald, who some believe is a lying little rat,  said words to the effect: """"That's not me holding that rifle. Someone pasted my face on someone else's body.""""

In fact, rather than wait, here's my complaint:

To whom it may concern, 
 
Hi.  My name's Jim Heller and I'm currently and for some time now caught up in a series of edit wars with Jossi Fresco.  The background is this.  I am a former follower of Prem Rawat, a/k/a Maharaji, a person I believe is a nefarious cult leader.  Fresco, on the other hand, is a current follower and, needless to say, of a different mind altogether.
 
For some years now, ever since the advent of the internet, Rawat and his followers have engaged in a long-standing campaign to whitewash Rawat's past and somehow protect him from the harsh light of history.  The latest flashpoint arose just today when I tried to edit a Wikipedia article of another of Rawat's current followers, a religious studies professor in fact, Ron Geaves (who, by the way, just shot to flashpan infamy as the English academic who opined that the July 7th bombers were """"demonstrators"""", not """"terrorists"""".  
 
Please excuse the fact that, to explain the problem in any meaningful way, I have to flesh out the context somewhat.  My edit concerned an academic (not Wikipedia) article Geaves had written where, discussing a program Rawat held in 1973, he wrote that:
In November 1973, Divine Light Mission had booked the Houston Astrodome, a large sports stadium with a capacity of 90,000.  The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U.S.  with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji's appearance at the stadium as a second-coming, complete with angelic and alien visitors.  Only 20,000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers' expectations.  He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises.

(My emphasis here and below)

In fact, a widely-disseminated invitation to that same 1973 program, Maharaji himself not only demonstrated knowledge of the """"millenial expectations"""" but fanned the flames substantially.  Thus, he declared the program the """"most Holy and significant event in human history"""" and even hinted that it might have intergalactic significance:

A LETTER FROM GURU MAHARAJ JI 

Bonn, Germany 

September 31, 1973 

Dear premies, 

First of all, I would like to tell you about something of great importance to all of us. Because we have realized this beautiful Knowledge which is of great bliss to us all, it is our duty to propagate it to the human race. For it is something they really need. 

In the world there is suffering, hatred and dissatisfaction. That fact does not need proof. It is understood by all that the world is passing through a great moment. No one has satisfaction of mind nor can they find the solution to this. The world is looking for the Perfect Master to come and reveal the Perfect Knowledge of God. There is a supreme energy constantly vibrating in everything making it survive and all the Perfect Masters coem to reveal this Knowledge to people. We can attain all materialistic things and still not have peace, for peace lies inside not outside in materialism. 

As you all know Millenium '73 is being prepared for now. This festival has been organized by Divine Light Mission each year since 1967, in the memory of the late Satgurudev Shri Hans Ji Maharaji on His birthday. This year the most Holy and significant event in human history will take place in America. 

I think that Millenium '73 is a point where we can really get together and enjoy the bliss bliss with all of our borthers and sisters who are premies; and also tell the world that we have received and realized the permanent service of Truth, Consciousness and Bliss which all the world is looking for in one way or manner. 

To do this I really need your help. I really need the help of all the premies in all respects; physically, financially and all other ways to make Millenium '73 come off. This is a festival not for you or me. It is for the whole world and maybe the whole universe. 

I hereby invite you to this Divine Festival of Peace, Millenium '73 and request all premies to help me financially, physically and spiritually to make the program manifest for all seekers of Truth. 

Isn't it about time you all get together and help me bring peace to this Earth?

It is clear, when you contrast Geaves' claim with the documentary evidence, that Geaves, bless his heart, is playing the role of the typical cult apologist, lying about his leader and blaming the followers, the press, anyone at all, for the inexcusable, laughable excesses of the cult.

But now I'll give you an example of why you shouldn't lend weight to them either, I  will also tell you why the results you have aren't at all reliable. Using the search term """"female genital cutting"""" does not tell us the context of the result google finds. I'll give you an excellent example of this: I googled """"female genital cutting"""" from 2010 to 2010, (link here:[]). I draw your attention to the 3rd result from the top (that is, the 3rd most relevant result that google could find across that entire year for that term), the title of this article is """"Sexual function in women with female genital mutilation"""". Given that the title of this article clearly favours the term FGM, I opened the pdf that google links to in order to find how exactly the term """"female genital cutting"""" was used in the article. This is the text I found on page 2 of that article: 
""""Worldwide, it is estimated that 100 to 140 million girls and women have undergone some form of FGM, and each year 2 million girls are thought to be at risk (1). The World Health Organization (WHO) classification is superior to terms used by the public or even some scholarly reviewed publications. The latter terms include female genital cutting, female circumcision, female Sunna circumcision, and Pharaonic circumcision.""""
If the 3rd result on the first page of google scholar search is already a result which is refuting the use of the term FGC, then I submit to you that you can't rely on google scholar results (or ratios of results) as a method of determining whether FGC is replacing or augmenting the term FGM. Also note that the 4th result also uses FGM in the title, and that the 6th result is another which is refuting the use of the term. If stats are what matter, then I'll put that into numbers. 33% of the top results for the term """"female genital cutting"""" for the year 2010 are refuting the use of the term female genital cutting.   20:52""",0

 OneGuy's vanadalism of the discussion page 
Aside from OneGuy deleting other user's comments, he has now begun to blatently disorganize and effectively vanadalize people's comments: he distrupting the flow of users' comments by arbitrarily cutting off paragraphs and inserting his comments in between, instead of being civil and adding his reply to the end of a given post. Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again. OneGuy must be ejected from this discussion before it can have any hope of being a civiled and productive debate. I am left with no choice but to completely resign from this discussion, since it seems that no one is going to be moderating OneGuy's behaviour anytime soon.  Pename

What's ironic is that OneGuy claims he is not a muslim and therefore can not be considered an Islamic apologist!  In fact, most of the Muhammad/Islam apologists here claim to not be Muslim!  Looks like Muhammad's best friends are the infidels.  

As of moderating OneGuy's behavior, the Arbitrators are looking into him and myself after he filed a hypocritical arbitration request against me and I thus filed a countercomplaint against OneGuy.  Whenever OneGuy spots someone who doesn't agree with his radical apologistic viewpoint he tries to silence them by any means at his disposal.  OneGuy, in his complaint in arbitration, accused me of rivert(sic) wars and having POV in my contributions yet he does the exact same thing, only more so.  In the arbitration complaint, the arbitrators don't seem as concerned about the POV contributions as they do about personal attacks, revert wars and my vandalism of his user page. See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34.  When OneGuy was giving evidence against me he incorrectly called a few minor word changes as a revert war (even though the change were only made once or twice) and he clearly left out the revert wars in which he was involved (but the arbitrators were not fooled - they found him out).

Since the arbitrators will probably not do anything about his radical apologistic contributions, they will most likely respond to his vandalism of the talk pages.  Feel free to post your complaints regarding OneGuy on Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34/Evidence.    06:56, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)

The Harpers magazine article you list and also called well written contains the phrase """"Post American"""" in the sub-title and article content, an obvious bias. Time is no exception to bias. Every city demolishes structures, so its not notable. One of the authors you list, for example, has controversies cited on Wikipedia for 'misreporting', hardly a good source.  The stacking of sources with the slant indicated shows merely they are not neutral and contain much bias. They amount to WP:Fancruft and WP:Coatrack.  Wikipedia is not obligated to include editorial bias. Detroit takes in plenty, its $1.1 billion budget with higher population density and higher spending per person than Atlanta show for example that weasel words like 'decline' and others inserted are inappropriate. An emergency manager is in place to alleviate largess caused in part by public sector union contracts - it shows responsible action by the governor. The comprehensive study shows the city of Detroit is in good shape and the Detroit Free Press reported it. The city of Detroit's home owner vacancy rate is 2.9%, in line with the national average.  The Detroit Free Press termed it a major population shift which is accurate. Many cities experienced change with suburbanization and freeways. The region is more populous and probably more prosperous than the 1950s. The city has seen multi $ billions in revitalization and it continues, the city serves an entertainment hub, has state of the art facilities, state of the art schools, a major university, casino resorts, a world class corporate center, a wealth of very well kept historic and national landmarks and restorations,  modern freeways, etc., is a partner on regional boards which did not exist in the past.

It would be really overdoing things to include convolutions with more input functions in the sandbox article, but I plan a gallery-like page in the info still to be uploaded to gnu.org.
Development of the convolution theme includes other mathematical concepts. Far from being a """"one-trick pony"""" you ought to know that the mathematics of the delta function, alone, lends itself to further visualization of subject matter routinely taught in dsp and related courses. Besides the ability to code, Development only needs imagination.
As the article indicates, I too made the mistake that Fortran was a dinosaur. Fortran is under active development, surpassing the performance of C in certain areas. I also code in C, Lisp, Scheme, and will be writing some code for C-Graph in Python - but modern Fortran remains a good choice for the core code.
There are websites that offer the demonstration of convolution, but none that encompass verification of the convolution theorem with ease, or that offer the range of features GNU C-Graph does. The download statistics verify C-Graph's growing popularity.
The meritless claim of """"online promotion and documentation (marketing?)"""" has been recited elsewhere and is transparent in its intent.
Yes, you did miss the point. I won't comment on the other """"significant"""" additional resources and external links listed in the articles on Convolution and Convolution Theorem, except that they hardly present """"new science"""", which is not a requirement for a reference.
No, it's not possible to deflate my ego. I'm accustomed to these types of responses - and use them as building blocks.

Enough said. The reason more information on C-Graph is not already at GNU is because I find myself having to spend too much time dealing """"blocks"""" in various forms. Wikipedians visiting this talk page have the text for the references should they choose to use them. Happy editing!

Set a time (say, 1 month?) that is left for discussion only (that is, voting will not start until at least ).  Once discussion has reached some kind of consensus, establish a clear voting schedule (what possible votes may be cast  yes, no, neutral, for example  what each type of vote means in real terms, how long voting will last, who is eligible to vote, whether or not the question may be altered once votign is underway, etc.).  Alternatively, if discussion seems generally to favor the idea (but it's not clear that there's enough consensus to make it enforceable policy), it may simply linger as Wikipedia:Semi-policy, in other words, a principle that's a very good idea that a lot of people like, but which for one reason or another isn't fully policy.

I'm protecting this page to prevent repeated vandalism. Among other things, this allows for discussion of a stable version in VfD. I know this is an inconvenience for editors. I suggest that those affected post drafts of any rewrites they want to make here in Talk in preparation for merging them back later. As far as I know there are no content disputes over this page.

 More vandalism? 

I just removed the following sentence from the article: 
Lil Jon is currently working on learning politics at the University of Ottawa with professor David Kiesman.

There isn't any professor by this name at the University of Ottawa, according to a search of the staff directory.  So unless someone can provide a citation, I don;t think that it should be included in the main article.

Do not listen to him. He will detract from your IQ points as you scratch your head wondering just how the hell he ever became popular.

Funny, but still vandalism.

I'd like to note that """"Get Low"""" is not a singular word.

Guh!

YEEAH! WHAT!? OKAY! Huh?  

It's not NPOV and it's not funny. I'm sure there are ways to insult all famous musicians, and on an encyclopedia its not that clever. If its humorous and wellformed (and not just stupid like the vandalism here) it should be on uncyclopedia  

What the first guy said was true about Lil John's only major claim to fame is screaming words, but he is not talentless. No one can say YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH like he can. He is the best at saying yeah in the world. he could give lessons. 

 Just needs some attention. 

This article doesn't need to be deleted, as Lil Jon is a legitimate topic for an article, and the content may not be in dispute, but the language is a little lacking. """"Hooked up"""" is still used coloquially, etc. Were it somewhat more sophisticated, it would be fine.

"Ideas, ideas 

Hey, how's it goin' Ginkgo100? I had a couple ideas I wanted to bounce off another editor to see what they thought: you’re the editor. Here's what’s going on in my head:

First; I was looking at the Bill Ritter (politician) article a little while ago and thinking it was a little dull. You scored that good shot of Ritter at the CDC, and that's about all the color we've got. So, I stopped by Ritter's campaign site (http://www.ritterforgovernor.com) and found a great screenshot off KUSA of the latest poll numbers (drop by and take a look if you can). I thought maybe this might be worth uploading (if applicable; didn't check yet) and using in the Ritter article and Colorado gubernatorial election, 2006. What do you think?

In a related thought, I stumbled upon the video of the Ritter/Beauprez debates from Aug. 11 (Here's a link ). Other articles I've read have contained video, but this one might be a little to long (any thoughts?) and may not be material appropriate or applicable to upload onto Wikipedia.

Second, I'm going to plunge into a clean-up effort that looks a little challenging over at National Western Stock Show (take a look and you'll see what I mean). If you can, and you like what's one of my favorite events in Denver, drop by the article and help me out a little.

""" November 2007 (UTC)

It seems that either you do not understand, either you are of bad faith. Let's make it simple:

According to Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1972), not I, the great argument of the Reform rabbis in Frankfurt (1843) was """"God ordered circumcision to Abraham, not to Moses""""; in other words God's COMMANDMENT to Abraham is circumcision, God's COMMANDMENTS to Moses do not order circumcision; in other words:

- God's One Commandment to Abraham = circumcision.

- God's Ten Commandments to Moses = not even one for circumcision!

The rabbis, not I said so! Therefore, wholly and seriously documented, I wrote it into the main article but WP and S rub it out. This is an insane violation of the wiki rules.

Now, in order to enlighten the main article, the 2nd Commandment topic of this """"Discussion""""  introduces my """"discovery"""" (a child would do it). It says:

- God's 2nd Commandment to Moses orders him: """"Do not circumcise.""""

But, contrary to the saying of PW and S, I never attributed this to the Reform rabbis.

Conclusion: who forgot to take their medicine, for several days now? Not I!

The ethical question involved about this discussion is: """"How can the wiki support a very obviously childish lie just because this lie has been carried along for millennia?"""" Think about it! If you are responsible persons, you cannot publish an obvious lie without warning your readers, which I am doing.

Sigi's request to WP and S: """"Circumcise your heart, eyes, ears and pen, not your peco!"""" because yes, this criminal violation of Moses 2nd Commandment is being done every day in the USA to baby boys. It even has been done to an Oregon girl, in 1950 (see http://www.aesculapiuspress.com/ - Books – The rape of innocence); indeed a good American mother cannot want her beloved daughter be deprived from circumcision when her beloved son gets it, can she?

 POV concerns 
I'm not (yet) going to put the NPOV warning up, but the statement """"Maher is also fair to his conservative guests"""" is getting dangerously close to POV, since I'm sure many conservatives would disagree with this statement. 
Whether conservatives, liberals, or little green men would disagree with that sentiment does not make it POV.  It is, instead, POV in its own right as it's a judgement that a wiki editor made on their own.  It's someone's take on the show, which may indeed be 100% true, but we're also abutting the area of No Original Research here.  If we were to make a general statement about conservative guests being defended by Maher, I think we're on safer territory as it's generally true and easier to verify.

I removed the following passage because it is a clear violation of both RP:BLP and WP:OR and makes extensive use of weasel words.

 But some suspect that Erdogan's virulent attacks on Israel are rooted in anti-semitism and hostility towards Jews. In Turkey, according to a survey in early October 2009, 53 percent of the population would object to having a Jewish neighbor. He has been accused of exploiting such prejudice for political gains: On October 8, 2009, he stated in a speech at the Yildiz Technical University of Istanbul that he has been watching """"the Jewish model of success"""", pointing to """"their [the Jews'] buisness instinct"""", and claiming that """"Jews are able to make their money multilply while seated.""""En Turquie, le premier ministre, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, exploite un sentiment d'hostilité vis-à-vis d'Israël (Le Monde, October 19, 2009)

Describing Erdogan's criticism of Israel as """"virulent"""" is a NPOV violation (nor is it meaningful English). Quoting survey results about the opinions of Turkish citizens is WP:SYNTH and irrelevant to Erdogan's own beliefs. Also, nothing that is quoted is actually negative about Jews.   """,0

The recent Super Bowl loss is a highly significant event in the history of the Patriots franchise. The opening section discusses the """"dynasty"""" status of the Patriots, but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss. This page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important Patriots facts. However, the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss.

 Taunting Disguised as Factual Information 

Looking through the history of edits since the Super Bowl, a lot of information that's being added (and much of it since deleted) may be true, but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting.  Is it really relevant that the Patriots are the first 18-1 team NOT to win the Super Bowl?    Who cares?  And believe me, I'm no Patriots fan (they've been a thorn in my team's side since last season's playoffs), but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry, not a fan forum.  This page should be locked from any further edits for awhile, unless something TRULY relevant to the Patriots should suddenly occur.

 Bias??

It should be consistant one way or the other.

The sentence, """"The Patriots, however, were defeated by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, after winning the first 18 games of their 2007 season.""""  is very clumsily tacked on to the first section.  I think it warrants another sentence or 2 or at least the deletion of the word """"howev",0

I think you went overboard here and blew your load a little too quickly by blocking me for a week for posting on my own talk page.  It really is quite ridiculous. I have understood that users on wikipedia have far greater leeway on their own user talk pages and user pages, and asking other users to stay off is an accepted practice.  My comments on the Sarah Palin edit summary probably went over the line and deserved either a warning or 1 day block because of the article probation, and I should not have reacted the way I did to the other users instigation.

 regarding International humanitarian law 

The protection of hospitals is according to the Geneva convention. The agreement from 1949 was also signed and ratified by the USA.
According to that agreement hospitals are protected.
The exception is: unless the facilities """"are being used, outside their humanitarian function, to commit acts harmful to the enemy"""" as rightly commented in the article. But: Even if enemy combatants are inappropriately using the facility for shelter, the """"rule of proportionality"""" usually forbids such attacks because of the high potential for civilian casualties. (why the usually as a qualifier?)
And it is not the: Human rights organization Human Rights Watch stated that the laws of war require the attacking force to issue a warning, and wait a reasonable time for a response, before attacking a medical unit being misused by combatants.
but the Geneva convention itself that requires a warning by the attacking force. And that is not a choice.
Why having qualifiers, as if the Geneva convention is not clear on the point of the protection of a hospital. And this scenario, an unannounced air strike by an AC-130 definitely falls outside a hypothetical proportional attack.
Why being so ambiguous about it, the Geneva conventions forbids the attack on a hospital, except in exceptional circumstances!  """,0

Totally agree with you Direktor, and I am sure that your highly reasonable opinions and facts you are presenting on wikipedia are highly respected and accepted by the waste majority of its readers. Please, if you can, - do your regular check-ups of the articles concerning South Slavic languages and make sure they’re not presenting some misleading information. I would just add to this that although ‘the political reason is the officially maintained distaste of the so-called """"pan-Yugoslav commonness”’, this distaste should be ‘expressed’ in a more civilized manner than creating some non-acceptable partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area, or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system (language) at the templates featured in the articles about South Slavic languages and dialects. And most importantly - that ridiculous ‘pan-Yugo’ distaste which openly sends a message of hatred and separatism, should not, by any mean be reflected in the language area, because it only shows how low and how uncivilized its ‘supporters’ can be, no matter what their ‘not-supported-by anyone-in-scientific-world’ theories they may point out as their sources. 
And, at the end, as an example of a civilized political distaste between nations, here’s the example of Americans and Canadians. Majority of Canadians feel in a different extent, a kind of aversion towards Americans, especially since the start of the ‘George-Bush-era’ in USA. But still, nobody says that Canadians speak a ‘different language’ than Americans, and nobody tries to hide the common history facts and the strong cultural and economical ties that exist between these 2 countries. This is a typical way of overcoming any kind of ‘distaste’ in a human and civilized way, all the other ways are just a shame for humanity.

In the northeastern U.S. we had the cylindrical jars  I recall this being as early as the 1970's, and that they were imported from Canada.  I only saw yellow plastic lids.

"Hi,

Taekkyeon is a sensitive topic because many people want to learn it and not enough qualified teachers to disperse the knowledge. If you truly desire to learn Taekkyeon there are only two masters in the world who know the complete system. One is in S. Korea, he doesn't teach many people. The other lives in Los Angeles, CA. The truth is, you have to either move to Los Angeles or S. Korea if you want to learn the Taekkyeon as taught by GM Song and Im Ho. 
I will tell you this. GM Song was a bodyguard of the remaining Choson Dynasty family memebers. The top Taekkyeon masters always defended the king, They were in the military. Taekkyeon was a military artform first and a civil cultural game for children and adults later. By calling Taekkyeon a civil martial art game is demoting it from its real status. However, Taekkyeon is still a Holistic Martial art with many healing aspects and a civil game for children and adults. Its all three!

"I got your message regarding boorishness

Dear Mark,

There came a point where I believed that certain non-BSF people  were going to whittle down and mischaracterize the BSF position and could not be reasoned with.  It comes from watching atheist/Christian boards where atheist of the militant atheist variety cannot be reasoned with and are quite hostile.  

At that point, I mocked and taunted certain non-BSF people for censorship (which they were engaging in) and mocked sources/links like Farrell Till that the non-BSF side was offering.   I do realize that I was very probably breaking Wikipedia rules there.  I also recognize that asking Duncharris to prove he was sincere by actions and rebuffing what I thought was a faux friendship letter was somewhat premature.  I should have made greater attempts to see if it was sincere.  

I will tell you what I will do.  I will send duncharris and MickWest a peace offering letter.  If it works then fine.  If not, nothing lost.

portions of St. Albert's boundaries are incorrect, particularly:

the Sherwood Park Urban Service Area boundary south of Wye Road appears to be a tad exaggerated in terms of size (please double-check, referring to the above linked CRB map);

Gregalton, you know very well from your repeated """"edits"""" (deletes?) on debt-based monetary system that there is a distinction.  """"Crunch"""" is a cessation of lending in some debt markets FULL STOP.  """"Squeeze"""" is where debt is still being issued but with stricter requirements, resulting in a slow down - but NOT a complete cessation of lending activity.  Imagine a tap.  One is where the tap is turned off.  People starve, there's chaos in the streets, asset markets collapse... you get the picture.  The other is where the tap is turned to """"boiling hot"""" so only those with 18 carat gold gloves on can receive this precious liquid called debt money...whoops!...sorry, that concept has been killed off by Gregalton and a few other WP guardians.  Err...precious liquid called... liquidity?  How's that sound?

Where the tap is turned to boiling, this generally only results in a slow down in economic growth and a contraction in prices in some isolated asset markets.  Those asset markets that were receiving """"easy money"""" prior to the squeeze get jammed but generally the economy hums along OK, with isolated pockets of distress.

Until then though there isn't really any sort of guidline as to this specific page other for the sake of completeness. It is in my opinion that until seperate pages are created for Third, Second and First generation fighter jets then I don't really think the addition of one aircraft will really cause a lot of problem until such action is undertaken. Especially given that pretty much every single jet fighter is already on the list. The days of where nearly every country could create their own fighter like in WWII are long gone. Perhaps to at least organise the clutter, rather than listing aircraft vertically, it could be done horizontally like with the inter-war aircraft to at least make the page 'shorter'.

I'm going to remove the notion that the ecliptic didn't cross Ophiuchus before 1930, since it is clearly contradicted by 
this: Ophiuchus

The story seems to be that before 1930, the area that now only belongs to Ophiuchus belonged to two or more constellations.
In order to formalize it, astronomers had to choose one.
If they choose one of the astrological signs, they would avoid angering astrologers.
If they choose Ophiuchus, one of the most important documents in astronomy, Kepler's """"De stella nova in pede Serpentarii"""" (On the New Star in Ophiuchus's Foot) would still be meaningful to future astronomers. They would also honor Kepler and Ptolemy who first described the constellation over 1700 years earlier.
It comes as no surprise that they acted as they did.

There is a big difference between an organism being saved from total destruction so that it might become a fossil and the fossilization processes of permineralization or carbonization, etc., which preserve the organism after it has been buried.  Talk.Origins conflates the two.  If you don't know the difference, you don't have enough knowledge to judge what W & M said and probably don't understand how Talk.Origins blatantly lied.

"SBharris, I have just looked at both of your links. In both cases, contrary to what you say above, the derivation requires that the term  only applies in the limit. In the former paper (arXive) it occurs at equation (13). In the latter paper (J price) this is clearly stated in the last sentence of the wording beside fig. 5 on page 14 of the pdf file.

This means that the  term must be exclusively a tangential term. Hence the other v term in the Coriolis force must be a radial term. In other words, these transformation equations only apply to co-rotating radial motion such as would occur if an object were to be constrained to move in a radial groove on a rotating turntable.

As regards circular motion, it appears that both you and Brews are unfamiliar with planetary orbital theory. A circular motion occurs when the inward gravity force (centripetal force) always exactly cancels with the outward centrifugal force.

You both insist that a circular motion involves a net inward centripetal force. If that were so, the radius would shrink and we wouldn't have a circular motion.

You are basing your beliefs in this regard upon the restricted high school derivation of centripetal force in circular motion. The force needed to rotate the velocity vector inwards shows up to be the standard expression for centripetal force. However, if we examine the exact same vector diagram for a straight line motion measured relative to the same origin, we will obtain the exact same expression, only radially outwards. The centripetal force in circular motion is therefore merely cancelling with the centrifugal force. This fact is totally overlooked in high school physics courses.

You must never lose track of the physical meaning behind the maths symbols which you use. These transformation equations cannot be applied to a particle which is stationary in the inertial frame. The entire derivation of those equations is based on the actual components of its actual acceleration. One component leads to the Coriolis force and the other component leads to the centrifugal force. If there is no actual acceleration, then these two components will both be either zero, or equal and opposite. There will be no net inward centripetal force no matter what frame of reference we view it from.

As regards the merry-go-round example, it actually undermines your point and bolsters the very point that I have been trying to make. The quote The radial Coriolis force associated with azimuthal motion is much like an increase or slackening of the centrifugal force tends to confirm my view that the so-called radial Coriolis force is in fact a centrifugal force and that in meteorology it would invoke Archimedes' principle and invoke a torque on a cyclone, due to differential centrifugal force on the east-west wind at one side, and the west-east wind at the other side.",0

"""""""List of United States cities by area"""" says Sitka, Alaska, has 4,812 square miles, of which 2,874 are land; Juneau, Alaska, has 3,255 square miles, of which 2,717 are land; Anchorage, Alaska, has 1,961 square miles, of which 1,697 are land; and Jacksonville, Florida, has 874 square miles, of which 758 are land.

""""List of cities by surface area"""" matches that, except that it mentions """"Juneau City and Borough"""".

The pages about those four individual cities today have figures that match, too. Yet, when I posted in this section several days ago, the article on Jacksonville said 1,962.4 square miles.

Jacksonville's own government website says it has 841 square miles, not 874 or 758.

I'm not sure whether some people or governments are rightly or wrongly putting all of a county's land into the city's listed area. I can say that, in the case of Jacksonville, although the governments of the (a) City of Jacksonville and (b) Duval County are unified, there is (or ought to be) separate reckoning of the city's and county's area, because Duval County also contains three other cities (Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, and Neptune Beach), which are not part of the City of Jacksonville (they have their own, separate police departments, for example—even though the Jacksonville Public Library is county-wide).

The government website of the City and Borough of Juneau says it has 2,593.6 square miles of land and 487.6 square miles of water, for a total of 3,081.2 square miles. Neither the total nor the land area there matches what Wikipedia gives.

At the government website of the City and Borough of Sitka, I haven't found the area.

Same for the government website of Anchorage. But it does link to anchorage.net, which says the city has 1,955 square miles—which, like the government figures for Jacksonville and Juneau, doesn't match Wikipedia's figure.

 A problem with """"English Patriot Man"""" and his sockpuppets 

Hi. Lately I've seen you blocking some sockpuppets of a user named: """"English Patriot Man"""". I see that this man is nearly obsessed with Polish people. He seems to spread his anti-Polish propaganda by distorting the historical truth concerning World War II, nazism in Europe and racism against Poles. He is totally denying the sufferings of the Polish nation. 
Thank you so much for taking care of him, and taking care of the articles that are his main targets. However, now he might create another sock and log in from some other computer or place, so that his personal data and IP address would be totally different. This is why I suggest us to patrol the articles that are his main targets like:

[edit] Armenian Genocide
Peres' denial of the genocide should be noted in this article, failing to do so makes it more of a hagiography than a biography. His shortcomings must also be mentioned in addition to his feats like winning the noble prize. Do you think it'd fit better in political views? In anycase it must, and will, be mentioned somewhere. How about adding this in his political views segment:

Peres' foreign policy outlook is markedly realist. For example, to placate Turkey, the only significant Muslim country in the region that is friendly towards Israel, Peres has explicity denied the Armenian genocide, which caused an uproar among genocide scholars.(citation) E10ddie (talk) 

Peres made these statements in 2001, when he was foreign minister. Clearly, he was caving in to Turkish pressure. Israel has very few friends and cannot afford to lose them, so basically it is not free to take the position that would seem to mesh with its outlook and history, which is to recognize that the Armenians were murdered en mass. Now he is president, an honorary position, not a political one, and his """"views,"""" whatever they may have been back then, are worth about as much as mine are. I have no problem with mentioning this """"view"""" in the section on his political outlook, but a separate section on this one utterance gives it undue importance and distorts the picture.

[edit] sumac opening sentence
I don't know what the right wording is, but do you see the problem with """"Sumac (also Rhus) is a genus of approximately 250 species of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae""""? First of all, there is no reason to italicize Sumac. Secondly, it is not accurate to say """"Sumac is a genus"""" because there is no genus called Sumac (but there is one called Rhus).

I may be too steeped in botanical jargon to easily come up with something which is natural to non-plant-people. But we need to figure out something which (a) works whether people get to this page as Sumac or Rhus (currently, the latter is a redirect to the former; policy would have it the other way around), and (b) doesn't mix up scientific names versus common names in a confusing way. Kingdon (talk) 

I am not a botanist and my reason for reading the article was because of the spice, which is used all over the Middle East. I was surprised that the spice didn't rate a mention in the lead. Sumac needs to be the first word in keeping with Wikipedia norms, and the same as the title of the article (i.e., not plural). How about: """"Sumac refers to a variety of shrubs or small trees of the genus Rhus, as well as the purplish spice that is produced from its dried, crushed berries Gilabrand (talk)  
Looks like Richard New Forest (talk · contribs) has solved it for us (I'm happy with his wording). As for """"first word"""", Wikipedia policy isn't quite that strict (""""earliest natural point in the prose"""" at Wikipedia:Lead section#Bold title and I don't know whether a plural fits under """"slightly different form"""" or not).

"CEREMONIES AT MINDROLLING MONASTERY 

Vajrasattva Drubchen- 10th Day of 1st Lunar Month

The Vajrasattva Drubchen is a seven day ceremony based on the Minling Dorsem or Mindrolling Vajrasattva ritual. Minling Dorsem is part of the Vajrasattva cycle of teachings discovered by Chogyal Terdag Lingpa. The Drubchen is held every year for seven days beginning on the 10th day of the 1st lunar month.
This grand ceremony is performed to purify the negativities of all sentient beings, particularly of the deceased. On the 15th day of the 1st lunar month sangha gathers to perform a special ceremony for those who have died within the previous year.

Kagyed Drubchen- 24th Day of 1st Lunar Month

Beginning the 24th day of the 1st lunar month, the Drubchen is a ten-day ceremony. It is based on the Kagyed De-Sang Du Pa terma that is one of the treasure teachings discovered by the renowned Terton Nyang Ral Nyima Woezer and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
When Terdag Lingpa was about to pass into Parinirvana, it is said that he asked his disciples and sangha members not to weep but to realize the truth of impermanence. He then instructed them that if they had devotion for him and truly wanted to benefit beings they should do the Kagyed ceremony each year. This, he said, would benefit the Dharma and all sentient beings. In accordance with the instructions of the great Bodhisattva, from that time on, the Kagyed Drubchen has been held every year, now being performed at the Mindrolling monastery in India.
The final day of the ceremony is on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month, which is the Parinirvana Day of Terdag Lingpa. There are lama dances in the evenings of each day’s ceremony. The drubchen ends in the evening of the 3rd day of the 2nd lunar month with the ritual of Bgodrub Lenchog, the Receiving of Siddhis Ceremony and Marme Monlam (butter lamp ceremony). These are open to the public.

Tsechu Drubchen- 8th Day of 2nd Lunar Month

Since the heat in India makes it impossible for the dances in this ceremony to be performed in the 5th lunar month as they were in Tibet, this Drubchen is held for three days beginning on the 8th day of the 2nd lunar month. The tsechu Drubchen marks the birth of Guru Padmasambhava and is done in accordance with the terma, Lama Sangha, which was discovered by the great treasure master Guru Chowang and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
On the 10th day of the 2nd lunar month,a full day’s Lama Dance is performed in accordance with the ritual of Lama Sangdu. These lama dances are renowned for their blessings and are the foremost examples of the lama dances in Tibet in their original form. Many people come from all over to receive the blessings of this great ritual. On the next day, His Holiness Mindrolling Trichen would bestow a long life empowerment to the public in order to dispel the obstacles and difficulties in the coming year. The tradition has been observed down to the present day since the Tsechu Drubchen was performed in Mindrolling. It has been an opportunity both for everyone to receive the blessings of the Mindrolling Trichen and for the coming together of the monastic and lay sangha.

Saga Dawa Drubchen- 15th Day of 4th Month

This Drubchen held on the 15th day of the 4th lunar month marks the birth, enlightenment and mahaparinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha, one of the most important occasions throughtout the Buddhist world. Special prayers, rituals and butter lamp offerings are made during the ceremony.

Tel-da Tsechu- 10th Day of 5th Lunar Month

This auspicious ceremony marks the birth of the Guru Mahaguru Padmasambhava. This drubchen is performed for three days in accordance with the Lama Sangdu text from the 8th to the 10th day of the 5th lunar month. Suring the Drubhcen, secial feast practices are done and the Tsog ( feast offerings) is distributed to the general community.

Yarne, the Summer Retreat- 15th Day of 6th Lunar Month to 30th Day of the 7th Lunar Month

This is the rain retreat for one and a half months from the 15th day of the 6th lunar month to the 30th day of 7th lunar month. The retreat is held in accordance with the instructions of the Buddha in the Vinayana Sutra directingall monks to observe certain restrictions and engage themselves in meditation and practices for the period. Khenpos and Lopons give teachings each day and “So-Jong” or confessions are offered by the sangha during this retreat. Many butter lamps are offered and pujas are done during the retreat. On the evening of the 30th, the last day of the retreat, selected monks give teachings and expound the Dharma to the community. The retreat is usually followed by a 3-5 day holiday break for the monks.

 Follow-up re new medal icons for medals tables 

Well, this has been finally implemented, and I think the new icons are a radical improvement over the previous color blocks.  The medals table of Nicole Haislett looks remarkably cleaner and more graphically refined, and we may now replace many of the artificially abbreviated place names and event descriptions that were previously employed to avoid line-wrapping within the medals tables.  A couple of points remain to be discussed and resolved:

  how do we handle the graphics for the """"disqualified"""" medal option?
  what do we do about the winner, runner-up and playoff options that were engrafted onto this template by an association football editor in 2011?

I'm bringing these issues here first, SFB, because you (a) are obviously not opposed to change, and (b) have a good eye for better graphics.  I would like to get on the same page with you before starting another template talk page discussion.

My suggestion for the """"disqualified"""" issue would be to fill square area surrounding the circular medal icon with a percentage screen of red, with a red diagonal bar drawn across the icon itself  that screams intuitive.  The disqualified option should also include a field for explanatory footnote text.  Another simpler alternative is to omit disqualified medals altogether.

As for the winner, runner-up and playoffs options for association football/soccer, I seriously question whether these should be included in a """"medals"""" table at all.  Having looked at several dozen footballer infoboxes that use these options, it also appears that many uses are for minor regional, national and subnational tournaments.  Frankly, I wonder if WP:FOOTY has even sanctioned many of these minor tournament outcomes for inclusion; most of them do not appear to be medal competitions, so the use of the gold, silver and bronze background colors is inaccurate.

I honestly do believe some of the events were biased against Bell (particularly charging him as an adult when the law clearly said that could not be done and the releveant factors the DA considered weren't considered relevant in prior LA SC decisions), but I think their is a reason you're not seeing that fact harped on... even the pro-Bell supporters realise it's probably more fluke then noteworthy. It just looks to me like people trying to make a statistic look like a fact, when if you put it into a broader picture, it's nothing signifigant. I'd wager on most jurys in the Parish, white or black criminal, one of the jurors can be traced in some way back to the victim, and I doubt at MOST you'd need even a 3 people seperation to link it. Again, only 14,282 people total.",0

If I'm going to be indef blocked then User:Smsarmad (SMS), the guy who filed SPI without notifying me, should also be indef blocked.

This SPI investigation report from 2007 clearly establishes that he is a disruptive vandal  and lives in Islamabad, Pakistan , has used socks and open proxy located in Greece. 
 began calling me dark-skinned Indian followed by cursing everyone, and was edit-warring with everyone, and when BBBAAACCC got blocked, an IP (212.174.135.194) from Turkey (a country next to Greece) began revert-warring in order to keep BBBAAACCC's version of pages.
As noted by User:UzEE in the above 2007 report, (SMS) connects himself with Pakistan military. I've noticed that many banned socks have been behaving exactly like SMS and uploading copyrighted images (without permission) relating Pakistan's military, see . According to this recent revert by SMS, he exposed himself that he belongs to a special community within the Hindkowan group, they generally don't associate Pashtuns, and I notice this in SMS's actions. 
He often uses Islamabad IPs to edit, see , , and  and makes other edits by his other socks (User:TopGun  User:MHDH ) so nobody notices but I do because I get paid for doing this )

Clear Proof: 1 2, 3. He often appeared at Siddiqui article since December 2005, used to edit from USA but now from Islamabad.

Me, I have more than thirty years in pro audio event production, primarily audio system design and mixing. I worked at McCune 1988 to 1994 which is why I altered that bit about the McCune JM3 active system. Since about 2003, the majority of loudspeakers I encounter in my career are self-powered. It has been a giant shift, one that the article does not adequately describe.

 Hello from a main page regular 

Recent vandal attacks on the main page where an 'interesting' picture has been snuck in via unprotected subparts of the main page have been annoying at the least - Yes it's true. It has been one or two lapses of concentration by admins who forgot to protect something that they placed on the front page templates. Admins are human, they do make mistakes. Everyone has been poked and reminded. I'm not saying that it won't happen again, but everything that should be done has.

However.

What should happen when such a vandal attacks?
Within minutes someone with admin ability spots it, quietly reverts it and covers the cracks that the vandal oozed in via. The vandal is blocked, defeated and deflated, they move on.

What does happen when such a vandal attacks?
Everyone, their dog, cat, hamster and rabbits swamp this talk page with """"OMG!11!! I'M OFFENDED!! ARGH! ARGH! MY EYES WTF!"""" style messages of outrage and indignation. The vandal says """"HAR HAR PWND! I EMS TEH 1337"""", posts several taunting messages about how good they are and revels in the afterglow of their nuclear attack.

Eventually, within minutes someone with admin ability spots it, reverts it and covers the cracks that the vandal oozed in via. The vandal is blocked and moves on with a self-satified smug smile and sticky underpants.

People. If you get all up in arms about it, you're feeding the vandal's ego. Just let it pass. It will be reverted within minutes.

(deindent) Not even wrong only if you don't understand what he's doing. These are all standard problems for the many millions of people who have tried to make sense of infinite arithmetic at some point in their lives.

The number  ...9997 in Archimedes' system is also known as the number -3, which almost is the """"largest prime"""" in Ludwig's order on the Plutonian integers. You would think ...99998 might be the right one, but that's -2, and it is clearly divisible by two. So maybe ...9997 should be thought of as divisible by three, but dividing by three is different than dividing by two in base-10, because two divides 10 and three does not. So maybe that's a self-consistent definition in a 10-based infinite arithmetic with the order he chooses. Maybe not. I don't know, but neither do you, and to pretend otherwise is insincere. It's not incoherent, just original, and incomplete. The methodology is obviously many, many, painstaking infinite digit calculations, with the extra burden that the rules keep shifting whenever he finds an inconsistency. 

The reason he claims transcendental numbers are incomplete is because, if you accept that the integers are Plutonian, the real numbers are only """"finitely"""" wide. Normally, a real number can be thought of as a map from Z->digits, giving it's digit sequence. Unfortunately, Plutonium's """"Z"""" is just as large as the real numbers, so that a real number is really only a sequence of digits, because a sequence in this view cannot be viewed as a map from Z-> digits. In this view Z is larger than any sequence (the integers are """"uncountable""""). So the real numbers have """"gaps"""" which would be filled by reciprocals of infinite integers. But large integers don't have reciprocals in Plutonium's system, because he can't make any sense out of bi-infinite sequences:

Numbers like ... 999123.3333..... are not allowed because you can't do multiplication digit by digit.

So he doesn't think of the real numbers as containing the integers, he has two classes of numbers the """"Adic integers"""" which are infinite to the left and finite to the right, and the """"real numbers"""" which are infinite to the right and finite to the left, and it is illegal to add an adic integer and a real number.

The reason Archimedes Plutonium keeps working on the Riemann Hypothesis is because he feels he can say something new about the distribution of primes because he has knowledge of some infinite ones. This is because he can ask questions like """"if I choose an infinite integer at random, digit by digit, do I get a prime number?"""" Those sorts of questions have analytic counterparts about real numbers (complete numbers really). He probably feels the twin-prime conjecture is false, becuase, what's the chance that the infinite integer ....321113 and ....321115 are both prime? He also probably feels that an infinite even number can never be the sum of two primes. These last two statements are both based on my own thinking. He might thinks that there are very many primes at infinity, I don't know for sure.

Look, I am not saying his mathematical musing are not cranckish. But recognize that Archimedes Plutonium is to cranck science as Isaac Newton is to mainstream science. He has seen futher than others even though he stands on the shoulders of no-one. """,0

It makes no sense. TRPV1 activation causes pain or heat sensation. Capsaicine is known to activate the receptor, and that's what makes chili pungent. If one of the reasons for AM404 being an analgetic was TRPV1 activation, it would have to be the opposite to that of capsaicine. The only wat in which TRPV1 agonism would decrease pain is that a prolonged exposure to high doses of the agonist decreases the sensitivity, which is the case in any type of receptor activation, but this would mean that AM404 is no more an analgetic than capsaicine or any other source of pain... and the relief would come after a period of pain actually getting worse.

My edits were reverting, not altering the main text sections. I only edited the last 1995 bit, and you've said nothing about that, except made unfounded claims. All major changes are supposed to be discussed first, and you have not done that, you have just ripped out the factual material and done a whitewash edit in apologist speak to look like it was all a minor dream or something.

A couple of points I will pick up on were where you claimed in regard to 1799, 1914, 1920, and 1925 etc., that they were “suggestive and purely speculative”, but Ben, not one of those dates falls into your apologist descriptions, you are clearly not being reasonable, rational, or honest

You then say “Progressive adjustments of understanding in the face of unfolding events, resulted in a period of changing explanations centered around the years 1914, 1918, 1920, and 1925.” That is also incorrect because those dates were only changed after their humiliating failure, not before. It hardly takes a brain surgeon to change a prediction, where the world is still looking on, long after the end was supposed have arrived! You also are trying to use very deceitful terminologies to try and pacify the facts to more and more insignificance, when they were anything but that at their times of publishing. An example of your gross dishonesty is here where you say “Other dates variously considered being time of God's judgement”. Since when were they “variously considered”? They forcefully stated, “we affirm that, Scripturally, scientifically, and historically, present-truth chronology is correct beyond a doubt. Its reliability has been abundantly confirmed. . .” and “This chronology is not of man, but of God. Being of divine origin and divinely corroborated, present-truth chronology stands in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct.” What you inserted was gross fabrication and deceit Ben. Why? What is your agenda? If you are embarrassed, get over it. You should not destroy, whole pages due to your religious ties to the JWs.

Ben, you said “They do not profess to be inspired”, but they use ever synonym in the book that directly implies that exact same thing, see quotes here 1 and here 2, why are you hiding this balance?

There are a lot more points that you are misleading and censoring for your own agenda, and that is not the purpose of Wikepedia. I get the impression you are possibly a naïve JW who does not know about the real history of your religion (please don’t take offence at this, it is a common thing), and so you edit in good faith that your indoctrinated info from the watchtower org is correct. Please do some detailed research before you vandalise many editors' hard work. Wikepedia is here for accurate information, be it good or bad, but not public relations platform for religious groups and their biases. You have also repeatedly changed long accepted text with no discussion. Can I suggest you look up the 14 pages of talk and read them all carefully before you abuse the hard work of others with your grossly biased unauthorized edits.

   Hey Einstein, when did I say anything anti-africanist here?? please point it out for me. I'm even against the CIA sources that some people wanted to place on the article here, the one about 73% mulatto,16% white and 11% black.  Do you think that I'm going to be crazy enough to believe DR is only 11% Black??  I'll be too ashamed of saying such a thing.  I agree on you on that one. 51% mulatto, 46% black, 2% white is the real demographic approximates of DR. Where is the """" denial, anti-black, blaha blah and all the non-sense accusations that you are making by me saying that??
   I stated an increase from 11% that somebody else place here from CIA to 46%, that's an increase of 35. So I am the anti-black, racist,denier??? 

   I knew that you where going to throw the """" Moor myth"""" about Spaniards, you are showing the radical afrocentric nut. What's next? you also believe in Van Sertima's book, that the Olmec heads of the Yucatan peninsula are Africans? or that snow is really black??
   DNA studies in Spaniards show that less than 2% have Moor blood. It has been weed out,since the fall of Cordova in 1236, by the """" limpieza de sangre"""" campaign of the christians. Spaniards are White as are the anglo-saxons,and the Irish. I'm not going into deep details about """" Moors and Spain"""" with a radical Afrocentric nut, but going back to the article, we are not going to allow that the DR article is going to get hijack by radical afrocentric nut, nor eurocentric too.

Scholars of the historical Jesus use the historical method and Israeli archeology to reconstruct a biography of Jesus. They debate whether he preached the imminent end of the world, his connection to religious groups (such as the Essenes), and which sayings attributed to him are actually his. The so-called quest for the historical Jesus began with Hermann Samuel Reimarus and continues today with scholars such as the fellows of the Jesus Seminar.""""

Present Day Canada Government website incorrectly Titles BNA Act 1867

The Government of Canada (mainly Liberal since 1963) is very """"skilled"""" at practising the Sin Of Omission as shown in the linked text below,

British North America Act 1867

http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/c1867_e.html

This website incorrectly refers to this document as the Constitution Act 1867, which is a misnomer, and a shameful one, indeed.

http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/endnts_e.html#(2)

(2)  As enacted by the Constitution Act, 1982, which came into force on April 17, 1982. The section, as originally enacted, read as follows: 
1. This Act may be cited as The British North America Act, 1867. 
 

 

I disagree with your interpretation.  You're reading a footnote, which merely says that *originally* the 1867 act was to be cited as the British North America Act 1867.  But, under the law since 1982, it is now to be cited as the Constitution Act 1867.  All acts forming the constiution were retroactively renamed.  Judicial decisions, and subsequent legislation, use this new naming system.  This reflects the fact that these documents were not a part of a """"constitutition"""" when originally created, since Canada had no consitution until 1982.  Collectively, these acts were turned into a constitution, and hence renamed.   

What?
""""Canada"""" had no Constitution until 1982?

You are completely wrong as well as per retroactive re-naming, that is not what happened at all.  Please get your facts straight.

I have created a draft page at  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynch_syndrome (note the small S) where I have redrafted the HNPCC content. Apparently this violates Wikipedia attribution rules, which I wasn't intending to do, but it gives an idea as to the preservation of content.

 Unblock Request: Fuck you, unblock me! 

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh",1

Therefore it would be tendentious to ignore genetics now that DNA analysis is available and is turnign on those theories.

 On recent edits regarding English section 

I have reverted some edits by Capnprep.  I'll address a few of his concerns:

1.  Do as aspectual auxiliary.  This is the only function of DO as an auxiliary verb and is its primary function within the language.  The non-durational aspects in English (everything not progressive/continuous aspects) are marked by the aspectual auxiliary DO followed by its subordinate in bare form.  English has two aspectual auxiliaries, DO & BE.

2.  Do is not a modal auxiliary.  It does not express emphasis / emphatic mood.  Rather, DO when used as an aspectual auxiliary may be emphasized just like any other word in a sentence.  There is no emphatic modal auxiliary in English.  English simply uses vocal stress (or in type, boldface or ALL CAPS) to emphasize the desired element.

3.  Perfection / perfecting auxiliary is valid.  Perfect is not an aspect but rather a verb in any aspect may be perfected.  Perfection is a grammatical category used to express completeness of a verb.

4. I have changed the repeated phrasing """"Most auxiliaries"""" / """"Most modals"""" to ...some... because this sort of generalisation is simply untrue and unfounded.  If anything, of the modal auxiliaries, those that subordinate to infinitive form are at best in approximately 50% distribution to those that do not.

5.  In the discussion of the various forms following make, I have once again removed the claim for passive voice.  That usage is not in passive voice at all as BE is not acting as a vocal auxiliary but rather BE+MADE is acting as a single unit forming a modal auxiliary.  Whereas MAKE as a modal auxiliary conveys internal force and subordinates to bare form, BE+MADE expresses external force and subordinates to infinitive form.

6.  Within the section on defective verbs I have eliminated some poor and misleading examples while rewording others.  That section comes close to conflating infintives with infinitive form and as worded was misleading.

Please do not revert any of these changes without first addressing and resolving these points here on the talk page.  """,0

"The term software distribution, according to wikipdedia, describes a bundle of a specific software (or a collection of multiple, even an entire operating system).

Whatever Bondeson's credentials, i think the central claim of this article (that upon """"Hitler's orders"""" superdog members of the SS were being sought), founded solely on a book by Bondeson that none of us has read, is probably false. In this BBC article http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-13568270 Bondeson complains """"A rise in schools of animal psychology in the 1930s was encouraged by the Nazis, and Hitler in particular, and their potential military use examined. But that's a million miles away from the press claims - which get taller by the day - that the Nazis had a legion of talking, machine-gun-toting hounds, on the point of being unleashed on the allies.""""

 Re. Please advise. 

Hello Mareklug. Well, I believe that your request at WP:RFPP might have been declined due to the fact that the edit war was just starting and there was thus insufficient information of a full scale edit war that would have surely resulted in full protection to the article (by the way, that's how we call it: we don't """"block"""" articles, we """"protect"""" them). If the edit war continues, then do relist your request at WP:RFPP. It will likely to be accepted. I also have to agree that you might have failed to control yourself sometimes, when in the face of your opponent Tocino. Edit warring is never a good choice, as it only worsens a dispute and can indeed grant blocks to both of you (although I think that a topic ban would be quite an unlikely/draconian measure, you're not causing that much trouble as far as I see). My suggestion is, when Tocino (or any other user) makes an edit that you strongly disagree with, refrain from reverting right away and instead, summon the other party to the talk page. Then two things may happen: either he joins the discussion so you can both argue your points of view, or he doesn't join the discussion and provides you with a good reason for requesting an administrator's intervention against his unilateral actions. I hope this helps. Best regards, nd """,0

""":I don't mean books by the way (which contain hundreds of pages) but any concise bio.  
I looked through several bios on bookrag and none, some of which were pretty lengthy, mentioned Falk. It's off topic and additionally, he doesn't even have an article.  

Well, I'm not sure that Falk needs to be included in the Jordan article or not (though he did seem to have a huge influence on Jordan's career), but in any case, I have written a Wikipedia article for David Falk.  I would appreciate it if others would read it over to see if the article is any good, and secondly to decide if he should be mentioned in the Jordan article (as I look at the Jordan article again, it even says in the second sentence that """"he became one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation""""... since it was Falk who did the marketing, he probably deserves a link there).  My information for the Falk article came partly from David Halberstan's book Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made, which has about 10 pages on Falk, as well as a ton of online articles I found.  Cheers!   

I added a few brief lines about Falk in the section """"Media figure and business interests.""""  Falk is probably too off-topic to put him in the opening section, but I think he's important enough to mention in a section specifically about Jordan's role as a media figure, since Falk was largely responsible for crafting Jordan's image.  

 Divorce 

Is is just me or does it seem like, unlike an earlier divorce threat five years ago, Michael & Juanita's split seemed to have been kept quiet by most of the media?

I'm wondering because the first I've heard of the current proceedings was last night when I heard something about this being the most expensive celebrity divorce ever?   
Five years ago, he was still in the NBA, so obviously he has a bigger spot light on him. For the most part, Jordan isn't under the lime light anymore, so it doesn't have much coverage.  
It was announced in the press when it happened. But it was one of those things where people stopped talking about it a couple of days later.

Nick Names
I don't believe the Nickname """"Superman"""" is valid in the case of MJ. Yes, he was called Superman, Pippen was called Batman, and Rodman, Rod-man for a brief time. But Superman as a nickname has been used for almost every prominent player in the NBA; i.e. Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and especially Shaq. Nicknames should be identifiable to unique players. If you ask someone who knows nothing about Basketball, what were Jordan's nicknames, they would say Air, or Air Jordan, and throw in the acronym's, M.J. Jordan has had plenty of nicknames, but we don't list every single Nickname, only the most identifiable. That's why his NBA.com Historical Bio, only lists Air Jordan as his nickname. I propose mutual consensus on the issue, before more users begin to add obsessive Wp:fancruft to the article. Feel free to comment.  
Agree, Superman is not a common nickname for him. At all. It gets used all the time for athletes. Unless he gets a Superman tattoo on his arm like Shaq and starts calling himself Superman it's not worth inclusion.

 This article does not need a list of """"my favourite language"""", but at the same time it does need true examples. Not as language samples, but as examples of what a Hello World program looks like, for the benefit of the general principle. Readers of this article need to see what such a program looks like, and (most importantly) why one would bother. Hello World in JavaScript is trivial - why would any programmer even care to write it?  It makes much more sense for more difficult languages like assembler.
 My edit was to re-add examples for JavaScript, Java and Assembler. I have no particular attachment to these languages but JavaScript is contemporary and as simple as it gets, Java is contemporary and demonstrates how a modern language might still need to be more verbose. Assembler is obscure these days, but it highlights just how much work can still be needed to get Hello World up and running. I believe these three limited examples convey something of value at the level of a general article on Hello World and thus belong here.
 You also removed the note on the Arduino and the use of non-text output devices in the Hello World context. Why?

 Inverted Ad Hominen is non-notable 

When I correct the ad hominem article later, I'm zapping the 'inverted ad hominem' term.  It is completely non-notable (86 hits in google) and was invented and inserted into the article by User:Layman.  Heck, the article itself even attributes it to Layman, a random web user, as having said it.

Original edit inserting it under an ip address
Edit by User:Layman the same day

There's a reason why the term wasn't invented by logicians too, because """"inverted ad hominem"""" is still ad hominem.  There's no """"inverse"""" about it.  The so-called """"inverse ad hominem"""" is just a case of ad hominem where someone says """"my qualifications are better than yours"""" instead of directly saying """"your qualifications suck.""""  The meaning is the same and there is no reason for another term.

I really don't think there is any question that this and the silly thing about it being coined should be removed.

"Anacrossan Fairy Story

Thanks Ta'olunga for giving Anacrossan some light....lol.. Yes Mr Mariner wrote about Nuku'alofa Fort as he was part of 'Ulukalala's forces that destroy the Nuku'alofa Fort...

Mr Mariner book was published in 1817, nine years before Mr Thomas arrived and recorded events and developed the Old Tongan alphabet as shown with the Bible Old publish or how the old people say in Tongan, koe paaki motu'a.

Mr Vason arrived with 10 missionaries from the London Missionary Society in 1797, he stayed in Tonga for four years where he recorded Mumui as King, Tuku'aho installation and murder, while staying with Mulikiha'amea he also recorded and describe the Mulikiha'amea's Household, the beginning of the Civil War and how Muliki Ha'amea was killed. Mr Vason book was first published in 1810 with later published edition.

Nuku'alofa were recorded over the years before Tongan alphabet and to the modern Tongan alphabet as these:

1797 published in 1810: Noogollefa by George Vason, first Missionary. 

1817: Nioocalofa by William Mariner

Post 1826: Nukualofa by Mr Thomas Old published document.

1842: Noukou-Alofa by Father Chevron, first Catholic Missionary.

Post 1945: Nuku'alofa by the modern Tongan alphabet.

Anacrossan claim is unsupported and she has to remember that Taufa’ahau was in Ha’apai as King and his first recorded to visit to Nuku’alofa by the Missionaries were in March 1827, Nuku’alofa were already recorded 17 years before when Vason’s book was published in 1810.

"""Actually to clarify....after Bret Hart was forced to vacate the world title(and retire) due to a concussion, the planned Hart vs Sid Vicious title match was changed less than 48 hours before the match to Sid vs Benoit. Since there was no time to build up the match it was decided to do a screwjob finish, and then build to the rematch at Superbrawl the next month. So benoit """"won"""" the match(with Sid's leg clearly on the ropes), and then the next night on Nitro the decision was overturned. The official result of the Sould Out 2000 Main Event was """"Chris Benoit and Sid Vicious fought to a no-contest"""". End of story. Except not. Pissed off at the shitty booking, Benoit confronted booker Kevin Sullivan(who benoit had a personal history with re: Nancy). Sullivan then told Benoit if he didn't like the booking he could ask for his contract release no questions asked. benoit took him up on it and jumped to the WWF. The difference between this and the millions of other screwjob/Dusty finishes was that rather than the belt seemingly moving from one champion to the next, then being handed back....the bgelt was vacant before Benoit """"won"""" the title, thus the overturning of the decision made the belt vacant once more. Sid also had a seeming title victory only for the result to be overturned due to his """"pinning the wrong Harris"""". Officially at the time the belt went from Hart to a vacant state to Kevin Nash awarding the belt to himself........

Okay, so Vinnie Mac has bought at WCW and recognised both Benoit's and Sid's first wins as World Title Wins. He has also recognised Hulk Hogan's two AWA Dusty Finishes as official World Title Wins. I don't like it, but I guess it's official now. The obvious question is, since Vince owns WWE, WCW, ECW and AWA can he, say overturn David Arquette's WCW World Title win at this point?

You can't have it both ways. You're either an encyclopedic website that seeks to be factual and informative while minimizing speculation or you're a fansite. Either way, it's not suitable for inclusion. For example, if your site is a community run information site, then it should not be included under the In general, any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of brilliant prose guideline. Your Wiki won't provide information we don't already have or will have in the future if its just a community info site. However, if it trades in information that we won't be adding, such as speculation, theories, spoilers, because of Wikipedia guidelines on such material, then we should not be posting your sites for the reasons discussed above. It is not the case of making a link between encyclopedias, but between an encyclopedia and one particular fansite.
Further, the two Wikis you mention aren't even major fansites, when the guideline specifically states: Fan sites: On articles about topics with many fansites, including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such. In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link. We already have the major AND official forum: The Fuselage. If you'd like to add a link to a directory of Lost fansites, be my guest... but inclusion of either Wiki alone (instead of a list) is preferential treatment of minor fansites, since there are certainly other, larger, more popular fansites (Lost-media, Lost-tv, for example). Certainly, if we were to start adding fansites at random, we'd have to begin there and with others, like a link to TWOP's reviews and forums. The best course of action if you believe these sites simply must be linked to is for you to make a list of fansites and include a link to that directory, which is how WP:EL says to proceed.
As for removing the disclaimer, its not going anywhere. The disclaimer was put there specifically because we'd have people posting each and every fansite they dreamed up as official sites when they weren't. Lost is an example of a show wherein Wikipedia guidelines and policies are repeatedly ignored by the editing community, so the long-term editors have had to be very diligent in monitoring this page. This is an outgrowth of that, and has for the most part helped a lot. Moreover, there is no """"freebie"""" section for links. All links listed there are official sources except IMDB, which is used almost without exception. The same list of reasons I mentioned above for IMDB, including the fact that IMDB is a featured part of the standard TV Infobox, clearly do not apply to these Wikis nor any other site people have been trying to add (Mr. Clucks, 4815162342, etc.)
Finally, I will agree with you that the list of links for all the individual networks is redundant, and should be chopped down or moved to Airdates of Lost as a link for the country/network listed there.  """,0

The article reads more like a left leaning op ed than an objective encyclopedic article. A good example is this unsourced assertion early in the article:

US conservatives didn't """"adopt"""" the term in the early 90s; it would be more accurate to say that by the early 90s the excesses of """"political correctness"""" became more widely known and many people (not just """"US conservatives"""") began to ridicule it (particularly as manifest in the implemnetation of draconian speech codes on college campuses and the aggressive promotion of increasingly dubious and absurd assertions of what might be construed as """"offensive""""). The term has come to be used in mischevous ways at times by people to ridicule positions they disagree with (an example would be creationsts categorizing the teaching of evolution as """"political correctness""""). 

The article in short seems to reflect the perspective of someone of an """"activist left"""" sensibility that is more interested in addressing popular backlash against political correctness than in objectively describing it. It's really not as complicated as the article makes it out to be. In brief, politically correctness is simply a word for efforts to alter or prohibit innocuous language or other activities that are unreasonably or implausibly asserted to be offensive.

As I understand it, the Angel escalators have a greater vertical rise than the Tyne Tunnel escalators - 27.4m vs 26.0m - but they are actually shorter in length (60m vs 61m), presumably due to being set at a steeper angle.

Rape in the United States of America

The FBI keeps very detailed national records on crime. In the United States in 2005, 37,460 white females were sexually assaulted or raped by a black man, while between zero and ten black females were sexually assaulted or raped by a white man. In other words, on average, every day in the United States, over one hundred white women are raped or sexually assaulted by a black man, and zero or one black females are sexually assaulted or raped by a white man..

 Long hair shep image 

I've rechecked the old image, and I still don't think it's a good one for the article. Even in full size, the dog is front-on, so only the tufts of fur from the ruff are visible. In a thumbnail the long hair features are not visible at all, and it looks like a poor focused """"generic German Shepherd"""" picture. The picture I replaced it with is side-view. Even in a thumbnail the features are visible, and because it's a side view, the long hair influence is visible on the neck and haunches which is not the case even at high resolution with the older image.

I don't do much image work, but this one was crying out for a better one and has been for ages, to my eyes. Can you take another look at both, and reconsider the full images, and the thumbnail images of each revision, and my comments on these above. Many thanks. FT2 (Talk | email) """,0

But there is no cherry picking. The article contains the most reliable information. There are many studies presented by religiously affiliated/motivated institutions and scientists. That's not reliable. There are studies presented by outright bigots. That's not reliable. There are studies that claim to show one thing, but do not. That's not reliable. The organizations in the article, which have membership in the hundreds of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world, are not unreliable nor do they present subjectively biased conclusions based on what they studied. Pointing out a difference, for example, of a male child of two lesbians not being as aggressive as the male child of a man and woman is very trivial. The conclusions that the scientific world has come to is that, while there may be some isolated differences, which exist in all types of families not just those with same-sex parents, it is inconceivable to make the generalization that one is better or more efficient than the other. The only contrasts which my have significant differences are those families who do not have two parents, no matter their gender. So there is no rational basis, in my mind and obviously the mind of most studied science on this, to even try to contradict that. –  (talk · email) """,0

First off, I can let you know that I am not on any particular side. However, from what I've seen, you have displayed childish behaviour in the last few days.

I do not know the correct info for the article. However, what I do know is that all this can be finalised if you or the other party found sources to support the claims. Also, Wikipedia has a policy against reverting the article between different versions — the 3RR. Before you edit Firebender again, I suggest that you read it.

 Reply to """"On gender"""" 

Your posted: Don't guess at someone's gender, as you have done here.  It is uncivil, and could in fact be taken as insult.  Any argument you might have that their 'name appears to be that of a female/woman' is invalid, as you have no idea if that is their name, last name, middle name.. etc.  It could even be a reference to the male comicbook character Blade, who had the name of Daywalker given to him by others in the comic book.— dαlus Contribs 

If you know your friend’s gender, spit it out, you stupid ass. Your entire posting, if you didn’t have the agenda I ascribe to you, infra, would have been “FYI: He/she is a female/male” and I would adjust accordingly. Hell, if you tell me that Dayewalker is a consortium, and I’d refer to Dayewalker as “they/it.” Don’t continue to be an ass if you post further, or understand that your further postings are unworthy of reply.

I note that you are not correcting your friend Dayewalker when she posts to you 6 days ago """"I saw that afterwards, I knew HE was topic banned but it had slipped my mind about the overall bannation. Thanks! Dayewalker (talk) 06:48, 13 July 2010."""" Are suggesting that you know that Dayewalker has completed genetic testing on the subject of her comment, so that he (Dayewalker) is not guessing at ‘his” gender (the subject of her (Dayewalker’s) comment) when he only refers to """"he’;"""" or that he (Dayewalker) has genetic evidence that the """"he"""" is actually a """"she"""" and she (Dayewalker) is insulting them by suggesting that the """"he"""" is too ballsy or pushy to be a woman/“lady.” Dayewalker is not whining about this unintended insult of either referring to a woman as “she” or equally unintended insult of referring to a man as “she.” Don't be an ass.

If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like """"Mr."""" or """"Ms."""" Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion. If you wish to join into the discussion, please feel free. On second thought, don’t join in. I have no confidence that you would answer the questions posed by the other editor either. Dayewalker (he she, they, etc.) doesn’t answer his question. Ut oh, now I’ve called Chowbok a “he.” No doubt her boyfriend/girlfriend will rush in to call me a “beast” and start a fight on the 2nd grade playground. If Dayewalker thinks that he has been called a """"sissy"""" or a """"girlie,"""" then she can address that with me. He doesn't need a mighty protector to create issues designed to get me banned. And by """"protector,"""" I mean you. You are an ass. Male. Female. Both. Neither.

 Your Comments/Vote on Davien Crow 

You said they do not meet WP:MUSIC. This is not true. You only have to meet 1 requirement to meet WP:MUSIC though some of you are debating over what exactly is an album they have had more than 2 releases on labels, 2 of them independant notables Kidatrim music and Mushroomcloud Records. But the undisputable requirement they meet is having been on a National Tour, They (Davien Crow's Bands) have been on 2. Please reconsider changing your vote, thanks for your time and contributions to wikipedia.

Look the point summarized is I am willing to work with you guys on why these were deleted but until now noone has given us any feedback and has even lied about stuff trying to get it deleted. All 3 of them meet the sufficient amount of requirements for WP:MUSIC, the guidelines in WP:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies, Wikipedia:Importance, Wikipedia:Notability (the fact that suicide girls, gidget gein, and marilyn manson are involved and can be verified in those links should proove that) , Wikipedia:Fame_and_importance mainly the part stating """"There is clear proof that a reasonable number of people are or were concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community)"""" If you can't tell the community of Myspace.com and Livejournal.com alone are enough to meet this criterea you are blind. If you do google searches, go to forums and search their names, or visit internet archives you can find un-disputable information on the band from reputable sources, first hand accounts that are years older than these discussions, and intangible archives kept by internet archives. IF you want more detail read my above rant, your right I do sound mad about this, because I can't see how you can say they do not meet criterea or that this is a vanity page. Please accept my apologies for anything you have taken to be rude and please re-consider changing your vote. What Harm could it do ? BTW I am not trying to bully anyone, I can show you the location of the people threatening to come here and vandalize the hell out of Wikipedia. But I do not want that to be part of your decision at all. (please reference the large rebuttle on the discussion page itself)

I have posted this, I hope that some of you will consider looking for my information and reconsider your vote for now. A lot of people are simply responding to the rudeness of user:sin-thetik and some things I said are being misconstrude as threats. I am simply upset because of all the time it took to write these 3 articles, knowing they fit the guidelines, only to have somone delete them with the proof and verifiable facts right in front of them .. just their un-willingness to read them.
