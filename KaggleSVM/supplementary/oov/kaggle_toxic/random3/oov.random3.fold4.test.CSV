This is really getting ridiculous. Because since Nomoskedasticity """"won't be inundated by Keravelt for a few days """" he resorts to propogating  his own NON-NEUTRAL views in the article:
a. He completely ignores the fact that there are views that specifically contest him being CEO (his attorney and the governement). b. He flagrantly misinterprets the Gazette article as reporting Sholom Rubashkin to be the COO (where else did he come up with that idea), while the article clearly reports the US attorneys admitting that they misreported him as CEO (you have not quoted anything to suggest that what I had proven was original research (this all while Mosmof is """"guessing this is the sort of minutiae that the defense lawyers ... so I could live with his title listed as CEO"""" - Original Research?)) c. He then blankly changes the third paragraph's repeated references to Sholom Rubashkin from Vice President to CEO (CEO is contested while Vice President isn't).  d. He changes my clarification of Sholom Rubashkin's exit (that it is disputed by a seocndary source) to simply """"Sholom Rubashkin left his post in September 2008"""" e. He fails to even explain himself in all this.
And no one raises any concern about a Neutral Point Of View.

I am reverting it to my previous edit which is far more accurate than this one (it just omits sources that have been called innaccurate by both his Attorney and the US Attorney  """,0

 Early Republic; 2nd paragraph 
Right,
For the 2nd paragraph, the why (for what needs to be done), and how (suggestions) -
1st, the why:

besides the 1) excessive number of bibliographical citations in Portuguese, which I claim to be unneeded, since there is abundant literature in English dealing with the subject;
My suggestion is that (keeping the paragraph short, btw depending on the option to be chosen, even shorter), must be also fixed:

2) the truncation of the narrative, referring to fix the correlational gaps of
2.1 the beginning of the republic and the military rebellions of the 1920s, and to
2.2 the mentions about all revolts of the 1930s, and not just the communist one, 
Or 
- 2.2.1 - to maintain coherence, don' mention any (1930s) revolt specifically , in the manner suggested below

3) (Regarding the briefness of the paragraph); remove the excess of detail inferred from a source in Portuguese. Details that can be contained in other more specific articles of Wikipedia, related to the history of that period
I refer specifically to this passage  """"The repression of the opposition was brutal with more than 20,000 people imprisoned, internment camps created for political prisoners in distant regions of the country, widespread torture by the government agents of repression, and censorship of the press.**"""" ; 
which can be summarized as suggested (see suggestion about Point 3) below 

My suggestions for How -
Regarding to: 
Point 1, use the abundant literature in English dealing with the subject, as some which I used

Point 2.1, a variation of what I had proposed:
 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, through various civilian and military rebellions, that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Get√∫lio Vargas, supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt."""" 
Or, shorter 
 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, that by 1930 it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Get√∫lio Vargas supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt."""" 

Points 2.2, 2.2.1 and 3 (bold letters)
 """"Vargas and the military who supported him, were supposed to assume the power temporarily, but instead they closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with their supporters, having defeated between 1932 and 1938, 3 major attempts to remove them from power. Being the 1935 communist one served as an excuse for they preclude elections, launching a coup d'√©tat in 1937, making their regime a full dictatorship, with all that this entails. """" 

Thus (following the justifications above), one possibility of how the entire paragraph could be:

 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Get√∫lio Vargas supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt. Vargas and the military who supported him, were supposed to assume the power temporarily, but instead they closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with their supporters, having defeated between 1932 and 1938, 3 major attempts to remove them from power. Being the 1935 communist one served as an excuse for they preclude elections, launching a coup d'√©tat in 1937, making their regime a full dictatorship, with all that this entails. """" 

Note that, besides Not contain the defects stated above, even With the phrase  """"in the wake of the murder of his running mate, """" - this possible version is by far a shorter paragraph than the present version.

 Removed long unsourced lists 

I have removed the long lists of unsourced expressions of Indian English.  This article is not the List of expressions of Indian English; rather, it is about the history, syntax, and phonology of the dialect.  Eight years ago, when I arrived on Wikipedia, books  Indian English were few and far between.  But now, as I have demonstrated above, a number of reliable studies exist.  

Random long lists, in any case, serve no purpose in an encyclopedia article.  Examples can be added judiciously in the relevant sections of an expanded Indian English article in order to illustrate notable (syntactical or lexical) features of the dialect.

Morgellons disease: Analysis of a population with clinically confirmed microscopic subcutaneous fibers of unknown etiology
Virginia R Savely and Raphael B Stricker

Additional article information

Abstract
Background:
Morgellons disease is a controversial illness in which patients complain of stinging, burning, and biting sensations under the skin. Unusual subcutaneous fibers are the unique objective finding. The etiology of Morgellons disease is unknown, and diagnostic criteria have yet to be established. Our goal was to identify prevalent symptoms in patients with clinically confirmed subcutaneous fibers in order to develop a case definition for Morgellons disease.

Methods:
Patients with subcutaneous fibers observed on physical examination (designated as the fiber group) were evaluated using a data extraction tool that measured clinical and demographic characteristics. The prevalence of symptoms common to the fiber group was then compared with the prevalence of these symptoms in patients with Lyme disease and no complaints of skin fibers.

Results:
The fiber group consisted of 122 patients. Significant findings in this group were an association with tick-borne diseases and hypothyroidism, high numbers from two states (Texas and California), high prevalence in middle-aged Caucasian women, and an increased prevalence of smoking and substance abuse. Although depression was noted in 29% of the fiber patients, pre-existing delusional disease was not reported. After adjusting for nonspecific symptoms, the most common symptoms reported in the fiber group were: crawling sensations under the skin; spontaneously appearing, slow-healing lesions; hyperpigmented scars when lesions heal; intense pruritus; seed-like objects, black specks, or ‚Äúfuzz balls‚Äù in lesions or on intact skin; fine, thread-like fibers of varying colors in lesions and intact skin; lesions containing thick, tough, translucent fibers that are highly resistant to extraction; and a sensation of something trying to penetrate the skin from the inside out.

Conclusions:
This study of the largest clinical cohort reported to date provides the basis for an accurate and clinically useful case definition for Morgellons disease.

Keywords: Morgellons, subcutaneous fibers, pruritus, delusions of parasitosis, Lyme disease, skin lesions
Introduction
Morgellons disease is a poorly understood multisystem illness characterized by stinging, biting, and crawling sensations under the skin.1 According to the Morgellons Research Foundation (MRF) website, more than 14,000 families are reportedly affected by this emerging disease.2 Considerable suffering occurs as thread-like fibers work their way out of the victim‚Äôs skin causing pain, itching, and open, disfiguring lesions (Figures 1 and ‚Äãand2).2). Unfortunately, patients are often dismissed as delusional by clinicians who are unfamiliar with the signs and symptoms of Morgellons disease.3‚Äì5 There is a scarcity of literature on Morgellons disease due to its relatively recent description in the modern medical literature, the reluctance on the part of the medical community to recognize it as anything other than psychopathology, and the lack of knowledge about its etiology and transmission.6

The distinctive feature of Morgellons disease is the presence of microscopic subcutaneous fibers1 (Figures 3, ‚Äã,4,4, and ‚Äãand5).5). Observation of the skin with a lighted, hand-held, 30 √ó to 60 √ó magnifier enables visualization of these red, blue, black, and white fibers that have the appearance of either straight hollow tubes or wiry tangled threads.1 At times the fibers are seen above the dermis as loosely clumped ‚Äúfuzz balls‚Äù or as black specks the size of coffee grains. Examination of the black specks by electron microscopy reveals that they consist of a tightly woven ball of black fibers.6

Reply: I added another, different, quotation from the same article that helps firm up how Russell felt on the subject. I  believe this added material compliments rather than hinders the presentation; it makes it more conclusive. 

My statement that Russell never suggested organized prohibition on using blood represents the conclusion of a Modus Tollens argument. However, rather than speculating about what Russell did or did not suggest, my statement should have read that Russell never organized a prohibition on using blood among his fellow worshippers. 

Modus Tollens would have us accept that had Russell, as president of the Watchtower organization, organized a prohibition on using blood among his followers then we would have seen organized prohibition on using blood among his followers. Since there is no record of such an organized prohibition among Russell‚Äôs fellow worshippers then the Modus Tollens argument form has us conclude that Russell never organized it. The underlying premises of this particular argument are 1) that Russell applied his presidency and that 2) his fellow worshippers acted on his presidential initiatives. There is ample evidence that Russell applied his presidency, and that his fellows acted on it. Hence, it is not my opinion that Russell never organized a prohibition on using blood among his fellow worshippers. Rather, it is a logical end to a valid argument form based on evidenced premises. 

For the time being I have removed the statement about Russell and organized prohibition on blood under his presidency. If you dispute the validity of what I write above then please offer logical refutation, keeping in mind that logical constructions and conclusions are not at the mercy of preferential outcomes (i.e., private opinion). I make the latter comment only to demonstrate my commitment to logical conclusions is above my commitment to any personal opinions I may presently hold. If you fail to offer refutation within a reasonable time then I will return my comment to the history section, but in a more precise form.",0

Dear Sir,

First, please do not email Jimmy Wales about Wikipedia issues. We have official

We apologize for what happened.

Wikipedia cannot provide it, because it is not a professional organization.

""""Willy on Wheels"""" is/was the name of a very obnoxious user that laid waste on
Wikipedia. He kept on creating accounts with usernames based on 'willy' and 'wheels'.

The simplest solution by far is for you to take an account name that does not

Yours sincerely,

2. I don't care what distruction this other person caused, calling someone you do not know bogus as Ohnoitsjamie did should not be tolerated. I was not and am not here to cause trouble.

3. Saying that I am here to harrass and threaten is wrong. I read your incident report. I also read the block you placed on my current IP.  I have not harrassed and I have not threatened. I simply want an apology for what I have deemed bad relations on you and Ohno's part.

4. All I want is a sincere apology for calling me bogus and accusing me of threats and harrassment and then I will go away.  If not, I will forward all messages before and from this point on to Mr. Dupre and what administrator actions need to be taken will be taken. His apology in the second line says it all.

People are frustrated because now, as in the past, it seems as thought the WMF doesn't listen to what us editors are saying. Yes you have evidence that you tried to notify users but the way the notifications were done and the places they were located gives the impression that the folks building these changes don't understand the community or how it works. You are also worknig hard to fix the problems but then releae the app to all logged in users knowing there are a lot of problems, many of which are severe. Then you act as though your surprised and hurt that we are annoyed. We know you are working on the problems, but so are we and we want to feel as though our voices are heard too. When the Visual Editor talk pages aren't filled with long lists of complaints and bugs, then we can talk about a widescale release. But there's no need to rush it out yet. Anyway, I just wanted to clarify that the problems aren't with you, they are with the WMF organizations's ongoing policy of doing whatever they feel like regardless of what us dumb editors think. Happy editing. PS, sorry they mixed us up.  

 Your user page 

Hi Elitre, when we designed the  template, we intended to make it easy for staff to use it and edit it, so added parameters that would make it easy to update the relevant sections. I noticed that you'd substituted the template on your user page instead of transcluding it and presumed this was not intentional, so I've gone ahead and boldly switched it to the template, making a few general fixes. This should allow you to also edit your user page through the Visual Editor. Please feel free to undo my changes if you intended to substitute the template! -) helpfulone 

 Random act of kindness 

 Hello Elitre (WMF), Eduemoni has given you a shining smiling star! You see, these things promote WikiLove and hopefully this has made your day better. Spread the  whether it be someone you have had disagreements with in the past or someone putting up with some stick at this time. Enjoy! ‚Üëtalk‚Üì

He bilked United Artists out of $6 million for a tiny film set in Thailand. Through five years of bull-shitting, Stone managed to make his name synonymous with My Lai.

 The Dellums mayoral campaign was criticized for holding expensive fundraising dinners and because Dellums would not disclose his plans for the city, or his positions on issues.  - please provide a reference for this; surely, per WP:BLP, you would never insert something like this without a source?

 Elise Ackerman, an Oakland resident who bought the domain recallmayordellums.com sent an open letter to Dellums that was covered in the local press, saying to Dellums, """"African Americans and Latinos live in fear in Oakland because of your lies. Middle-class residents working two jobs live in fear because of your lies. Nurses, teachers and social workers live in fear because of your lies."""" Near the end of the message, she continues """"You are not effective, you are not honest, you have no integrity and you should step aside."""" - what is your source for this?

 In 1972 John Lennon wrote the song Woman is the Nigger of the World. Asked for his reaction to the use of the word """"nigger"""" by a white singer in a pop song Dellums wrote """"If you define nigger as someone whose lifestyle is defined by others, whose opportunities are defined by others, whose role in society is defined by others, then good news - you don't have to be black to be a nigger in this society, most of the people in America are niggers!"""" Lennon was delighted with his reaction and proudly read the quote on the Dick Cavett Show prior to performing the controversial song with his wife at the time, Yoko Ono. - can you explain the removal of this material?

 Conservative journalist David Horowitz suggested Dellums' actions were treasonous. - source?

 RE:RE: Blagojevich 

Copied from my talk page, no response required

Hey folks, since there's two users in this talk I'll just thread this here.  I promoted it to ITN on the reasoning that the removal of a state executive is, IMO, notable whether the subject himself is or not (though I'd figure it is inherent).  Seemed obvious to me that this was more than Wikinews, which is why I skipped the discussion phase.

As to the portal, thanks for letting me know, I was not aware of the duplication being needed in the editing, I thought it was transcluded.  Learn something new every day ;)

And lastly, I still think that it should be on the main page.  While I can understand Spencer's logic in that it needs more information to make it encyclopedic and not just news, I personally don't think that anymore should or could be added to the article on the Blagojevich scandal at the time and it is a pretty descriptive article.  

No matter it all, thanks for the input and the learning opportunity from all three. talk """,0

"""

Qwyrxian, let me attempt to point out the flaws of your response to my arguments set forth above: Yes, I'm a new editor, however, with all due respect, that has no bearing on your inclination to decide on behalf of all viewers what should be made available to them.

I very much understand the purpose of Wikipedia.  My assertion is NOT that the middle-finger incident should be included in the subject article (I started) because of news reports, as you contend.  If you will review the foregoing, the reason why I cited the news reports is because a flagrantly reckless comment was inserted that what is of issue now is not worthy of documenting when the exact opposite is true; the news reports is best evidence in that regard, and the person who said it is not worthy has only but his mouthan inferior source of 'evidence,' relatively speaking.  It is noteworthy, and, if you can come to appreciate the context of the subject's profession and for which has become known to be involved in, then you'll come to appreciate the significance it plays out in the essential need to properly reflect the entirety of the trial in which the subject became a major fixture as co-counsel.

Your example of everyday political speeches is seriously an aytypical example by which to convey your point:  Contrary to a mudane, everyday speech, here, an attorney just allegedly got out of court in obtaining a siginficant finding in his client's favordefeating immense odds and seemingly going against the court of public opinionand just afterwards gathered with his team at a restaurant just down the street from that historic victory, during which he released the manifestation of his emotions, etc., as one could imagine.  This was included as part of a segment of the whole article of the article-there is no article specifically on this incident, so let's also come to appreciate that.

And, to the contrary that this incident is of interest only at the moment, more and more discussions are being held about the audacious incident, and has cultivated an interest in what happens next, as if it is leading to a whole host of other actions (whether that includes the filing of a bar complaint, etc.), and this leads us to the national grand scale interest of the audacity of officers of courts acting in such a manner, etc.

Furthermore, I concede that Wikipedia is not in existence for the greater good, and that was never my contentio.  Again, you misunderstood the context I place in the words, """"public interests."""" Going back to the above, it is incontrovertible that is of the interests of the public, and, consequently, it should be documented well because, as noted in the latter paragraph, it is beginning to take shape in having a lasting impact on what we have come to expect from individuals, such as the subject of the article.

Let otherscertainly at least those who helped me in creating the articlechime in with their thoughts before you take an action on behalf everyone else.  Let's not do something in such a haphazard way.  Do not deny information in haste.   """,0

 Packerfansam 

Better to continue the discussion here, I think.

The ANI, in which we both participated, was closed out in June or so with no action, based on her assurances that she understood the nature of the problems she'd occasioned, and a promise to try to stop.  You'll recall that she had been removing references from articles to non-Christian religions and thought, sexual orientation, and sex generally, among other things; and while I was the one to raise this initially at ANI, it is certainly fair to say that I was not the only one to be troubled by these edits.

As the matter wrapped up, I was skeptical that she appreciated the problem (she described it along the lines of """"offending one or two users"""") or that she'd actually quit the problematic editing, but after being characterized as """"overzealous"""" on the point, I withdrew.

She has slowed, but certainly not quit, her POV editing.  A partial list of such edits since then includes:

July 9
At Christianity, without explanation, she recast the ‚ÄúCriticism and apologetics‚Äù section as ‚ÄúArguments and apologetics‚Äù, and removed sourced critical commentary by Nietzsche, Bertrand Russell and current Jewish and Muslim theologians, as well as a (sourced) observation by an atheist that some Bible stories may be based on myth.

July 30
At Trois-Rivi√®res, removed without explanation the identification of a (Canadian) Liberal Party politician as ‚Äúliberal‚Äù, as well as a reference to another person‚Äôs being the first Jew elected to public office in the British Empire

August 15
She erased, without comment, mention of Hugh Hefner‚Äôs attendance at the Art Institute of Chicago.

August 18
She removed proper and wikilinked mention of a notable alum who is best known (and described as) an LGBT activist.

October 15
At Ted Turner, she removed a reliably-sourced quote from Turner declaring himself to be agnostic, claiming it was ‚Äúcontradicted‚Äù by info elsewhere in article, when the excised information was more recent than the ‚Äúcontradictory‚Äù text and, indeed, nicely illustrated the point (in the source itself), which is that Turner has waffled on the issue over the years.

Here too I am not the only editor to remain concerned - see this Talk page entry from September.

I agree that the """"party school"""" edit to the University of Wisconsin is, in the larger picture, kind of a silly thing; but between her registered account and the IP she sometimes edits from, she has made the same edit at least four times now - see May 15, June 13, October 3 in addition to today's.  And to be clear, she's not removing the """"party school"""" material but just the (perfectly good) citation to Playboy.  Indeed in her October 3 entry, she updated the """"party school"""" rankings to 2015 and went out and found a different source to insert in Playboy's stead.

So I take your point, that maybe this particular edit is a trivial thing to template her on; but she has continued her practice (albeit slowed) of idiosyncratic, unexplained or deceptively described removal of content for reasons that can only be explained as in furtherance of a personal point of view.  I don't think that such editing should pass without at least occasional comment, and that's what I did.    """,0

"Koala claims that there are no legitimate descendants of the Hohenstaufen, which is a different thing than saying that legitimate male line is extinct. And in this very case, it is incorrect to allege that legitimate descents via women are nonexistent, while legitimate male line descent truly is extinct. They are not the same thing, as those of us who know genealogy, are well aware. I observe that the Yopie has chosen to join the same falsehood. I think Yopie and Koala need to cease their falsehoods and stop those edits of theirs. I understand Yopie is not fluent enough in English (being obviously a foreigner, from Czechia). Those 'warnings' Yopie distributes here and there, are manifestly unwarranted, and rather a signal of twisted tactics in Wikipedia conduct than anything constructive. For example, Yopie sometimes alleges vandalism in clear cases of non-vandalism. Yopie's such behavior should and may lead to him getting sanctioned.   

as to Yopie's quibbling using unrelated claims, I suppose he means to say that all female-line descents from all dukes of Anjou are illegitimate. But of course those who know genealogy and titles, are aware that strictly speaking, neither of those peinces actually are 'princes' of Anjou, they would themselves be first to admit that their claim is to the title of duke of that.

 Joseph Szigeti 

Hi there! Would you mind taking a look at the Szigeti article and giving me some feedback? I put it up for peer review a few days ago and all it got was a review generated by a bot. The only comment that I found useful was that I can sometimes be too wordy, there are apparently still redundancies and peacock termsbut I can't see any of that stuff in my own writing right now, I need someone with fresh eyes to look at it. I'm hoping to put it up on WP:FAC as soon as possible but I also don't want to nominate it before it's ready. Thanks, talk 

Looks good; it's thorough and reads well.  As is my nature, rather than listing a lot of nit-picks, like they do at the Featured Article Pillory, Good Article Gauntlet and A-Class Inquisition, I uncapped my nit-picker and picked the few nits I found.  Optionally you could expand the """"reception"""" section; there's lots of commentary on  Szigeti's playing, and contrasts with his contemporaries  oh, you know, everyone from Kreisler to Heifetz to Nathan Milstein might be interesting  none of that is necessary, though, it's just something I might do if I were writing it.  I wondered about separating out the """"family life"""" section from the main biography, since you cover the """"bureaucratic entanglements"""" part twice, but in different levels of detail, but if you stitch that into the main part of the biography it could overwhelm it, so ... maybe fine as is.  Good article!   (talk) 

Oh, one other minor thing  I eradicated a lot of ghost hard returns, such as   I hope I didn't inadvertently bork your paragraphing, since the paragraph is together in the visible text but appears to be split in the edit window.  I assumed the lines were meant to be together.  (talk) 

Thanks for the nitpicking, it was exactly what I wanted you to do. ) I've had the same thoughts about the """"Reception"""" section, just not really the time to go paw through the stacks to find interesting little tidbits. Any ideas on what books would be most useful in that regard?
I meant to take out the now-redundant part about bureaucratic entanglements, must have just slipped my mind. Completely mortified that I got the poor man's date of death wrong this whole time, btw... talk

The problem with titling a geographic article based on """"who should control the area"""" rather than """"who does control the area"""" is that it leads to endless arguments over who has the better claim.  Using """"who does control the area"""" makes people unhappy, but at least it's easy to determine.

As a case in point: the city of Jerusalem.  Who """"should"""" control and name it?  The current Israeli nation?  The Palestinians?  The British?  they conquered it in 1917.  Or should it be Turkey, the successor to the Ottoman Empire, who controlled it prior to that?  Egypt, who controlled it in the 13th century?  Germany? Fredrick II held it during the Crusades.  The Vatican, as spiritual successor to the Crusaders?  Italy, as successors to Rome?  Any surviving descendants of the Jebusites, who the Israelites displaced in antiquity?

In the South we had Virgil, Cicero, and Augustus before the Germanic Race could either read or write.""""

 Yes, among those times one was a barnstar she gave me too but is rather hard to draw related conclusion from unrelated events.

Well, now that I think, the block was done after a post in which I was telling her that if she was stopping with her problems (her problems are not with me or about posting things about me) I also """"forgive her""""(=stop hounding her). The block is not stopping me from hounding her, since there is now nothing to be stopped. That is why I think it lost its purpose already.

"Uncle Max
Over the last month there's been a few edits (and reverts) by others regarding Uncle Max as a CBBC programme. It's a fact that it was originally commissioned and transmitted by CITV Channel in 2006 (repeated December 2007). However, since January 2008, it is now being broadcast on BBC One, presumably after the BBC picked up the rights.

There is one other thing that just occured to me: an encyclopedia deals in facts, not in speculation about what a given person may or may not be.  I doubt you would find a list like this in any other encyclopedia (not necessarily a reason to remove it - Wikipedia has lots of good stuff not in other encyclopedias), and it would be inappropriate to have a list like """"warning signs your neighbor may be a serial killer"""" or """"how to tell if your best friend is gay"""".  It may be better to find a site that has a list like this (you could probably find something like it on the APA web site, a good source) and provide a link at the bottom of the page.  I also am not comfortable replacing """"factual"""" with """"common sense"""".  Thank you, by the way, for avoiding an edit war.

Felix and I are clearly going to keep alternating edits, me putting them in, him cutting, me putting them back, etc etc, which seems like a real waste of time. That isn't good for wiki, and it's frankly very tedious.

I edited the entry to clear up some misconceptions that partisan media groups are prone to spread.  Groups like the Cristian Science Monitor and UK Guardian are generally good outlets but their info on the video story was inaccurate and therefore should only be mentioned as a footnote on mainstream media inadvertantly spreading misconceptions.

One lists random shooting of Iraqisthe video does not show that.  It shows vehicles rapidly approaching PSD convoys where everyone else in the area noticed the huge sign thats stenciled on the back of the vehicles, (in Arabic), telling them to stay 100 meters back or be fired upona detail that has yet to be mentioned in the media but is severely mandatory for Aegis vehicles.
Notice all the other vehicles in the distancethey're not stopped at a stop light or sign...they're slowly rolling forward pacing the convoy.

The contention in the video, (and the subject matter of the investigation), is not weather the vehicles should've been fired upon or not, but insteadwhy did they sustain fire after the vehicles stopped and from such a distance.",0

Good science is conservative, and so is Barrett and QW. When new medical knowledge is established, QW articles get updated. Some which are outdated may not even exist anymore, or they have been revised to include new data. That's the proper way to do things. If QW were to trumpet new knowledge too  quickly, they would often end up having to backtrack, because most new knowledge ends up being a false lead that proves to be a disappointment. That's exactly what quacks do, and make money by selling such poorly supported """"new"""" knowledge. Barrett knows better than to do that.

Notability of Survival boys
 A tag has been placed on Survival boys requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

Please accept a belated thank you for the well wishes upon my retirement as FAC delegate this year, and apologies for the false alarm of my first‚Äîand hopefully last‚Äîretirement; the well wishes extended me were most kind, but I decided to return, re-committed, when another blocked sock was revealed as one of the factors aggravating the FA pages this year.  Maintaining standards in featured content requires vigilance, dedication and knowledge of people like you, who are needed; thank you for all you've done so well for so many years!  Somehow, somehow we never ever seem to do nothin' completely nice and easy, but here's hoping that 2013 will see a peaceful road ahead and a return to the quality and comaraderie that defines the FA process, with the help of many dedicated Wikipedians!

Vandalism warning
One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

"Hi Horst. Nice to meet you. You're doing a great job, especially if English isn't your first language. I'd hate to be editing in anything other than English.

Signing is done when you are editing a 'talk' page. When you are having a discussion it really helps to know who said what, and when. We always encourage people to sign whatever they write there. However in articles everything is considered 'common property'. We don't sign what we write, because we don't want to think that we 'own' it in any way; someone might come along and change it later. Once an article has been in existence for more than a few days there are usually many people who have contributed to it. In some cases there may be nothing left of what the first author wrote.

What a lot of people do is put a list of articles that they have made big contributions to on their own user page. That gives you an idea of what a person has done here without claiming 'ownership'.

I hope you are finding out what you need to know. Feel free to ask lots of questions. Wikipedia:Village pump is useful if you can't find the answer anywhere else, or ask me or someone else. Enjoy your time here.  15:14, 16 Mar 2004 (UTC)",0

The Oxford English Dictionary, Vol II C, Oxford at the Clarendon Press, 1970, p.1181).

Oxford University Press, 2002, p.324) Steben‚Äôs paper then clearly describes Confucius‚Äô criticism. As another example, WP‚Äôs article on Yayue refers to Confucius‚Äô writing: ‚ÄúThe term yayue itself first appeared in the Analects,[2][3] where yayue was considered by Confucius to be the kind of music that is good and beneficial, in contrast to the popular music originated from the state of Zheng which he judged to be decadent and corrupting.[4][5] Yayue is therefore regarded in the Confucian system as the proper form of music that is refined, improving, and essential for self-cultivation, and one that can symbolize good and stable governance.[6][7] ‚Äú The Analects contain music criticism whether the word ‚Äúcriticism‚Äù appears or not. I think you may be the only person around who thinks otherwise. In the future, if you make assertions like, ‚ÄúYou claim that """"Confucius' Analects is, in regard to music, criticism""""; but the reference that you quote in support of your claim utterly fails to actually support it, because it merely never speaks of criticism,‚Äù please cite a reference to support your argument. Your continuing argument that a thing cannot be accepted as theoretical unless it specifically uses the word ‚Äútheory‚Äù is similarly problematic because it is not supported anywhere that I can find.

100s of Short Stories Claim
One of the trends I have noticed with Wikipedia articles on authors is the tendency to exaggerate the number of short stories an author wrote. I think this stems from a research laziness to actually look up the stories. The inaccuracy diminishes Wikipedia's crdibility in my opinion.

I certainly do not have a problem with this user CORRECTING birth date years to reflect the truth, provided some kind of proof is given in the form of a link to an authoritative web site or other source.  The evidence indicates however that the changes made by this user were in fact arbitrary additions or subtractions of a year or two or ten.  It may be that the user inadvertently hit on a """"correct"""" year purely by accidental coincidence, particularly if there are """"source information"""" sites that have alternate years of birth posted as well.  But there are other cases in the contributions list where the user made a change to a false year, and then changed it back to the correct year, either to confuse the anti-vandalism patrollers, or to make the latest edit look like a true and legitimate one.  Either way, I think it would be good practice for us all to provide a reference link and edit summary any time such a change is made.

Notice
This article focuses on the military campaign, while the American Revolution covers the origins of the war, as well as other social and political issues.

Please try to keep this article at a reasonable length. The current approach has been to summarize the war in a way that will be clearly understandable to the general reader, without cluttering it up with too many details. Concentrate on the major figures and actions, and try to leave detailed discussion of war strategies, battle casualties, historical debates, etc. to linked articles about specific battles or actions.

Instead of adding additional detail to this lengthy article, consider adding your information to an article on a specific battle, or to one of these campaign articles currently in development. Additionally, one campaign, Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga (box at right), does not yet have an article specifically about those operations. Perhaps you will start it Miguel!

NPOV

Reading this article it looks like the US won the war solo, with some assistance (which was mostly inept) from some other countries, one of which happened to be France.  This is evident in the introduction and throughout the article.  The introduction is particularly blatant, mentioning non-American intervention only as an after thought.  Should the WWI and WWII articles mention American intervention as an afterthought too? Am I the only one to think this is a problem?   

I have edited the intro so that it is less laughable.    
I agree especially Yorktown   

Casualties
I think that the casualty figures in this article are incorrect, as 25,000 Americans died in all, and 24,000 British and their allies.

I have repeatedly expressed the opinion that the most idiotic, as opposed to merely lazy, thing that Tyson has been revealed to have done was to listen to Bush's Biblical quotation and write a note to himself (which in the event he was too lazy to locate) to the effect, apparently, that Bush had clowned himself by taking credit for star names that were actually Arabic. So, since I wrote the words you complain about, it should be obvious that they are not intended to make Tyson seem in any way correct. I would be in favor of making this clearer by quoting someone to the effect that attributing to Isaiah the intent to take credit for star charts drawn up a millennia after Isaiah's death is profoundly stupid, but I was in a hurry to replace a vacancy on the page and an appropriate source didn't spring to mind. In any case, I am adamantly opposed to the change you propose, since it removes all specifics, leaving a tasteless gruel, and I don't see anything particularly """"encyclopedic"""" about bad writing.

I understand what you're saying, but this is not a disciplinary measure, it is further offence as an admin not only attacks my WQA response, but then conceals their attack by turning my behaviour into hyperbole to reduce their guilty. I don't apologise to people with such motives, or who serve protect themselves. The project only risks degenerating when sysop is left in the hands of people who abuse it. I maintain that the block is a front, a pretext. If reviewing admins are failing to take time to determine that and recognise the integrity of my claim, instead of taking Fram's for granted, which is contrary to """"we're all equals on wiki"""", then I will have no choice but to raise the matter elsewhere, such as RfC or ArbCom. This isn't about discipline, at my age I don't consider """"you can't login"""" as anything like you suggest, because it's not like losing wages. It's the principle of the matter. My contribs to WQA were meticulously used as spin against me, instead of the AGF everyone else saw them as. I don't intend to let Fram sit on a high horse any longer. Either they apologise first and withdraw their false assertions, or they'll have to explain them to RfC or ArbCom. Which I'm sure is much more complex and time consuming and stressful than admitting to any wrong-doing, but so be it, I stand for what I believe in and always have. I won't be bullied by someone like that. So really, the ball is in their court. If no one is counting coup, that applies to the admin who attacked me in an undignified manner, and continues to do so by maintaining their position ‚Äì though now shielding themselves behind a wall of admins instead of facing up to the fact they erred. COI is clearly affecting their actions, or unwillingness to show face. They can either opt-in and admit they were wrong for their attack, or wait until a higher channel, one that even exceeds their stance, asks why they attacked my contribs and synthesised a despicable """"bad faith"""" conclusion.

This is not your playground.
I do not know what are your motives to acting as you do as nobody has ever seen you here, but you do seems to go at it with a revenge.
Any reasons who would be worth mentioning now?
You have just been elected admi and the first thing you do is blocking and banning fox from a site you don't know and that you were not aware of for 24 hours ago.
This don't go, you are overstepping wikis rules and previously made decision about this talkpage.
You are acting very unbalanced and provocating a chaos who wasn't there before and who in fact wasn't there as far as the 22th of september. Isn't your role to make things work? 
Another veru very important thing is that you are walking on my article about a Settlement Proposal, that I do recommend you to read carefully, and that you don't have answer to in your recents edits above, and who therefor have no place what so ever under my article and as a part of it.
So moove your articles above, to follow suite of your childrens fights, and leave the growing up doing the right thing.
This article above was the one I was writng and in fact inserted in Meru own talk page before you made your intrance here, and before the situation degenerated that much.
I did it in an attempt to calm tempers down and create a new tangible goal with better opportunity to solve this dilema than revert war and banishments war.
I was stopped at inserting my article by constant editing of article from people fighting, and had each time to perform some changement of my article before saving it, at the end it was too late, you hade arrived, talk like c√©sar, ban a person wihtout valuable and argued explainations, without warning, and taken over the role assignated to Meru by N. Turnbull a few days ago.

By the time I arrived to save my article about burrying the hachet, heads had already rolled, thanks for you.
For your knowledge, you did it at midnight, a saturday evening, and this kind of action will have required the presence of more users, and an agreement between those.
Your opinion about the presence of Igor or not on his talkpage is none of your business, but the business of the arbitration comity and their decision, not yours.
You will have to be more patient and leave to other the right to decide.
Know your chain of command, and the wikis appointed chain of event before a ban can take place, specialy a definitiv ban!
What about the other guy who begin this reverting phase all together? isn't he guilty as well or is he your personnal friend in the discussion forum?
For if this is the case, and if you do have preferences for who is right and who is wrong, so you shouldn't be here and make interventions as well.
You have to stay neutral, but your judgement sounds arbitrary to me, to the point that even your collegue Meru didn't understood what and why you were doing this and disagreed.
Why are you making troubles, and tell me why the alone person who support your actions, is rjb, the exact person known for insulting peoples very often, reverting all the time, and having started this reverting war completely iognoring previous concensus made about the contain of the biography on this talk page.
He was destroying the work of people, to who it had taken several weeks to obtain.
You didn't baned him, why? Is he your socket puppet, or are you his?
What were you doing 6 hours ago and why did you came here?
Did someone warned you?
What triggered your hush at coming by, first time, so late?
I would very much like to know.

You will please move your dispute and different blowings up on one another on a different place, and will take your bad saturday night mood swing somewhere else than on this talkpage, unless you have a satisfactory explaination for what just did happened.
You can't ban Igor when Holger Beck Nielsen is going to make an intervention on this talk page. I hope you know who this person is.
i do notice that the 2 persons who made reverting a war, and insisted on it are ybm and rjb who are both in very close contact with each other, and in fact I am quiet sure that rjb is The socket puppet of YBM. This way he can do it again and again and",0

VandalProof 1.2 Now Available
 
After a lenghty, but much-needed Wikibreak, I'm happy to announce that version 1.2 of VandalProof is now available for download! Beyond fixing some of the most obnoxious bugs, like the persistent crash on start-up that many have experienced, version 1.2 also offers a wide variety of new features, including a stub-sorter, a global user whitelist and blacklist, navigational controls, and greater customization. You can find a full list of the new features here. While I believe this release to be a significant improvement over the last, it's nonetheless nowhere near the end of the line for VandalProof. Thanks to , I now have an account on test.wikipedia.org with SysOp rights and have already been hard at work incorporating administrative tools into VandalProof, which I plan to make available in the near future. An example of one such SysOp tool that I'm working on incorporating is my  tool, which simplifies the process of performing history merges from one article into another. Anyway, if you haven't already, I'd encourage you to download and install version 1.2 and take it out for a test-drive. As always, your suggestions for improvement are always appreciated, and I hope that you will find this new version useful. Happy editing!   """,0

Wikipedia takes this very seriously because the whole site can be found responsible for things that editors like you and I say, even if it's not in article space. For this reason, biographies of living people are taken very seriously, and come under the most scrutiny of any Wikipedia articles. Here is the appropriate policy, it's vital that you read it if you want to edit articles about living people.

With regard to the Anita Sarkeesian article, if there are specific additions that you want to make to it, please suggest those on the talkpage. """"She's a liar"""" is insufficient, you need to find a notable source whose content you want to add. This policy details how we determine what sources are notable.

At the end of the day, though, whatever you believe, Wikipedia is going to describe the positions and opinions of a lot of people you disagree with. That doesn't mean that Wikipedia endorses those points of view, simply that they are notable people whose statements and actions are worth documenting here.

"Words of Encouragement in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda
Damemk, You have come to the same conclusions about Bulgarian 19th Century Nationalistic Propaganda on English Wikipedia.
User:Laveol is one of the most prominent editors on Wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about Republic of Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Language|Culture|Sports and what else not.
He is spending a lot of time working on his cause, pushing Bulgarian Nature in the articles of the domain of Republic of Macedonia.
How far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at Wikipedia:WikiProject_ROMacedonia where he has listed himself as a member.
So just my few words of concern for the Macedonian Articles in English Wikipedia, and the great damage done by User:Laveol and other users with the Bulgarian and Anti-Macedonian Propaganda.
Hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in Republic of Macedonia the things will go in right direction: Removing the Bulgarian Propaganda from Macedonian articles, cleaning them of false fabricated information, and giving the facts to the world, and the views of the Macedonian Science and sources.

Dispute(s)
(*Note to NSBR, TSSR, SSBA, AND ISSDC contributors: Please advise if you concur or disagree with my summaries below):

From everything I have read, it would appear, as evidenced throughout this talk page AND the article edit page, contributors representing the NSBR, TSSR, SSBA, and ISSDC registries/clubs, have agreed/compromised/concurred regarding the following:

1)They have agreed/compromised to the inclusion of ALL currently established registries/clubs affiliated with the Shiloh Shepherd dog, including the ISSR/SSDCA as an acknowledged Shiloh Shepherd registry/club in the article.

2)They have agreed/compromised that the article contain an acknowledgement that Ms. Barber initiated this breed and originated the standard for the breed.

3)They concur that the article content must contain """"verifiable"""" documentation, not based on """"original"""" research and stated only from a """"neutral point of view"""", in agreement with Wikipedia's stated requirements for content criteria.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About#Wikipedia_content_criteria)

4)They have agreed/compromised, in order to resolve this dispute and prevent potential for unverifiable, dependent, biased inclusions/comparisons/contrasts by any registry/club, including their own, to refrain from including any registry/club specific information and promotion in the article, other than to cite the existence and names of each, and to simply include ALL registry's/club's homepage website links at the bottom of the article, which will allow Wikipedia readers the opportunity to gain access, should they choose, to each of the various registries'/clubs' individual purported documentation, research, and points of view. 

5)They concur that the article should NOT contain original publication of """"original thought"""", """"propaganda"""", """"advocacy"""", """"self-promotion"""", and """"advertising"""", in agreement with Wikipedia's stated requirements for """"Wikipedia: What Wikipedia is Not"""" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_propaganda_machine).

6)They have agreed/compromised, in order to resolve this dispute and prevent inclusion of these disallowed contents by any registry/club, including their own, to refrain from including any registry/club specific information and promotion in the article, other than to cite the existence and names of each, and to simply include ALL registry's/club's homepage website links at the bottom of the article, which will allow Wikipedia readers the opportunity to gain access, should they choose, to each of the various registries'/clubs' individual thoughts, propaganda, advocacy, self-promotion, and advertising.

7)In order to resolve this dispute and prevent bias regarding the article's descriptive contents concerning """"Health"""", they have agreed/compromised to refrain from including any statements citing, reviewing, or comparing/contrasting ISSR, NSBR, TSSR, SSBA, SSDCA, or ISSDC health practices/policies and they propose the """"Health"""" section of the article contain only a statement listing those health issues acknowledged by ALL registries/clubs (gastrointestinal problems -gastric torsion/bloat, bacterial overgrowth syndrome- and skeletal or bone disorders such as hip dysplasia, panosteitis and osteochondritis), a recommendation by ALL registries/clubs that testing be conducted and a statement that """"these reports clearly show that, as giant breeds go, the Shiloh is arguably a healthy example"""".
 
8)They have agreed/compromised that regarding """"Size"""", """"Coat"""", """"Color"""", and """"Temperament"""", there appears to be very limited dispute re: the """"standards"""" contained therein and that the section should remain free of any statements citing, reviewing, promoting any individual registry/club and comparing/contrasting one registry/club with another.

These compromises and requested article inclusions/exclusions meet Wikipedia's policies/procedures for content criteria, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About#Wikipedia_content_criteria) in that they embrace the following:

1) Neutral(WP:NPOV)in that the article would be """"representing all views fairly and without bias""""  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view). In FACT, there are no requests from the NSBR, TSSR, SSBA, and ISSDC registries/clubs for the inclusion of any comparisons/contrasts (negative or otherwise) between any of the registries/clubs, including the ISSR/SSDCA,  nor have they requested that any clubs other than their own, be exluded from inclusion in the article.

  Dear Administrator,
 this morning I edited Derrick Bell's page and added a link from a NYT article that state that one of his famous essays, The Trade Spacers is considered antisemitic by many people.  A few hours later, the addition was deleted.  I posted it again, and noticed that another user did the following:  
 19:14, 8 March 2012‚Äé HJ Mitchell (talk | contribs)‚Äé m . . (14,795 bytes) (0)‚Äé . . (Protected Derrick Bell: Violations of the biographies of living persons policy

I found this action abusive as Bell has been dead for months.  I proceeded to go to this user talk page and posted the following:
   I find it very interesting that what you continuously delete is the comment that Space Traders is considered an antisemitic essay, even though there was a link to the original article from NYT where it was discussed and prominent Professors like Dershowitz have discussed the antisemitism in that work. There is no vandalism involved and to be honest it is arrogant and totalitarian to just lock the page under false pretenses because you disagree with people's philosophy. The reason that people have started shunning Wikipedia is exactly attitudes like that to prevent a free flow of facts. If someone had written about the opinions of the faculty that Bell left the deanship at Oregon Law School because he was going to be fired since he spend all the time lecturing away from the school, I could understand that. But there are articles about his antisemitism. Bell's page does not even include his racist comments about Clarence Thomas, """"The choice of Clarence Thomas replicates the slave masters' practice of elevating slaves willing to mimic the masters' views."""" Also, Prioryman, name calling people you disagree with """"dunderheads"""" really diminishes Wikipedia and perpetuates the impression that most administrators are bigots.

The user not only did not have the courtesy of replying to my comment, but deleted it.  I posted the following later:
9 March 2012 (UTC)Dear HJ, do you represent the Wikipedia censorship brigade? I do not usually engage in conversations here so please let me know what I did wrong and you deleted my comment that there are NYT article's about Bell's antisemitism, as well as questioning why you locked the page since Bell is DEAD. I am a simple person, the type of people that Wikipedia was supposed to inspire to all contribute but totalitarian behavior like the one yo have exhibited both at Bell's page and here are what sours people with Wikipedia. Is not it bigoted behavior for Prioryman to call people that have opposing views """"dunderheads""""? I am sorry but ypur behavior, as well as prioryman's, along with your sarcastic tone in history is what diminishes Wikipedia and makes you equal to the totalitarian freepers. The facts are the facts. Is not the Gray Lady a sufficiently legitimate source?

Then that user """"pressed the bell"""" so I will be blocked. I may have been naive and thought that senior members in Wikipedia have these talk pages to discuss the issues. I was not trying to harass or attack anyone.  To the contrary, I have been totally respectful of everybody. However, if the behavior that I encountered today is the typical behavior of the administrators/senior staff, then it is really sad that this great endeavor has degenerated to  a site where only political correct speech is allowed. Or it may be because HJ lives in England where free speech is not allowed. As Americans, that's one of our liberties that is cherished and should be defended. Free speech is what makes us different from Europe and has allowed intellectual thinking and academic research to flourish, instead of remaining stagnant as it happens in Europe.  I am really surprised by this whole behavior. Is this high school, or what? We are all adults and we should engage in conversation, not call mom when we do not like something. My ten year old does this, not an adult.""",0

Challenged content

The following material has been challenged by two separate IP editors, and restored by one editor (Altenmann). Having reviewed it, it does not appear to be in an encyclopedic style and requires a rewrite. As such, I've posted it here for discussion and reworking to avoid disruption. The text in dispute is as follows:

Pincus offers managerial advice on handling difficulties caused by both types: she defines the know-it-all as the """"Truly Smart Know-It-All"""", an employee with """"a intellectual handle on the job requirements that is spectacular"""", but who """"doesn't 'see' boundaries"""", and the omniscient deity as a person who """"thinks nothing of imposing or intruding"""". Lloyd makes no such distinction, although he notes that ironically, Know-It-Alls can sometimes know what they are talking about, and simply have such a brusque style of communication that people are unwilling to listen. He characterizes Know-It-Alls as superficially domineering and controlling, but insecure underneath. The outward focus on the inferiority of their fellows is intended to mask the inner sense of their own weaknesses in knowledge, skills, and competence.
 
Pincus recommends different strategies for each type. For the case of the Truly Smart Know-It-All she observes that a manager might have to bend the rules somewhat to accommodate the negative aspects of such an employee, which include impatience, an exaggerated sense of self-importance, and other peculiarities, in order to retain the positive benefits of the employee's knowledge and experience. Although she also cautions that managers have to weigh the benefits against the taxing effects, upon managers and staff, of employing an """"outlandish prima donna"""". She also recommends that rule-bending not extend to allowing the peculiarities of a true know-it-all with odd habits to be displayed to outsiders, such as customers and other visitors, and that such employees be clearly requested not to flout their eccentricities when such visitors call. She also states that managers should not be afraid of asking a genius employee questions, and should insist upon mutual respect and not adopt a self-deprecating attitude simply in order to placate such employees. Lloyd similarly advises managers to take a strong line against any form of intellectual bullying, either of others or indeed of the manager.
 
For the Know-It-All who doesn't, Pincus recommends to managers that they give praise where it is due, and that they assign such employees to work together with one, or two, other people, and regularly check for signs of stress. Notess observes that the last tactic mentioned can be unsuccessful if a Know-It-All is paired with a novice, since the Know-It-All quickly takes control away from the novice.
 
LLoyd observes that getting a point across to a Know-It-All can sometimes be difficult, and require much repetition, because such people are more interested in what they themselves are saying than in listening to others.

"I just figured out how to go back years in the article history. The bench press record has been in the article pretty much since the beginning. Here it is http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bench_press&direction;=next&oldid;=5794667 Taking out the record would be a shame. The reason there is a difference in the Guinness record and lifts sanctioned by less notable organizations is that there are different rules on what technique constitutes a lift, if equipment is allowed to aid the lifter, and if performance enhancing drugs are tested for. If you take away all rules and judging, then anyone can claim the record. Aaron's home run record does not include the home runs he hit in the negro leagues. Josh Gibson is not the HR record holder. You can't just go out to your local gym, alert the media and complete the lift. It has to be judged by an existing set of regulations. What is a lift? Is there a pause on the chest? Can the athlete use legs to push? Can they be on drugs? Who tests? How often? Who weighs the official plates that were used? Does it have to be a standard bench? Are you allowed to put bungee cords under your lifting shirt? When is the lift complete? Lucky for us there is already an organization, recognized by the world, that takes care of all there rules and regulations. The argument is simple. If you want to be considered the greatest quarterback of all time, you compete in the NFL, the highest governing body of that sport.

 Geneology Nightmare 

The beginning of this article confuses Alexios the first with his grandson of the same name. It says that he was the son of John II, when John II was in fact the son of Alexios I. Alexios the grandson was the son of John II. The top picture entitled """"Depiction of Alexios as a young prince in Hagia Sophia, Istanbul"""" is also of Alexios the grandson (who died young, hence why he is frowning), and not Alexios I. 

I should also note that the lady Anna Dalassena is listed as the mother of Alexios I. This is correct. But it says that she fathered him with her grandson, so that needs to be taken care of.

I addded the link to positivism, because the name of Auguste Comte is often associated to it. He is even said to be the founder of this philosophical movement.

 European Borders 

There is a BIG problem going on about whether Republic of Georgia and other neighboring countries should be included in Europe or not .As you know there is no official border between europe and Asia and there is a great number of unofficial versions .so you might think that it is LOGICAL to explain all of the versions that exist for today on that page..........      well sadly thats not what most editors think. they put one version there and every time I changed it, it went back to the previous version. now I am just wondering do these people think it is their personal page or what gives them the right to rely on several sources and ignore other ones that are not any less trust me. They should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version  and not even bothering to explain why, it is unacceptable. I contacted one of the editors and he/she said that he chose that version because he/she """"thinks it is the most neutral one"""". I am sorry but what some users """"think"""" should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be Credible. they should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an OFFICIAL border ! Council of Europe, the oldest organization in europe classifies country as european,  country is in the middle of the NATO membership process (only european countries are eligible for it according  to the North Atlantic Treaty) and they are not even mentioning why they left it out.

"Our family was also really fond of Audi, and owned two. The second one, a red 5000, did however unintendedly accelerate when I was at an intersection, and almost caused me to get into a head-on collision as I was attempting a left hand turn. I was familiar with the news at the time regarding the unintended acceleration, and the fact that the pedals were close together, so I released my foot from what I thought were both pedals, looked down and placed my foot on the brake only, the engine kept racing, and due to my leg strength, I was able to control the 5000, but I can see how a weaker person caught unaware might not be able to control the car as the rpm's were past 5000. As it was, it still took about 10-20feet to control the Audi. If it didn't happen to me, I wouldn't have believed it. As it was happening I couldn't believe it. I find it degrading that this article tries to place the blame on the driver as there was a real dangerous issue plaguing some of their cars. In my over 800,000km's driving my various cars, trucks and motorcycles, it has happened only that one time in that one Audi. Please rephrase the wording so that the blame is placed where it belongs; i.e. with Audi and not with the operators/victims.",0

 Edit disagreements  

Where are you getting the figure range for '300-3000' from? I couldn't find these figures in any of the sources you cited, unless you're estimating based on predictions from the article.
Abu Omar al-Shishani is not the chief in command of both Iraq and Syria. This is ridiculous. I don't know why so many people believe this. I suspect it might be becuase he is so prevalent in the IS propaganda that he is somehow the Islamic State's version of Napoleon Bonaparte. I cannot find any reputable source claiming he is anything more than a field commander in northern Syria. He doesn't even feature in any IS leadership hierarchies, which are almost exclusively staffed by Iraqis who have been in the organisations since the early-mid 2000's. When the former commander of the IS Military Council passed away in June 2014 (Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi), Iraqi secutyi forces found some memory sticks and a laptop containing the following leadership information currently pieced together by western analysts. Note how al-Shishani doesn't feature in any of them, save one which turned out to be incorrect. Here they are: , , . Here is the false one which showed al-Shishani succeeding al-Bilawi as the IS military chief of the Military Shura: . However, it was Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, another IS Iraqi commander who had been in the organisation years before al-Shishani had joined who succeeded al-Bilawi as the Chief of the Military Shura. He is shown in the graph as Adnan Latif Hamid al-Sweidawi which is his real name. You never see the upper echelons of the IS hierarchy, the ones who actually control everything. They are not shown in IS propaganda. They are clandestine, mysterious, shadowy figures. Only the pawns are revealed.
You keep stating that Jamaat-ul-Ahrar have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. This is just not true. You might get this impression becuase they broke away from the TTP or the Pakistani Taliban, which swear allegiance to the head of the Afghan Taliban Mullah Omar. But the spokesperson for Jamaat-ul-Ahrar stated that they pledged allegiance to the Taliban leader . The leader of Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, Omar Khalid has strong ties to Ayman al-Zawahiri and Al-Qaeda, a nemesis to the Islamic State. 
You state that Abu Sayyaf have sworn allegiance to the Islamic State, however, the man who swore allegiance to them is not the groups leader, so it is unclear whether or not he is representing Abu Sayyaf or a splinter faction. 
You write that Ansar al-Islam is an Al-Qaeda affiliate, but I can find little to no proof affirming this position. The leadership of Ansar al-Islam have rejected the notion that they swear allegiance to al-Qaeda, despite collaborating with their affiliates, such as the al-Nusra Front.U.S. terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna in January 2003 however disagreed with Krekar and affirmed links of Ansar with al-Qaeda: ‚ÄúAnsar al-Islam has links with al-Qaeda ‚Äì in fact it is an associate group of al-Qaeda‚Äù.]. The U.S Defense Intelligence Agency seemed to have affirmed this when they wrote """"Ansar al-Islam is an independent organization that receives assistance from al-Qaeda, but is not a branch of the group.""""DIA, Special Analysis, July 31, 2002, cited in Postwar Findings about Iraq's WMD Programs and Links to Terrorism and How they Compare with Prewar Assessments, pg. 71.""",0

Well, first let me say that if you have any questions about wiki-formatting, just drop me a line, and I'll be happy to help. As for the glossary, I think there's a better way. Remember, as an encyclopedia, it would be better to have articles about each of the terms, and then put the terms into a category so they would all be grouped together. So I think the best way to go would be to start writing articles about the wedding terms. This way you could do each of the terms justice instead of trying to sum them in up in a sentence or two. Finally, as for saving the material, you're free to copy and paste the page to a sandbox so nothing is lost. Best, XMan

"Edits to characters

Just a note of the corrections I made to the character section:

Under Full Moon, I added that in the final episode, she sings 'Love Chronicle' which was the third ending theme and the closing song of Full Moon's last concert.

Under Fuzuki, it said 'fiancee' which not only lacks the accent, but a double e is the feminine.

For Wakaouji, I explained when Takuto explained just after when Izumi tries to trick Mitsuki into jumping, he tells the doctor that he remembers the past and he was Route L's singer, and the agreement they made.

Under Madoka, it doesn't matter if two people audition with the same song. Eternal Song was planned as Madoka's debut single. Madoka's plan was that this way Full Moon wouldn't be able to sing the song at the same time, especially since they originally had the same producer. Since Mitsuki had her heart set on the song, she and Ooshige tried to get another producer. Eventually, under certain conditions, Wakaouji agrees to the job.

Also, in the anime, in one episode showing herself as a young child actress, she is shown to go through a lot before the anime began. Full Moon, on the other hand, rose to stardom with relatively little effort.",0

I have been blocked for responding to KimDabelsteinPetersen's ongoing assaults on Global Warming skeptic articles:

Exposing your arguments as being specious and hypocritical is entirely relevant to stopping the BLP violating assaults that you and Connolley and others in your cabal have carried out. If you're serious about the sourcing standards that you're arguing for, then please apply them equally to all articles in this topic instead of gunning for subjects that you disagree with. You behavior is entirely inappropriate and enormously damaging to Wikipedia. 

The issue was the repeated removal of large sections of sourced content, reverted by several editors. The deletion included removal a statement that Lawrence Solomon is a columnist for the National Post. 

I have no idea why Stephan Shulz, Dabelstein, and Will Connolley have been allowed to continue their POV pushing rampage and are free to continue their efforts to disparage those they disagree with by the smearing them in their biographies. I have no objection to the inclusion of properly sourced criticism, but their use of innuendo, and specious arguments for gutting content and coattracking smears is unacceptable. It is very ironic that at a time when a deletion rampage against unreferenced biographies is going on these editors and their admin allies are allowed to violate our core principles and continue to abuse wikipedia for propaganda purposes. 

I would also note that I was given no warning and no opportunity to amend my comment, if in fact there is soemthign objectionable in it.

Title reign tables, etc
I made tables for the Title reign part, hope that's okay.
 21:17, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)

As the author of the Title History section, I think that the tables are horrible.   I didn't make it that way because it's ugly for anyone that has low screen resolutions.  They are also harder to read in my opinion.  At least, with my presentation of the information, they were easy and straight forward to read.
 02:10, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Finally created an account here, I'm the one who made the tables. Well, I think that my version of the Title History looks better and is better to read. But maybe I'm the only one who thinks that way? I'd like to hear other opinions.
I changed the look of the tables a bit, do they look okay?

I have made two versions of the """"Title History"""" tables now. You can see the other one at Stone Cold Steve Austin. I think the table in Austins article is a bit long. The table in Benoits article might be unfriendly for users with lower resolutions. What do you think which table should be used for the Title Histories for the wrestlers?  12:54, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Do you really need a mini-paragraph for every PPV title event Benoit has?  I mean, in a year, is anyone going to care that Benoit had a US title match against Orlando Jordan at the Great American Bash?

Having a detailed account of every Benoit appearance on SmackDown! is not only tedious, it's unnecessary. -  

Regarding Benoit having """"Super Tombstone Piledriver"""" as a Benoit does regularly, um, no. At one time, a very long time ago, he was doing piledrivers as part of his moveset, but he hasn't done a piledriver, super or otherwise, in many years, dating even well before the ban on dangerous moves in WWE. At this point, anyone who even knows that Benoit did a piledriver at one time should be rewarded for their knowledge of very miniscule trivia. I'm removing it. Someone can consider adding it in as trivia if they like.  

Quotes I WILL MAKE YOU TAP OUT come on he says that!   err

I think Benoit does actually have the record for the longest time in the Royal Rumble. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rumble#Royal_Rumble_Records  ToneLa

IMO, the Personal Life section needs a little bit of an overhaul.  There's the background as to what led to him and Nancy having an affair (Kevin Sullivan told them to travel and appear in public together to maintain kayfabe, to the point of having Nancy grope Chris in bars) leading to the various """"Kevin Sullivan booked his own divorce"""" comments over the years, Nancy changing her name legally to Nancy Benoit (I'm 99% sure of this, as Dave Meltzer, who's friends with Benoit, exclusive refers to her as """"Nancy Benoit""""), and I'm pretty sure he and Nancy had a second child together.   

At the end of the World Wrestling Entertainment section (where it discusses Benoit's neck injury) it states Chris injured his neck in a match with X-Pac. However, I remember reading a quote by Benoit himself where he stated that he actually injured it in a match with Austin (while taking a stunner) and the superplex in the Triple Threat at KoTR simply injured him further. Can anyone verify this?

 A request 

I ask that you consider taking time away from posting on WT:V or the subpage. Your posts there, particularly the multiple polls, became disruptive several weeks ago, and the page has basically ground to a halt because of it. I took six weeks off from editing either the policy or the talk page‚Äîfrom around June 20 until August 7‚Äîjust to make sure other people's voices were heard equally, so I hope you'll consider doing the same. If your proposals are truly supported, they won't be affected by your absence.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

I agree that the main talk page needs a breather from this whole topic.  And I'm ready for quiet work on it in an obscure place for a while.  If you want that to not be the subpage, that's fine with me but I just said there that I went along with the subpage idea.  Sincerely,  North8000  

The main talk page needs a long, long breather. But I think you need a breather too from this topic, partly for your own sake, but also to see whether it has legs without you. At things stand, you're doing two things simultaneously (and in something of a contradiction): keeping it going, and strengthening opposition to it because of the overkill. If you would let it be, you would see whether it has legs of its own. Anyway, just a request.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

I'm ready to slip into low key """"homework"""" on this, even without a request.  Me suggesting that we adopt the first sentence just proposed/suggested by Jimbo Wales was a sort of special departure from that, I saw that as acting more as a facilitator.  I noticed that somebody tried to hide the fact that it was HIS suggestion by changing the section title. North8000  

But not before reverting and continuing to disrupt. You are posting an inherently POV poll; RfCs are supposed to be neutrally worded. I give up on you because it is pointless.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

 I don't think that it is POV to say who wrote the proposed wording.  That was the original title of the section, it's the title that people commented under, and it provides the information of who wrote it.   Since when in Wikipedia does saying the source of something get called """"POV'ing"""" it? And don't forget there is a second dimension to this.  I put up HIS suggestion, and people are removing the fact that it was HIS suggestion simultaneously with villianizing me for putting (it) up a suggestion on the first sentence.  I call that dirty pool.  But, as I said, I put it it up as a facilitator, and don't plan to further advocate it.  North8000  """,0

 Explanation of my recent edits 

Removing bolding and external links within article per WP:MOS. Only first word of section titles should be capitalized, and NCNM should not be placed on section headings (each section is about the subject of the article).

Removal of peacock terms and redundant phrasing, """"extensive, unique, geared to, in its course offerings, more universal, opens numerous, in which students are immersed, designed for students with a special affinity, wanting a more streamlined graduate experience, fully"""". If actually extensive needs a RS that describes it that way, likewise with unique or a description of how its unique. Geared to unless we are talking about gears this is marketing. In its course offerings is redundant. More universal with an explanation this is unnecessary, however universality is a pretty large if vague claim. Students are immersed, describe how program is immersive provide a RS that says it is notable for that. Designed for students with a special affinity, designed for students is a given for a school and special affinity sounds like peacock for interest in. Wanting a more streamlined graduate experience is marketing peacock speak for shorter/smaller course of study. Fully (accredited) is assumed if only partially accredited that would be spelled out. 

Removed wikilink on word school to article Medical school NCNM is not a medical school as described in target article.

Adding ref improve tag: the entire Academic programs section has only the two refs supporting accreditation, the NCNM clinic section is completely unsourced as is the Accreditations and associations section and the NCNM history section. 

I placed 3 citation needed tags on some statements that definitely need references. These are very specific in addition to the article in general needing improved references.

Additional proposed edits:

I think expertise in """"with an expertise in natural medicine"""" should be removed if it can't be supported with a reference. Expertise is substantial claim for education and training only. I am not sure what """"a holistic Chinese medicine education in Western medical sciences"""" means. """"Since its founding, NCNM has sought to preserve and convey the classical modalities of naturopathy and honor the principles that guide naturopathic care:"""" could be rephrased, """"to preserve and convey the classical modalities and honor the guiding principles of naturopathy:"""" if that preserves the meaning. """"The college is alma mater to over 2,000 alumni"""" is redundant if your an alumni it's your alma mater.

Disruptive edits?  No - only correcting a falsehood re-inserted by the perpetrator, who took liberties with the """"consensus"""" decision that he was wildly off base.  Even in a footnote, his original research that islands in the Fraser River are """"not actually part of the continuous mainland"""" is fictitious and constitute digging in his heels on his position; I simply corrected his (ongoing) error and mis-use of language; he wants to mention the City of Richmond, not its main island (Lulu Island, which also includes about 1/3 of the City of New Westminster, namely Queensborough), yet his """"footnote"""" spoke of Richmond as an island.  I'm not the one making the disruptive edits.  Franamax, who's familiar with the area, also concurs about the notion that freshwater islands are obviously part of the mainland and distinct from offshore islands such as Bowen; and that same footnote also re-digs in the false notion that dictionary definitions have anything to do with the meaning of the name.  The RfC accomplished nothing, except the consensus refutation of any validity to his position, and rile my back up over something wildly silly in nature for no good reason; and the RfC closed, with the consensus that JimWae's position was wrong, but a footnote explaining , not asserting.  JimWae simply went ahead and reinserted his original problem-content as if it were all peachy keen and he had won.  But he didn't even get the English idiom """"contiguous mainland"""" correct, I corrected that; he also wanted to centre on the City of Richmond even though that's not, in and of itself, an island (it's about 20); I simply pointed out the absurdity of what he had added by adding other things that didn't fit the dictionary definitions attached to """"lower"""" and """"mainland"""".  If you give as license to absurdity, or tolerate it, then you have to tolerate absurdities ensuant on it with impartiality.  Rivers and lakes are not land, but they are part of """"the mainland"""", mountain peaks are not """"lower"""", but they are part of the Lower Mainland.  So either the RfC stands - with JimWae's assertions being dismissed as original research - or you are enforcing a selective interpretation of it forbidding anyone from altering what JimWae wants to add, even though his addition was not supported by the RfC.  *A* footnote was tolerated by the RfC, or suggested by it.  But nobody said """"let JimWae say whatever he wants so long as it's in footnote form"""".  And if he uses incorrect language/idiom, then anyone (including me) can correct it - the City of Richmond is not an island, and the expression """"continuous mainland"""" is not the correct English idiom for what he thinks he's saying.

 Should Robespierre be classified as a liberal? 

As per the articles on more controversial topics such as fascism and Marxism-Leninism, I have noticed that they address the controversies involved in the ideology such as the Holocaust and the Great Purge - it is not POV to address these because they are important parts of history of the ideology. However the controversial elements of the French Revolution seem to be minimalized here - especially in regard to Robespierre.

When I added a picture of Robespierre, a user removed it, and claimed that it was doubtful where Robespierre was a liberal and claims that the Reign of Terror was not liberal. First of all, I believe a strong argument can be made that demonstrates that Robespierre being a Jacobin upheld many classical liberal values - albeit in a contorted way like Stalin's sociopathic version of Marxism. In Robespierre: The Voice of Virtue, that seeks to describe Robespierre not merely as a tyrant but as a man with genuine beliefs, it describes Robespierre as being a proponent of universal suffrage, of being an abolitionist (seeking to end slavery). Robespierre was part of a revolution that was associated with many classical liberal goals. Robespierre's Reign of Terror against the Girondists and counter-revolutionaries (both real and suspected) that was pursued according to Robespierre to solidify the revolution. Historian Francois Furet claims the Reign of Terror was deeply ideologically rooted in the idea of promoting """"man's regeneration"""" based on free will and enlightenment, that the Committee of Public Safety promoted that resulted in violence against people suspected of being counterrevolutionaries. The issue of Robespierre's association with liberalism - if he was a liberal or if he was not a liberal - needs to be investigated further here by other users, because regardless of Robespierre's controversies he was an important figure in the Jacobin movement and the French Revolution.

"Just look at the stuff about David Irving and how many times the author tries to smear this honourable historian, whose book 'Hitlers War' from 1977 was compulsery reading at West Point and Sandhurst. This really says a lot of the extent of authority as Mr. Irving enjoyed (then). He is still widely believed to be one of the greatest authorities on WW2 and of the nature of the Nazi regime. All this still stands, as everyone can witness for himself by reading some of his books, which are available free of charge from his website as Downloads.

However ONE chapter of the aforementioned book was about the holocaust. And because of that David got subjected to a smearing campaign hitherto unseen in scope. Booksellers was pressured not to sell his books (no mention of this on Wikipedia) - that is why he gives them away for free. Whereever he goes in the world he find arrangements cancelled ib short notice, the hotelliers or universities being pressed to pull the event.

I find David irving to be a good and honourable englishman. His father was naval officer who took part in The Battle of Jutland. You cannot find ANY factual fault in his work. If you can David is the first who wants to know - email him.

By the way, he do not deny the holocaust, which is why your Wikipedia entry is so wrong. He find the whole subject boring, but hardpresset he will tell you that it should be spelled with a small h as there were many holocausts, poles,russians,gypsies and others got killed. Civilians allways get caught out in war, but it is undeniable that the Nazi regime was especially brutal.

 To be a folk without a homeland living among a majority is allways a precaurious situation to be in in times of unrest, or so history has proven many times.

David akcnowledges that many jews got killed, but he happen to hold the view that most died from mal-nutrition and diseases, and that aplyes to ALL inmates in concentrationcamps. So you see he is not denying .",0

I would say that the bottom line is if independent reliable sources describe Cox as Catholic, then we can go with that. The difference is that Cox belongs to a schismatic organization that is several levels removed from the Catholic Church. Williamson, in his association with the SSPX, was directly ordained by a Catholic Church bishop and remained Catholic, even while not in full communion. Note that the Catholic Church affirmed that attendance at an SSPX chapel would fulfill the Sunday obligation, i.e. in a """"Catholic rite"""". I do not know if the Catholic Church has commented on the canonical status of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church, or the validity of the Thuc line of apostolic succession. My suggestion for a succinct description of Cox would be """"Independent Catholic bishop"""", as that is how his church is described.   """,0

Yes, the graph is misleading, but many textbooks and research papers have similar Arrhenius plots which do not show the true y-axis. The reason is that k varies very rapidly with T so that it is usually only convenient to study a small range of T, here 590-660 K. The true y-axis at x = 1/T = 0 corresponds to infinite T and is very far from the experimental range, or """"way off the graph"""". If we insist on a graph which goes to x = 0, the measured points will cover only a small part of the graph which would make it hard to understand. (It would also have led to inaccurate determination of Ea in the days when slopes were determined manually with graph paper, although this is no longer true since slopes are now determined by linear regression with a spreadsheet such as Excel.)
So instead of replacing the graph, I will explain in the article that the left side of the graph is not in fact the y-intercept, and that ln A corresponds to the true y-intercept which must be calculated. Putting a // on the x-axis is also a good idea which I have seen in some textbooks, if someone has the software to re-draw the graph that way.   """,0

RE: MPT
Hi it has come to my attention that it is only the english articles that uses """"MRT"""" instead of """"MPT"""" which is used in the rest of other language wiki articles especially the Macedonian one. Debunking your romanized alphabet argument, it could be seen how even the logo has put """"MPT"""" in a romanized alphabet form therefore should be the one to be followed. It is practice here in wikipedia to use the official naming used by the one being described in the article no matter what their translation to english might be such as Volkswagen which in direct romanized translation is """"Folkswagen"""" but the former prevailed due to it being the one used in the official logo of the company albeit being romanized too. I understand your argument on the main article """"Macedonian Radio Television"""" that is why I kept that because its original name would not make sense in an expanded form here in english wiki. But its acronym should not be meddled upon especially it has a logo to prove it and the main article could provide the knowledge why MPT and what is its translation to english.Lastly the MRT 1 and MRT 2 pages should be really up for a disambiguation as the MRT worldwide may refer to Mass Rapid Transit or an equivalent rail term.

To you, perhaps, but then, you had the unambiguous term """"winningest"""" to help you.  | Talk 

Ambiguity
The problem with """"most successful"""" is that it's ambiguous, since """"most successful"""" can, in general, be defined along many metrics: most sold, most manufactured, greatest market share, and, yes, greatest number of races won using the bike. """"Winningest"""" works along one metric  or two, if one is being deliberately obtuse as to what """"winning"""" means in context of a racing bike. So why not pick a perfectly standard word that avoids ANY ambiguity?

And contrary to Skyring's fake usage claims, """"winningest"""" is a perfectly standard word:

 The Grammarist:
Most participial adjectives are made comparative and superlative with more and most. For example, we say more troubling and most sickening instead of troublinger and sickeningest. So, to many English-speakers, the superlative adjective winningest‚Äîmeaning having the most wins‚Äîsounds wrong. And indeed some peevish grammarians hate the word. Yet despite the existence of grammatically unquestionable alternatives (most winning, best), winningest is deeply entrenched in sports commentary and is not going away any time soon. Those who dislike it might as well get used to it.

Google News searches show winningest has been common since the 1940s, and there are scattered examples from earlier. The word has always been confined mainly to American and Canadian publications. (This is also confirmed by Google Ngram)

Speedy deletion of Rahul saboo
 A tag has been placed on Rahul saboo requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. -  (Talk to me)  """,0

Hello,

You recently deleted File:Nasrallah.jpg, citing this discussion.  I'd just like to know how one person saying the image should be deleted constitutes consensus on the topic, because I really don't think it should.  
There were actually two users supporting deletion (Spartaz and Peripitus). Additionally, deletion discusions are not votes and are instead determined based on the strength of the various arguments presented; in this case, I feel that the delete !votes were more grounded in policy than your own (no offense intended), as previous consensus in many discussions has shown that just because a free image of a person can't be found doesn't mean that one couldn't be made or that a copyright holder of a non-free image won't release it under a free license; therefore, it is replaceable, as Peripitus describes. ‚Äì (T¬†‚Ä¢¬†C¬†‚Ä¢¬†L)",0

 more NPOV issues 

This article is pretty sloppy, as I think most people can tell.  I took out the section on first cause as revised by Nodem, which went beyond just poor style and outright called one side of the debate fallacious, which isn't really appropriate in an article on a philosophical topic.

Maybe I went a bit far?  I just object to statements like, the entirety of space-time came into existence at some point, unless you define this point embedded in a larger space-time outside of our own. The fallacy comes from implying that both the statements, space-time is everything, and something exists outside of space-time, are true. However, I work in computer software and don't do physics (although this is really about philosophy), so maybe I'm just using the the wrong kind of logic?  

If time is finite, then there must be a beginning (which is what I think is meant by """"at some point"""").  I don't think the phrase """"came into existence at some point"""" necessarily implies any metaphysical cause (ie: thing/being 'outside' the universe), does it?  06:59, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I wasn't really comfortable with the version that came before it, though.  First cause is a complex topic, or at least a lot has been said about it, and the previous version of the paragraph was presenting a rather severe dichotomy.  If someone could write a good article about the first cause debate, and maybe link to it from this article, that would be good.  I'm not really qualified to do it.

Also, and I haven't made an edit about this, I'm uncomfortable, as a physicist, with the statement that most astronomers hold to scientific determinism.  While many do, and they may be right, I can tell you that by far the dominant interpretation of quantum mechanics in physics circles is a nondeterministic one.  Oops!  forgot to login.  I'm misterbailey if anyone was wondering.

You are right to question the most astronomers bitI'll put in a qualifier about macroscopic forces.  I've been working on deterministic system (philosophy), where I put a bit more about quantum physics and determinism, but it is a complex subject.    

I agree that it would be nice if there were a separate article on first causes.  And I agree that this article is sort of sloppy.    Perhaps subheadings could be a first step to clearing it up?

 Tie-break rules in basketball  

Can you give me the exact rules of this situation because I found this:

1) If 2 teams have the same record, the team that won the head to head game wins
the tie breaker.
2) If there are more than 2 teams with the same record, then the tie breaker will be
decided by the point difference in all games played. Please look at the chart below
for an example. All 3 teams ended with 2 wins and 2 loses.
# Team A Team B Team C1 Win + 2  Lose 15   Win +252Lose ‚Äì10 Lose ‚Äì9 Lose ‚Äì33Win +5  Win +7  Lose ‚Äì24 Lose ‚Äì2  Win +10  Win + 11Diff. ‚Äì5  ‚Äì9  +31

I really don't know (or care to know!) how these bots work but maybe if there is just one mention of a political party it should maybe flag it as a possible for human checking rather than adding the cat straight off.

If he was a politician then he is in the scope of UK politics. If he wasn't a politician, then the category probably needs to be removed from the article.

"Government section cleanup 

The government section has a few problems. First, most obvious, is that it doesn't mention the government. (The cabinet or executive as its variously known.) That's probably pretty important to know what the superagencies are. Second is that it doesn't mention local government. Local government is pretty big in California, and there is no mention of special districts anywhere in the article. Third, capital punishment is given more detail than any branch of the government. That's POV pushing. Capital punishment is just one aspect of the law. If we are going to keep it, we should seriously consider adding in other criminal law aspects. But I think that's best left for the politics section or other articles. Fourth, the elections information is just plain wrong. Since Proposition 14, California only uses partisan primaries for political party officials in presidential primaries (and county central committees), which are not government officials.",0

Unfortunately he's wrong. Generally all votes are counted (twice) by midnight. Then the preliminary final results are announced and the candidates who won are contacted so they can state whether they accept their seats or not. They have a week to reply and then the final results are announced; it's got nothing to do with counting votes for a week (btw. the final result of the election as a whole can take even more time because somtimes some precincts vote later than the other.

At the same tiem you decree any attmeot to examine Dorothy as """" Smearing her."""" I didnt msmear her to dicredit her. But you smear me to discredit me.

Nothign in my own past reveals any bias, and Im toelrnt of all views, but nto all condict.

Re: """"I didnt msmear her to dicredit her."""" 

If not to discredit her, then why?  

Now.

As I said. Letsbe civil and discuss thematter in a live chat. I think you will fidn that mroe ocndusive.

Given your current artilc eis a whitewashofher, I do think a better option for you, before yourbanned as a troll, is to tlak to me.

Ill be waiitng. Unless you alloew me to add you.

Sorry, not interested. I don't see what the point would be.  

No rellay working.

The difficulty onthe talk page is yor blatant willignness to decieve others abotu me usign the same tactic you claim I use againt Acharya. You claim that I am a covert Zelous Christain wantign to defame her, and you merley wish to defend the truth. We both know this isnt true James. You want peopel to beelive her ideas and are willignto do anyhtign to make her seem as imprsive as possibl an rmeove all oposiiton to her vies.

My Chrisytaintiy is sued asa blundgeoon. You make it osund as if I oppose Acharya base don my faiht, hate her, and vehemntly opose her, and htus want ot attakc her. You then claim the aritlce is written in sch a way that it attakcs her. No spacific exampels of attakc are shown gowever.

I can assure you, nothign ithe article that is the current ocncensus among the general posters ( As oppsoed ot the Acharyans) is derogatory towards her.

But yo wish to rmeove the links ot CHrisyain rebuttals and all critisms.

If Dorothy wants to attack Chrisgaunity, why has she then no supply of courage to stand up to their rebuttals?

Midn you, Im not th eon makign suh a rebuttal. THis is WIkipedia, and I am ever midnful fo the need tobe Unbiased. Thoughyou will nto accept hat form me.

This is why I think talkigto me on Yahoo woudl be mor eocnductive. Uou would not only getot know me,but also ge tot have liv interaction.

this wya, we can easily discuss, in real time, any and very issue.

The awful truth about Wikipedia

This page is rather a good example of how a good page can be turned into a bad one by a series of foolish edits. There never was a justification for merging Japanese and Chinese together on one page, and I should have realised from the beginning that this piggybacking of the Chinese contents onto the Japanese language page was a stupid mistake. Successive edits have rendered the page less and less readable, and the recent idiotic decision to merge the information on Chinese and Japanese punctuation, as well as the rewriting of a section which was originally entirely about Japanese into something which seems to be entirely about Chinese yet again indicates the carelessness and foolishness of very many so-called Wikipedians. I recently looked at the page about """"only write about what you know"""" to find that it has been removed - Wikipedia, it seems, must be saddled with the efforts of illiterates and people who do not know what they are talking about. If I was actively involved in editing this encyclopedia, on the strength of the recent idiotic series of edits, I would revert out the Chinese language information and rename the page back to """"yokogaki and tategaki"""". It used to be a good, well written, informative page. Now it is a mish-mash of badly written, confusing crud. Unfortunately what happened to this article is not an isolated example but an all-too-typical example of what """"Wikipedians"""" seem to achieve - degeneration of article quality.

Further, the lead contains the phrase """"...though no evidence exists to suggest any of these reports are true""""  This seems to be undue to me. The source could not find any evidence. Ok. But this does not mean that no evidence exists. There may be evidence which this source could not find/does not know about. Moreover, Sian does not seem to have made much of an effort to find evidence and proving/disproving evidence was not the objective of that source. Sian seems to be trying to find a psychological/anthropological type of explanation for the """"forced conversion"""" narrative and has explained it in those terms. So, using this source to say no evidence exists seems inappropriate. Moreover, the """"Scope"""" section contains the proclamation """"...(though in the UK it has been proven false)""""  This is misleading because the source is about forced conversion among Sikhs in UK and is not about forced conversion in UK as a whole.

CONTROVERSIAL?  What was is controversial regarding my listing?  There are facts Randy Campo was born in 1952 and was killed in 1992.

 Request assistance deleting old talk page 

Greetings. two of the Wikipedia Sysops (or whatevery you call them here), refuse to let me delete the content of my talk page, for reasons that go beyond my understanding. Some of the material in the talk page is personal. The page includes rough drafts with mistakes that I never intended to make permanent. Had I known I would not be allowed to delete this material, I would never have posted it in the first place.

You recently archived part of the page, which is fine, of course. I told you at that time that I planned to clear the whole page, as I do from time to time.

 delusion zone 

why is the article allowed to survive in this state? it apparently gets a POV pass by badly impersonating sardonic writing. most of the article is overt advocacy of a point of view (case making), beginning with an unsourced, ethereal claim that """"[t]here is no evidence [for cow tipping as described,] aside from (mostly unreliable) eyewitness reports"""". what is a """"(mostly unreliable) eyewitness"""" report? what about the part that is reliable? weasel words.

i don't think cows can be tipped either, but this is hardly an article that meets wikipedia policy/guidelines/standards for clarity, neutrality, or good writing. the second paragraph, for example, is badly written, pretend-intellectual humoro-babble for the sole purpose of setting up the inclusion of the cutesy, unnecessary phrase """"precarious ruminants"""". the refrigerator example is strained, nowhere mentioning center of gravity. rather, it encourages a lower center of gravity than an honest attempt to simulate a cow would have, while making sure to reduce the lever. that's just the start. i would hack/slash my way through the thing, but i can tell from the history that it's the pet of some watching worshipers.

i hope nobody involved in creating/preserving this article ever marks anything at wikipedia as POV, original research, or unencyclopedic. wikipedia is not the farm team for the wannabe dave barry squad. and yes, that includes the useless pic caption. the prime criterion of a wikipedia article element is not how funny you think it is.

His accusations (beside being ad hominem) were also completely incorrect. Duffer appears not to give a damn about accuracy, or relevance, or the fact that ad hominem and propaganda are not acceptable on Wikepedia. JWs usually refer to this trashing and slander as """"theocratic war strategy"""", basically meaning anything goes (including lies and slander) if the end result is to promote the religion. I have removed the ad hominem and I hope it will not return.  is also problematic in the same regard, as he appears to not realise when he is using propaganda, (or insults above) but is clear to see it when someone else may use it against him or JWs, demonstrating his interesting double standards (a sad, but typical Watch Tower Society characteristic).

Checking the history of Irving Kupcinet's career will establish who was familiar with him.  I believe you are arguing just to be arguing.  

Washington, DC might not have been a mecca for Hollywood movies in 1963, but it was a respectable newspaper market where Irving Kupcinet would have loved to gain more readers.  But he didn't.  His column never reached that city.  All the way until he retired in 2001, very few people in the DC area gave a damn who he was or who his Hollywood friends were.  I was there.  And I can prove Kup's column never was.  If you don't want to be """"little known"""" outside of Chicago, then you better make friends in DC.  It's the Shakespeare capital of the Western Hemisphere because of all the pressure to succeed academically and in public service, but it still has migrants from Illinois  the land of Kupcinet and his name dropping.  Do you know how many people have to work for a congressman or a senator ?  Yet these Illinois people in DC could not read Kup's column when they got homesick.  They couldn't introduce other DC people to Kup's column.  

He was little known outside Chicago, indeed.  So he had something on a network for six months on which Carolyn Jones appeared ?  That's nothing.  In the 1950s the networks were begging for commentators to go on live television, and they came and went without any impact.  Carolyn Jones needed all the exposure she could get.  Her career wasn't on the level of Audrey Hepburn's.

My addition to the article allows that Kupcinet was well - known in Chicago and Los Angeles.  Elsewhere he was a ship passing in the night. News flash: there was no Internet when Karyn Kupcinet died.

Let's see someone other than Wildhartlivie say Irving Kupcinet was well-known outside Chicago and Los Angeles.  Wildhartlivie did a great job on the man's resume, but let's be realistic about who would have given a damn about his daughter's death a month after it happened.   """,0

 Name 

Hi all,

I am handling an OTRS ticket from a senior employee with Tiger's company ETW Corp., regarding the name of Tiger in this article. It is contended unequivocally that """"Tont is not Tiger's middle name"""" and that """"his official middle name has always been Tiger"""". 

I have analyzed the references presented here, and two of the three used make no mention of Tont. That leaves only the book; quite frankly, one reference in passing by a book does not outweigh both what Tiger has said himself on television, and what is being contended in this OTRS ticket (#2009061110035594) by someone who is authorised to represent him.

I propose that both the """"Tont"""" from the lead, and the short sentence relating to how he got it, both of which are sourced to the in-passing remark in that book, be removed. I ask for your comments in forming a consensus before doing so, however.\

Regards,

Some examples I looked at included:
 Soft Drink where the main picture shows a variety of brands on a supermarket shelf (with a photo of the Diet Pepsi product line much lower down)
 Potato chip where two of the three pictures are of chips without packaging, and the third is a non-current ad
 Fast food where all of the food is shown unwrapped (and only the Big Mac is clearly identifiable), plus a nondescript interior photo and a photo of several adjacent restaurants
 Chocolate bar with an unwrapped chocolate bar shown.

If proponents (such as SudoGhost) for keeping the article title as """"Linux"""" based solely on what it is commonly known as, then maybe they should be arguing for a change to """"Ubuntu"""" instead, because a lot of sources simply refer to the Ubuntu OS as simply """"Ubuntu"""" without any reference to Linux at all. GNU plays a vital part alongside the kernel in most distributions, and that the Debian project acknowledges """"GNU/Linux"""" has more credibility than whatever supposed common name these proponents claim is in use. Even if a reliable source can be found that claims common usage of """"Linux"""" over """"GNU/Linux"""", the sources claiming otherwise are far more credible (the Debian project).

And this can be easily done. There are ample internet sites that define traditionalist esoteric Christianity and this needs to be compared against the esoteric Christianity that was inspired by Margaret Starbird. Traditional esoteric Christianity that dates historically back thousands of years to Origen of Alexandria dealt with metaphysical matters. The common interpretation of Gnosticism widely held by maistream scholarship is that it was a dualist nature holding that matter was evil and rejecting the physical substance of Christ. This can be easily substantuated by reliable and independent sources from works published by mainstream scholars. It was the book Holy Blood and Holy Grail that was first responsible for twisting the idea that Gnosticism """"believed that Jesus Christ was a human being"""", and this became uncritically repeated ever since by those who uncritically follow the modern concept of the Jesus Bloodline.

Main points AGAINST this article (RfC)
Information that shows irregularities, tendentious editing, vandalism and POV on this article should written here:
I will start from what looks to be the main problem. 
Albanian nationalism refers to nationalism among Albanians. It should not necessarily show only claims made by certain circles as is done in this article. So the first sentence of the article: Albanian nationalism (also known as Albanianism[1][2][3][4][5] or Pan-Albanianism[6][7]) refers to nationalist Albanian ideologies and theories that were cemented during Communist Albania (1945-1991), its continuation into modern Albania, as well as its proliferation in Kosovo is a POV. Albanian nationalism does not refer only to ideologies and theories that were cemented during Communist Albania... it refers also to Albanian national uprising and Renaissance and Albanian national pride. 
Kosovo is a disputed matter and to say: """"The struggle for the liberation of Kosovo from Serb rule became the struggle for the recovery of the ancient land of'the Dardanians and thus a re-creation of their ancient kingdom"""" is a POV. Here are references that beg to differ One, Two, Three and Four. For more read Kosovo.

"Reaper Eternal, if you have the time take a look at just these two comments by Nishidani as well as his talk page were, who by the way was called upon by Hijiri 88 to help attack CurtisNaito several times, are these condesending and insulting comments acceptable? How is what I said any worse?

Whatever, no one need take my word for anything. I know the topics fairly thoroughly, through primary and secondary sources in Japanese and Western languages. I try however to avoid the topic area because of the need to WP:AGF, and all I can see is puerile bickering and dumb-ignorant edits based on an inability to see good sources and evaluate reliable evidence. I see only POV passions, googling for evidence to support them, and above, all, the tolerance on the page of sheer bad edits or nonsense that anyone with the slightest BA competence in Japanese studies would find laughable (I'm thinking of CurtisNaito in this regard). There are massive corrections to be made, but, as Ubikwit says, one simply doesn't have the time (at least for now), except to note that the litigants who do edit those pages, can't see the obvious (citing outdated sources like Fenellosa et al. from a century back,etc. I gave details a year ago why none of them are reliable, and suggested how to fix the sourcing: almost nothing done, and my edits are invariably to replace bad edits by giving several good sources, which, however anyone could do, if they had the foggiest idea of what Japanese scholarship knows). If there is competent area specialists available to review these messes, by all means get a third opinion from her, them. Nishidani (talk) 

Well, I also know this topic very thoroughly.' Sigh. I've had to correct virtually every edit I've seen you make, or revert every revert.

 legends pertaining to Mucalinda 

I have heard and read from several sources a story which elaborates on the Mucalinda legend.  According to this story, the Buddha was pleased with his protector and blessed him by placing a hand on his hood.  As a sign of the Buddha's blessing, cobras bear his fingerprints on their hoods.  Indian or Spectacled cobras (Naja naja) of course have two ocelli or eyespot markings on the back of their hood.  (These are thought to serve as """"eyes in the back of the head,"""" with the adaptive function of deterring predators that might try to attack the standing cobra from behind).  This story may be told in Thailand also, although there is a slight inconsistency in that Thai cobras (Naja kaouthia) have only one spot. )

I have also heard a variant in which the Buddha was protected by the serpent not from rain storms but from the blazing Indian sun.

Unfortunately, I cannot find a decent source for either of these elements in the Mucalinda story and do not know where they originated. 174.111.242.35  """,0

 Temporary massive removal of some legendary history 

There were quite a few paragraphs discussing the ancient origins of the Yadavs, but as I was picking my way through it, it appeared a well-nigh impenetrable mass of confusing data, and likely a lot of WP:Synthesis. Terms such as Yadava/Yadav, Ahir/Yadav, and Abhira/Ahir were frequently conflated, and it appeared at many (most?) times that info was included without regard for whether the cited author gave any indication that his topic involved the modern Yadav caste. The info is not """"lost"""", it is cleanly preserved in the History tab, and its removal noted in Edit Summary and here so that any inclined editor can go back through it and carefully select the appropriate portions to re-incorporate. I submit that any info not specifically related to the modern Yadav go into the appropriate other articles such as Yadava and Abhira, etc. and that only material clearly linking the modern Yadavs to those ancient roots be included here. Otherwise, lengthy explanations of past groups with no clear link to the present group constitutes Synthesis, as it implies/pre-supposes a factual linkage when one may not be specified.

Again, I'm not trying to permanently wipe out this info, I just think the section was very unwieldy and contentious, and rather than pick and chip at it, it's better to temporarily wipe the slate clean, and then mine the past drafts to incorporate any usable data.   """,0

 Not sure why we beat around the bush in not just saying she was crushed by a bulldozer 

All three of the first three sources cited about the cause of her death (the film Occupation 101, The Guardian, and Time) state that she was killed by a bulldozer, whether you want to call it an accident or not. Trying to reference which aspect of being bulldozed, such as """"debris"""" falling from the bulldozer, as the IDF reworded it, is a way of psychologically distancing the person operating the bulldozer for the IDF from having any direct responsibility for the action. None of the three sources state it was caused by """"debris."""" So the source citations should be moved closer to the statement that the witnesses said she was caught """"underneath."""" Currently the three citations have been placed next to a phrase that none of them reference. Therefore the sentence should be broken into two parts. The part about the IDF referencing """"debris"""" should have whatever citation mentions it next to that sentence, but none of the three sources cited references debris at all. 

Here is what they do say:

1. http://occupiedpalestine.wordpress.com/2010/12/26/occupation-101-full-movie-in-11-parts/  Part 6 of 7 after about 7:41, the film Occupation 101 (2006) states """"she got caught underneath the bulldozer""""; """"When Rachel Corrie was killed, she was protecting a doctor's home""""; """"The U.S. Congress has refused her parents' request for an independent investigation in her murder.""""  This source said nothing about debris accidentally falling on her. 

2. """"Corrie, 23, was crushed to death by an army bulldozer in Rafah, Gaza, as she protested against house demolitions."""" -The Guardian. This newspaper simply states she was """"crushed to death by the bulldozer.""""

3. """"Rachel Corrie was a 23-year-old American from Olympia, Wash., who was crushed to death by an Israeli Army bulldozer March 16, 2003. Corrie was in the Gaza Strip, working with the International Solidarity Movement, which opposes Israel‚Äôs occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and living among Palestinians whose homes were being demolished. She was kneeling in front of a home, acting as a human shield, when she was bulldozed."""" - Time.     
Again, here we are told she was """"crushed to death"""" and """"bulldozed."""" Nothing about debris accidentally falling.

I or someone else should put the citations next to a phrase about the bulldozer killing her. How exactly it killed her (whether dropping stuff on her or rolling over her) is speculative. None of the three sources reference debris. If the IDF """"debris"""" statement must be included it should be a separate sentence. The IDF operated the machine and have a potential self protection conflict of interest in their wording.

I'd feel better if it said something like: 

""""She was crushed by a bulldozer's operations clearing land in front of a Palestinian doctor's home.[1,2,3] An IDF investigation reported she died after being struck by falling debris.[source??]""""

(More accurate for the IDF part of it would be """"by debris falling from the bulldozer."""" I'd probably rather it say the IDF """"claimed"""" rather than """"reported"""" but I'm not going to change that part.)

you're wrong; IAR applies to admins and regular editors alike. 
 
You have provided no evidence of that.    As I said,   I have the facts and you guys just have bullshit.
 
What is a """"regular"""" editor?    I am not a """"regular"""" editor  I am an occasional editor.
 
The """"Ignore All Rules"""" rule does not mean there can be one set of rule exceptions for you and another set of rule exceptions for me.     We can agree on an exception to the rules,  but the exception must apply equally to both of us.   For example,   we could agree that it is OK here to break the Wikipedia rule against using personal blogs as sources.    But that would mean that links to my blog must be allowed here and could not be excluded by arbitrary,  discriminatory distinctions between """"crappy"""" personal blogs and """"reputable"""" personal blogs.

In some parts of Canada the situation is legislatively divided into warring U.S. and British camps . For instance, in British Columbia and Alberta, Doctors of Podiatric Medicine (D.P.M.) still exist. In Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Yukon,and N.W.T standards are slightly higher and are based on quackery-based charlatan British Chiropodists who insist on calling themselves """"Podiatrists"""". In Manitoba, for example, about 15 or so quack Chiropodists insist on titling themselves """"Dr."""" despite having bogus (3-4 year) qualifications. This disgusting Manitoba movement is designed to blur the distinction between British Chiropodists and USA DPM's. In the province of Ontario, MAJOR differences in scope of practice exist. Consequently, there is still a title distinction between UK chiropodists and USA DPM podiatrists ( ie. American Doctors of Podiatric Medicine). Unfortunately, both share a governing body, the College of Chiropodists of Ontario. To accelerate Ontarians into confusing U.S. trained podiatrists with bogus UK """"podiatrists"""", the British Chiropodists who are in greater number, heavily lobby the provincial Government regularly into perpetuating & maintaining the banned prefix """"Dr."""" and the associated title """"podiatrist"""". Unbelievably, and quite maliciously, British Chiropodists have lobbied provincial legislators into forcing all USA DPM's who migrate after 1993 into accepting and only using the title chiropodist. This is plainly maliciously designed so that the Ontarian public cannot distinguish the vast difference in educational qualifications. The APMA & ACFAS is now studying this injustice and blatant discrimination

The section that you added to Alimony is a classic example of synthesis.  You cannot collect together sources to make a point as you have done there.

If you want to write about the alimony reform movement you need to find reliably sourced articles about the movement itself.

 Rank Uiller article 

Hi Excirial.
First, I want to say thank you, for your time. And Happy New Year! I've made some changes on my article and I want to know if they meet the guidelines regarding Reliable Sources.
Kind regards, Zoe.
  

 Hello there Zoepe,

 I might be wrong, but at first glance it would appear that the references used are the names of several expositions that art was showcased on? I fear that this doesn't fall under reliable sourcing as these references cannot be looked up by anyone (While being also of temporal nature). Since the article is a so-called BLP page, a Biography of a Living Person the requirement for sources is several notches higher than it would be for other article's to be accepted.

 What you are looking for are sources such as newspapers that can confirm what is written in the article itself. There might also be coverage in other literature such as magazines that can qualify as reliable.  (Contact me,Contribs) """,0

"Your message

Hi, Mike: I noticed your message to my talk page. I nominated this for deletion not because I doubted the accuracy or verifiability of the information contained but because I doubted the subject's notability. Wikipedia has strict guidelines with respect to whether a living person is notable enough to pass our notability requirements, and one of those guidelines requires in-depth coverage of the person in multiple reliable sources that are completely independent of the subject. So for instance, in your case if you could find in-depth reviews of you or your work in newspapers, magazines, reliable websites (not blogs, unless they're affiliated with a newspaper or magazine) or some other media that isn't related to or created by you and has editorial supervision, that would satisfy the requirements. Unfortunately, nothing that you have created yourself - your Twitter feed, your Facebook or Myspace pages, your website - is considered either a reliable or an independent source for Wikipedia's purposes.

Please note that this is a discussion for deletion, not a speedy deletion. I chose this option because this type of discussion takes seven days to grind its way toward completion, so that gives you seven days to find the independent, reliable third-party sources that Wikipedia requires.

Wikipedia also strongly discourages autobiographies: I invite you to read our guidelines on autobiography to find out why.

If you have any questions about whether a source is reliable or not, please feel free to write back on my talk page. Thanks!",0

Given that Firefly is proving to be a failure at the box office by the well accepted formula of Movie Cost > Box Office Take, I am suggesting we start formulating a way to add that to the article.  I mention my love of the movie only to avoid the fans who might try to POV push because they don't want to face the awful truth.  I would suggest you take more time to help with the discussion on what should be said here, rather than pull out an unneeded and rather silly soap box.  We are talking about sourceable information Jeff, you just are not listening.  Additional to say we can't mention our like or dislike of the film seems to suggest you think personal opinion can't be expressed on Wikipedia Talk pages.  Well it can be expressed and it should be expressed.  We all have natural bias, by talking about our opinions we help others to identify our bias making it easier to critique our additions.  Furthermore, Wikipedia is a community, and we're having fun.  I'm sorry you can't seem to handle that.
Now, what I'm trying to say is that we need to stop POV pushing on the article.  Yes, we're fans and we don't like to admit Serenity flopped, but the truth is it has.  My suggestion is we data mine other movies which have performed as poorly and use a similar language.   (PowWow)",0

Bold textCameron Ward is a little known radio DJ who is only of 16 years of age.  He first started his career on Millside hospital radio as a member of the 'Jan and Jules' show team and broadcasted every thursday night from 6pm-9pm.  He then struck out a solo career and moved to ashfield community radio where he had three different shows over 2 years.  These were 'Saturday sport' which broadcast saturdays 5pm-7pm, 'LIVE MID MORNING SATURDAY/SUNHDAY' (depened which day it was) between 9am and 12 midday.  Finaly he teamed up with nina squires to do the 'Super Sports Saturday Show' between 2pm and 6pm.  He then left ashfield comunity radio in late 2005 to move to 'Regency FM' which broadcast on the internet.  There he ran a show on saturday mornings 10am-1pm 'The Saturday Revolution Show',  Which grew a cult following across north east derbyshire and bangor in Wales.  Then sadly Regency Radio closed down due to lack of funds.  It is speculated Cameron will move back to ashfield community radio or to Trust Fm which has now aquired a FM licence to broadcast across chesterfield and north east derbyshire.

No we cannot unless the speculated events are highly likely to take place. See my earlier reference to WP.CRYSTAL which says """"Wikipedia is not a collection of unverifiable speculation.

The truth is that all we know is that the board has to look for ways to cut the growth in costs. There is an endless universe of things that IPAB may come up as ways to do this. The fact is that WP simply should wait until IPAB reports and it is wrong to speculate what they may be. Sure, people can speculate but it creates bias if we include some speculations and not others.

Fair use rationale for Image:TranquilityPark.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:TranquilityPark.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

Wikipedia is hosted in the US, so US laws on copyright, etc. are enforcable. That's just the way it is, and we need to avoid legal action being taken against the foundation. To be honest, I don't see big differences in behaviour of editors by nationality, so far as nationality is apparent - I suspect that there are just more Americans here than any other nationality, simply due to sizes of populations of English-speakers, so any group of editors is likely to have more Americans than anything else, including the helpful, constructive, thoughtful ones. I think, however, that there are a higher proportion of editors here now than ever before who have little interest in adding and improving content, preferring to delete, argue, try to raise the bar on notability and fair use guidelines to allow more to be deleted, etc., but I don't see this as a wholly US phenomenon.  08:15",0

Hello.  To Jeffro77 above...  The original and first reference that I put in was Thomas Cahill, and his book The Gifts of the Jews - How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels.   And I originally put that ref alone.  The Wilson ref came later on, from a search, and at the request of Jeppiz.   But Cahill alone I felt was overall sufficient at that point.  (And that Cahill book had literally zero to do with anything with Jehovah‚Äôs witnesses, or any JW books or journals or sermons.)    That wasn‚Äôt even on my mind in that sense, nor did I look at ANY Watchtower publications regarding this article or this specific matter.  Cahill had nothing to do with that.       And even Jeppiz admitted a number of times that it was a reliable source and ok.       But the Wilson source I provided here later on (and then soon on the article itself) was only at the demand of Jeppiz, for another source.   He kept insisting to find something else, etc, so I did a search, and the Wilson thing was even more pointed in a way, and it‚Äôs in a pro-JW website, ‚Äústrictly genteel‚Äù, which transcribed the noted WT book ‚ÄúIs the Bible Really the Word of God?‚Äù, and the link can be found here http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/wordofgod/wordofgod4.html.       (Also, to DougWeller, hello.   I‚Äôm still not sure why you say that I got the name of the book wrong.   That‚Äôs what‚Äôs stated as the source.    J.A. Wilson.   And ‚ÄúThe World History of the Jewish People‚Äù.   At least that‚Äôs he main part of the name of the book, and I believe Wilson was a co-author of that or something.)    But, to Jeffro, you seem to think (incorrectly) that I probably had the Wilson ref as paramount, when in actuality that was just a side thing and accident, because of subsequent demands and circumstances on this Talk page.   Cahill was actually my guy on this specific matter on the Exodus matter, NOT Wilson necessarily nearly as much.      The exact (in-context) quote from Cahill‚Äôs book says this:   

‚ÄúWhen we examine the considerable extant literatures of Mesopotamia and Egypt, we find no obvious mention of the Israelites.  If, as the majority of scholars have provisionally concluded, Israel escaped from Egypt in the reign of Rameses II about midway through the thirteenth century B.C., why is there no record of this marvellous defeat in any Egyptian text or inscription?   Of course, the defeat may have been so embarrassing to Egypt that, like many great powers, it could not allow itself to record honestly what happened.    Alternatively, the story of the drowning of Pharaoh‚Äôs army may have been inflated over time by Hebrew oral tradition, and what had been a minor skirmish in Egyptian eyes (we know, for instance, that Ramses II died not in a watery grave but in his bed) was eventually puffed up beyond all recognition.  Most radically:  the Exodus may never have taken place, but may be just a story concocted, like Gilgamesh, by nomadic herdsmen in need of an evening‚Äôs entertainment.    This last hypothesis, though temptingly unambiguous, can be maintained only by ignoring  undeniable aspects of the actual text of the Bible.    There are real differences‚Äîliterary differences, differences of tone and taste, but, far more important, differences of substance and approach to material‚Äîbetween Gilgamesh and Exodus, and even between Gilgamesh and Genesis.""""

Cahill continues:   

""""The anonymous authors of Gilgamesh tell their story in the manner of a myth.  There is no attempt to convince us that anything in the story ever took place in historical time.   At every point, rather, we are reminded that the action is taking place ‚Äúonce upon a time‚Äù‚Äîin other words, in that pristine Golden Time outside of meaningless earthly time.   The story of Gilgamesh, like the gods themselves, belong to the realm of the stars.   It is meant as a model for the hearers, who believed, in any case, that everything important, everything archeteypal, happened, had happened, was happening‚Äîit is impossible to fix this occurrence clearly in one tense, since it occurs outside of time‚Äîbeyond the earthly realm of unimportant instances.   For all the ancients (except the Israelites, the people who would become the Jews), time as we think of it was unreal; the Real was what was heavenly and archetypal.  For us, the heirs of the Jewish perception, the exact opposite is true:  earthly time is real time; Eternity, if we think of it at all, is the end of time (or simply an illusion).     The text of the Bible is full of clues that the authors are attempting to write history of some sort....But there is in these tales a kind of specificity‚Äîa concreteness of detail, a concern to get things right‚Äîthat convinces us that the writer has no doubt that each of the main events he chronicles happened.‚Äù

"WP:WEB

I don't know what you mean by jumping to conclusions, but noted nonetheless. To address your example directly, Dominic Deegan was actually printed, published, and released, which gives it a  bit of a foothold in the webcomic world. It has tens of thousands of Google hits, the first several hundred of which are unique and relevant, and several hundred unique sites also link to it. It also gets a couple million views per month according to Alexa.com. The three methods on their own are not always the best for rating the notability of a subject, but when combined, they give a clearer picture

Some articles are marked for deletion soon after creation, and others aren't marked until several months (or years) after their first edit. However, in the end, they will eventually receive the same scrutiny all other articles must undergo- an unencyclopedic article will not be allowed to exist on the premise that other unencyclopedic articles already exist; they will, in all likelihood, be deleted eventually as well.

As for WP:WEB itself: It's a guideline used to help determine the notability of the site. While the majority of sites that do not meet the criteria are deleted, all of those that do meet the criteria are kept. This criteria is an extension of the following policies:

 Wikipedia:Verifiability
 Wikipedia:Neutral point of view
 Wikipedia:No original research

The following guidelines:

 Wikipedia:Cite sources
 Wikipedia:Reliable sources

And the following tests:

 Wikipedia:Search engine test

Basically, if the site has independent material published about it, receives an award, or is distributed through a notable publisher, information about it can be verified and, most importantly, neutral. This avoids original research. This also allows us to cite reliable sources; Wikipedia is not a primary source or publisher of original research/information.

Well, thank you. We certainly agree on fundamental difficulty in communicating. I am able to hear what you have to say. I don't perceive you as a Great Evil in your idiom, or ill-intended (except perhaps on one point I'll go into later), and I can generally extend good faith when one is open to public discussion.

If so, the first consensus I need is whether an article should exist on the topic of dramatically-concentrated short-period political fundraising. Your objections at AFD appear to me primarily as """"magnet for edit-warring"""" and """"WP:COATRACK"""" (you raise other concerns related to neologism, but they do not enter into the question as I've phrased it). These concerns both seem bad arguments per WP:RUBBISH because they are surmountable problems, and Wikipedians may not delete based on creator intent but on criteria like notability: we are expected to resolve edit wars and coatracks by DR, not deletion. 2. Given this, for what reasons if any would you oppose existence of an article on the topic of dramatically-concentrated short-period political fundraising? (If none, I would ask you to change your AFD entry at this point in good faith.)
The second consensus I need is how to disambiguate the search string """"moneybomb"""". Previously you advocated google bomb as the primary redirect. Independent of the previous paragraph, I would ask: 3. What is your specific justification that users entering the string """"moneybomb"""" would be interested primarily in a detailed description of search manipulation, with a mention of the fundraising form without further fundraising elaboration? (If none, please propose alternate disambiguation specifics.) This proposition, which your position amounts to, would imply there is greater connection of the string """"moneybomb"""" with search manipulation than with fundraising, which is an exceptional claim to me, requiring detailed explanation. I'm sure you recognize that both reliable sources on this point use the string """"money bombing"""" and significantly not """"moneybomb"""".

Well that is not correct. If you are unwilling to learn the difference between in-universe and out-universe then I think editing articles dealing with fictional characters is not fair on editors who actually bothered to. The problem is the date of death field is part of the personal profile section of the info box. This means it is an in-universe element of the article; referring exclusively to events within the series. If the episode was set on a different date, to that it aired on - then a death featured within that episode would carry the date within the series. Fictional characters do not die from our viewpoint - they will always exist, they do not cease to exist, so we do not use our date. So maybe you need to have a rethink.

""":Many contest that John was a forgery written directly to attack gnosticism (thus having a similar style). But the most supported stance of the 3 (gnostic/anti-gnostic/stance 3) is that the original more gnostic version was doctored (actually quite a lot of people support this idea - Cerinthus was held by some to have been the author, despite the fact that Irenaeus, who makes the first known quotes from John, uses his """"copy"""" of the gospel to attack Cerinthus.

Mark can be seen as gnostic - see the pythagoreanism part for example, re. 153. But in particular, the mysterious naked youth, and thomas didymous which can both easily be seen as gnostic teachings,(n.b. thomas didymous translates into english as twin twin), though I am not going to elaborate on that here, as I will add it to the article at some point. Also, the very existance of Secret Gospel of Mark is gnostic, as well as the reasoning that Clement gives for it's creation, and his statement that the Carpocrations favoured it heavily.

P.s. I think it would only be fair of me to inform you that I have actually met Jimmy Dunn, in a professional capacity, for quite some time, so there is little point in trying to quote his work at me.  23:51, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)

"I intended the comment about multiplicity to be an exception to the first line about quadratic convergence. You are correct that this is less than clear.  Your suggested phrasing is fine.  Durand-Kerner is Newton's method simultaneously on a vector of root guesses, with the derivative of the polynomial approximated by the derivative of what the polynomial would be if its roots were the current set of guesses.  This permits a lot of redundant computation to be eliminated,  and the algorithm parallelized.  If f(x) is a 4th degree polynomial and p,q,r,s are root approximations, the approximated polynomial is (x-p)(x-q)(x-r)(x-s) and its derivative at p is (p-q)(p-r)(p-s) so a Durand-Kerner iteration for p would be p = p - f(x)/((p-q)(p-r)(p-s)) and iterations of identical form for q, r, and s follow immediately.

I'm all for proper reviewing, instead of incorrect/arbitrary, which is why I've opened this thread recently (aftter this very debacle, precisely) because the scale of this problem (various types of bad reviewing) is pretty alarming, and some reviewers' blatant refusal to play by rules after they're being informed about them is just absolutely unacceptable (that's my opinion, at least, but I can't see how could I be any wrong with being right).

""":Batvette, first things first. I'm not the least bit sure that the USAF's """"Air Force Historical Studies Office"""", which is """"headquartered at the Pentagon"""", meets the criteria for WP:NPOV. Indeed, I suggest that it is very appropriate to use caution regarding any weight attributed to the USAF's analysis of actions performed by the USAF (see WP:Conflict of Interest). Especially as it regards to such controversial operations, (the USAF investigating the actions of the USAF are akin to the police investigating the conduct of police officers - heavy bias is inevitable). Further more, it may be argued that such a source violates WP:Primary Source.
Batvette, the """"air force historical society[sic] analysis of Dresden firebombing that you have provided place's some emphasis on the military value of Dresden as a target for strategic bombing. It refers to Dresden's value as a transport and communications hub, (see para II). It also refers to """"[s]pecific military installations in Dresden in February 1945 included barracks and hutted camps and at least one munitions storage depot"""", (see para II.10). Perversely, one of the arguments suggested for legitimising the bombing was the fact that Dresden """"was protected by antiaircraft defenses, antiaircraft guns and searchlights"""", (see para 11). I'm not at all sure what to make of that bizarre reference.
I have C&P; a relevant section from the Wikipaedia page on the Dresden firebombing. Please note, I have no idea what the rule is on C&Ping; the content of another Wikipaedia article to the talkpage of another Wikipaedia article. If this is a breach of any Wikipaedia policy please feel free to let me know (unless you're my stalker):

The historian Alexander McKee has cast doubt on the meaningfulness of the list of targets mentioned in 1953 USAAF report and point out that the military barracks listed as a target were a long way out of town and not in fact targeted during the raid.McKee (1983), p. 61,62 The 'hutted camps' mentioned in the report as military targets were also not military but were provided for refugees. It is also pointed out that the important Autobahn bridge to the west of the city was not targeted or attacked and that no railway stations were on the British target maps, nor were the bridges, such as the railway bridge spanning the Elbe River.McKee (1982), pp.62,63. Commenting on this Alexander McKee stated that: """"The standard whitewash gambit, both British and American, is to mention that Dresden contained targets X, Y and Z, and to let the innocent reader assume that these targets were attacked, whereas in fact the bombing plan totally omitted them and thus, except for one or two mere accidents, they escaped""""McKee (1983), p.61. McKee further asserts, """"The bomber commanders were not really interested in any purely military or economic targets, which was just as well, for they knew very little about Dresden; the RAF even lacked proper maps of the city. What they were looking for was a big built up area which they could burn, and that Dresden possessed in full measure""""McKee (1983), p.63.

According to historian Sonke Neitzel, """"it is difficult to find any evidence in German documents that the destruction of Dresden had any consequences worth mentioning on the Eastern Front. The industrial plants of Dresden played no significant role in Germany industry at this stage in the war""""Addison (2006) Chapter """"The City under Attack"""" by Sonke Neitzel p.76 Wing Commander H. R. Allen said, """"The final phase of Bomber Command's operations was far and away the worst. Traditional British chivalry and the use of minimum force in war was to become a mockery and the outrages perpetrated by the bombers will be remembered a thousand years hence""""McKee (1983), p. 315. Quotes H. R. Allen (1972) The Legacy of Lord Trenchard

In the north of Dresden there were remarkable military facilities which were not hit by the bombings. Today they are still there, used as officer education buildings for the German Bundeswehr and hosting Germany's military-historic museum (from stone-age to modern times).

Batvette, the above comments come from WP:RS that are significantly more NPOV than the USAF's Air Force Historical Studies Office.
Regardless, claiming that US culpability for its involvement in the Dresden firebombing was mitigated because it focused its bombing on the """"Marshalling Yards"""" is a bit like the arsonist claiming that she's innocent of murder because she only intended to set fire to the relatively-u",0

BAPS activities are not always without controversy, as in its open support of the Sardar Sarovar dam project in Gujarat. For its supporters, the Sardar Sarovar dam and the multi-dam Narmada Valley Development Project of which it is a key component are intended to increase power capacity and provide irrigation, cleaner drinking water, and flood control; for its opponents, the dam is environmentally and socially disastrous and is purchased at the cost of submerging a high percentage of dalit and adivasi villages. The wealthy BAPS organization is criticized by dam opponents for acting to protect its class interests, including those of its land holding members. In response, BAPS followers who are familiar with the Narmada controversy point to the various village relocation and community rehabilitation projects voluntarily instigated and funded by BAPS.

  The BLPN thread begins with this from you
After reverting an addition of a name of a living person to this article based on doubtful reasoning and subsequently the name being re-added, I am concerned about the basis of the whole article. There is an assumption that someone who is alleged to have had sex with a """"novice"""" or """"student"""" or """"disciple"""" (without unambiguous definitions of these terms) is fair game to be listed in this article as a """"sex abuse case"""". Some of the names listed have had no legal proceedings taken against them, others have been reported as having reached out of court settlements without the case being proven. There are obvious issues with the name of the article, the selection criteria for names being added and confusion about how well such cases need to be sourced. F√¶ (talk) 
 However you spin it, it was you who initiated this process and you did not extend me the courtesy of informing me. I did not revert any deletion of yours in your account name unless it was an IP deletion or from another account and for each reversion I made I noted in the edit summary that I had referred to it  on the talk page and there gave my reasons and asked for dialogue.
 If I had seen your concerns I would have noted first of all that unambiguous definition of terms is not common in discourses and in any case I began the article with a clear description of what was meant by  'abuse' in the context of the article. Even in the drafting of legislation where great care is taken to be unambiguous there is nevertheless a need to leave some terms undefined: for example 'nation' in EU leglislation, 'indecent' in UK criminal legislation (in the context of child protection) - the examples are legion. In any case it is perfectly well understood what abusive sexual behaviour amounts to and abusive behaviour need not be criminal. In particular teacher-student sexual relationships are universally regarded as abusive on the part of the teacher. The selection criteria was mentioned in the article - that the individuals involved had founded Buddhist groups at the forefront of the emerging Western Buddhist movement.

 Copyvios 

Hi Ram.  I patrol new pages and often run into new articles that contain copyright violations.  Recently, I've found 4 or 5 of them that were created by students in your program.  Obviously WP will react according to policy regarding copyvios but I was wondering if you would like me to notify you or anyone else when I find that an article created for your course contains a copyright violation.  If you or your program as a whole care to be informed, I was thinking I could either leave a message on your talk page or on the talk page of the course.  I think the ambassador project and these courses are really neat and the best way I can think to help is to lend my most used WP skills to assist.  If there's any way reviewing new pages can help you, the ambassador program, or any of your courses, please let me know. ''''''Talktome """,0

 Correct name & edit war with Quale

Then some people came from South India and supported me. I'm not sure if that """"culture"""" still persists here; but that's a big curse of openness and possessive edits.

Regarding the naming, here are the proofs (even if there's no proof, please note that it's a commonsense here in South India):

  That‚Äôs right. I‚Äôm Anand. My father is Vishwanathan. At some point people assumed that this must be my first name and Anand must be my last name. It‚Äôs common in the West. Vishwanathan was unpronounceable for them. Became Vishy.

  But my father is Vishwanathan Krishnamurthy. I am Anand Vishwanathan. Of course, my wife is Aruna Anand. So among the mysteries we have to explain to many people is, though we are married, why we don‚Äôt share the same family name. - http://www.indianexpress.com/storyOld.php?storyId=38320&spf;

Conclusions
Having read all of the above, it is obvious that both capitalizatons are acceptable, depending on the style choice and the context. While Fishhead's proposal (Liturgy of the Hours (Catholic Church)) is appreciated, IMO it adds an unnecessary level of complication for sake """"political correctness"""" (I have a fixed-wing aircraft in mind), and violates """"Titles should be as simple as possible without being too general."""" clause of WP:NC(CN). This article is, rightly or wrongly, currently focused to the Catholic service and its current form. At the risk of being frivolous, I must say that I consider most of the discussion above as """"Wikipedia hairsplitting of the month"""". Editors are kindly invited to amend the article with few sentences regarding the approaches to capitalization. 

Is it Murphy's law that I come to close RM discussions involving Espoo, or just a result of law of large numbers? I admit I wanted to walk away from this closing, but it would result in waste spending of another admin's time.

"It does indeed look very awkward without images but the rules for WP:NFC explicitely state that: The use of non-free media in lists, galleries, discographies, and navigational and user-interface elements is usually unacceptable for failing the test for significance (criterion #8). And right now, I don't see any possibility of Madlax character list being a special case exempt from it. ( Of course, other anime character lists do this all the time but the fact is: it is against the guidelines. And it may even cost the main article its featured status on which I've spent almost year of hard work...
Addressing your suggestion, it is indeed possible to just revert the removal of the images but that won't deal with the source of the problem: the unacceptability of such act under Wikipedia policies, which in turn, stems from the US fair use and copyright laws. Unfortunately, there is very little I can do about the latter, so anyone who'd remove the images again will be formally right AND it will eventually lead to an edit war which is an unconditionally bad development.
Don't think that I don't understand your concern. I too, hate character lists without character portraits and a thought of my favourite anime series having one pains me to no end. But it's just the way Wikipedia is. Being the most popular educational site on the web sadly comes with a price tag. ( ¬†‚ò≠",0

 A tag has been placed on Ms peachez requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  Blanchardb-‚Ä¢MyEars‚Ä¢MyMouth-timed """,0

Anyway, this story went as follows (of course, it being a long time since I lived in Fifestead, I won‚Äôt get it absolutely 100% word perfect, but I‚Äôll get the plot details correct, which is all that matters in the long run, and in the short run too, probably):

Once, I went to tea with a girl called Sophie (to fully appreciate this amusing, and I may add, most relevant anecdote, you must realise that there was no romantic interest between myself and Sophie: in fact, we were both only four or five at the time; these ages are, you will no doubt agree, far too young for any real romantic interest to be taking place). Anyway, for reasons General McCully couldn‚Äôt quite remember (I was at least ten at the time, and being a fairly old man, General McCully didn‚Äôt have a fantastic memory), this girl Sophie (you may remember ‚Äì she was the one towards whom I had no amorous intentions) put her spoon in my hair. Now, at this point in the story, you may well be saying to yourself, ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù But, the problem was, the spoon had a fairly large amount of yoghurt on it.

So this was, as you‚Äôll no doubt appreciate, quite a difficult situation, and in the confusion I couldn‚Äôt help noticing the slightly random (and, I‚Äôll have to admit, irrelevant) fact that the screws on which Sophie‚Äôs mother‚Äôs pictures were attatched to the wall required a flathead, rather than a Phillips, screwdriver (when I say flathead, do not use this term in its most obvious, literal definition, but as the DIY term in fairly common use).

Anyway, there was me sitting with yoghurt coursing down my face, examining the screws on my hostess‚Äô mother‚Äôs pictures, and casting dark aspersions, and eventually I just walked out and went home, all on my own.

Now, when I make all these claims about being very friendly with a General, he may not actually be a General: the British Army (the army in which he had served) had several ranks containing the slightly bizarre, random and irrelevant term ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù, including Major-General, and I don‚Äôt know if he was simply one of these, since they‚Äôre usually addressed simply as ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù, as was the citizen of Fifestead General McCully.

Come to think of it, there even used to be a Brigadier-General rank and even a weird-sounding Captain-General rank in the British army, though I believe the rank of Brigadier-General still lives on in the United States Army, existing under some obscure, weird, bizarre, random and irrelevant star rating too, such as ‚Äúthree-star general‚Äù, though this almost certainly (speaking with an unfirm knowledge of that field of mathematics known as probability) isn‚Äôt the right term for the rank of Brigadier-General.

Anyway, being a busy person, I can‚Äôt waste any more of my valuble time on this, unfortunately.",0

You may think that this is obvious, but we need a source that explicitly states that the findings of the the UT report were influenced by the funding received.""""Perhaps personal correspondence with the authors of the Texas study admitting their findings were indeed swayed by the knowledge that the business interests of major donors to their institution and research programmes would likely be substantially affected in the negative if said findings did not produce a clean bill of health for fracking? I mean, that's about the only way you could ever meet your demand. What an utterly absurd request. It's easy to see why it was made, though: just set the bar so high it can't be jumped, then use the failure as an excuse to chop out what you don't like. Maybe you'd have me hack the e-mail accounts of the authors, fish around for evidence (assuming there is even any there), then leak it to a major newspaper so they can write an article that I can cite on here. Only the most naive idiot can fail see the potential for conflict of interest from a study put out by Texas. The university's state is the heart and soul of US oil & gas, but that's certainly not worthy of so much as a mention given that which is also true: the university has multi-million-dollar and other links with the largest provider of fracking services in the United States, not to mention other oil & gas companies with interests in fracking. I have no idea whether their report was swayed by industry links, but only a fool would suggest the potential isn't there. If you don't like the juxtaposition, just open up a gap with a caveat‚Äîand make it as weak, pathetic and denigrating as you like for all I care, maybe something like, """"socialist‚Äînay, communist!‚Äîcampaigners in the pay of a European Maoist group have alleged a potential for a conflict of interest, noting that..."""" For comparison, take the recent global-warming sceptics at the Heartland Institute: as soon as details of the Institute's funding were leaked, they were prominently reported in the press. We don't even need leaks here, the information is freely available to anyone who takes the time to find it out, as Smm201`0 and others have done. All you are interested in doing is eliminating even mention of perfectly obvious potential for conflict of interest. According to Ian Urbina, we can't even get a decent, untarnished report out of the EPA; unlike Texas, the EPA doesn't even take industry funding, for god's sake, yet still it can't escape heavy industry pressure to redact. Aside from irrelevances like minor earthquakes, I have no idea whether fracking is causing all the problems it is alleged to, though I am extremely suspicious given the documented efforts of industry (and their paid-for puppets in government) to tone down or eliminate negative findings, and the truly just ridiculous claims about fracking's potential by people like Lord Browne here in England. And I couldn't care less if fracking's safe or not. Why should I? or anyone? If it's not, it's not; if it is... it is! Outside of a lunatic asylum, who would care? If it is safe (enough), bring it on: jobs, tax receipts, increased energy security, reduced use of coal burning... only a fool wouldn't be interested in those things, particularly given the current economic situation.

The original photo is the one with the """"fall-off"""" effect which was printed in The West Australian already back in august 2, 1969 (~6 min in this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMuTiziCszU) while the lighten up picture is the EDITED version who came out much later.

Perhaps the minx relies more on wit and slyness than on physical strength?  """,0

"She is not an undocumented worked, as she is not working.  It is unfair to punish me with my attempt to include a key fact (I have modified it is several different ways in an attempt to compromise, but to also make sure this critically important fact is included in the article).

I have fairly and accurately stated that she should be listed as an illegal immigrant/alien in the history as you initially asked. (others, you twice and Ramsey2006 has done three reverts.  Not only to undo my additions, but the person with address 68.whatever)

The fact that biased sources (i.e. people with links to groups involved in the story with an agenda can revert a known fact for political reason completely undermines wikipedia.)  Know, this is the first article I have attempted to edit, but this omission is considerable. 

Now, I am learning as I go, I put clear reasons in the history for my change, at your request, but you have punished me a second time, by reverting back.

Reasoning:

Somebody who crosses the border illegally is an illegal alien.

Elvira Arellano is therefore an illegal alien.

Elvira Arellano may also be an undocumented worker, but so a teenager who does not report baby sitting wages.

To list Elvira Arellano as solely and undocumented worker, with no reference to her being an illegal immigrant/alien is factually negligent.

Countless news articles refer to her as such:

 Why confusion and controversy in the """"real world"""" does not preclude the writing of a good Wikipedia on the topic 

Ackoz suggests that, because the real world has not yet hashed out """"the truth"""" about the expulsions, it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.

I reject such a stance.  I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial.  Where many Wikipedia editors """"get it wrong"""" is that they believe Wikipedia's job is to report the truth.  This is wrong.  Wikipedia's job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.  Any attempt to do that is original research.

Instead of """"truth"""", Wikipedia aims for """"verifiability"""".  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources).  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that.  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents """"THE TRUTH"""" and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.

I have been trying to hit this NPOV """"sweet spot"""" but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides.

 
Obviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don't want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that's not discussion about the NPOV edits. That's why I quit from the discussion about the form of the article. ‚âàtalk‚âà """,0

 From User talk:Jimbo Wales I wonder if you might consider...

I wonder if you might consider simply removing your political/religious/etc.  userboxes and asking others to do the same.  This seems to me to be the best way to quickly and easily end the userbox wars.

Userboxes of a political or, more broadly, polemical, nature are bad for the project.  They are attractive to the wrong kinds of people, and they give visitors the wrong idea of what it means to be a Wikipedian.

I think rather than us having to go through a mass deletion (which is what is likely to happen if the userbox fad doesn't go away), it will be better to simply change the culture, one person at a time.  Will you help me? 

 From WikiEN-l [...]

The current situation with these things being in the main Template namespace, and promoted as if healthy and normal in the Wikipedia namespace, is that they are damaging to our culture.  They are attracting the wrong sort of people, and giving newcomers the wrong idea of what it means to be a Wikipedian.

That's why they need to go.  Not to censor people's self-expression, but to make it clear that as a whole the community considers these things to be divisive and inappropriate. Jimmy Wales (jwales at wikia.com)

Well, I left for two days anyway, and I see no reason to dredge up a closed thread.  

I will say that the whole point of the thread (as Calton indicated) was to not have to get involved in it myself, and there was also really no need for an IP which displayed disruptive behavior in the past to get involved.  IPs are nice to hide behind, and I will bet money on the fact that it's been the same person all along (which is where my remarks came from).  I'm happy to admit a mistake when I make one, but this was not a mistake.  I will stand behind everything I said, based on the following line of reasoning:  a static IP is often tied to the same computer in an office (MHEC, the IP location, is not a school, it's a governing authority for the state schools in Massachusetts, so it has an office and an .edu address, but not a campus of 50 million people using a computer in the library).  The chances of two different people on the same IP (meaning at the same computer) knowing enough of Wiki internals to: go poking around ANI, try to run for ArbCom, request a block for an admin, and then have troll unblock requests (""""hello"""" is not a spurious unblock request, really?), is just too small for my liking.  I'm sorry if I'm not going to AGF that, but I cannot suspend my disbelief that far, and I got hammered for it.  

I neither expect nor require an apology, but I do want it to be known that something important was missed in that thread, and that IP's going to be a problem until someone takes care of it.   """,0

 External links on ballet 

Hello! External links are often taken as a """"For further reading"""" section, and as such, should complement the article, adding information we could not.

"Here once again is the Wiki position on primary sources:

Primary sources that have been reliably published (for example, by a university press or mainstream newspaper) may be used in Wikipedia, but only with care, because it is easy to misuse them. Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation. Without a secondary source, a primary source may be used only to make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is verifiable by a reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge. For example, an article about a novel may cite passages from the novel to describe the plot, but any interpretation of those passages needs a secondary source.

Do you believe that the primary sources have been reliably published? If so, they may be used in Wikipedia?
Do you believe that I have interpreted the primary source or misrepresented what that source says in a summary? If so, can you supply an example?
Are you able to verify the accuracy of the contents of each of the cells?
Do you believe that there is any actual interpretation in the table? If so where?",0

I'm sorry to be blunt, but this just doesn't fly. Ruddiman's hypothesis is neither here nor there with regard to the cause of recent warming.

And snowball earth was > 500 MYa, which is way outside any relevant time frame for current global warming (the continents were in completely different places, for a start).  Finally, Ruddiman himself would likely take exception to being thrown in with the """"scientists objecting..."""" camp  the fact that his latest book is """"Plows, Plagues, and Petroleum: How Humans Took Control of Climate"""" gives a hint as to his stance on recent warming.

Umm - I'm not exactly """"promoting"""" him.  I'm a Democrat, and I voted for Gore.  But the consensus of several users - in fact, EVERY user except you - was very clearly in favor of the quote being removed from the introduction.  The quote provides no context, is blatantly POV, not to mention terribly inaccurate and silly, considering what actually happened with the election fraud (see http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1104-36.htm) and the fact that Gore actually won anyway.  So how did he make Dubyah the president?  Yes, I'm aware that's the first thing many people think of when they see him, just as the first thing many people think of when they see Mama Cass is that she died choking on a ham sandwich.  This, like the quote, is not true at all, but merely an ill-researched fallacy.  Does this mean we should write in Cass' introduction that she is best known for having choked on a ham sandwich?  No, because it simply isn't factually based or accurate at all. Even if it was accurate, it still wouldn't be appropriate for the introduction as it provides no context. Pretend you are someone who didn't know anything about him, and you saw this quote that he """"made George W. Bush the president""""-what would that mean? Is he the magical fairy who goes around granting wishes and making people president with his magical fairy wand from Lollypopland? You need to provide context and a detailed account of what actually happened before you provide such a glib, not to mention factually inaccurate, summary.

So again, I don't know what your point is about that user being banned, when the offense seems to be only the fact that they removed vandalism well over 3 times.  To me, your offenses of violation of NPOV, violating consensus when no one agrees with you, and editing other user's sigs seem a twinkle more extreme than theirs.  I invite everyone to look at the comments that Griot left on Astruc's talk page wherein he revealed his very clear bias on this issue-he accused Nader of being a """"Maoist""""-and he is clearly just using Wikipedia as his own personal coloring book to slander him in violation of NPOV policy, and in violation of an irrefutable consensus on this issue.

Below is the entire message I sent Rianna which you conveniently altered. Further, Rianna knows full well she asked for a change to the get site today because the article had not been edited for three days. She asked to change a couple of lines relating to Ms. Bruker and to remove the fact that she had an affair because it was not relevant to ths issue.  Bruno then denied her change. This was in the history of edits secions which I somewhere have saved.  Nishkid then changed the history section to show Rianna's change without the notice of line was changed. This is fraud and if an attorney did this in Federal Court, he would be disbarred and possibly charged with contempt of court. 

In response to Nishkid's question in the email to me, I think that he is not telling the truth and is equivocating about what Rianna really sent to her. From what I have read on her page, she would be quite offended at the vindictive behaviour of these men.

 Hari and other parts with sources not cited 

To attribute quotes to Steyn or Hari without citing sources is against Wikipedia policy. You should reference with links (or due diligence references including where and date it was published, volume and page number) what quotes are attributed to Hari or Steyn. Erroneous quotes attributed to a person, not backed up by references, could be interpreted as libelous, and should be avoided. http://www.ifex.org/en/content/view/full/61063/
Large quotes attributed to Hari will be deleted as this is a post about Steyn, not about any single critic. 

The following was deleted:

According to Hari, in November 2001, Steyn circulated a series of conspiracy theories that a huge number of Muslims in New York City had been forwarned of the terror attacks. A Muslim student at a Brooklyn high school, he claims, said to his teacher on 6 September 2001: """"See those two buildings? They won't be standing there next week."""" 

On 10 September 2001, Steyn further claimed, """"a sixth-grade 
[NOTE: HOW COULD STEYN HAVE CLAIMED THIS ON 10 SEPT 2001? THIS STATEMENT MUST BE TOTALLY FALSE.]
student of Middle Eastern origin at a Jersey City school warned his teacher to stay away from Lower Manhattan because """"something bad was going to happen"""". Teachers at schools within sight of the World Trade Center in New York reported that, as the towers burned, many Muslim students were taking pictures: it seemed odd that so many of them happened to have brought their cameras to school on that particular day.""""

Hari commented: 

""""Almost no evidence has been offered in support of [this] claim. Steyn cites only the """"evidence"""" of a disgraced and sacked journalist on a suburban New York paper, and even that is for just one of several """"facts"""" that he cites. [...] Steyn seems to believe seriously that many American Muslims knew about the plan and did not warn anybody - not even the 300-plus Muslims who were murdered in the attack... """"

Steyn himself wrote:

In The River War (1899), Winston Churchill's account of the Sudanese campaign, there's a memorable passage which I reproduce here while I'm still able to: 
""""How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property - either as a child, a wife, or a concubine - must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.

""""Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen: all know how to die. But the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytising faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science - the science against which it had vainly struggled - the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.""""

Is that grossly offensive to Muslims? Almost certainly. Is it also a rather shrewd and pertinent analysis by one of Britain's most eminent leaders? I think so.""",0

Howdy Zscout370,

A man after my own heart eh, I own that book as well.  The book """"I stand for Canada"""" is an invaluable book indeed.

 Random tagging 

Your revert of my """"random tagging"""" was rather disappointing behaviour, for someone with so many GAs I would have thought you would apply some common sense and actually look at the tags in question and the problems identified with several sources, rather that claim ownership of the article as top contributor.

Also, the link to cowboy worded as vaquero could be considered an WP:EGG, but it's also a pointless one as the latter article exists and there are differences between a cowboy and a vaquero, so the American word should not be used to mask the Iberian version of a cattleman if that's not what it means - there is an entire Atlantic Ocean and several thousand miles between them. 82.8.252.13  """,0

King Air article
Bill, sorry for not responding sooner to your question about the military versions of the 90, and the general length of the article. I've been mulling it over, and I'm still not sure what would be best, but I'm wondering about splitting the article into one about the 90/100 series and another about the 200/300 series. That, to me, is where the logical split is, in a number of ways. The 200/300 (including 350), went by """"Super King Air"""", and while there's a lot of commonality between the 90 and 100, there's much less so between the 100 and 200 (the exception would be the 90F which borrowed the 200's tail, but I wouldn't worry about that). Plus, the PT-6A engine comes in two """"families"""", the large PT6A and the small PT6A (# of PT wheels being a big factor). The 90/100 KAs use small PT6s, the 200/300 use large PT6s, so there's a natural split there. If we split the article there, each would have a fairly decent length, and could possibly be split further down the road if they continued to grow. Just some thoughts....  """,0

These examples suggest to me that some use of comments may be appropriate in articles. The Katrina article was edited frequently by many distinct editors. I don't think comments would have been retained without support for their use. 
I wonder if you might be willing to reply to my query regarding the comment wording (and caps use) that I proposed in my previous message?

 In fiction and In music consensus 

The consensus (painfully) reached here is that the In fiction and In music sections should contain short representative lists of the most notable instances of chimera in fiction and music (see the article edit history and the arbitration on the article discussion page). These sections should not include every instance since the lists would become so long as to have little or no value and would give the impression that such uses are more important than mythical or scientific uses. Wikipedea is not mere collections of internal links. See what not to put on disambiguation pages, as well.

Consequently, before adding to this section, please take the following steps:
be sure that the article that you are linking mentions chimera. We should not be sending readers that are looking for information about chimera to articles that do not mention the term. 
verify that your addition is at least as notable as the examples already listed and that chimera plays a major, not just a tangential role in the work. 
consider replacing an existing less-notable entry. 
justify your edit on this page.

Finally, if you disagree with my opinion of the consensus, leave your comments here. Please don't edit the article to make your point.  (talk) 

Page move request
To move the page to its classical Latin spelling Chimaera. It is of course a classical creature / concept, which has nothing to do with the US, so why should it be at a recent US variant spelling? -  
I think this is a reasonable argument. On the other hand, the majority modern usage is with the Chimera spelling, I think.  Google finds 3,230,000 (Chimera) v. 1,010,000 (Chimaera). If Google is an indication of use frequency among Internet users, a majority of readers will be searching for Chimera. That is a weak argument; redirects are relatively cheap, or so I think.  (talk) 
Gee, why should it use a recent US spelling? Well, there's Wikipedia:Use English policy, Wikipedia:Naming conventions policy that say we use the most common version, and a conspicuous lack of any policy that says Wikipedia:Use archaic Latin. We spell it the way it's spelled in the real world, it's a little thing called Wikipedia:Use common sense.

Speedy deletion of Ashish Dabral
 A tag has been placed on Ashish Dabral, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia per CSD A7. 

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not meet basic Wikipedia criteria may be deleted at any time.

 The article is incomplete 

Well written and interesting. Good.

I think the article would benefit from identifying the former bands of the members. What I find frustrating is that the article seems to assume knowledge of UK indie music. Why is it a supergroup? Who is Damon Albarn? Paul Simonon? Tony Allen? Simon Tong? I knew Damon, but I had to click 3 more links to find out the others. As an international wiki, anyone outside the UK will have no idea who these people are. The article should explain to anyone assuming no prior knowledge. Mention and link to the Clash, the Verve, Blur etc as well. 

After all, this is meant to be an encyclopaedia. It's not an article in NME, and space isn't an issue. Identifying the history of the members and explaining why it was considered a """"supergroup"""" is surely relevant to the article.

On another note - I only noticed who produced the album was here when I returned to it and looked at the top right side panel. I was expecting to find this at the bottom under the list of personnel. On my first visit I had to click other links to be certain that Danger Mouse had done it.

Hope that didn't sound too much of a complaint.

 User:Alien3 thinks I'm edit warring... 

...which is confusing, since I'm not even close to 3RR. But, anyway, I thought I'd drop by and explain my reasons for pulling the cite from the first sentence of the article. Per WP:LEDECITE: 
Leads are usually written at a greater level of generality than the body, and information in the lead section of non-controversial subjects is less likely to be challenged and less likely to require a source.... 
Pedantic semantic squabbling aside, I don't think there's anyone who contests the validity of the characterization of MM as """"progressive."""" Given that the same assertion is sourced exactly one paragraph later, I think the citation should be cut from the lede. 

All that said, I'm not sold on MM being a reliable source for characterizations about itself. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that MM described itself as """"impartial"""" (it doesn't, btw). Would it be alright, then, for Wikipedia to describe MM as an """"impartial media watchdog,"""" replete with cite to their web site? IMO, MM can't be a WP:RS for information about MM; they're biased, and anything they say about themselves is inherently POV. What's more, if we're not taking MM at their word, but, instead, only citing them for claims that Wikipedia editors find credible, that's differently problematic for being WP:OR. It's not our place to weigh the veracity of primary sources; we shouldn't even be using them.

To the end of sidestepping the whole issue, I'd like to offer this source instead for the claim that MM is a progressive organization: . But I don't think it should appear in the lede, either.

Also, by being related to Arabs does not mean Maltese are necessarily Arabs and there are many Lebanese who seak Arabic, but also don't even consider themselves Arabs because of their distinct non-Arab ancestry, especially amongst Lebanese christians. Tunisians and other North Africans were largely Arabized in language and culture but are of non-Arab origins, and are of predominantly Berber origins and retain Berber culture, even among Arabized Berbers. Maltese speak a Semitic language and are of very significant Phoenician descent which clearly links them to Lebanese and also to Tunisians. Considering the Maltese language is a Semitic language very similar to Tunisian Arabic, obviously there would also be Arab cultural influences as well. They are related to all Arabs in terms of language, but are specifically very closely related to Lebanese and Tunisians due to common Pheoenician ancestry and also share many cultural aspects with Tunisians.

Taking a second look at it, I don't think that the phrase """"express reservations regarding conclusions reached in the 9/11 Commission Report"""" is accurate.  That seems pretty watered down considering that they come right out and say they think it was a controlled demolition.  From their own About page:

""""The World Trade Center building... were destroyed not by jet impact and fires but by controlled demolition with explosives""""  

I checked the first 15 or so references in the article and the one cited appears to be the only way that phrases it this way.  The other ones seem to be much more direct in what this organization is advocating.

For example, BBC News says: 

""""However, a group of architects, engineers and scientists say the official explanation that fires caused the collapse is impossible. Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth argue there must have been a controlled demolition.

""""The founder of the group, Richard Gage, says the collapse of the third tower is an obvious example of a controlled demolition using explosives

"""" 'Building Seven is the smoking gun of 9/11. A sixth grader can look at this building falling at virtually freefall speed, symmetrically and smoothly, and see that it is not a natural process.' """"

I suggest the following:

""""Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, founded in 2006, is a non-profit organization representing architects and engineers which advocates that the World Trade Center was destroyed by explosive demolition, a 9/11 conspiracy theory.""""

Or if you really want the 9/11 Commission report in the lead sentence:

""""Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, founded in 2006, is a non-profit organization representing architects and engineers which rejects the conclusions reached in the 9/11 Commission Report about the September 11 attacks.

I enjoyed this page when I first saw it about a year ago.  I have some of the public domain pictures that were originally posted here but have now been deleted.  It has been sometime since the originator has posted.  I just recently became a member of Wikipedia and am still learning how to post things.  I will try to replace some of the pictures that have been deleted.  I also think it is a good idea for anyone else to add their own examples of Korean pieces if they feel it will add to the educational value of this site.  I have some of my own that I plan to add.

 What I addad 

The below was liked. If someone wants to chop this down and add it, be my guest. ~   

In 2012, the Journal of Palestine Studies was forced to translate and publish a 1937 letter of David Ben-Gurion after the pressure group CAMERA reported an error made in a journal article written by Papp√©. In his article, Papp√© had written, """"Ben-Gurion, for example, wrote in a letter to his son in 1937, 'The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war, citing pages 167‚Äì68 of David Smith's 2004 Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict. After checking Smith's book for the quote, CAMERA noticed that there had been an error in citation, and wrote to JPS saying so: """"the quote attributed to Ben-Gurion does not appear in the citation provided."""" The JPS verified this, but in doing so highlighted something that CAMERA had not:

The JPS, for its part, does not mention that the paperback version of Papp√©'s book, certainly at least the 2011 reprint, uses (p.¬†23) the quote with the same mark positioning as the JPS article‚Äî""""The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war."""" The paperback provides different sources to the Smith citation used in the journal article, though: """"Ben-Gurion's Diary, 12 July 1937, and in New Judea, August‚ÄìSeptember 1937, p.¬†220.""""

Having uncovered these citation errors and discrepancies, the journal decided to go the final step and have the entirety of Ben-Gurion's letter translated into English. The translated letter confirms that, regardless of citation errors, the underlying interpretation of the letter provided by Papp√©'s article and book was sound. In the letter to his son, Ben-Gurion is quite clear: """"We must expel Arabs and take their place.""""""",0

Early radio career
Mills began his career at 16 as a DJ on his local Hampshire commercial radio station, Power FM, after barraging the station with demo tapes.  He was given the chance to present a weeks worth of shows, and based on the success of this, was immediately offered the 'graveyard slot' of 1:00 am ‚Äì 6:00 am six nights a week, making him the youngest permanent presenter on mainstream commercial radio.  His popularity led to a quick move to the coveted late afternoon 'drive time'.

Mills moved from Power FM on to GWR FM and stayed with the station for two years.  His next station was Piccadilly Key 103 in Manchester where he once more progressed quickly from the late night slot to the mid-morning position.  In 1995, Mills moved to the then new London radio station of Heart 106.2.

Mills has provided various voiceovers, including the voice of specialist in-store radio station 'Homebase FM',  the voiceover for Blockbuster Inc.'s in-store infomercial channel 'Blockbuster TV', and more recently, the voiceover for 'The VH1 Album Chart' on UK television channel VH1. 

BBC Radio 1
Mills joined BBC Radio 1 in 1998 to present The Early Breakfast Show between the hours of 4am and 7am. In January 2004, Mills was moved to a weekend afternoon slot, which only lasted for just over 6 months, as in July 2004 he moved over to the weekday early-evening slot, initially covering Sara Cox who was on maternity leave. When Sarah did not return to the slot, Scott took it over as his own The Scott Mills Show.  Mills also provides holiday cover for other slots including The Chris Moyles Show.

The Scott Mills Show, in its current format, runs from 4pm to 7pm, Monday to Friday.  It is co-presented by sports reporter and occasional presenter Mark Chapman (Chappers). The assistant producer was Laura Sayers until April 2008. The current assistant producer is Rebecca Huxtable, usually called 'Beccy' or 'Wacky Beccy' on air. The regular newsreader is Tulip Mazumdar. The producer of the show is Emlyn Dodd, although he is referred to on air as 'The one who doesn't speak'.

Thanks for uploading Image:Alisonbechdel2.jpg. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, their copyright should also be acknowledged.

As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Non-free content, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use.

Everybody: you're wrong. Everyone here except Bretonbanquet has said that they think that the numbering should continue on side two. This isn't about what anyone thinks; it's about reliable sources - in this case, the label of a vinyl record. It is also about reality - and as usual, people here are trying to make Wikipedia into an alternative universe rather than an encyclopedia. So, in a nutshell, it doesn't really matter what any of you think. If you can produce a copy of this or any album where the numbering on side two is continued from side one, rather than beginning again from track one, by all means, it should be noted in the article, because that would be an accurate representation of how the record was presented to the public, as well as a reliable source. Problem solved. By arbitrarily deciding on a numbering system that is contrary to what actually exists in the real world, you are using original research, which some people here tend to frown upon. As far as the problem of younger people not understanding the numbering: even today's young people are capable of working out the logic behind something with two different """"sides"""" being numbered differently. 

I also don't agree that the sides should be eliminated completely; an album article is supposed to reflect the reality of the initial release, which, for most of the best music ever recorded, is vinyl. It is our responsibility to convey that reality accurately, not to revise it.  ‚Ä¢talk‚Ä¢   """,0

 Request regarding current RfAr/Clarification 

There is an open Request for Clarification regarding a sanction decided at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Abd-William M. Connolley, see live link, or permanent link.

 is the only arbitrator to comment there so far. I agree with him, and, unless other arbitrators wish to address the issues raised, I support the close of this request with no finding or clarification. My reason for this: it is apparent that any useful clarification would require more discussion than can be accomplished at RfAr/Clarification, and that I was blocked while this request was pending, for comments made in the request itself, is an additional impediment.

There is no need for extra debate or argument. I have stated that I am willing to accept a tighter restriction than the way in which I interpreted the sanction, pending clarification by ArbComm. So the status quo is that the restriction is tight, though not necessarily as tight as defined by the administrator who blocked me. I do not consider myself restricted from what the sanction explicitly permits, and I'd argue that he did so consider. I accepted Sandstein's decision (""""clarification"""") as a neutral administrator, pending ArbComm review, not Future Perfect's who was already involved, and I had already claimed that he was involved in dispute with me.

I will continue to respect Sandstein's tightening as standing and binding on me, and will interpret this very narrowly but as originally stated, and it did permit legitimate comment before ArbComm, when I am an originating party, as is normal. Normally, I can, having filed, respond there to comments from other editors, also made there, which is what I did. ArbComm specifically allowed me to originate a case, and if I'm clearly involved as well, I see nothing in the sanction which requires me to avoid it.

I will not use this as a loophole to drive trucks through carrying my opinion about disputes between other editors, and I will avoid, in such a filing, if it happens, unnecessary mention of disputes between other editors. Obviously, if I file a case claiming involved use of tools by an admin, I will present evidence of involvement and existing disputes or other reason that recusal would have been required, which would only mention other disputes peripherally, and which will not be an attempt to resolve those other issues.

I hope that there is more clerk attention to an actual RfAr than there has been to the existing RfAr/Clarification, which, as it stands, includes an illegitimate edit by someone other than me to the material I filed. It's been pointed out by , with clerk attention requested, and nothing was done. Nevertheless, if the request is closed without action, it's moot. The real point here is that if clerks were following filings before ArbComm, surely this would have been noticed and reverted or moved, and possibly the editor warned.   """,0
""":Hi. Lots of points, I'll reply as best I can:
Listing the squadrons and their aircraft types is too much /for this article/ but not too much for Wikipedia. Only listing the serial numbers, pilots or other minutiae is too much for Wikipedia. One way you could try would be to create a """"sandbox"""" page for yourself, say User:FFA P-16/Sandbox, write up the squadrons as best you can and then ask at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Aircraft‚Äé if we can look at it, tidy up the English, etc. and advise on the best page to put it on. Ground instruction airframes are not notable unless there is some special reason, for example if the airframe itself is notable from earlier in its life. 
Re. the ordering of the list, I would have to think about that but it is really a separate discussion. 
You say that the serial numbering (tail numbering) uses a special system. I would like to see this system explained, but it needs just a few examples to show the principles, not the whole list.
If Swiss writers routinely quote the serial number of an aircraft when writing about it, as a way of showing the information contained in the number, then you should be able to reference this. Such references might convince us that the Swiss Air Force is an exception to the general rule. We Wikipedia editors do like to see hard evidence, not just another editor's word. And, as you have noticed, we sadly know little of the Swiss Air Force unless someone can find reliable sources for us. ‚Äî Cheers,  (Talk)

Regarding your comment on the possible side effects (headaches, dizziness, numbness), pale in comparison to the side effects of many medications used to treat pain syndromes.

 Vietnam War is NOT genocide 

Genocide is the deliberate killing of a certain religious, ethnic, or national group. The Vietnam War was never a deliberate and systematic killing of any religious, ethnic or national group.

2. The statement ‚ÄúThis view was put forward by the second president of the Watchtower Joseph Franklin Rutherford‚Äù not only lacks verification, it is just plain false. Rutherford did not teach that blood per se was sacred, and he never condemned blood transfusion. 

3. The statement ‚ÄúBeginning in 1980, the medical use of certain products derived from blood became permissible‚Äù is not verified, and it is just plain false. Watchtower doctrine tolerated some products derived from blood as early as November of 1961, which was only ten months after blood transfusion became a shunning offence. 

4. The statement ‚Äúthere is evidence that some Jehovah's Witnesses have secretly taken medical products derived from blood or blood transfusions‚Äù is a patent misrepresentation. Verifiable source material demonstrates that some Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses have also openly accepted blood transfusion! 

5. The statement, ‚ÄúThe non-acceptance of blood products by groups like the Jehovah's Witnesses has caused many hospitals to offer bloodless medicine‚Äù is another horrible misconstruction. When it comes to the Watchtower organization‚Äôs blood doctrine, there is no other similar group, and you have not referenced one either. 

Your statement manifests a serious lack of qualification to address this subject. You manifest ignorance of the subject, and a willingness to edit despite that lack. Hence I have reverted to the verified introduction, which feeds nicely into the article as a whole.

"There weren't even proper data for those years from Europe and you expect me to provide statistics? It is like requesting statistics to claim that Gaule was populated of Gaulois. I have provided records using the term Armenian ecxluding other groups, I have provided records statistics of 250-300,000, I have provided another work which claims majority. What you ever did was to provide datas that at least 200 years pre that period or 300 years after. The closest data was provided by me and which either equated population for 'Armenians' or another one used the term majority, and another one only talked about the depopulation of Armenians. Being neutral doesn't mean to add misleading wordings, the way it is, no one would guess that the Armenians and this in the entire article had even a history there or they had ever constituted an significant part of the population. It isen't enough for you that the entirity of the history of the Armenians in Nakhichevan is entirly missing from the article, for hell sake Grandmaster you even disputed that the word is generally known as Armenian, you even have a problem with the term Armenian being added anywhere or accept that Armenians for some period in the history of Nakhichevan have constituted a majority. If you are really good intentioned, I think you would not have had the problem with the word Armenian there when the history section start with trash about the etymology of the word and with referrences that aren't cited anywhere.

 Race and Intelligence: Asian-Americans 

I've noticed you've contributed much to the race/intelligence articles and thought these articles might interest you:

http://paa2009.princeton.edu/papers/90354

""""Using data from recent Current Population Surveys (CPS), this study compares third-and-higher 
generation with earlier generation Asian Americans and non-Hispanic whites in terms of 
socioeconomic characteristics and demographics. The findings suggest a ‚Äúthird-generation 
decline or flattening‚Äù for Asian American and white men as well as Asian American and white 
women. For each of these groups, the mean of years of schooling among the 2.5 and third 
generations is lower than among the first and second generations. This pattern is most 
pronounced among Asian Americans. As for wage determination, the generational differentials 
can be explained by educational attainment and other basic demographic variables. Overall, these 
results suggest that assimilation beyond the first generation immigrants no longer improves 
socioeconomic attainments as expected by traditional assimilation theory. Furthermore, in the 
case of Asian Americans, cultural assimilation across the generations may actually lower 
educational attainment and thereby reduce wages contrary to traditional assimilation theory.""""

""""It is widely noted that Asian immigrant parents have higher educational and socioeconomic 
expectations and motivations for their children than do non-Hispanic white parents (e.g., Goyette 
and Xie 1999; Kao 1995, 2004). Asian families also tend to invest more aggressively in 
financial, human, and within-family social capital than families from other racial groups (e.g., 
Sun 1998). Yet, protective effects of ethnic cultures and resources decline according to more 
acculturation into the mainstream U.S. society (e.g., Kao and Tienda 1995). As third-or-higher 
generation Asians become more ‚ÄúAmericanized,‚Äù they tend to embrace the prevailing U.S. norm 
that as long as good efforts have been made based on one‚Äôs ability, the outcome would be 
acceptable even though one has not achieved the best performance or reached a higher level of 
education (Chen and Stevenson 1989; Stevenson 1988).""""

Likewise...

http://www.ibtimes.com/asian-americans-increasingly-defying-stem-stereotype-246578

""""Shinagawa pointed out another interesting phenomenon; later generation (second, third, fourth, etc.) Asian Americans on average have markedly lower education and income compared to immigrant Asians.

In 2007, 33 percent of PhDs conferred in the U.S. were to Asians. However, of that 33 percent, only 2 percent were Asians Americans born or raised in the U.S.""""

These trends are reflected in their TIMSS/PIRLS scores, which are often used by people like Charles Murray and Richard Lynn as proxies for IQ.

http://i39.tinypic.com/zob4p0.png

Note that native born Asian-Americans perform worse than native born Whites in every subject.

My goal here is not to put down Asian-Americans, but I've noticed that lots of modern racialists like to use Asians as a battering ram against other minorities. Yet, as the above evidence indicates, even """"model minorities"""" who start from a much more advantageous position than the others can still succumb to negative cultural influences which significantly hurt their academic performance. This suggests that culture does, indeed, matter greatly, even on exams like the TIMSS which supposedly test for 'g'. 

If you have any contacts with academics in the field, perhaps you'd like to pass this information along? James Flynn who wrote an entire book on Asian-Americans might be particularly interested.""",0

 Kitzinger 

Regards reference 46, Framing abuse by Kitzinger, I got the book out of the library yesterday.  In the index, and on a brief flip through there is no mention of satan, satanic abuse, ritual abuse, the United States, religion, religious leaders, the satanic panic, courts, judicial systems, guilt, or anything else that really supports the sentence """"In America and Britain journalists framed the charges against the defendants as evidence of a moral panic and mass hysteria; child protection workers and social workers involved were bound by their professional codes of confidentiality and unable to comment on the specifics of the cases""""  There is focus on two cases - Cleveland and Orkney, both in the UK.  Based on my reading, the main focus of the book is on how the media's portrayal of the cases affected the public's perception of the event years later - not on guilt or innocence (though there is discussion on how the media left out and selectively reported details that were more convincing of the guilt of the parents.  If anyone on this talk page has read the book or is responsible for placing the text on the page, could you refer me to the page number (and chapter in case we have different versions) so I can verify?  Right now I'm tempted to excise the statement for having a) nothing to do with the U.S. b) nothing to do with the outcome of court cases and c) nothing to do with satanic ritual abuse.  If nothing else, it would allow the most nuanced, hopefully most neutral, portrayal of the book's contents.  Kitzinger appears to be very carefully saying nothing about the suspects' guilt or innocence, but I admit it is a cursory flip-through.

 Hs Khalsa Recommendations 

I have several suggestions for how the Sikhism page can be improved.  I plan to list them below, one at a time, allowing time for comment on them before making the relevant changes.  After a suggestion has been considered and approved or rejected, I will move on to my next suggestion.

1)  """"The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the Ten Sikh Gurus and the select works of fifteen earlier bhagats as scripted in the Gur≈´ Granth Sahib.""""

Problem: I feel this sentence is misleading.  As you know, the writings of only six Gurus are included in Guru Granth Sahib.  Perhaps this sentence is not meant to suggest that all ten Gurus are included.  However, a second issue arises because there are more authors than just fifteen bhagats included in Guru Granth Sahib as implied by the second part of the sentence.  

Solution:  """"The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten (lowercase 'T') Sikh Gurus, as well as (no 'the') Guru Granth Sahib which includes select works of numerous authors from diverse backgrounds.""""

If this is not detailed enough, perhaps all relevant authors could be listed.  In any case, just stating """"fifteen earlier bhagats"""" is factually incorrect.  Further, the emphasis of the Gurus was not on the background of the authors, but on what they had to say about God.

I also propose removing 'the' from in front of Guru Granth Sahib.  Guru Granth Sahib is not a thing.  It is not acceptable or appropriate to call Guru Nanak Dev - the Guru Nanak, or to call Guru Gobind Singh - the Guru Gobind.  Similarly, Guru Granth Sahib is a Guru of equal stature.  I know writing """"the Guru Granth Sahib"""" is extremely prevalent all over the Web, but we at Wikipedia should consider the merits of the case and hold ourselves to higher standards rather than just going with what is most popular.  Thanks for considering my post.""",0
"""== Possible Sock-puppet account? ==
This is a """"one-issue account"""" with a suspiciously good knowledge of Wikipedia rules and jargon for a new account owner - and after just three hours since account creation already has a history of disruptive editing, a 3RR violation and a resulting admin block.

The account has only ever been used for editing Stanley Meyers' fuel cell and Admiral Sir Anthony Griffin (who was a strong supporter of Meyers' and whose article was just created by this user by highly dubious """"close paraphrasing"""" of a copyrighted web page).

I therefore suspect that this is a sock-puppet account of some kind...although I apologize in advance if this is a mischaracterization.

 Hi Duxwing,
 Sorry for the very long response time.  The sentence """"a Y such that Z exists for X"""" is much harder to decipher than the other version and because of the nontraditional order of quantifiers; in some cases it may have different meaning as a mathematical statement.  (It is also not noticably more concise.)  For example, the sentence """"An element ‚àív ‚àà V for every v ‚àà V exists"""" is impossible to parse because of the strange quantifier placement.  I suggest that if you are not familiar enough with higher mathematics to understand the importance of precision in quantifier choice and order then you should tread very carefully when editing technical phrases.  (Some of the other edits you made were unobjectionable or improvements, but they were all mixed in together and I didn't want to risk leaving an incorrect technical phrase.)

you demanded some facts.  here you go;
Dursun Karatas was not born in 1953, but 1950.  most of the infos about Dursun Karatas at internet suggest he was born in 1953.  it is definately wrong. if you look at original Devrimci Sol court documents, you will see he was born 27 March 1950.  he has enrolled to Universityof Istanbul in 1967 at the age of 17.if he was born in 1953, it means he enrolled to university at the age og 14 which is not possible.  

In 1978 he founded Dev-Sol (Revolutionary Left, precursor of DHKP-C).[2] Karata≈ü' group was based in Istanbul.[3]

this is not a fact.  the organisation was not based in Istanbul.  He was representative of Devrimci Yol in Istanbul branch when he established Devrimci Sol, splinter organisation from devrimci Yol.  Even turkish texas ranger that you used his report as a """"fact"""" states it, if you carefully read it.  Devrimci Sol is not based in Istanbul, but all over Turkey, especially, Adana, Izmir etc.

Karata≈ü was jailed after the 1980 military coup. In prison a political reorganisation was undertaken. The Dev-Sol inmates at Bayrampa≈üa prison refused to follow orders and boycotted court invitations. 

This is not true as well.  They have boycotted the torture and inhumane processes in prison.  Of course, torture is not mentioned at any documents or internet facts, but does not mean ut was existed.  The organisation protested torture in prison and Devrimci Sol started a hunger strikes, 4 inmates (sorry, terrorist for you and turkish texas ranger, bearing in mind, one of the terrorist lost his life during hunger strike was imprisoned with the accusation of putting up posters in the walls, punishable with 6 months imprisonment nowadays), lost their lives.  

In prison Karata≈ü wrote Haklƒ±yƒ±z Kazanacaƒüƒ±z, a work which included analysis of past mistakes of the Dev-Sol movement and lists of enemies of the organization. It was published in two volumes in 1989, spanning more than 1000 pages.[3][4][5]

He did not write it, but all Devrimci Sol prisoners.  As a matter a fact Sinan Kukul prapered the book.  If you read the book earlier version you would see. (don't use sun glasses when you read it).  Lists of enemies of the organisation..... what a fuck is that.  there is no such thing in the book.  their past mistakes......  the book consisted with Devrimci Sol ideologies, its aim etc.      

He escaped from prison in 1989.[6] After escaping from jail, he went into exile in Europe.[4] In 1989-1990 Dev-Sol carried out a series of attacks. However, on July 12, 1991, Turkish police was able to dismantle several cells of the organization. Karata≈ü fled to Europe. In April 1992 his wife Sahabat was killed by Turkish police.[3]

Following the police crackdown on Dev-Sol, Karata≈ü was kidnapped and detained by the second-in-command of the movement, Bedri Yaƒüan, on September 13, 1993. Karata≈ü did however escape from captivity, and Dev-Sol was divided. Karata≈ü and his followers reorganized their movement as DHKP-C.[3]

following police crack down....   very funny, second in command bedri Yagan,.... this is a joke not fact.  Bedri Yagan was experiencin some problems theredore whatever his duties with in the organisation was removed before his action.  see Devrmci Sol Dava Dosyasi.  turkish texas ranger mentioned this in his report.

this is not your fault of course, the facts about the organisation and its leader were delibrately changed and munipilated by turkish security forces and its collobraters.""",0

It is unclear why a number of categories were removed from the National Audio Theater Festivals page. I can only assume that the person who made the changes did not read the page carefully. The remaining categories imply that the NATF is simply an American radio drama performance festival and """"artists collective"""".  

The festival is not a performance alone, but comprises a professional organization - not a """"collective"""" or amorphous """"group"""" - of audio engineers, sound artists, voice actors, playwrights and producers. Its yearly event, also known as the National Audio Theatre Festival, involves several days of instruction, training, special talks and other discussions on these topics.

It is one of the only conferences of its type worldwide.

The upcoming 2011 festival, for example, will be focusing on voice acting in animation.

Several of the categories are rather egregious removals, such as """"Audio plays"""", """"radio drama"""", """"sound recording,"""" """"sound technology"""", and """"voice acting"""", for which NATF is one of the only national training grounds or gathering for professionals... and even as other pages in those categories that are affiliated with NATF or are similarly themed stay in those categories.

First of all I have nothing against you or Rouvas (who is an artist I actually like) in case there is a misunderstanding. I read the changes and I have to admit that you did a very good job... but I still think you exagerate in general about Rouvas. He's not perfect in everything as the whole bio clearly slows. And the movie Sta Akra (because I live in Greece) was not a BIG box office hit... Don't live in a bubble. And in the article there's only one positive review from Zoumboulakis praising his performance and the movie itself. In this case only one review means that his performance was indeed good and proves a point and many """"random reviews"""" cannot prove that a movie was good or bad in the case of Alter Ego? (and let's face it... it was a really bad movie, but that's my opinion). You repeatedly put info in the Anna Vissi article, stating her commercial decline. Apagorevmeno sold 27.000 units (2x platinum) and it was her lowest selling album. You can't say that. I believe Rouvas' """"Parafora"""" certified double platinum, or am I wrong? I am not sure. But if it's true how many units did he sold. There must be around 25.000 units or more, right? That means it's his lowest selling album, right? If it is I didn't see you writing on his article!!! So, some things apply for Vissi and not for Rouvas. I think it's unfair and you're being highly impartial. Not to mention that Rouvas never made huge sellings (like 7 platinum that Vissi did) but he still is a big selling artist so his decline cannot be that obvious like Vissi and Vandi. (I really hope you get my point and what exactly I'm trying to say to you). So it's not easy or even possible to reach a 7 platinum status again in someone's career and especially in this period. I'm not mad about anything especially for a bad review that concerns Vissi. I'm used to it. To me it sounds really bad when someone uses the word """"decline"""" in an article because some reporter decided it is so.

In fact the whole Ancient_Rome#Technology section needs more referencing.

I have marked up a few sections, e.g. Punic Wars, Government, Economy, Games and recreation, that need more references.

There is scope for an image in Punic Wars - you could have Hannibal and Scipio side-by-side, perhaps.

""""Quaestors were made automatic members of the Senate"""". Perhaps they were automatically made members.

Adjectives are somewhat astray in some places, e.g. """"the famous Hadrian's Wall"""", the """"famously decisive Battle of Zama"""" - who says it's famous?

Image captions: there are many people here, over a very long time period, so dates might be a help in the captions.

The maps are noticeably in very different (ok, random) styles, which is quite distracting to the reader. It would be desirable (so, not a GA requirement) to harmonise these.

References are formatted very diversely, from naked links to full citations. This is not a GA issue but needs to be tidied up radically for FA.""",0

I'll try to take the points in turn. Hope I get this format right.
 - WP:BLPGOSSIP states that Be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources. I am not aware of any weasel words or attribution to anonymous sources. I am not sure how the section applies, if you could be more clear it would be helpful.
 - The phrase involve claims about third parties is so vague as to not be any assistance. By this metric, so little can be used that it's almost meaningless. Someone stating their birthdate, or the grade school they attended. But for a person saying """"I have a conflict with Jenny Smith over Issue X"""" - where do we draw the line? It could easily be said that an actor and actress divorcing, with one placing on their personal (publicist) website a statement about """"separating for reasons of X"""" is a """"claim about third parties"""", but I wouldn't argue it is unreliable nor unencyclopedic to include in the biography of either individual. One can take things too far, and I think in this case the avoidance of even mentioning the existence of dispute is getting to the point where people are being literalist and not using their common sense. 76.31.236.91  20:51""",0

So the second criterion for inclusion in the list is not satisfied, as he clearly does have supreme power over the entire territory. He doesn't have to say """"The country I rule is not sovereign"""", this is obvious from the very existence of his office!

"Mithraism and Christianity ==

The Mithraic branch of Zoroastrianism also heavily influenced Christianity.  It should not be neglected that Aramaic was the language of administration of the Persian empire, and it is the same language used to write the bible.  Zoroastrianism was the state religion of a large and continious empire in based out of Mesopotomia and Iran for up to 1000 years, with brief periods of Selucid and Parthian rule.  This religion had a tremendous influence on all middle eastern culture and thought for the next 2600 years.

Monotheism, the prayer 5 times a day, the resurrection, judgement day, the saviour (Saoshyant in Persian, it's originally a Persian word).

 Template:Infobox Network 

Hi. I've restored your version of the code for the template header, so that it appears within the infoboxas is standardrather than above it. This, and adding a couple optional info lines, has brought me to the limits of my coding ability. Request: Is it possible to further modify the code, so an editor has the option of employing the infobox without using a header at all? (See, for example, the use of Infobox Biography in Henry Cowell.) When I attempt this with Infobox Network (that is, either erasing the """"name"""" line or leaving it blank, under any of the recent iterations of the header code), it leaves a little rogue vertical mark in the linespace above the logo image, insteading of eliminating the linespace altogether.

"I noticed that Rob now added a notification on original research or verification. This is better than simply removing the text, but there remains a confusion. You all must distinguish me (1) as a scientist who for you is a third party and who provides sources, e.g. see me as the writer of VTFD in 2001, (b) as a scientist who helps you, just now, to get this article straight. You should note that the verifiability condition concerns facts that need be checked by various sources. But the text that I provided (in the disputed criticism section) contains a reasoned argument that you can check by the logical faculties of your minds. Thus the condition does not apply in that sense. Also the reference to original research doesn't apply, since I didn't enter original research. The research originated in 1990 and was published in 2001. The only thing I do now is correct the misleading element in the article, and provide the reader (and you as editors) with a condensed reasoned statement, that you again can check by using the logical faculties of your minds. Also, the verifiability page mentions that the sources should be unreliable. Well, again this is a non-issue for this paragraph. For, the point is that a reasoned argument is provided, so that it doesn't matter where it is from, and you have to use the faculties of your minds. If the washing lady says 1+1=2 then this has the same value as when the bishop says so, even when the bishop doesn't know what he talks about. Which is exactly why I added the suggestion, above, that when the reasoned argument is understood, the criticism might perhaps best be included in the main text, revising the main article. I didn't do that myself, since all of you would be completely shocked, not having digested that reasoned statement. Some other comments: PM 1: I doubt whether you will find many other sources on criticism other then I already included in the list of literature in the links that I provided. If someone feels like unpacking those links and transferring those references into the main body, feel free to do so. PM 2: Now that Rob has eliminated that one sentence, that he agreed was nonsense, perhaps the header Criticism is too strong, and it may be perhaps Evaluation or something like that. PM 3: If the consensus is that this group of editors cannot take responsibility for using their logical faculties of minds on the reasoned argument, then you may also attribute it to me, see Colignatus at wikinfo, and perhaps research a bit how reliable I am. Simply a Google scolar is not enough, though.

 JIDF posts image for Wikipedia 

Here's a situation I found intriguing. The JIDF blog specifically posted an image to put on this Wikipedia article. The heading currently reads """"Better Sample of the Groups We Target (For Wikipedia)."""" This strikes me as problematic. At the very least, it gives the appearance of Wikipedia coordinating with JIDF to promote JIDF, or cooperating with JIDF's self-promotion. (From what I can tell, our image is downloaded from the blog image by Einsteindonut 8-22-08.) I'm sorry if you've already come to consensus about the inclusion of the image in the article, but I did want to mention this interesting nuance. Best wishes,  | Talk 
I don't like the way the JIDF is manipulating this article, posting messages for Wikipedia that are then being used as sources. I wish there was some way to put an end to it, but I think a blog is a WP:RS for what it says about the organization that sponsors it. ‚Äî Malik Shabazz¬†(talk¬†¬∑ contribs) 

 Hm. That's interesting.  The JIDF is only marginally notable (only two major press citations have been found), and being in Wikipedia increases the visibility of the organization. Wikipedia usually doesn't display web site screen shots. Usually an article gets a logo, if that. Also, we have a third-party cartoon in that image without copyright clearance.  Maybe we should drop that image.      

It looks like the JIDF doesn't want to be on Wikipedia after all. ‚Äî Malik Shabazz¬†(talk¬†¬∑ contribs) 
At this juncture, Malik, their opinion about whether to be on Wikipedia strikes me as irrelevant. (I'm assuming that WP:BLP does not apply to organizations, right?) However, if the screenshot is unusual for an article of this size, then I'd be interested in hearing the pro's and con's for keeping the image. (Aside from the promotional concern I've floated above.) Tx,  | Talk 

I think there may be copyright problems, because (for example) the Hamas logo is subject to copyright. I've brought the question up at Wikipedia:Copyright problems. ‚Äî Malik Shabazz¬†(talk¬†¬∑ contribs) 

The Anti-Defamation League, AIPAC, and CAMERA Wikipedia pages don't have screenshots. They don't even have pictures other than the logo, and those are organizations with physical offices, known officers, and big real-world events.  The page for Facebook has a picture of Facebook HQ (although, amusingly, that picture is actually of the Japanese restaurant that occupies the ground floor) and a screen shot of the home/login page.

But John, this image serves a different function. It displays the Facebook groups that were the target of JIDF activities. So it seems directly related to the notable aspect of the group's activity. Is it relevant that the screenshot is taken from the JIDF Facebook page or blog sites? After all, it could as well be an independent screenshot of the targeted group, without JIDF as the source. See what I mean?  | Talk 

Just to clarify, there was already a sample up.  I read the blog and they made a point saying that the original sample only showed anti-semitic groups and not the terrorist groups, and I wanted to learn how to add an image, so I replaced it.

 Notability concerns 

Hi Agricola44 (as article creator and largest contributor). I would like to place a notability tag on this article, but since I get blocked for everything I do, I am firstly consulting others in this manner. This seems like a cool little medal contest and all, but since it is being awarded by SAE International (SAE), (formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers, is a professional organization for mobility engineering professionals in the aerospace, automotive, and commercial vehicle industries) basically a professional organization, I do not find this notable. What policies govern this, and what makes it notable to you?

I am not trying to completly trying to erase the face that Raven was their co-star in the movies. But she was never a meber of the REAL LIVE group. And like I said, the """"Greatest Hits"""" album is just a rumor, as is the reality show. I don't know what will happen but as of right now, I am all for your idea of having Galleria away and bringing Anginette in. I don't know if they should bring her into the real live group though, depening on who they bring in. And as for the rumor of Jessica Benson being cast a Cheetah Girl for the 3rd movie, I DO NOT want that to happen. 3LW is (in my opinon) way to mature for Cheetah fans to hear and having a group within a group is ridiculous. But...3LW's album has been pushed back from 2003 to 2007 already which leads me to the face that 3LW may have to face the music that the may be over and it may be the best thing for Jessica to join the Cheetahs. I mean, really old artists have MySpace pages where they just add their """"greatest hits"""". 3LW is already doing exactly that which leads me to believe that 3LW may be over and Jessica Benson may be joining the Cheetahs. 

If 3LW is over than I am all for Jessica joining the Cheetahs as Anginette. But if 3LW remains a group, then I am completly against Jessica joining them. And if 3LW is over and she joins the Cheetahs, this may be the way to get older fans to listen to The Cheetah Girls. I guess some part of the girls fate is on the hand of 3LW.  03:03, 31""",0

Created on the basis of lies and today people day on the basis of lies. That¬¥s pure sacrifice of innocent children of Afghanistan who had nothing to do with those lies but they are the victims. Why?? I know many Pashtuns did great damages on non-Pashtuns and devided them by their varieties but in return many non-Pashtuns dominate them with their cultural- lingusitical superiority . Today, those who are responsible for killings and lootings are sitting on the streets or get killed. Many Pashtuns have lost everything and live under the right of existence. The Mohammadzai were known to be wealthy and very rich and giving Afghanistan it¬¥s ruling class with it¬¥s royals, but today they do not differ from Kuchis and the drug-infected people of Kabul or Hazaras of Behsud or Tajiks of Kandahar. The same things I am writing here I always tell to my own friends and relatives. Let¬¥s stop these idiocy and work together. Our own hearty people will deal with our criminals and you need to do the same with yours. Those who devided Afghanistan were fascists or servants of foreigners.

The name of the article, """"Close to nature forestry"""", comes from a continental school, but the content incorporates the US theory and practice I found reading the work of professor Tom Mc Evoy, """"Positive Impact Forestry"""", and I also made reference to the """"Ecoforestry Institute"""". I thought that the title """"Close to nature forestry"""" reflected better the concept than """"positive impact forestry"""". Also I may be biased, because of being a continental, but looking closer, as I am Spanish, and the current is of German origin, I may have certain neutrality. The article does not claim novelty, since the German movement was initiated in 1950. I think that the main value is to consider that the human action in forest should only be to help nature do more quickly the process it would make slowly by itself; and as a result the idea that to manage a forest as an ecosystem has sense also from the economical point of view, as it reduces operating costs. Needless to say that the article is open to incorporate any additional information, particularly concerning US practice and experience, and help balance it.

At the very least, there are many sources that study the reflectance spectra of Munsell chips. One that is in the public domain is at .

What is the identity‚Äîin the Munsell system‚Äîof the Munsell color to which the Wikipedia article is referring? Is it in fact 5RP 5/12?

In what sense are artists supposed to be """"following Munsell"""" here? Obviously not in nomenclature.

Yes, I am aware that there is no reference in the Australian Census about Latinos but this is trivial, there does not need to be any reference. You seemed to be confused on who actually is Latino and this seems to be your main point of debate. Going by your logic the pages Anglo-Celtic Australian and Black Australian should be drawn into question as they are also not referenced in the Australian Census. The rest of the page shouldn't need citations and references as no more information than what is available in the census is really given. And how exactly am I wrong? """"I'm not saying that your entirely wrong"""" Again this opinion seems to me, to have come from your belief that I am not aware of what or who a Latino is, and in my opinion, no offense intended, is due to yourself not grasping the concept of a Latino. My view is further strengethed by your comment: """"I think it's dubious to list people because they're of Latin American descent all down as 'Latino Australian' when they are in fact of different ancestral, ethnic and national backgrounds.""""
This is exactly what Latinos are, of different ancestral, ethnic and national backgrounds. This is the great and unique thing about Latinos is that they can be White, Black, American Indian, Asian, Multiracial and of all different nationalities.

I am an African American currently residing outside of the States.  I just wanted to write and say """"Thanks DeeCee"""", for your work over at the Black Supremacist page.  I surfed there by accident.  I was shocked to find that Wikipedia has even chosen to include this article.  It is far too long in view of the insignificance of so-called """"Black Supremacy"""" when compared to the massive White Supremacist Movement which is once again taking the entire White World by storm.  (Are you a Black Supremacist, if you are only trying to survive in a nation that overtly practices and tolerates Racist practices such a lynching or segregation?)  Until I read our courageous comments, I was truly daunted by the sheer malevolence that appears to be at work in that article, especially the insidious denigrations of Marcus Garvey.  So many considered him to be a hero for addressing Black suffering in the Post Slavery Occident.  Yet, that article slanders him viciously, referring to him as an errand boy of the Klu Klux Klan and a friend of White Supremacists.  I have not been able to find any truth in any of these statements, so I deleted them.  So much of the material there appears to be merely conjectured or anecdotal designed to tell ugly tales about African people in general rather than focus on the purported subject at hand.  Yet, on the White Supremacist page, there are no such juicy tidbits to further incite anger and outrage.  There are no tales told period, just the bare bones concerning this virulent hate-inspired movement.  In fact, much has been left out.  The White Supremacist article could have included a number of recent and not so reccent events that would have turned any reader's stomach but the writer keeps it very cut and dry.  Not so on the Black Supremaciy page where, the author goes out of his way to assasinate the character of any Black person who remotely expresses any racial pride or hope for his people.  I guess, he is just two fingers from calling Martin Luther King a Black Supremacist, since he incited Black people to protest white brutality and segregation.

I want to complain to Wikipedia about the unhealthy tone in which the Black Supremacist page has been written.  The assaults on Rappers and other musicians such as Lauren Hill is shocking.  I have no doubt that the article is motived by racial hate.  It is so apt that you have identified the problems as systemic.  Wikipedia is a true menace in the sense that people of African descent are often assaulted but may lack the resources, time or orientations necessary to defend themselves against those who use Wikipedia to commit what amounts to racial assault.  Refutations are highly resented and a general ambiance of White supremacist aggression reigns on many pages.  I haven't read all that you've written, I imagine that you spend a lot of time, fighting the good fight.  Again thanks.  I hope you get this message.Sincerely
Vani

There is no good hand / bad hand here, that's a total misuse of that concept, another attempt to smear me with no grounds whatsoever. This is not an """"alternate persona"""", this is me talking the way I talk, trying to resolve an issue with another user the way I would do normally, a user I have no prior conflict with or any intention of alarming or harassing. In this case however, for sound common sense reasons that you two would do well not to feign ignorance of given neither of you are new admins, I just don't happen to want to make my other contributions available to all and sundry just because I happened to have decided to try and do that. ErrantX, if you want to continue to smear my actions in the most despicable way, by trying to paint what were civil, polite queries, as a """"pursuit"""", and you want to continue to insult me by insinuating I'm a coward, then I guess there's nothing I can do stop you given you've been entrusted with the power to do so. But I'll take the fact that neither of you are prepared to detail what part of WP:SOCK I have actually violated, or indeed identify which part of WP:HARASS I am supposedly guilty of, as evidence that you can't. Not to mention neither of you seem prepared to present any evidence that Malleus himself felt threatened or alarmed by the conversation, or had asked me to leave and I had refused to do so. I guess you two can live with that I suppose, but mark my words, if or when there's an arbitration case concerning Malleus' conduct, then I'll be entering this experience into evidence, and adding User:ErrantX and User:Bwilkins as admin parties to it, with questions to answer as to why they chose to block off an attempt at civil discourse with the user, who neither requested the communication to stop, or said he felt threatened or harassed by it in any way. I did have half a mind to try and continue the conversation here if Malleus was willing, given that there's some simple concluding statements that arise from it that I'd have liked to have seen whether he was happy to sign off on or not, but I get the sense that you two would probably block talk page access for some spurious reason, whether he was interested in doing so or not. I sincerely hope there's nothing deeper than simple admin over-reaching going on here, but precedent says otherwise with these types of disputes. I'm sadly reminded by your actions of several other cases which ended up at arbitration simply because people were unwilling to follow some basic steps like AGF, indeed the steps outlined in policy. So, you just content yourselves that you've done something good here, and I'll just get back to my main account and do my thing there, and we'll see what the future holds for all of us.

"""::::::::: Use or indeed overuse of the words 'informer' or 'suspected informer' alone remains pejorative and inappropriate here. Angus's suggestion of """"suspected by the IRA of being an informer' is not unreasonable as it indicates that it is a concept or crime particular to that side of the dispute. 
Sarah argues, """"What they are commonly called is what we should reflect here. Any inhabitant of Ireland who assisted with information given to the British was an informer."""" She avoids my earlier point. 'Commonly' has to include, in Ireland, Protestants and Unionists (who were themselves British) and therefore the concept is not common currency unless you regard Protestants as people of no consequence at all in the matter. Can you inform yourself?
And was it in 'common' use in Ireland that you would call someone who had reported a rape or a stray cow an informer? 
Sarah's other point that """"Protestants who openly supported the Republic were never killed. So it wasn't a sectarian matter"""" is risible. As if you execute those who come across to your side? Anyway most Protestant Republicans became Catholics. 
The number of Protestants in Cork who were home rulers would have been tiny and the percentage who supported the separatists minute and can pretty well all be named like Miss Dorothy Stopford or Sam Maguire.

Both references from the SAME scholar, yet one is accepted which is favor of an ambivalent view towards diet, while another assessment from the same scholar admitting their are passages against meat eating, is not accepted. Why the Double standards? 

Why does the ADMIN on sikhhistory, blatantly support their own ideological stance, to the point of synthesis, and selectively using texts and passages, from authors who they cite, and then reject the same authors when going against their position? 

How can you adressing harassment, yet make no attempt on addressing the issue of BIAS in your articles? Do you only protect the Orthodox Sunni islamic view? and the unorthodox shia view?...IF that is not the case, then please can you tell me why sikhhistory ADMIN have taken the biased stance of only abiding by an orthodox POV.

I dont think these questions im asking is harassment, but if my objection is avoided time and again, and the same allegations being made towards the same ADMIN for being one sided, you again have AVOIDED the issue at hand, which is a biased article protected by ADMIN to support their own beleifs, i think that is a greater offense than my trying to get some sense from the ADMIN in question. lol.",0

Let me make it easy: Television main cat has 167 lists, of which 48 use your preferred schema (and most of those are serious AfD bait), 19 follow neither convention with 13 being the Characters in/of variety of non-lists. Anime/Manga, 269 lists, only 13 of which do not use List of X characters, and of those only 4 use your preferred version, 1 uses Characters of, and the rest need renaming/merging/deleting.  Then there is the less populated Category:Lists of film characters with only 57 lists. Of those, again, 27 do not use List of X characters or are not actual lists. Of those 27, 3 use the Characters of/in, 1 uses X characters, and 23 use your preferred List of characters in/of X. So, vast majority of all of those use List of X characters, and most of those that don't aren't lists that their respective projects would even approve of their existance, and if kept as is, would be renamed. So, where is your research to actually show that yours is preferred, except by a single project which also rejects other guidelines. Where is the overall naming guideline that truly supports your claim without special interpretation? And where is your discussions giving consensus to begin renaming any such lists you feel doesn't meet this personal interpretation without any discussion.  ¬†(talk¬†¬∑ contribs)

But because my stalker hated Michael Lucas, as a farewell F.U. to him Michael and I decided to collaborate and produce some high-quality photos of what goes on during the making of an adult film.  Out of roughly 400 shots, I uploaded eleven.  Only one shot does not have the cameras, lights, operators, etc. in the shot (and that one is not explicit).  Most of the shots do not show genitalia.  Those are my reasons.  I'd be interested to hear what people think about all of this.  Am I """"Wikipedia's pornographer""""?
So there you have it: Shankbone admits to collaborating with Lucas to upload pornographic photos from Lucas's studio onto WP as a final F U to his alleged """"stalker""""  not to enrich WP, but to say F U to some unknown random IP.

The results have not been repeated by other scientists.  In fact, within the list of referenced studies, there are contradictory results both by the same researcher and between different researchers.

The general consensus in the research community, and in the HIV/AIDS community, is that although the much vaunted list of references claiming to link nitrites to HIV/AIDS may look impressive to the untrained eye, they do not support a case for a claim that nitrite use causes HIV infection or Kaposi‚Äôs sarcaoma (KS).",0

You would have more credibility if your first of only 2 edits hadn't been to vandalise one of the articles I'm working on just like the other trolls and sockpuppets. But to answer your question there's no difficulty in either adding the details to this Drake Circus article (thereby avoiding the despised Drake Circus Shopping Centre article, or by creating a whole new article. You will of course have to meet the WP notability requirements if you choose the latter. Of course if you wish to do the former you'll have to wait until the protection runs out, alternatively you can place the details here and an experienced editor will do it for you.   

I published an article on a poet and then because I also wanted to feature an article on the Peninsula medical school in drake circus I came here. I read all that you have deleted over the months and from that I learnt you are not allowed to link to spam so applying your rules I removed the spam link from your article.
So you are saying you are the only person allowed to edit an article? And that if anyone dare to remove your spam they are 'just like other trolls and sockpuppets'.
I suggest that unless you have anything constructive to say you stop insulting people and go away. 
I have no interest in either where you came from or where you go. When your first edit is to delete something from an article using a spurious excuse like spam then that is vandalism. Before you delete anything else from any other article I suggest you bone up on the guidelines first. The requisite article you needed to be aware of for your first edit was WP:EL, likewise a quick lesson in commonsense would also be handy, i.e. a link to a Manchester history website in an article about a Manchester historical establishment couldn't be construed as spam by any stretch of the imagination.   
Incidentally you created the mo-foster article almost an hour after you deleted the """"spam"""" link. You really need to learn how WP works before trying to game the system.   

""""You really need to learn how WP works""""
you mean if some guy tries to publish an article that might compete with one of yours they will be blocked and their article trashed?

reading through all this i find it hard to believe its all about spam - firstly Google respects Wp's nofollow attribute in the links tabs and secondly they have an index for example of known spammers of for example social networking sites. I personally would like more emphasis in the article on the computer sciences in Drake circus as that is what it is becoming more rapidly known for.

I think you are doing a lousy job polluting valid information with complete garbage. So, I will no longer link to the wikipedia Clan Davidson """"article"""" and will link to the correct history: ACCORDING to the Highland manuscript believed to be written by one MacLauchlan, bearing the date 1467, and containing an account of the genealogies of Highland clans down to about the year 1450, which was accepted as authoritative by Skene in his Celtic Scotland, and believed to embody the common tradition of its time, the origin of the Davidsons is attributed to a certain Gilliecattan Mhor, chief of Clan Chattan in the time of David I. This personage, it is stated, had two sons, Muirich Mhor and Dhai Dhu. From the former of these was descended Clan Mhuirich or Macpherson, and from the latter Clan Dhai or Davidson. Sir Aeneas Macpherson, the historian of the clan of that name, states that both the Macphersons and the Davidsons were descended from Muirich, parson of Kingussie in the twelfth century. You suck, and this site sucks and your edits are complete crap but I'm sure you feel justified somehow in your pathetic view.

 Referencing 

Referencing on Wikipedia, thanks to its primitive interface, is a pain. There are a couple of ways to do it: one widely-used method is to simply copy and edit references from another article. The Meridian Hill Park article has a start on references: it's got a heading and a {{reflist}} template, so you're partways there already. There are some extant citations in the text, like{{citation |title=Roads to Diversity: Adams Morgan Heritage Trail |url=http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/AMHT_English.pdf |author=Cultural Tourism DC |date=2005}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?node=cityguide/profile&id;=799601 |title=Meridian Hill Park: Sports and Recreation Locations in Washington, DC on washingtonpost.com's City Guide |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}. You can see that the references are framed by  (or ) and  in HTML-like markup. You use named references if you are going to use a particular reference more than once. When embedded in the text they'll cause notes to appear in the References section at the bottom of the page.

In the top left of the edit window you should see a toolbar that has, at the left, a button that says """"Cite."""" Clicking it will show a drop-down menu of citation references for web, news, book and journal references, which then leads to a form that you can fill out (not all forms need to be used), and will insert a formatted reference wherever your cursor happens to be in the text. Often, for book references, you can dispense with extensive context after the first reference, and just say Smith, p. 15 and go on.

My main concern on the tone of the article is the use of intensifiers and adjectives in general, which is frowned upon in encyclopedic style. A certain dryness is called for, but there's an art to keeping just this side of plodding declarative prose. It's an interesting exercise. Perhaps not Joe Friday, more like Bill Gannon. 

Have a look at the citations policy for more: also verifiability and reliable sourcing are important. The policies on no original research is important, since Wikipedia is a tertiary source that relies on secondary published sources.

Greetings,
I have seen your name everywhere already. Thanks for your recent attention to WP:PHILO and the aesthetics dept. I had recently been working on the logic project. I did quite a bit of work on it, and then ran up against some cultural issues.

I wanted to get User:SatyrBot (an apparently wonderful service!!) to automatically tag articles with the new logic banner for the purpose of assessment. I put together a category list, publicized the issue, and then moved forward with no objection. Well the complainers came out of the woodwork! The bot was stopped and at this point most have been untagged. I find all of this quite terrible.

Since then, I have been working on WP:PHILO with all of these task forces. I got the sense that people were a lot less uptight in general over there. I have changed direction a bit and now am advocating that the philosophy project tag incorporate these fields and be placed appropriately, etc. However, there is no real enthusiasm for the auomatic bot tagging proposal. Although there is far less hostility to it!

 he also owns cultnews.com and changing """"blog"""" to """"web site"""" obscures that these are self-published and not WP:RS
This page is about a person who control that site, this link is a must in this page, cannot be avoided.

A tag has been placed on Night nazif, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

Re.: Rathlin massacre
The People on Rathlin were not Irish- they were the families of Sorley Boy McDonnell's followers. The Scottish clanchiefs had sent their families to Rathlin in the belief that they would be safe there. Drake had been hired to supervise the transport of John Norri's Troops to Rathlin, and then patrol the waters between Rathlin and the Mull of Kintyre to prevent the scots from sending reinforcements. John Norris had a force of 300 Foot and 80 Horse as well as siege-guns at his disposal; it seems extremely unlikely that he would have had to rely on Drake and the 25-strong crew of the """"Falcon""""- Drake's vessel at the time- to help Norris do his dirty-work for him.John Sugden's Biography of Drake contains a fair amount of info on the subject. 21:46""",0

 Excellent work! 
I have been away from Wikipedia for years, and largely due to users like the despicable, self-deluded Gavin Collins. To return here after so much time and find that he has been removed from the site is an utter joy, on several levels. Justice has finally been served, proving that the system here actually works, albeit slowly. However, I can't help but feel sick about the time, energy, and effort the Wikipedia community has expended (i.e., wasted) in dealing with this Gavin Collins, a terrifically disruptive and possibly mentally disturbed individual. It is incredible to me that one user has caused such extensive damage and unending headache, heartache, and loss of resources. Yes, instead of spending hundreds of hours dealing with Gavin Collins' nonsensical, myopic, obtuse, elliptical, deconstructive, and dense argumentation, we could all have been making this a better place. And now, he's gone. So in a sense, I suppose those hours lost were not for nothing. And at the end of the day, Gavin Collins' dubious legacy is deeply stamped.

"Wow...you hold a masters degree in economics and have taken many doctoral courses? Is that supposed to impress us? Most professional economists are on the payroll of the FED, so of course they reject Austrian economics. AE is, however, the oldest continual school of economic thought. Moreover, it doesn't have the dismal track record of mainstream economics, which, to quote Bill Maher, is a litany of getting shit dead wrong. From the Wall Street crash 1929, to the non-existent depression of 1946, to the Bretton Woods system, the stagflation of the 1970s, the S&L; crisis of the 1980s, the dot.com bubble of the 1990s and the housing bubble of the 2000s. From Keynes' suggestion to bury FED-notes in glass jars underground and let people dig them up, to Samuelson's insistence on the USSR overtaking the US from the early 1970s to 1989, to Krugman's Space Alien Invasion solution to our present day crisis.
Just to name a few examples of the top of my head. With a track record like that, of course they will shun the one school of thought that get things right, that understand what economics actually is and, more importantly, what it isn't.
It's not the mainstream economists that don't take AE seriously, it's the other way around. For good reason. So excuse me for not being all giggly about your supposed training in economics. Like Jefferson said, you'd be better informed of current events if you didn't read any newspaper at all than if you read those of his day. Likewise, you're likely to have a far better understanding of economics if you've never taken an economics course than having spent years studying Keynesianism, monetarism, neoclassicism or whatever mishmash of mainstream schools that gets taught in the universities today.",0

There is no official credible source for album credits. Taking images or scans from cd liner notes is illegal. There is no national database because distributors are private companies that aren't required to disclose album details.  ‚Äî Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.114.24.75   

If there is no published source to back up the fact then the fact does not belong in the biography. See WP:No original research. Wikipedia says it is not enough that your text is true or correct, it must also be previously published.
You can WP:Cite album liner notes even if you don't scan them.

 Ramped up 

Binksternet, the activity at Snowden has ramped up to the point that I think some action is needed. It is a battlefield where even the simplest work is being disrupted. The long standing Lede is being used to retell the story, and a team has formed. No amount of sense from other editors seems to bring about more sensible editing behaviour nor good communication on the talk page. The talk page is all we've got, if that doesn't work, is there some sort of RfC, or...? Thanks again,  tc 

I will look at what's going on. I've been preoccupied with another biography.   

But you have enough time to keep templating my user Talk page with """"an editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page within a 24-hour period... Please consider using the article's talk page...""""?  Let's leave aside the fact I am obviously aware of this advice such that the only remaining explanation is that you are trolling me.  Let's also leave aside the fact that you templated me the minute JohnValeron removed what I added and then Petrarchan stepped in to restore exactly what I added down to the last punctuation point (how does it help Petrarchan if when I add material she wants you template ME instead of the guy she's warring with?)  For a user to have performed four reverts within 24 hours, he or she would have had to have edited FOUR times, no?  I've edited TWICE in 24 hours (note that policy counts """"...edits by one user with no intervening edits by another user..."""" as a single edit for counting purposes).  And in these two edits, there is nothing at all in common between these two edits, either in terms of including something or excluding something.  In other words, in no sense have I returned even just twice to some preferred version.  If you are going to say that",0

 Final Edit 

Since I'll never be editing Wikipedia again, I thought I'd add a few notes here for the benefit of the few people involved who aren't delusional.  One day, I logged on to discover that I had been accused of being someone else and was facing being banned as a result.  When I objected, instead of being banned for being someone else, I was banned for objecting.  The person who did the banning had been carrying a grudge for literally years, having been caught trying to ban me for similar ludicrously and transparently self-serving reasons years earlier, only to have his malicious action overturned.  In the years since he had been initially caught, the administrators who had cared one way or the other slowly dropped away as Wikipedia slid into its own navel.  A larger and larger proportion of Wikipedia's dwindling contributions are being directed towards bureaucracy and petty politics.  This is always the sign of a community rapid decline.  I do not anticipate that Wikipedia will be relevant for much longer, though it may linger for decades as an increasingly toxic MMORPG for authoritarian sperglords.

The proof that this ban has nothing to do with my contributions and everything to do with my legitimate criticism of Wikipedia is that my user page (containing criticism of the systemic biases within Wikipedia and the noxious atmosphere within its community  which had already survived one attempt at censorship through official channels) was gleefully blanked once I no longer had the power to fix it, complete with mocking """"buh-bye"""" commentary.

Eric Hoffer wrote, """"You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you.""""  I never cared about Wikipedia; I came here because a blatantly libellous biography about me had sat untouched for months and only when it was corrected to make it factually correct, only then action was taken to have it removed on the basis of being a """"non-notable"""" and a """"vanity"""" article.  In the years since that initial experience, nothing I've experienced has done anything to contradict my distaste with the bullying, authoritarian culture within Wikipedia, and serves to confirm my suspicions about the sort of society Randroids like Jimbo would like to foist on us.  It is, however, telling that the worst punishment Wikipedia's brownshirt enforcers can think to enforce upon me is to prevent me from contributing to their project.  If I was a troll and an agent provocateur, clearly I wouldn't care and, in any case, could easily create more accounts.  I know several people who do just that.  It's obvious that the people who want so desperately to silence me and my unthinkable criticism of the wildly dysfunctional culture within Wikipedia don't really think I'm a troll or a sock puppeteer or whatever other excuses they've dragged up for silencing me; it's that I infuriatingly refuse to consider it some kind of glorious reward to give free labour to Wikipedia.

It's an odd situation, to be forcefully barred from rowing the oars on a sinking ship, for the apparently inexcusable crime of noting that the ship is sinking.  Even now, I suspect that this final commentary will be removed, because the presence of discordant voices inside the echo chamber of Wikipedia is intolerable, even when those voices are trying to draw attention to a problem which will ultimately destroy the very community which is providing the milieu in which the echo chamber ostensibly exists to protect.  Some of the people involved clearly have a long and well-documented history of cognitive distortions which leave them largely unable to either control or be held morally culpable for their actions.  It's not these people, the sadly delusional acolytes of Jimbo, to whom I address this, but the few remaining people within Wikipedia who have closed their eyes to what's occuring.  I don't have any desire to be re-chained to the oars, so this isn't about shaming anyone into overturning the decision of the kangaroo court which silenced me on Wikipedia.  This is about getting the more-or-less sane people to feel some sense of personal responsibility for refusing to either make the attempt to stand up to the bullies or remove themselves from the culture which fosters and supports the bullies.

Sorry to take so long in replying, I've only had a small amount of WP time the last few days.  I see the point you are making, on the other hand it seems useful to say something about General Haftar's character given such a reputable source says something about it after consulting 20-odd people - which given FT's reputation you would think is a balanced representation of his contacts, but they do not say who they were. I agree the FT quote """"wasn‚Äôt well informed in politics"""" is very surprising given his position. I'm happy with you removing this, and will ponder if there is a better way to give the info.  FT registration is no-cost for a few articles a month, but here is a wider quote of what they said:

Even supporters acknowledge his political ambitions, suspecting he plans to anoint himself leader of the country‚Äôs liberals. The armed forces he now purports to lead are successors to the Gaddafi-era military he repeatedly turned against; the Islamist militias he is fighting are the ones with which he fought in the 2011 uprising. Many wonder whether he is a committed democrat, as he claims, or just another Arab military officer with dictatorial ambitions, in the mould of Egypt‚Äôs Gamal Abdel Nasser, Syria‚Äôs Hafez Assad and Gaddafi.You need someone tough like Haftar to step up to the outlaws,‚Äù says the commentator Abdel Hamid el-Jadi. ‚ÄúHe has experience in the Libyan military and he knows the tribes. If he has political ambitions we‚Äôll deal with that in the second stage.‚Äù

But others worry about what they describe as a brittle personality and myopic worldview. Of nearly two- dozen people who have had dealings with him and spoke to the Financial Times, none could identify any of his interests outside war. In meetings with exiled opposition groups in the US and Africa, before he returned to serve as the rebel army‚Äôs chief of staff in the 2011 uprising, he spoke only of his military expertise. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt well informed in politics, relationships between countries or cultures,‚Äù said one Gaddafi-era opposition activist.Many Libyans and international experts fear the offensive that Mr Haftar is co-ordinating could further destabilise the country. In televised appearances, he has a habit of conflating the Islamist militias with members of parliament and the government who belong to the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, and with al-Qaeda.''

"The Table of Sacrifices is an artifact summoned by the Three Sacks in order to raise the Yamiking (and likewise, Hydrate) to the surface.  Typically, a being from the Reverse Maruhage can only individually teleport back and forth between dimensions (we see when Crimson, LOVE and the Sacks return to the Dark World, they use a teleporter that allows them to raise and fall between the surface).  My assumption is that an object such as the Yamiking needs a lot of energy to rise up to the main world compared to the limited amount of energy that individuals can use.  Thus, the Table of Sacrifices is needed to gather energy from twelve individuals (in the form of a clock) to power the Yamiking.  After the Sacks summon the clock, Crimson and LOVE throw over defeated opponents (already known to be really strong since they made it to the final stage of the playoff) into each number, with the assumption that their great energy will siphon from the clock to the Yamiking. -",0

"""A shared working relationship and agenda, limited actual knowledge of the subject in this case and unfortunately no desire to seriously discuss how much to highlight an obscure thesis. Of course. Best to just put NPOV tag on the article because consensus is impossible. Not that the Edwards reference concerns me much. 

There is a published view that Advaita and """"enlightenment"""" itself is a fraud created by possession by power hungry beings, specifically referencing Ramana Maharshi. That view deserves equal treatment as far as being referenced. To quote the author: 

Consider this quote by the currently popular guru, Ramana Maharshi: ‚ÄúRepetition aloud of His name is better than praise. Better still is its faint murmur. But the best is repetition within the mind ‚Äî and that is meditation. Better than such broken thought is its steady and continuous flow like the flow of oil or of a perennial stream.‚Äù

Ramana Maharshi‚Äôs statement represents mantra meditation‚Äôs goal: a state where the mind is timelessly identified with surrender to the name of one‚Äôs god ‚Äì identical with the god himself. The mind itself has become self-negation at the feet of the deity. Empty of original thought and dynamic desire, the ‚Äúliberated‚Äù person‚Äôs ego is dissolved: the very thing that made him or her human. All that is left is a mind-body shell, a meat-robot, that moves through life as a surrendered instrument of some greater will. I suggest the greater will is not that of the Infinite. It is the will of the god who has taken the place of one‚Äôs mind...

Does this sound like possession? It surely appears to be. Think of all the gurus you‚Äôve met with their palpable shakti. An energy so real no one who experiences it can deny it. What is that light in their eye, a light beyond this world? Whose is that power they touch you with, embrace you with? Is it the shakti of Brahman, the light of pure consciousness? Or is it the power of Kali or one of her friends? Gurus often say they are the embodiment of Shiva, Kali, or some other god. Why do we not take them at their word?

I would like to suggest that mantra meditation turns humans into zombies who serve the agenda of the gods. That agenda is procurement of more humans and more human energy. This explains the common phenomenon of proselytizing by the religious, including fundamentalist Christians, TMers, and disciples of other varieties. Servants of ‚ÄúGod‚Äù or the gods feel a driving need to bring in more recruits. The god that moves through them fills them with this zeal, as a hungry stomach fills the mind with an overwhelming need to procure dinner.

There are no gods, in the sense the gods would have us think of them. No one has been designated by the Infinite to control creation and administer the laws of nature. The sun shines by itself as an entity with its own consciousness. The rain and wind don‚Äôt need a god to direct them; they move where they will in harmony with their fellow elements. All things are children of the Infinite, spirits or egos in their own unique right, expressing in physical form and also in astral dimensions.

The gods are spirits/egos like everybody else. Most of the time they dwell on astral planes, which is why human senses normally don‚Äôt perceive them. According to ancient records, they have visited the earth in ages past in physical forms of their own, as entities from the stars.

They are no more divine than a ghost, no more cosmic than you or I, and no more entitled or intended to run the universe than any other gang of warlords might be. Somehow they‚Äôve gained control of this planet, and have held that control at least since the beginning of recorded human history. But that is no reason to think the Infinite wants it that way, or that life needs to continue that way.

True empowerment is not the Indian concept of enlightenment. It is knowing what we are and living from there. We are spirit: individual and eternal, moving within the consciousness of That which created, sustains and pervades all life. Knowing this is not difficult. It only requires putting attention on that which is beneath the content of thought. Acting from this place of empowerment is natural: we can ordain reality from that quantum level. Everyone can do it. Everyone is equally powerful moving and creating in the depths of their own consciousness.

Unfortunately, people rarely do that, though, as the mass hypnosis that governs human life convinces us that karma, fate or the will of God runs the world, that we as individuals have little direct control over what happens to us. The gods are the purveyors of this global hypnosis. It serves their agenda of control. True liberation does not mean rising above the illusion of ourselves as egos. It means rising above the illusion that as egos we are cut off from the powerhouse of creation. That as individuals we are something less t",0

""": Hi Hanely, and others,

First, a further clarification on the concept behind wikipedia, neutrality is a fundamental pillar, but there are two others as well, no original research and verifiability.  This takes us into the """"weasel words"""" you mention, which it's true is an area where improvements are needed with the article.  A reader should be able to independently check everything written in a wikipedia article should they want to, and as such, wikipedia is more about providing verifiable information rather than what a given editor simply thinks or believes is """"true.""""  You specifically cite the Criticism section, and I agree.  """"Plagiarism"""" has evolved the furthest of the three subsections IMO and is solidly referenced with verifiable sources (I think the believer stance(s) aren't presented as well as they could though), and the same should probably be done for """"Science"""" and """"Revelation"""".  For instance, one thing that can be done for """"Revelation"""" is cite the low book sales and distribution of the TUB instead of the simple current statement that it isn't widespread.  """"Peacock terms"""" have been an ongoing challenge from my perspective, commonly inserted throughout the article in a way that aggrandizes the book, but I think this is currently toned down.

What I'm hearing from you Hanely overall is a suggestion to focus on TUB alone, make the article perhaps a book summary with some history added, and put everything else in other articles.  It is one way to go, and you specifically mention Criticism-related topics as being placed elsewhere.  This would also need to be true of the adherents section and anything """"pro"""".  I don't agree with this tactic however, for reasons of wikipedia policy and overall usefulness to the average reader.  What makes TUB interesting and worth writing & reading about is that it purports to be more than a typical religious book, and people accept it as such.  I think that is a highly intertwined element of the TUB topic, and it fits in this article, and by the same token the reasons people *don't* accept it as such is part of the story.  I think it is a challenge to have the article reflect these differing perspectives, but that's a basic challenge involved with wikipedia articles in a nutshell.  Writing separate articles for separate points of view is discouraged.  See POV forking.

I think there needs to be a top-level article that is a summary of The Urantia Book basics, its teachings, its history, and those who are pro and con on topics related to it.  Other articles can then develop certain topics in more depth, if needed or wanted.  I don't see why the top-level article shouldn't be this one, it already serves as that, and other similar topics on wikipedia are structured the same way (for instance A Course in Miracles isn't a simple book synopsis & some words about the history, but covers pro and con viewpoints, as does Book of Mormon, which also has a plagiarism section).  I certainly do not accept that for some reason everything to do with Criticism should be tucked away in separate articles.  This is inherently biased toward the idea that the main wikipedia article is only for those seeking viewpoints where nothing negative is said.  Audiences also come to learn about contrary viewpoints, and those viewpoints are just as valid.

On the points you brought up, my thoughts:

1.  I've seen a tendency over the 1+ year I've followed this wikipedia article off and on for people to add many digressions to the article.  And understandably so, TUB is enormous and has thousands of interesting details and side stories.  But not all will fit in the main article.  I've seen multiple people each add a few sentences here and there, and over time, the article has become enormous and unfocused with all sorts of illogical disorganized digressions.  Like you say, this article can stand to be streamlined (you should have seen what it's been like before!).  IMO, the Lucifer rebellion story, while interesting, doesn't quite make the cut in terms of being essential enough to mention on the main page.  Perhaps an article summarizing TUB's view of the history of earth is worthwhile to build up?  The Lucifer / Caligastia / Satan story would fit in article such as that, for example.

2.-5.  Like I've said, Criticism is appropriate to have, as is the view of believers, and a POV fork is contrary to wikipedia standards.  In terms of Gardner specifically, despite any opinions on his conclusions about TUB, his book is one of the few published about TUB to analyze it from a nonbeliever perspective and it's entirely appropriate to use and cite as reference material for the article.  I say that even though I'm not personally convinced by arguments he makes.  I've read his book, have access to a copy, and can make edits regarding i",0

http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html

However, the wikipedia article on the """"Roman Salute"""" is becoming more dishonest by the week. An earlier version referenced the work of Professor Rex Curry and started thusly: """"The Roman salute is a gesture in which the arm is held out forward straight, with palms down. Sometimes the arm is raised upward at an angle, sometimes it is held out parallel to the ground. The salute was supposed to have been used in the Roman republic, but there is no clear evidence of this. Indeed it is not known whether salutes in the military sense existed at all in Roman culture"""" (by Paul Barlow).  A more recent version of the same article is written as if a neo-Nazi has been covering-up again.

A big initial problem is that no wiki writer will even attempt to discover the first use of the phrase """"Roman salute"""" and thus the writers remain stuck in intellectually dishonest confusion about dates and origins.

The article reverts back to its earlier opening concessions to the work of Dr. Curry, conceding that there is no clear evidence of the salute in the Roman Republic and also conceding that there is no evidence of salutes in the military sense at all in Roman culture.

The wiki writer then engages in speculation that people today misunderstood some images from ancient Rome.  There is no support for the idea that the """"Roman Salute"""" concept arose long ago from misinterpretations of Roman images.  There is as much evidence that, after Dr. Curry's shocking discoveries about the salute's origin with the Pledge of Allegiance, modern writers (including wiki writers) deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers misinterpreted Roman images in order to cover-up and suppress Professor Curry's discoveries.  

The wiki writer then engages in speculation that neoclassical artists misunderstood some images from ancient Rome.  There is no support for the idea that the """"Roman Salute"""" concept arose among neoclassical artists from misinterpretations of Roman images.  There is as much evidence that, after Dr. Curry's shocking discoveries about the salute's origin with the Pledge of Allegiance, modern writers (including wiki writers) deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers seized upon neoclassical artists in order to cover-up and suppress Professor Curry's discoveries.  

For example, there is no evidence that Jacques-Louis David actually thought that his painting """"The Oath of the Horatii"""" represented an actual historical Roman salute.  All of the evidence indicates that David created the scene out of whole cloth for drama. All of the speculating otherwise is actually the machinations of wiki writers and people of their ilk. The intellectual dishonesty is all the more evident in that the wiki writers deliberately faill to address those very points already made by Dr. Curry http://rexcurry.net/pledgehoratii.html  Further, the Horatii painting depicts three people reaching for weapons.

The Tennis Court Oath was painted by David later, and repeats David's use of the dramatic gesture that David concocted, but in a more modern setting.  There is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed. David was not there. Further, the oath was was written on paper (the paper being read by the central figure?) and the """"oath was taken"""" by signing the document. There is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting (the central figure might be swearing, or he might be reading his document) while those people about him waive hats, talk, holler, point, etc.  Three figures on the left seem to be an inside reference to the Horatii painting.  The wiki writer is misrepresenting the works or reading into them.

The distribution of the Eagle Standards was painted by David even later, and repeats David's use of the dramatic gesture that David concocted, but in another modern setting.  There is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed and there is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting at all.  The wiki writer claims that this is the mos important of these paintings.  That painting shows no use of the salute in pledging or oath-taking or at all and simply shows various people, with various gestures, acclaiming the central figure and grabbing for, and shouting for, the """"Eagle Standards.""""  The wiki writer is misrepresenting the works and reading into them.

Thank you , I'd rather discuss the generic effects of the long-standing and widespread violation of WP:NOR and WP:NPOV here and leave the discussion of specific content issues to the rest of the talk page (which is its function).  The generic problem with the article is that rather than presenting divergent multiple viewpoints of a topic the article often attempts a topic synthesis (prohibited by WP:NOR) which presents every viewpoint incorrectly or incompletely (violation of WP:NPOV). 

For reference I quote (with added emphasis) from Wikipedia:Five pillars about WP:NPOV:
Wikipedia has a neutral point of view, which means we strive for articles that advocate no single point of view. Sometimes this requires representing multiple points of view; presenting each point of view accurately; providing context for any given point of view, so that readers understand whose view the point represents; and presenting no one point of view as """"the truth"""" or """"the best view"""". It means citing verifiable, authoritative sources whenever possible, especially on controversial topics.

The topic of mutual intelligibility in Slavic languages is a bit difficult. For example, Bulgarian is routinely regarded as a language most distant from the Slavic type and very difficult to understand for most Slavs. In Czech, there even exists a saying """"speaking like a Bulgarian"""" for unintelligible speech. Yet the difficulties in understanding lie mainly in grammar (the non-existence of word-endings, the use of articles). You can listen to a Bulgarian, not to understand a word and doubt, if you are actually listening to an Indo-European language - and then you see a Bulgarian text and you are surprised that you can read it quite with ease. So the difference in understanding spoken language and written language can be huge. 
As for the difference between Czech/Slovak and Polish, I must agree with the Polish contributor above that a fluent conversation is not possible. Yet you can certainly understand a lot and conduct some conversation, if you try to be patient. So """"a limited intelligibility"""" would be a more correct term. As for written Polish, Czechs and Slovaks shouldn't have any difficulties with a general understanding Polish text, although quite a few words (especially of technical sort) may seem obscure and untintelligible. However, the closest Slavic language to Czech (after Slovak) is Lusitan Sorbian, especially Upper Sorbian. I don't have any personal experience with this language, but from the written texts I saw I think that its resemblance to Czech can be compared to East Slovakian dialects (which means that you can understand some passages easily, but subsequently you can be lost due to accumulation of weirdly sounding words.)

Also please read this excerpt of what I wrote:

You can thank me later for it but I'll tell you Parseval's identity. It's more conceptual to think of L^2 the space of measurable square-integrable functions on [-pi,pi] as a complex inner product space (Hilbert space). The idea is that the space has an orthonormal basis (general orthornormal basis can be found by wavelets) such as {e^{-in}} for n an integer. And if f is a function in L^2 you can take its inner product against each of these functions and get """"components"""" of f. The point is, as you'd expect in any Hilbert space, the components are the only relevant data when it comes to taking inner products. So you can find the inner product (an integral) of two functions just by knowing their Fourier coefficients. Pretty cool math dude? So basically I advise you to find the Fourier coefficients of the function """"x"""" on [-pi,pi] and take the inner product of this function with itself and apply Parseval. The PROOF of Parseval is probably well beyond the scope of your education; you'll see it when you get to university. It involves proving the completeness of the trigonometric system (in the L^2 case) which can be done nicely with convolution but I'll save the details to your lecturers at first year undergrad. uni. 

I notice you said that you didn't know what """"Fourier series"""" is and it shows since if you did know you'd see that the above is perfectly correct math. Feel free to consult anyone.

 Dear Sitush, I understand your point. If you see this WP Only a few are cited from inscriptions, most of them are well supported by Book citations ( I mean I have given book citations as secondary, I have provided more than 2-3 citations as backup). Please remember that those inscriptions are genuine and they are not manipulated or tricky.
Once can easily corelate the inscription to the actual Rajus WP content.
For E.g The inscription A.R No. 283 of 1924 (krishna dist)says """"States that a certain Brahmin Chavali Bhaskara  consecrated the image of Chagi-Ganapesvara and that king Chagi Manma endowed the temple with land.  Describes the Chagi family as of Kshatriya caste (bahujakula) and gives the donor‚Äôs genealogy.""""  > from this inscription We derive Chagi family as belonging to Kshatriya caste - There is only Chagi royal family in entire telugu society, i.e Chagis of Kshatriya Raju's who ruled Krishna dist, later they ruled Peddapuram kingdom also. There are several inscriptions/books/evidences about Rajus/Rajulu as they have been in ruling since 5th century right from Eastern Chalukyas, after medieval period certainly ther kingdoms started diminishing except one or two.
 one can see my contribution to this Rajus WP since three years, I have removed content which was puffery and added content which I was sure about and genuine with backing evidence. I can surely say this Rajus WP just reflects 40-50% of their glorious history. Whatever content I written/write I am sure Majoritarian Andhra historians will agree with me. I agree with you on the point that most of Indian caste make puffery out of nothing, For this I would suggest to Wiki Founders to induldge the Genuine Historians of respective region like Andhra Historical Research Society to be involved and review the caste/community specific WP.

Clearly, some have an emotional or economic interest in minimising or even denying the importance of these consumer-oriented blind tasting competitions: 

The Emperor Has No Clothes

The owners of 30 of  the best wines in the world, in the judgment of a Champagne company president, were invited to a party in 1997. The event was organized by Jean-Claude Rouzaud to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his presidency of Champagne Louis Roederer. Half of his selections were from France. """"I‚Äôm a chauvinist and a nationalist"""" he explained. 

""""Before agreeing to participate, the Bordeaux first growths set some conditions, the foremost being that no comparative tasting with their international competition would be held."""" They didn‚Äôt even want to be included in a group photo with their colleagues from other wine regions, although they finally reluctantly agreed.  """"But getting the Bordelais to have their wines served with the others', that was out of the question,"""" said a Roederer spokesperson.

So the event took place in two separate parts: first, a dinner featuring the Bordeaux wines; then a tasting the next day with all the other wines, but no Bordeaux. 

""""They are cowards,"""" said a non-Bordeaux producer.  But the host said  """"I understand them."""" He explained that  """"They feel that when you are first growths you are untouchable."""" Their problem is that they actually know better.

They and the other named growth vineyards have a carefully cultivated  image of  superiority. This is a marketing advantage worth an incredibly enormous sum of money every year. However, they frequently fail to perform well in blind comparisons and realize how vulnerable they are to exposure and the destruction of their vaulted  and very valuable reputations. 

Because of this the named growths  (1) want to avoid  comparisons  and (2) try to discredit  the results of such comparisons . Who can blame them? Those results can cost them a fortune in lost revenue. But the consumer benefits immensely.

Hi, my thinking has been that those stub tags do not necessarily imply nationality, and just sorting them into subcategories - The changed wording when moving into position tags (the decades just add a clause onto those) could be a problem, but the phrase """"English football forward"""" is a bit ambiguous in that sense. This seemed reasonable as the idea of a stub tag, as opposed to regular categories is not to categorise people, but to group them for interested editors, so if all we know about someone is that they played English football, that is the obvious place to stub-sort them. I certainly don't have a problem with the alternate wording you mention, although I notice it has been reverted for consistency on one of the pages linked. I would be happy to go through and change all of those if there is consensus for that wording.

In most cases I think I only changed the country in persondata when a person was in Cat:English footballers, but in this case (and probably some others), I saw country of birth and location of junior club and jumped the gun.

Alright, we've witnessed an administrative demonstration of power as with the """"protection"""" of the article; thanks Bundy, for your kind warning. Can we now constructively return to the matter in hand? After all, it is the task of all of us Wikipedians to see to it that articles contained in this Free Encyclopedia adhere to encyclopedical standards and not those of the yellow press, isn't it? 'Free' should not stand for 'free of correct facts', 'free of truth(fulness)' or for that matter 'free of ethical restraints'. One would think we all, at least those of good will among us, agree on that. Now it happens to be the case, if not by willful disruptive tendentious editing then by negligence, that in its current state the article Francesco Carotta is full of errors of all sorts and easily verifiably so, some of which were mentioned in the previous, now """"deleted"""" comment. Especially the section on the """"Dutch media controversy"""" is a complete distortion of the real events, for instance, the review of Peter Veldhuisen was not related at all to the activities and pronouncements of van Hooff. This section needs a thorough revision, or maybe the best thing to do would be to just delete it, since it does not provide any information on the theory and might be of interest only to the yellow press. Furthermore, we the Populares, the People's Front of Rome so to speak, hope that it is not considered a personal attack if we dare to ask the reputable user Rubenstein what exactly he thinks it is that qualifies him to act as the expert for and supervisor over this particular article. If User:Slrubenstein does not deem us worthy of an answer, as has been the case a few times on this page, maybe other editors or just readers could try to help us understand. In any case, we fail to see why Slrubenstein's arbitrary words and deeds should carry any special weight for the decent normal Wikipedians. We also don't understand why there seems to be so little opposition to what appears to be his self-arrogated authority.
So in closing we ask an unbiased and honest administrator‚Äîthere certainly must be one around here‚Äîto remove the editing protection from the article so that some much needed reasonable work can be done by knowledgeable and sincere editors. In order to prevent tedious unfruitful edit wars we suggest to discuss changes to the article on this talk page first. ‚Äî   """,0

 Edit request for Sophie Hunter page 

Hello! Can I ask a favor, please? Regarding Sophie Hunter's page, in her infobox J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone is listed as her """"maternal great-great-grandfather"""", if you double-check the source, Seely is actually only his """"maternal great-grandfather"""".

"""

 Self-aggrandizing POV? 
The phrase 'self-aggrandizing' has been removed several times for two reasons:
It's [[WP:POV|POV].
It's redundant, apparently because it's made clear by the rest of the article.
I'm not sure either of these reasons are valid.  What POV is the 'self-aggrandizing' phrase pushing?  It doesn't seem to be something either the GNAA's supporters or detractors would disagree with, making it unclear whether or not it's POV at all.  It seems to simply be an indisputable fact, evidenced by, among many other things, the article itself as well as the GNAA's website.  Also, if the statement is not POV, it can't be said to be inappropriately unbalancing the article by including the POV of one side and not the other; that the GNAA are a self-aggrandizing group is a simple fact.

Another reason given for the phrase's removal was that it was redundant.  That might be the case, but isn't redundancy not only acceptable, but desired in the first paragraph of an article, which is generally supposed to act as a summary?

I'm really not sure why this phrase is causing so much controversy.   """,0

""":Ali, as I've wrote, none of those authors are aware of many important details, such as Kurekchay Treaty - an official and legal treaty which defined the entry of Karabakh into Russian empire. At the same time, the khan of Sheki too signed a similar treaty, for example. I know Michael Croissant, and his book is full of mistakes and errors, his book doesn't mean much in this regard. His mistakes are too gross  the Russo-Iran war started in 1806, whilst Karabakh became part of Russia in 1805 before such a war. Meanwhile, Tim Potier is a good legal expert, and it is surprizing to see him write that. But everyone is entitled to errors and his was due to lack of resources - he was limited as a scholar in variety of materials and legal status of Karabakh in 19th century was not his objective  the 20th century was. Anyways, I do not know the khans of Iran in the south and which treaties they concluded with British. If they did it in the Zand period, they probably had full legal right at the time, since Iran was more of a geographic entity, than political. Same with Azerbaijan (North) - it was geographic too. Whilst I do not remember the legal documents and letters of the time, the later Russian and British documents clearly identified Azerbaijanis of the North as """"aderbeijani tatars"""" - I have evidence of that as far back as 1880 in British census estimates and in the 1897 official Russian Imperial Census. Same word is used by Russian ethnographer Velichko in his 1903 book. Azerbaijani author, Firudin bey Kocharly wrote a book in 1908 """"Literature of Azerbaijani Turks"""". 

Anyways, Azerbaijanis simultaneously fought against both Iran and Russia at the time, and some sided with either one side or another. Unfortunately, you won't find much on that in libraries - but just one such translated book would allow scholars to reconsider mistaken assumptions. What is more important however, is that Karabakh khan (khan being a Turkic term derived from kagan), was that it concluded its own treaty, that it minted its own money (one of the typical examples of independence), and fought several wars with Iran, some handily winning, others, like 1797, ambgiously  but still Shah Muhammed Qajar gets killed. And I don't know who told you about Vagif and Ibrahim  by the later you probably mean Ibrahim khan, right? Well, Vagif, the poet and vizier, was executed in 1797, AFTER shah's death, and was executed by the temporary ruler, Mamed bey Jevanshir, who was nephew of Ibrahim khan. While details are murky and contradictory, the Qajars didn't have the primary rolse in this  indeed, once shah was killed, Iranian troops withdrew, it screwed up all the plans to re-conquering other parts of Azerbaijan and Georgia. Meanwhile, Ibrahim khan lived and ruled the khanate until tragic error - or so it is explained  in 1806. But anyway, the Kurekchay Treaty was signed by him. Thus, once more, Karabakh khanate, for one, was totally independent, and Iran had no legitimate or otherwise claims whatsoever to it. Meanwhile, few other khanates were nominally dependent - like Poland was to USSR, or Armenia to Russia (Russian speaker of Parliament, #3 person in the country, openly called it """"forepost of Russia"""" whilst in Armenia).

  Lebanon: Catholic Villagers attack and vandalize Baptist Church
Posted on 29 August, 2006

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member‚Äôs rib and both men‚Äôs glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

‚ÄúPolice were at the church watching everything,‚Äù Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. ‚ÄúThey even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.‚Äù 

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with ‚Äúred wax‚Äù immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, ‚ÄúNo Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,‚Äù the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church‚Äôs right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were ‚Äúno followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,‚Äù and the ‚Äúdecrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.‚Äù 

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

‚ÄúThis is nonsense,‚Äù said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. ‚ÄúWe can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.‚Äù 

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, ‚Äúwe have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,‚Äù Sahyouni told Compass. ‚ÄúWe do not need to get permission.‚Äù 

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop‚Äôs biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?‚Äù the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other‚Äôs members. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.‚Äù

I've expanded the article in general and corrected some of the English, namely some literal translations and """"false friends"""".

The correct translation from the Galician universalista / universalismo when speaking about politics is """"internationalist / internationalism"""", and so on.

Also, I have serious doubts about what's said in reference to the translations of his works... Only a handful of his short stories are translated into English as far as I know, and I don't think there's many translations around in other languages.

Answer: Thank you. - The allegiance that I corrected it to was the 'British Empire', not the UK. The """"Allegiance"""" category in this section applies to Currie's military career, which his WW1 service was the centerpiece of. That conflict was a clash between the British Empire & the German Empire, not Canada vs Germany. Canada declared war on the German Empire in 1914 as a integral part of the British Empire which was threatened as a whole, not as an independent country in isolation. Currie in 1914 would have regarded himself as defending the British Empire, not Canada in isolation, which was under no individual threat from Germany in the least. 

I understand the enthusiasm for Canadian patriotism, but it doesn't really make historical sense to use allegiance to Canada in this context, & it's a mistake to take contemporary sentiments & backdate them onto the past like this, where sentiment was different in these matters.

It would make sense to put military allegiance to the British Empire with that symbol for Currie's martial career, & the Canuck Red Ensign  (great flag, which should be re-introduced today imo, by the way) next to his nationality or birthplace, but putting military allegiance to Canada in the context of WW1 doesn't make contemporary historical sense?

Thanks Nadiatalent, your comments are helpful and I've made another try at the Social issues text below, adding in new references for the first paragraph and placing the reference for Indonesia at the end of the second paragraph (an oversight on my part before). In this second try I have also made some changes to the wording of the first paragraph so that it is accurate to the references.

The new references for the first paragraph are studies on Malaysia and Indonesia. I'll provide quotes here so that you can see what they say about palm oil production's social impact:

1. Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of Palm Oil Production: 
""""The data showed generally positive financial and socio-economic consequences of oil palm adoption in the immediate surroundings of oil palm estates.""""
""""In terms of industry and economic opportunities, OPCs [oil palm communities] feature more wood-based industries, and a higher numbers of shops, minimarkets and hotels.""""

2, The local impacts of oil palm expansion in Malaysia: 
""""According to respondents, the primary reasons for shifting from traditional livelihood activities to oil palm cultivation were higher returns for oil palm due to perceived high prices (43.3%) and perceived ease of managing oil palm plantations (30%).""""
""""Generally, oil palm has brought positive impacts, such as increased income, secure employment, and improved access to social services. However, involvement in oil palm has also caused many local communities to move away from traditional practices.""""
See also the table of results on page 11 which lists """"Increased income"""", """"More steady or reliable income"""", """"Education"""", """"Better access to transport services"""", """"Health facilities"""", """"Accommodation"""" as survey respondents' perceived benefits of palm oil production.

For the point about landholders being able to participate in the cash economy, I think the existing reference works. Here is the quote:

""""...the authority has set up a number of joint ventures with NCR [native customary rights] landholders. Under these agreements, local title-holders are paid a dividend, ensuring that part of the profits flow back into the community.""""

Oil palm is a valuable economic crop and provides a source of employment. It allows small landholders to participate in the cash economy and often results in improvements to local infrastructure and greater access to services such as schools and health facilities. In some areas, the cultivation of oil palm has replaced traditional practices, often due to the higher income potential of palm oil.

However, in some cases, land has been developed by oil palm plantations without consultation or compensation of the indigenous people occupying the land. This has occurred in Papua New Guinea, Colombia, and Indonesia. In the Sarawak state of Malaysian Borneo, there has been debate over whether there was an appropriate level of consultation with the Long Teran Kanan community prior to the develo",0

I'll say this, as one of the very few truly experienced patrollers; most patrollers are not particularly good, and copyvios in particular can take considerable skill to pick out.

"People need to seriously stop calling what goes on at this talk page the forming of 'consensus'. This lastest round included, it is at best just a series of long and rambling discussions involing the 'regulars' making and repeating ad nauseum the same largely POV points, and which always bizarrely seems to end in a vote or other exercise in 1-member-1-voice form of accounting. There's not a single thing about that process which is encouraged on Wikipedia if the goal is to actually form WP:CONSENSUS. The fact that as ever the process has not a single element of independent review or summarisation, and has been as ever completely lite on policy, guideline or reference to common good practice on other peer reviewed articles, only underscores that. And right to the end we still bizarrely had claims that keeping the footnote was acceptable, due to the rather obvious fact that these unproductive rambling sessions more often than not end up with no discernable support for doing anything, so leaving the article in a state in which it could never become Featured because it's such a giant policy violating crap bag, somehow turns out to be the 'consensus'. It cannot be so, by definition. The current version still has major issues, but at least they are now out in the open in plain text, and can at some point be addressed cluefully and independently and without tedious claims that it is the 'consensus' version that can be repeatedly edit warred over to maintain. It's not, and thus it cannot.",0

The instructions for nominating it are at Template talk:Did you know.  Basically, all you need to do is take this code if you created a new article:
{{subst:NewDYKnom| article= | hook=... that ? | status=new | author=  }}
or this code if you expanded it
{{subst:NewDYKnom| article= | hook=... that ? | status=expanded | author= }}
and write the hook, a concise and interesting bit of info from the article beginning with """"... that"""" and ending with a question mark.  The info from the hook has to be present in the article and supported (in the article) with a citation.  Someone will double-check to make sure the source says what it's claimed to say.

Once you've come up with a hook, fill in your username as the author and fill the title of the article, then add the above code, including your hook following the """"hook="""" part, to the top of the appropriate section for the day the article was started on the DYK template talk page.  The code will produce an entry formatted like the others.  After that, just keep an eye on the entry; if anyone brings up an issue with it, try to address it.  I'll keep an eye out as well.  If everything goes well, it will appear on the Main Page for several hours a few days from now.

While words like """"allegedly"""" should be avoided, it is even worse to word a proposition by """"it is"""". Instead, you should write like """"Who-and-who suggested that..."""". yck C. 

Dorvaq, thank you for the pointer, where I see """"Newspapers, for instance, almost universally refer to any indicted but unconvicted criminal as an alleged criminal.""""  Agreed; I use 'alleged' whenever writing about someone where crimes have been charged but not yet proven in a court of law.  Perhaps what I'm trying to ask is more of a common-sense question to which the answer is so obvious that no one has thought to incorporate it in a policy or guideline here.  Trying again, """"Once an accused criminal is convicted in a court of law, is it not both inappropriate and biased to insist on using the word 'alleged' when writing about the charges of which he's been convicted?""""  Maybe someone has a pointer to an old discussion or arbitration about this?  It seems that it must have come up in the past.   
I'm pretty sure there is no discussion involving the generic use of """"allege"""" (or any derivative thereof) specific to before-and-after trials.  However, there has been many discussions of this sort on individual article pages involving criminals. But, most of these discussions have been initiated by either anonymous users or users who contribute very little to Wikipedia besides the article in question.  Perhaps your best bet would to start there unless someone else can provide you with something more informative.

Anyhow, I don't believe this needs to be incorporated into policy/guideline beyond how the word has already been treated.  In terms of law, to allege is to present without proof or without first proving.  Therefore, to state the convicted crime of an offender as an allegation is inherently contradictory. Wikipedia is dedicated to quality and integrity ‚Äî anything contradictory fails on those two points, but that's my opinion. ‚Äî  (talk) 

Ah, that last paragraph hits the nail on the head, thanks.  Nothing like logic to prove a point.  I came upon the Megan Kanka article by chance and I remember the case quite well.  It really irked me, after removing all the 'allegeds' and cleaning up the article, to find an old entry on the Talk page stating """"He argues that he was wrongfully convicted; if he admitted to the allegations, they wouldn't be alleged, but he hasn't, so therefore they're 'alleged,' and he's the 'alleged killer.'""""

The """"Se"""" in """"Sesotho"""" does not mean """"language."""" It is a noun class marker which is an inalienable part of the morphology of the word. That's simply the way the word looks.

For example, """"education"""" is derived from """"educate"""" through a change in morphology. The change implies that the word is a noun, but it is not valid to simply use the root without the suffix.

""""-sotho"""" is a root, which is made meaningful with class markers (Sesotho, Basotho, Lesotho, etc).

The """"Se-"""" marker in this case does indicate language, but the class has many other types of nouns.

 comment ter vs tre 
Hi, Loved your essay.  I have had some thoughts in this direction my self.  My goal was not only to unify English spelling, but to make it more consistent and easier. I like the ideas you have here as beginning that.  

I do have one thing I'd like to comment on: ter vs tre.   As in center vs centre.  Everytime I see tre I want to pronounce the """"lettres"""" in the order they appear. -)  As used in outr√©.  So I end up with sen-tray for centre and sen-ter for center.  I agree it would be better to have just one unified way to spell the """"r"""" sound. 
I understand your point about etymology, but I'm seeing eventual confusion of people over centres and lettres, bettres, wettres (letters, betters, wetters ). There are many more words that end in er in Commonwealth English, (CE) than ones that end in """"re"""".  Its a smaller change to have all words with the """"r"""" sound at the end in """"er"""" form, then changing them all to  the """"re"""" form.  This reflects the idea that simpler, more internally consistent spelling is best, and it still provides a path to the Unified spelling that is your goal.   

P.S - have you seen Mark Twain's ideas for fixing English Spelling?  http://web.archive.org/web/20030629161605/http://users.telerama.com/~joseph/simple.html. Funny and True!""",0

OK, I just tried to merge Cloud telephony into Web-based VoIP, and it did not work.  The reason is that the intros in both of those articles did not correctly define the concepts.  
 Cloud telephony is a subset of Cloud communications; it means third-party, off-site VoIP services in general.  This includes both web-based and non-web-based VoIP (it could just integrate with conventional telephones as a PBX replacement).
 Web-based VoIP simply uses a web page running a multimedia applet or whatever instead of dedicated non-web VoIP software

I propose merging Cloud telephony into Cloud communications instead; they are both very short and weak and there is substantial overlap.  I tagged both of those articles.

There is no section in Voice over IP into which to merge Web-based VoIP, since it defines a class of client software; though I did add an awkward link from the """"Protocols"""" section.  Clients are described at Comparison of VoIP software.  Web-based software is included there but not necessarily marked as such.  That's another potential merge target, but I don't have any problem leaving web-based VoIP as its own article for a while and letting it grow.  It may be handy to just be able to link there from several other articles. I removed the merge tag from Web-based VoIP for now, but feel free to rekindle the debate if you see fit.    """,0

On Makemi‚Äôs previous comment
Makemi said """"I'm not clear on how this is revolutionary, it seems like a bigger/faster/louder computer piano.""""

I deleted the remark on the CEUS being a milestone. I even deleted anything that could be judged as being a praise. Despite the fact that even the praises I made were based on facts, on the quest that has been going on for more than two decades by makers of reproducing pianos to try to produce a reproducing piano that would truly record and playback the full gamut of expressiveness of the best performers at the piano.

So here is the current article that I have, incorporating the recent change I made, following Makemi‚Äôs feedback. Any praise of any kind has been deleted by me (even though my praises were based on facts, on knowledge).

The New (2006) B√∂sendorfer Reproducing Grand Piano: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano
Pianos That Has For goal of Accomplishing Full Expressiveness at the Keyboard==
During the past recent decades, a reproducing piano (also sometimes called a computer piano or a player piano) has been defined as being first an acoustic piano that is not diminished in any way in its ability to play piano pieces. The touch at the keyboard and the sound produced by a reproducing piano is not changed in any way compared to a normal acoustic piano. However, a reproducing piano has an unobtrusive computer interface that allows the pianist to record and playback the piano pieces that are performed on it. Usually, it also has a silent mechanism that stops the hammers from striking the strings and that allows the pianist to play silently at the keyboard, at any time during the day or the night without disturbing others, and with the option of using headphones to hear digital sounds while playing silently at the keyboard (many digital sounds are available: piano, harpsichord, organ, strings, etc.). It also has a MIDI interface that allows the pianist to play back many pieces that are available on this particular MIDI format. However, the MIDI format allows the recording and playback of the velocity of the hammers of the piano only at a level of accuracy of 127 scales (or 127 steps if you prefer). The problem is that several pianistic techniques move the hammers at an incredibly high speed, making these 127 scales highly insufficient to be able to record and playback accurately the very high velocity of the hammers. The capability of a reproducing piano to convey the full expressiveness of the pianist at the keyboard is directly related to its ability to record and playback accurately the velocity of the hammers that are moved when the pianist presses the keys at the keyboard. Consequently, a reproducing piano usually also has a more accurate proprietary format to record and playback piano pieces at a much higher level of accuracy than the MIDI format. In summary, a reproducing piano is a very flexible musical instrument that combines the old (an acoustic piano) with the new (a MIDI format but especially the recording and playing back of the piano) at the same time. It allows the pianist to play the numerous MIDI piano pieces available but, more importantly, to record and playback piano pieces at a higher level of accuracy than it is possible to do with the MIDI format.

The quality of the B√∂sendorfer pianos and especially the sound that they produce are the result of a long and old tradition of piano making.

B√∂sendorfer also kept in touch with modernity. They took an active participation at making reproducing pianos first with their SE 290 computer piano that was made in collaboration with Wayne Stahnke. It was considered by the entire community of piano makers to be the most accurate reproducing piano of its time.
At the beginning of 2006, B√∂sendorfer introduced its next generation of reproducing pianos: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano.

Previously to the B√∂sendorfer CEUS Computer Grand Piano, several scientific studies were made that had for main goal to assess if the reproducing pianos that were available were as faithful to the expressiveness of the best performers at the piano as they should be. These studies concluded that the best reproducing pianos (including the SE 290 computer piano) were not as faithful at recording and playing back the performance of the best pianists as they should have been (see in particular """"Measurement and reproduction accuracy of computer-controlled grand pianos"""" by Werner Goebl, et al., August 6-9, 2003).

Taking this conclusion as an incentive to raise the accuracy of its reproducing piano (the SE 290 computer piano), B√∂sendorfer set themselves to create an even more accurate reproducing piano that would accomplish THE VERY CHALLENGING GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO RECORD AND PLAYBACK THE FULL GAMUT OF EXPRESSIVENE",0

Some early books I have found on Google Books refer to is as Reform Judaism; I am always corrected about this.

I fail to see the difference between simply making a page titled """"Religion of Monotheism"""" which includes Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Reformed Judaism, Conservative Judaism etc...

 anti-Greek collusion occuring? 

I am new to Wikipedia. I've only been here a few days and I already get a strong sense of anti-Macedonian bias. (for the record when I say Macedonian... I'm talking about the ones that identify with Greece)

I've already been threatened with banning and named called on more than one occasion for simply discussing facts on Macedonia. At this point I am loathe to name more names but it always appears to be the same set of people working together as a team. (I'm sure you know who some of them are) 

Anyhow... I have an interesting image that I think this is very relevant to the naming dispute article but I don't know how to upload it. Perhaps you could arrange it? (they should be allowable under fair use) I think the second one down """"Solun will be the capital of Macedonia again""""... perfectly illustrates Greek claims of FYROM irredentist behavior and would be an excellent example to add to the naming dispute page.

http://history-of-macedonia.com/wordpress/category/fyrom-news/

A secondary issue that bothers me is the Wikipedia page entitled """"ethnic Macedonians"""" related to FYROM (as if to say that Macedonians are now non-ethnic.) This of course is really offensive to Macedonians but the FYROM page is locked. I think the best approach around this lockout dismissing the human rights of 2.5 million ethnic Macedonians... it to make a new page called ethnic Macedonians (Greek)... which describes the rich history of the Macedonian identity... from ancient Macedon... to Byzantium... to integration with the new Greek state.... to distinct Pan=Macedonian foreign diasporas dating back decades. Many people only know Macedonians from Alexanders time... I think a page showing the long history of Greek speaking people calling themselves Macedonians would make it much clearer to readers why Macedonians are so sensitive to this name issue.

The article states that only one Libero player is allowed per team.  However, Beginning in 2008 for FIVB competitions, and beginning in the 2011-2012 for USAV competitions, two liberos are allowed per team, although only one may play at a time.  In fact, FIVB rules _require_ two liberos to be designated if a team has more than 12 players on the roster.

FIVB refernce:  http://www.fivb.ch/thegame/TheGame_VolleyballRules.htm
USAV reference: http://usavolleyball.org/news/2011/03/09/usav-rules-commission-meeting-highlights/41322

The article also states that the rule allowing Liberos to serve has trickled down to juniors competitions.  That is not entirely true.  USAV rules do not allow Liberos to serve in any sanctioned event, although AAU Volleyball does allow Liberos to serve.  Many USAV regions allow Liberos to serve in events that do not serve as USAV National qualifiers.

Myself and another editor are having a drive on Sussex stubs by merging one line village articles into a larger parish based article, based on guidelines at WikiProject UK geography. This means that the Laughton article is about the wider ranging Parish of Laughton and not just Laughton village. To emphasise that, I used Laughton Civil Parish as the official name.

 imho, activity diagrams are one of the diagrams provided by the UML which is an OMG standard, not related to Utrecht university definition, though it may seem similar on the surface. But there are many variants of these diagrams (e.g. workflow diagrams, workflow nets and even some dialects of Business process modeling are graphically similar) the definition given here is not 'activity diagrams' which is sort of a reserved keyword for the definition of OMG. So, moving the text to Process-data diagram seems a very good idea and would satisfy me fully. Or even leaving it where it is in metadata modeling if that is the term they use to refer to this kind of models, and removing the redundant text from metamodeling page as I initially suggested (hmm, took out my hatchet and did it!). I think what went wrong is the interpretation of the discussion at the top of this discussion page: people were complaining that metamodeling page was polluted by Utrecht definition of the term, and that by 'squatting' the term, some information on the more generally accepted definition of the term ended up on this [metamodeling technique] page. But I think the more generally useful info was extracted from that page already. The merge was suggested as a way of providing an example """"provided it is very clear this is not the definition of metamodeling"""".

Hi Umeboshi! Thanks, but I think I'm just going to let this topic go, as far as Wikipedia is concerned. It is too stressful to do battle with some of these characters, and I don't really know my way around the various political systems.

"""My meaning of """"physically real"""" is that for the rotating observer the centrifugal force is placed on the force side of Newton's law of motion and treated like a real force. That means it behaves like a vector, adds vectorially to other forces, and should the rotating observer switch origins or orientation of his coordinate system, the centrifugal force transforms like a vector.

JJ98, I have to ask again why you think it is necessary to create a talk page for EVERY SINGLE redirect

Needlessly adding wikiproject banners to talk pages, for redirects that are unlikely to become articles or be discussed separately, serves no purpose other than to clutter up project search lists and quality logs.

While I applaud your intentions, please consider redirecting these pages to the appropriate talk pages instead, especially for links that are just multiple variations in spelling.",0
"As the dog returneth to his own vomit... .

Brief history: On my return from holiday, last week, I discovered that another editor,  had posted a  which criticises my conduct and alleges that I am part of a concert-party aimed at articles substantially edited by him. During May 26h., I tried to add comments to the page and then had a discussion with him, above, which closed the matter between us.The following day, I posted links on the Talk pages of the other alleged conspirators, one of whom is . The entire correspondence with him reads as follows:

==Discussion involving you==You might be interested in the discussion on my 'Talk Page', here, which indirectly involves you. It is disappointing that the author has not notified you himself.  (talk) Seen all that. Out of context, of course, in every sense. In addition its dredged up from some time back when we were all wrapped over the knuckles then. It seems he wants people perpetually punished for not agreeing with him or for voting on the same pages. I'd hate to list all the AfD and other pages he and Vintagekits collaborate on. But thats all right. Regards,  :Yes; the image of a dog licking its own balls comes to mind. (talk) 

The metaphor is supposed to represent a self-indulgent act which gives great pleasure to the participant but which others view as embarrassing and repulsive.

The next thing I know is that some random Admin has popped up, blocked me, and disappeared again, reappearing on the Administrator's Noticeboard waving my scalp around. The diff link on the Noticeboard refers to the last post only, and a number of commentators on the Noticeboard immediately agree with the view that it is a WP:NPA.

I pause here to point out that either the Admin herself, or I (before I was blocked), could have blanked the comment, perhaps with a warning on this Talk page. I would have been perfectly happy to have done so myself, because I like to think of myself as reasonable and because the post was not intended as an attack; had I wished to criticise  I would have done so on my own Talk page discussion with him. (As it is,  had the sense to blank the discussion in any case.)

Anyway, that said, I reply as follows to those who have posted comments here:

' I hope that I have demonstrated that we're at cross-purposes. Frankly, however, you've made no attempt to engage with either myself or  or to resolve the dispute between us. You might just as well have blocked one of us at random.

' Thank you for yours. You're the dog's bollocks!

' Point taken, for what it's worth (I had initially understood 's complaint to be with the vulgarity of the metaphor rather than her seeing it as an attack). !vote discussions increasingly resemble a mass outbreak of Tourette's syndrome.

' Thank you for yours. I note you seem to have had rather an unpleasant discussion with  yourself on the subject, and I should like to thank you for your interest and understanding. I have also had a look at your User page, which I found very interesting and would like to comment further on your Talk page in due course. To answer your point, I did see how to request an unblock, but as the block was only for 24 hours, and the ground had anyway been cut from under my feet by 's posting on the Administrator's Noticeboard which had garnered approval for the block. I also dislike complaining to Admins about other people's behaviour; it just seems a bit wet to me (and I don't do it myself).

'''' Firstly; thank you for the link, which I would otherwise have missed. Secondly, an apology for this post of mine (on the Administrator's Noticeboard): Giano - Sympathy is limited. The contentious nature of the page in question was twice pointed out to you by me and I also requested that you calm down; there's no need to post the same thoughts across 3 different forums.

Years ago I was on one of those old ships (USS Rankin (AKA-103)). I wrote an article about her, then branched into other similar ships, plus ships built at the same place as she was. I finished that project, and haven't done any more, but there are many of them waiting to be done. The basic material is at DANFS, so you can do an article fairly quickly. There's a LOT of Wikification to be done on them, as well as polishing up the DANFS language. Plus you learn about history and exotic locations.

"I agree with Travellingcari. The tags serve a useful purpose, even after the article is brought to AfD, and especially so when they have been on the article for a significant length of time. They make it clear to visiting editors that any interested parties have had a fair chance to improve the article, and hadn't, which is often a point used in support of deletion. Conversely, if the article isn't tagged, it's not clear that interested parties have been given a chance to improve the article, which may be used to support a keep argument. Removing the tag makes the status either way less clear. Yes, it's available in the history, but why make editors go through the extra work of checking the history? In addition, an AfD can end without reaching a consensus, which means the tag most likely still applies and would have to be restored. No, the time to remove the tag is after a consensus has been reached at the AfD that the subject does meet the notability guidelines, i.e. after it is closed with result keep (or in some cases, when the eventual outcome is clear per WP:SNOW).
