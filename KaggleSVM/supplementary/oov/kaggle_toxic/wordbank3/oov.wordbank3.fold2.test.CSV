"That's a difficult question.  I think a lot of it is a matter of just doing it on a day-to-day basis in every discussion we have on WP, whether on an article talk page, a deletion discussion, or at VP.  Maybe there could be a guideline (or even just an essay) urging people not to rely on rote policy citation regurgitation in lieu of substantive explanation (maybe there already is one somewhere?).  And reminding people that citing policy is at best only half the work: you may have settled on what you think governs the issue, but you still need to convince others of the best way to apply it in a particular circumstance.  To do it properly the focus should always be on what the best editorial decision is, not just the superficial level of what complies with codified policy or guidelines.  Yeah, all that should be written down somewhere if it isn't already.  In another guideline for people to cite.  ; )

I think also we could go policy by policy, guideline by guideline, and ask ourselves whether its purpose is clear.  What does it substantively accomplish.  That may not always be evident; it may reflect the way consensus tends to go without an articulate reason as to why.  A history of how the policy was written could be interesting, but maybe not that helpful, and it would be difficult to summarize.  Just looking at the edit history of a particular policy or guideline may omit a lot of developmental discussions that occurred on the talk pages of other policies, the Village pump, or even user talk pages.

"Then the ban will probably have to be made permanent.  Your decision, admins. 

I had a sick feeling it would come to this.  It always seems to, in this day and age.

This will probably be declared my last wiki-edit by the administrators (and that's even if I'm allowed to put this on my Talk page), for I am compelled to believe that the administrators of Wikipedia will have to extend my ban permanently, not as a function of a Wikibreak, but as a function that I cannot exercise “good faith” in a consensus which does not care whether the information is accurate, verifiable, or even true.

In fact, given the current state of Wikipedia, it is no longer sufficient nor even necessary to act in “good faith” and provide verifiable information.  What is sufficient, and the only thing necessary, is to provide information the collective will accept as verified – note that I did not say “verifiable”.  If the garbage I have to put up with like on almost every meaningful edit I've made in the last eight weeks is true, the collective has already spoken and I have no place on Wikipedia whatsoever, especially because I believe that the consensus is not only wrong, but either flagrantly mis-informed or down-right stupid.

This stands in violation of basically all five pillars of Wikipedia.

First, Wikipedia is NOT an encyclopedia as long as the general public is allowed to edit it, but only in the form in which a collective will accept.

I will give a good example of this in the first real problem I ran in to about 6-8 weeks ago:

BCS National Championship Game.  I tried a number of edits to properly represent the BCS' nullification of the participation of USC in two illegal Championship Games, and removing their designation, since the games no longer are believed to have taken place.  http://www.bcsfootball.org/news/story?id=6632189   An edit war began on that subject, and the subject of Wikipedia's rules regarding “no damnatio memoriae came up.  I proposed, and repeatedly, that the concept of damnatio memoriae applied, since that was the exact penalty imposed by the BCS when they nullified the entire participation of USC in the 2005 Orange Bowl and 2006 Rose Bowl (pages (along with USC's entire 2005 season, nullified by the NCAA beforehand) I would've deleted eight weeks ago under encyclopedic verification, but we now have a conflict between damnatio memoriae and encyclopedic verification).

AND, since Wikipedia does not respect the BCS as a sanctioning body (trying to remain neutral – I'll get to that in a moment in part two!), Wikipedia accepts as valid USC's 14 vacated victories, including in a BCS National Championship Game which no longer logistically should exist.  Hence, Wikipedia  recognizes (in the form that they won the 2005 Orange Bowl) USC as the BCS National Champion – if Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and their participation in the 2006 Rose Bowl, which was also nullified by the BCS.

Ergo, we now have a non-encyclopedic, non-verifiable situation which is, in fact, false!  Only the sanctioning body can give sanction to the event, and only the sanctioning body can take it away.  (Remember this one for later, as well!)  I had respected the decision of “no damnatio memoriae, but can do so no longer, because of the fact that it creates an encyclopedic falsehood!

And because the collective accepts “no damnatio memoriae, even in cases where it applies, we now have to change one of the hardest and fastest rules on Wikipedia, on every editing page.

Encyclopedic content must only be considered verified by the collective.  That is all, and also that is the only acceptable basis for content on Wikipedia – actual encyclopedic verification is no longer sufficient nor necessary.  Anything short of that will be removed by the collective.

If I am reinstated, I am considering removal of all mentions of vacated participation in games.  That means the 2005 Orange and 2006 Rose Bowls go, as does their mentions in BCS National Championship Game, as well as USC's entire 2005 season page, replaced with notations of the nullifications.  Any other games where the participation of one or both schools are removed also go as well.  (As one example, the 2011 Sugar Bowl may also be deleted, if the NCAA or BCS nullifies specifically Ohio State's participation in the event.)

That dovetails nicely into debunking pillar number two:

If the collective is the sole basis for acceptability on Wikipedia, then Wikipedia cannot be neutral.  In fact, when the collective is mis-informed and prejudicial, on top of being inaccurate, this redoubles that, since the collective enforces the rules, Wikipedia is not at all neutral, but written with the biases of the collective in mind.

800-1169/1200?
New subheading:Upon a reminder from Fergananim on this question, as raised by him and enthusiastically supported by Scolaire, I said I'd elaborate a bit here. Looking though the discussion again I see I have already (tried to) say something about it.... Anyway, I think we should follow the now established historiographical division of of 800-1169. To amend problems the limitations from such a division I'm thinking the we should to the following
Add a couple of sentences, either in the lead or in the historiography section, explaining why this division is somewhat problematic. (Mind, any division that gets established is problematic, for the same reasons)
Have a solid background-section to draw the lines from before 800 into our period. I've slready started that, but it might be expanded.
Have a solid """"whatever-the-opposite-of-background-is-called-in-English""""-section drawing lines from our period into the future, so to speak.
Don't treat 1169 as limit written in stone, despite being in the title. The second synod of Cashel should be discussed here (despite being in 1172), the career of Rory O'Connor after the invasion should be included, etc etc.
It's not like I'm married to 1169 though, but maybe we could wait drawing a conclusion on this until I've gotten around to write something (except church history) about Ireland after 1050...

"There are many inaccurate statements being posted here. Far too many, i don't have time to correct all of them. The BNP was modernised by Nick Griffin and has no links to Holocaust denial or Nazism. Digging up 20 or 30 year old quotes is irrelevant. You can do that for all parties as many change their ideology. The modern Labour party are not the traditional Labour party, just how the Conservative party are no longer traditional Conservative Tories. During the heydey of the British Empire the Conservatives were pro-imperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries, do you think the modern conservatives under Cameron support that? Another example: The Green Party in UK used to strongly oppose drugs, yet now they support drug-use and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession, trade and cultivation of cannabis. So they went from being anti-drug to pro-drug. The modern BNP has no links to Holocaust denial. Secondly, the comment about Nick Griffin and the RAF bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by anti-BNPer's. What Nick actually said is that the RAF should not have bombed German innocents (children and woman) as many were murdered in the Bombing of Dresden. Likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent British civilians by the Nazis. Also the last claim modern BNP members sieg heil, i presume was a comical claim. It has no basis in fact. BNP are strongly against Nazism and Fascism. If you want a real fascist organisation that would be the UAF (Unite against Freedom), who attack BNP members with clawhammers and other weapons etc. Is that democratic?

 """"JFK:First Day Evidence"""" 

I looked for information on a book called """"First Day Evidence"""" written by Gary Savage.   Several book reviews noted the following

Mr. Savage is the nephew of a retired member of  Dallas police crime lab who  processed much of the evidence gathered the day of the JFK assassination, Nov. 22, 1963.  Savage located a number of documents and photographs, previously not published that were in official Dallas police files or the personal files of retired police officers.  """"JFK:First Day Evidence"""" consists of those documents and photographs with commentary on the investigative activities of the Dallas police on the day of and shortly after the assassination.

 Once again, you are proving that you lack the ability to understand. If you had payed attention, you would have had realised that I actually removed that paragraph, because their Turkic origin is NOT disputed in mainstream sources. 
 I think that 90% of the people are not interested in their ethnic background, and especially not in their Turkic ethnic background, because they did not rule in the name of Turks, not had they any influence or some other kind of nationalst involvement in the history of the Turkic peoples. Not even Encyclopaedia Britannica (your favourite source) mentions their ethnic background: . 
 What's important is that the dynasty was started by a former slave, and that it rose out of the chaos that followed Seljuqid decline in Central Asia. It's absolutely unimportant whether Anushtigin was a Turk, a Mongol, a Chinese, or a Brazilian, because his descendants ruled as the """"Shahs of Khorezm"""" and not as the """"Turkic rulers of Turkistan"""". If someone is interested in Anushtigin's background, he can click on the link. The dynasty was certainly not """"Turkic"""", as you claim (and this is indeed bad faith), but only the dynasty's founder was (most likely) of Qipchaq origin. 
 In the article Mughals we agreed not to mention any ethnic lables, because the Mongolian origin of the dynasy's founder has no importance - the Mughals came from a Mongol background, but they were not Mongol rulers (in contrast to their Gengghizid ancestors). 
 I do not dispute authoritative sources, such as Iranica, who describe Anushtigin as a Turk. That'S why I have modified the Anush Tigin Gharchai article. But I do dispute POV claims that try to """"Turkify"""" a dynasty that was neither Turkic in language, nor in culture or identity.  """,0

Er let me see:
Prose vs lists: Perhaps Prose is better than just plain lists (although some people seem to like and want lists, there are loads of """"list of...."""" articles, which show the demand for it).  The nature of this particular article does tend towards bullet points: people usually want to make several points about the same subject, list several authors etc, and this is difficult to do coherently using prose.  The idea of bullet points was invented to overcome this very problem, and is becoming more common in modern prose.  (the only disadvantage is that it is worse if you read it aloud).  I have tried to plain lists, so for example I added a couple of lines (usually taken from their own Wikipedia pages) for some of the critics or responders whose only appeared as names.

The problem with reliable sources. I am only copying in the pre-existing references.  But the real problem is that there is no definition of reliable, and being reliable is not quite the same as important.  If Gerry Falwell or Osama Bin Laden make a statement about Islam those statements becomes important because of wha made it, not necessarily because it has any acedemic validity.

Balance of critiques and responses. Again I have only restructured what was there. The restructuring may make any lack of balance more obvious, and show where further work needs to be done.

Section on Islam and War. Sperry's section on Islam and War was in before the restructure, I didn't notice the fight about it. I'm going to stand back from this one. If anyone else wants to restart this debate, please do so.

"Heleen Mees (born Heleen Nijkamp, 1968, Hengelo)[1] is a Dutch opinion writer, economist and lawyer. She has been credited as being a third wave feminist.[3]

Biography
Mees graduated in Economy and Law at University of Groningen. From 1992 to 1998, Mees worked for the Dutch Treasury in The Hague. From 1998 to 2000 Mees worked as a national expert for the European Commission in Brussels.[5] In 2000 she emigrated to the USA, where she changed her surname to Mees.[6] Mees lives in Brooklyn, New York.[2]

Mees' breakthrough as an opinion writer in the Netherlands came in 2006 when she wrote The time is long overdue that women should go to work.[8] That same year, she co-founded Women on Top, an organization that until 2011 advocated more women in top jobs.[9] 

From 2006 to 2010 Mees wrote a bi-weekly column in NRC Handelsblad, and from 2012 to 2013 for Het Financieele Dagblad. Her work has been published in the Financial Times, Foreign Policy and other international newspapers. Currently she is a columnist for Project Syndicate[11] and the German magazine Capital. Mees is the author of three books. 

In August 2012, Mees completed a doctoral thesis at the Erasmus School of Economics, focusing on the effect of China's economy on the emergence of the 2008 global financial crisis.[13] While completing her research, she worked as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Tilburg University.[14] From September 2012 until July 2013, Mees was employed as an Adjunct Associate Professor of Public Administration at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.[15]

In July 2013, Mees was arrested in New York on charges of stalking her former lover, the chief economist of Citigroup, Willem Buiter.[16] In March 2014, the court decided that the case against Mees was to be dismissed in one year provided that she complies with two conditions.[17]",0
"Futile==
The Liberal Democrats do not have a hope in NW Hants even if they have a good candidate. In this constituency unemployment is very low, and home ownership is high, all of which helps Labour and the Conservatives who were the top two parties in the constituency in 2001, both exhibiting positive swings while the Lib Dems lost votes. This is an obvious Tory hold. Nevertheless, good luck Mr Tod. Maybe you'll get to fight for a different constituency in 2010, but by that time the Lib Dems will probably have changed their views on almost everything anyway.

For very well-known celebrities, the US government archives may have something: a Google image search on """"site:.gov"""" may bring something up.  Also, the search engine on the Archives website (http://www.archives.gov/) may find things that Google doesn't.  For people with military service, the military might have something (Google search on """"site:.mil"""").

For celebrities that were well-known before 1950, there may be newspaper photographs that have fallen out of copyright.  These will be hard to find, but the Library of Congress (http://www.loc.gov/) may have something.

A further option is to contact the celebrity's agent or estate and ask for an image to be released under GFDL, Creative Commons attribution, or Creative Commons sharealike-attribution licenses.

In my opinion, if free-use images can't be found, the second-best choice is a promotional photo: it's an image that is intended to be distributed widely.  Of course, there are exceptions: for albums, singles, and DVDs, a low-resolution scan of the cover is always appropriate.  For movies, a still from a well-known scene or a low-resolution scan of a promotional poster is good.  Failing all else, other fair-use images can be used, but they need to be tagged, justified, have the source/copyright owner credited, and used very sparingly.

As for the images at Iron Maiden, I'm still trying to figure out how strict I should be about fair-use images: all the images there are directly related to the subject of the article (except Image:PrisonerNovel.jpg, which I've just removed), all of them have some semblance of a source indicated, all of them have some semblance of a fair-use justification, and none of them seem to be surplus to the needs of the article.

Propaganda and logical fallacies are not a reasonable method of influencing people, especially if you are claiming to represent God and be a Christian, so why do you continue with them and your specious reasoning? All the points in your reply can easily be refuted. You said above: """"If text in one place is inappropriate or excessive . . ."""" You have totally failed to prove the premise of your argument, but you then presumptuously assume that everyone will just blindly accept your wanted opinions as facts, and so you come out with a straw man argument about """"inappropriate and excessive"""". You get the medal for surreptitious false reasoning. You then go on with another blatantly false statement: """"And as far as this section being POV, its title, """"Books Critical of the Group"""" proves that it is by definition a POV section."""" Danny, how exactly is something that is 'critical' proof that it is biased or POV? You have failed totally to make even the most basic case for your assumed conclusions; you just jump there with one giant false leap. Criticism is not by default proof of a bias, POV, or non-objectivity as you incorrectly assume. For example, if you said """"five plus five is thirteen"""", someone could objectively and neutrally criticise your ability at maths, and your conclusion, and prove you wrong, without having any biased point of view, or dubious agenda. Facts can be proven false or true, that is the rational basis of objective reasoning. Merely being critical is not a valid cause for rejection of the one criticising, as you manipulatively try and twist into its meaning with more ad hominem. You also ignore the hypocrisy of your argument, as Jehovah's Witnesses have masses of material heavily criticising other religions, so by your default, it should all be rejected as POV, biased, and highly subjective, and of little of no value. You have shot yourself in the foot Danny. You then go on with paragraphs of irrelevant red herrings, straw men, and more ad hominem character assassinations, in true Watch Tower fashion. You should read these Watch Tower articles on criticism and open-mindedness. 

You come out with even more logical fallacies, by mentioning subjects that do not apply, and hoping the less knowledgeable reader will fall for your 'guilt by association' machinations. You speak about """"disaffected individuals, apostates, and anti-cult movements"""", as if this somehow applies to Franz, when you have proven nothing. I'm sure I could get a host of quotes telling us all how sick and degenerate paedophiles are, and link that to you, and plenty of people would fall for that one if said over and over enough times, and the trick would have worked, no one would listen to anything you have to say if they believed you were messing about with little children. Your corrupt use of negative propaganda is disgusting, especially as you claim to be a Christian. I suggest you read your religion's articles on propaganda, you might learn to be more objective and less scheming in your arguments.

You then say: """"Especially suspect are """"Individuals who take up a cause for personal gain"""" by publishing books, etc."""" LOL, I nearly fell on the floor with laughter with that one! Hey, Danny, look in the mirror! The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society makes nearly a '$$$Billion$$$ US Dollars a year, a large part coming from its massive literature sales, most to loyal JWs. They also dodge paying their taxes on that massive income, this depleting the local community of needed funds (except in France where they have to pay their taxes, and are calling on """"Satan's European governments"""" to fight Jehovah's scriptural worldly tax arrangements, LOL). The greed of the publishing Watch Tower is terrible, but interestingly not a peep of condemnation from Danny about those Watch Tower """"Especially suspect 'Individuals who take up a cause for personal gain' by publishing books"""". Pure gold from Danny Muse!

You then go on: """"There are not similar books listed on the WP pages for the Catholic religion. . ."""" Since when did JWs love to link themselves with Catholics? Besides Catholics being a specially hated religion by Jehovah's Witnesses, it is completely different in its size, history and doctrines, and its treatment if those who criticise it. There are over 1 billion Catholics, and a 1500 year old religion, with massive tradition etc., why on earth would it be described the same as a 120 year old cult like prophecy obsessed group that treats its internal critics like demon possessed monsters, and then expels them and bans its members from",0

Perhaps we should work on that section here.  Here's the text, which I've started making an effort to clean up... although it needs a lot more work.
Oh, and the page should probably be all Harvard refs, rather than none:  Wikipedia usually sticks with the style chosen by the first author.    

Instrumental rudeness and pragmatic competence
Sometimes, people deliberately employ rude behaviors to achieve a goal.  Early works in linguistic pragmatism interpreted rudeness as a defective mode of communication.  However, most rudeness serves functional or instrumental purposes in communication, and skillfully choosing when and how to be rude may indicate a person's pragmatic competence.  

Prior to the mid-1990s, most linguistics research ignored the instrumental or 'useful' nature of rudeness in speech (Brown & Levinson, 1987; Grice, 1975; Lakoff, 1973).  Before then, rudeness was seen as a sign of communication failure:  Lakoff gave """"two rules"""" of pragmatic competence (1973): be clear, and be polite. Grice (1975) believed that rudeness violated universal norms of conversation of truthfulness, politeness and relevancy.  Likewise,  Brown and Levinson's politeness framework (1987  pp. 60-61) is also based on the idea that politeness is normative and rudeness is eschewed even when engaging in 'face-threatening acts' (FTAs) such as making a complaints or refusing a request.  """"The semantics and pragmatics of utterances must be taken into account in assessing degree of face redress; if the overt content of an utterance is rude, for example, politeness strategies won’t necessarily redeem it."""" (Brown & Levinson, 1987, p. 22)

Robin Lakoff (1989) addressed what she named 'strategic rudeness,' a style of communication used by prosecutors and therapists to force their interlocutors (a courtroom defendant or patient) to talk or react in a certain way.  

Gabriele Kasper (1990) gives us the earliest definition of rudeness in an academic paper.   In her discussion of Lakoff's (1989) research on strategic rudeness, Kasper (1990) defines rudeness as speech that is """"constituted by deviation from whatever counts as politic in a given social context, is inherently confrontational and disruptive to social equilibrium"""" (Kasper, 1990, p. 208).  This definition is important, in that it marks rudeness as speech which is confrontational at its core.  Although Kasper (1990) further defines rudeness as 'motivated' and 'unmotivated,' her definitions do not make use of natural data.  

It is not until Leslie Beebe's research comes along in the early to mid-1990s that data on naturally occurring instances of rudeness in everyday conversation is collected.  Drawing from Lakoff's (1989) idea of strategic rudeness, Beebe (1993a, 1993b, 1994, 1995) similarly proposes the concept of instrumental rudeness; rudeness that is meant to achieve a goal.  Like Lakoff (1989) and Kasper (1990), Beebe (1995) believes that rudeness is confrontational behaviour, and indeed in her research, she found that """"hostility seemed to pervade the data"""" (Beebe, 1995, p. 156).   In her study of naturally occurring rudeness in New York City, Beebe (1995) provides her own definition of rudeness:

""""In this study, rudeness is defined as a face threatening act (FTA)- or feature of an FTA such as intonation- which violates a socially sanctioned norm of interaction for the social context in which it occurs.  It is only rudeness if it receives insufficient redressive action to mitigate its force or, of course, if it does not occur in a context, such as intimacy or emergency, that would negate the need for redressive action.  Consequently, it causes antagonism, discomfort, or conflict and results in some disruption to the social harmony.   The idea that socially sanctioned norms of interaction are violated is central to the perception of rudeness."""" (Beebe, 1995, p. 159)

In this definition, Beebe (1995) asserts that rudeness is an FTA, or a feature of an FTA, that has not been mitigated by redressive action and does not occur between intimates or in emergency situations.  Essentially, rudeness is a bald, on-record face attack, and not a failed attempt at politeness.  This definition would also most likely preclude culturally-specific ritual insults, verbal games, or manners of speech that are used among members of certain social groups.   Labov (1972) argues that ritual insults, or 'sounding,' follow certain linguistic, organizational, and interactional rules.   If such speech among members of a cultural in-group could be seen as following 'socially sanctioned norms of interaction' (as Labov, 1972, argues) where there is a low risk of face-loss, it would most likely not be considered 'rude speech,' according to Beebe's (1995) definition of rudeness.

Some of the the sub topics fail to justify how they help explain the primary topic, instead they mention tangential controversy wihout satisfactorily connecting that controversy with the subject matter.

Another example would be failure to cite the actual Johns Hopkins articles, the evidence of their bias and lack of scientif rigor, or the various subsequent studies that refute the Johns Hopkins article, which is over 25 years old and out dated at best.

 Input needed on a Wikiversity project

Well, I'm sorry, but I don't have those links that you desire. Yes, this article is very POV based, in favour of vangard propaganda sociology. Unfortunately, due to the tyrannical trends of namby pamby liberalism (Labour UK, for example), not much genuine research can be done in the subject, because it's quite politically incorrect these days. For example, when a university professor says that on average Black people score lower in IQ tests than white people, said professor gets voted out of tenure 600 to 1. So it's not good practice for libertarian capitalists to bother trying to counter argue against all this namby pamby left wing crap. Labour UK is a twisted experiment, which, although capitalist and ostensibly right wing, has introduced very bizarre left wing projects in to the political playing field: such as, teaching young children about homosexuality in schools, trying to make gay hate a crime like race hate, trying to make condemnation of monotheistic religions a crime, with use of the truth distorting term 'incitement to religious hatred' etc. We are on the losing side, those of us who love truth.

"Disruptive Editing 

Your recent editing history at 2015 Chapel Hill shooting shows that you are currently engaged in an edit war. To resolve the content dispute, please do not revert or change the edits of others when you get reverted. Instead of reverting, please use the article's talk page to work toward making a version that represents consensus among editors. The best practice at this stage is to discuss, not edit-war. See BRD for how this is done. If discussions reach an impasse, you can then post a request for help at a relevant noticeboard or seek dispute resolution. In some cases, you may wish to request temporary page protection.

Being involved in an edit war can result in your being blocked from editing—especially if you violate the three-revert rule, which states that an editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page within a 24-hour period. Undoing another editor's work—whether in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material each time—counts as a revert. Also keep in mind that while violating the three-revert rule often leads to a block, you can still be blocked for edit warring—even if you don't violate the three-revert rule—should your behavior indicate that you intend to continue reverting repeatedly.

You are clearly off the topic, this is about a terror attack and not about whitewashing it.

""""However, the bombing operation had already been planned before then.""""

That means there isn't even any sort of link between the bombing and the British raids, which were btw. legitimate action that any police force would have done. This is a piece of excuse and justification not tolerated in any topic accusing the Arab side.

Finally, there is so much about the buzzword """"terrorism"""", placing it above all suffering caused to the Palastinians by expulsion and regular warfare, but yet apparently the same people who expose this so much don't distance themselves from this bombing terror but only seek to excuse it as much as possible.""",0

North Africa is a vast region, a large region that spans a huge geographical locale, much greater than that of Western Europe. Enmeshing all these different groups of people together for the sake of simplicity on your part I suppose is unfair, unethical and false. Much of the information that is posted regarding their origins is false and based on a study conducted in Southern Morocco, near the border of Mauritania. As the studies were conducted by europeans, who often look for the exotic element, we cannot even be sure that these were inhabitants of the region and not maurauders. Basing the findings of this study to for instance the Kabyle people who do not think of themselves as Berber as they are racially apart, culturally as well and even geographically reside mainly in mountainous regions in algeria is absurd and grave. As a native of the region, I am saddened by the distortion of so many peoples on wikipedia, a source that is edited by anyone, people such as the madman who thinks that only """"blacks"""" exist in Africa, which is as the world knows false and an absurd proposition.

Using common albedos 0.05 to 0.25, for an object with absmag (H) 26.5, the object would be 13-30 meters in diameter unless Wikipedia wants to use more extreme albedo values which may only further confuse the average reader. Either way this article should be consistent with how size is estimated when the precise size is not known.",0

Why was I not given a chance to defend myself at the administrator's noticeboard, even though the complaintant never notified me after making the report, as required? Why has  an article, when policy clearly states that is not permissable? I've made a lot of good contributions to this encyclopedia, and I enjoy it. I'm willing to chalk my experience with Spike Wilbur up to one bad apple in the bunch. I realize admins stick together, and I get the fact that no one is willing to go over another administrator's head, and unblock me. The fact is User:Therefore has clearly broken 3RR. I have a hard time believing that any one user could have every single administrator here in his pocket? Spike Wilbur should see that this user has broken the same rule, at the same article. Obviously he's not going to do anything to rectify a situation that he created. I don't care about being unblocked.

Just as a point of clarification, I think we all have to keep in mind the difference between a reliable result and a valid claim.  I don't think it would be possible to claim that g is not a reliable result - as Bpesta said, it's been replicated far too many times to say it's just an artifact.  The debate is over what this reliable result means (e.g. which theoretical claim about the underlying cause of the effect is valid), and that is a complex, multi-sided, yet-to-be-resolved-if-ever question.  Frankly, I doubt science will have a decent answer to that question until it has a more analytic definition of what intelligence is (and being a bit of a developmentalist myself, I suspect that that definition will be much more subtle than can be captured by a simple measure like IQ), but as it stands, the best we are going to be able to do with this section is discuss g in its basics,and then lay out various interpretations with proper attributions, so that it doesn't look like the section is advocating any one amongst the several competing ideas.

 Our ancestors 

Most of us trace our musical origins to the B's, but, past the B's, everything, and I mean everything is due to The Fans, Pylon, and Vietnam.  The Fans had records on db (Danny Beard = db records).  Their single """"True,"""" in particular, is a fantastic distillation of half of what Athens would be (avail. on """"Squares Blot Out the Sun,"""" a db sampler).  Vietnam was never recorded.  The Fans split up, with Kevin Dunn remaining about the scene as a solo act (Kevin Dunn and the Tribe of Women were on db).  Alfredo Villar, the singer of The Fans, went back to his day job.  

The other thing is Pylon.  There just are    not     words for how important they were/are.  REM's favorite band is Pylon.  The B-52's favorite band is Pylon.  Everyone's favorite band was/is Pylon.

The other huge starting point is in Atlanta.  The Hampton Grease Band, despite being Atlantans, was a kick off to the whole idea that we could be weird and successful.  Although they claim that """"Music to Eat"""" sold fewer albums than any in Columbia history (not true, as a Yoga instructional record undersold them), they looked successful to us because they had integrity and played and got to pay their bills that way.  In particular, although that band's career was very brief, Bruce Hampton never went away.  Both in The Late Bronze Age and Aquarium Rescue Unit later, as well as the various incarnations as Hampton B. Coles and Colonel Bruce Hampton, he was a magnet for musicians.  Furthermore, Glenn Philips, who played guitar with the Grease Band when he was 15 years old, stuck around and continued to gig.

Tone and style of article

Just a passerby and not a wikipedia editor per se. However, I felt compelled to leavea comment regarding the tone and style of the article: it suffer from sounding very personal, and has a tone of what one would expect a non-scholar explaining something in emphatic language. (the overabundance of quotation marks is one symptom, but there are other, such as the """"for the benefit of Europeans"""", which takes away from the neutral tone an encyclopedic article.) I'm not an expert on the subject (in fact I know very little about it, which is why I came here), but even to me it would be better if the page instead sourced a number of published treatises/works on the subject instead of going into a quasi-emotional and ambiguous personal essay-style on the subject. It sounds to me like the article attempts to unite the various concepts and make it as culturally vague and generalized and """"acceptable"""" (as in, lacking cultural, ritual and mythical specifics that would make different versions more characterized) as possible - and this makes the article sounds a little - dare I say - """"New Agey"""". (for lack of a better term.) I think more people would appreciate more specific mythic instances and rituals that specifically dealt with the Great Spirit/Mystery (and also those that established important differences between various views on the subject, as one would expect from proper research) - if those are available - as opposed to the currently rather watered-out explanation. 

As this is a very interesting subject, I'm looking forward to seeing how the article develops. ) Best of luck.

 Background section 

At the present time, the """"background"""" section cites unspecified interviews with the media, according to which, Ahmed claimed to """"take apart a clock and rebuild it inside a pencil case.""""

The sentence is taken verbatim from the NPR article. However, it links to a Dallas News article, which says no such thing, to a Dallas News interview, which also does not contain this statement, and mentions a WFAA interview, which I've been unable to find. I've checked four different interviews with Ahmed and he does not explicitly describe it as a rebuilt clock in any of them.

If such an interview exists and the statement was not an interpolation by NPR, it would be nice to have a direct link, a quote and a date.

The problem with the statement is that it provides inadequate background for the rest of the article. When the story broke on 9/15, the device was consistently described by the media as """"a homemade clock"""" or """"an invention"""".  The fact that it was a reassembled commercial clock was mentioned in passing by a WFAA article (which quoted Irving police) on 9/16 but otherwise mostly ignored. It only went """"viral"""", so to speak, when Dawkins waded into the controversy on 9/20 and his comments got picked up by the conservative media.

Much of the immediate reaction, from Obama's tweet and Zuckerberg's invitation to Dawkins' lashing out, seems inexplicable if the device in question was acknowledged to be a rebuilt commercial clock from day 1, but makes sense if the device was initially assumed by everyone to be a genuine homemade clock.

I invite everyone to read again the WP:NPOV policy of Wikipedia:
Editing from a neutral point of view (NPOV) means representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic. All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view. NPOV is a fundamental principle of Wikipedia and of other Wikimedia projects. This policy is nonnegotiable and all editors and articles must follow it.

Currently, the article is heavily biased towards a historical/heritage representation of Paris. The article is structured the same way as the article of Pompeii with most of its contents dedicated to describe past History, heritage sites, tourism, and past culture. The difference with Pompeii though is Paris hasn't been destroyed by a volcano 2,000 years ago, and here goes the WP:POV.

Facts about what is Paris today are marginalized in shrinked sections burried at the bottom. For the good of the debate, here are some facts about today's Paris we should all remember. Economically speaking, Paris is among the top 5 cities generating the most wealth in the world, it hosts more headquarters of Fortune Global 500 firms than London or New York. Demographically speaking, it is a megapolis of 12 million people inhabitated by large communities coming from all countries in the world. Regarding infrastructures, it is one of the most important transport node in Europe, with 4 airports, 6 major railway stations linked to 4 different high-speed rail lines, and hosts the second largest river port in Europe.

To know whether or not the economics, demographics and infrastructures aspects of Paris are represented fairly, proportionately in the current article, I invite everyone to compare the size of the said sections with the one of those dedicated to History, heritage and culture (which in the case of Paris ignores its modern aspects as everyone obviously agreed here ). I've counted words of each section (including their paragraphs in introduction), and in order to give a point of comparison, I've done the same about London, which is a similar size capital city of a similar country.
Field of interestParisLondonNumber of words% of totalNumber of words% of totalHistory3,573 words22%2,048 words17%Heritage4,277 words26%204 words2%Culture2,545 words15%1,661 words14%Subtotal10,395 words63%3,913 words32%Economy673 words4%727 words6%Demographics852 words5%1,605 words13%Transport819 words5%1,693 words14%Subtotal2,344 words13%4,025 words33%Overall total16,388 words100%12,131 words100%
It's worth being mentionned though that London's culture section is entirely dedicated to today's culture. But even putting that aspect aside, the London article, which seems well-balanced, talk about as much of History, heritage and culture than it does of economy, demographics and transports. In the case of Paris, sections about the """"past"""" aspects are 4.5 times bigger than those about today's aspect. In reading this article, we can decently believe that today's Paris is judged not relevant any",0

I agree, but I also don't agree.  There is nothing incorrect about the way that the article present Cruz's position.

You want to quote a reporter for CBS News, when that reporter is covering Cruz's appearance on Jay Leno's show.  The article currently quotes Cruz directly on what he said on Leno's show.  That option trumps the quoting of a reporter who wrote what he wanted to write and not what Cruz said.  You have not shown why your version of what happened on Leno's show should be put in the article and Cruz's direct word for word quote should be removed from the article.

All the listed grounds for blocking here are judgement calls, so there is no contesting them, and hardly an incentive when the subject of my complaint is admins. The lone factual claim is wrong: I was not unblocked as Mindbunny for making any agreements. I made no compromises of any sort.

The fact is Isalmophobia began with a 8 paragraph section undermining the concept of Isalmophobia. Antisemtism has a few scattered sentences criticising the concept. We all know damn well that there is no chance that Antisemitism would ever look like Islamaphobia, and that the systemic resistance to making them EQUAL is substantial. That's """"systemic bias,"""" which is a euphemism for prejudice. It doesn't happen invisibly. Certain editors can be tied to it, and we all know some of them. We all know it is self-reinforcing: the bias alienates Muslims, Indonesians, Arabs, and other groups who are demographically non-English-speaking and have significant headwinds in gaining consensus on ideological subjects related to their ethnicity. Those who stick around get pissed, and get blocked, further reinforcing the bias. It makes an encycolpedia into a stupid power game to see whose prejudice will prevail.

This community is plagued by systemic bias, i.e. racism, and it is plagued by a lack of accountability for admins. Communities that want respect from minorities need to give it.   """,0

"== Albanians Descendants of the Illyrians == 

Albanians Descendants of the Illyrians

1-the earliest attempt to link the modern Albanians to the ancient Illyrians was made in 1774 by the Swedish historian Hans Erich Thunman in his book Untersuchungen
ueber die Geschichte der Oestlichen Europaischen Voelker (Research on the History of
Eastern European Peoples). Using Roman and Byzantine historical sources as well as
linguistic and onomastic evidence, Thunman was able to conclude that the Albanians
were the autochthon descendants of the ancient Illyrian populations who were never
Romanized like the Daco-Thracian populations, forefathers of the Romanians.
2-Austrian linguist, Johannes Georges von Hahn further supported the theory of the Illyrian
origin of Albanians in his work Albanesische Studien (Albanian Studies) in 1854. In the
course of time many other historians, archeologists, and linguists have provided further
arguments supporting the theory that the Albanians and their language are modern day
descendants of the Illyrians.
3-Albanians live in the territories once inhabited historical sources pointing to the movement become settlers of these territories.There are no historical sources pointing to the movement of Albanians from elsewhere to become settlers of these territories
4-Components of Illyrian linguistic elements such as names of objects, tribes,
names of people etc known can be found in the Albanian language.
5-One of the latest attempts in this ongoing effort to establish a link between these
civilizations is a book entitled Ancient Illyria recently published in London.It is a study of unpublished documents and
includes the book Illyrian Letters, written by the renowned archeologist Sir Arthur Evans.
This work sheds light on the society and the culture of these predecessors of Albanians.
6-The relationships of Albanian with ancient Greek and Latin testify that
Albanian was formed and developed alongside these two languages along the
shores of the Adriatic and the Ionian Seas.In 1864 Dhimiter Kamarda published his linguistic study Saggio di grammatologia comparata della
lingua Albanese showing its antiquity as well as attempting to demonstrate its close relationship to Greek.
7-Even according to the writers of ancient Greece, Illyrians and Epirotes did not differ from each other in any way. they lived and were like the modern Albanians, without any
difference;Toskeri is the southern part of Albania. Its northern counterpart is known as Gegeri.
  they spoke the language which we speak today Ibid p. 11In antiquity,
Herodotus wrote that, Epirus is inhabited by non-Greek peoples who speak a barbarian languageIn antiquity, Greeks used this term to refer to foreigners. Indeed it was this non-Greek language which was later going to be one of the distinguishing elements setting the Albanians apart from other nationalities of the Balkan Peninsula.",0

I think I can help with some explanation here, as metamaterials are not fringe or pseudo science but hard science on the cutting edge of our understanding of chemistry, quantum physics, and engineering. The doppler effect is difficult to understand in terms of metamaterials as it requires one to think in ways which we are not used to. The viewer is stationary, yes, but the photons of light or phonons of sound are moving, and moving though a medium with unique refractive properties.  This means that the wave itself will be curved in bizare ways. One of the effects of this is that the apparent wavelength of the photon or phonon will appear to lower as it approaches, and rise as it recedes from, a viewer.  The infinite inertia refers to the fact that a metamaterial can, in precise circumstances, temporarily halt light by trapping it in the lattice of electromagentic fields within the material or within the particles themselves as a quantum spin state charge. Another way to phrase this would be infintite internal inertia. Such effects have been thoroughly demonstrated, and you can see the article slow light for more information. You are correct in saying that very little in science is infinite, but the catch in a metamaterial is that it is not 'infinite' infinite inertia. The infinite inertia is an induced effect that lasts only as long as the proper conditions remain, whether that be an external current applied to the metamaterial, a temperature to which the material is raised or lowered, or internal quantum state which can be thrown off balance. At the point that these conditions end, the light trapped within the metamaterial is freed from its electromagnetic 'cage' and re-emmited. I hope that I have cleared up some of the misunderstandings about the properties of these materials. rant """,0

Certainly I do not follow all the teaching of the Quran, but there are many good suggestions about how to live ones life in the Quran, some of which also exist in christianity, some of which dont, so I dont think islam is 'false'. You may think islam is false, whats to stop me turning around and saying to you Judaism is false? I could probably give you a hell of a theological argument for saying why Judaism is false,. but I do not believe it is completly false, and at the end of the day whatever argument I may provide whether a religion is 'false' or not is merely a biased opion. So what if Bless sins may have a pro-msulim leabing, we all have bias in our approach, and in fact I would say that your bais against islam is far more agressive and evident than that of Bless sin's pro-islam bias.

"The fact that Azeris are mixed Turkic speaking people that sprung from the Turkish invasion points to the fact that they did not just appear.  They were and are in the location that was Arran that consistent of Albanians, and Iranian tribes.  Furthermore, the fact that the entire area was called Arran, then for some reason was renamed Azerbaijan is another indication that Azeris were not a Turkic speaking group that just living side by side in the Caucus next to the Sakas.  No one said Azeris in the north do not have differences when compared to other Iranians, in fact Iranians are a multi-ethnic, multi lingual group, much like the Kurds in the west have a different language/customs, as do Balochies in the south.  What happened to Iranians in Arran intermittingly, in which the Turks invaded their tribes, and the Albanians were driven out, and imposed their language on them via Elite Dominance, does not change their original ancestry.  You have again failed to give a single rationale as to where the Azeris came from, why they even appear/are part of Iran, even today, and why these ethnic groups even have a Persian culture?  In all, you can concentrate on their differences, but fail to explain where did Azeris come from?

 100 years of women in transport 

Hi,

The campaign is a celebration of the role that women have played in the transport industry as a whole. However, the number of women that entered the transport industry - 100,000 is the number of the UK. 
Could we agree on this so I can edit it back and place """"United Kingdom"""" in the right place?
At the moment, after you edited it, it says: 

The 100 Years of women in transport campaign (or YOWIT) is a celebration of the significant role that women have played in the transport industry over the past 100 years in the United Kingdom, following the centennial anniversary of the First World War, when 100,000 women entered the Transport industry to take on the responsibilities held by men who enlisted for military service.

Birbhum

I am sorry to disturb you again and again. I have message as below: 

Hi! I would have really liked to support Birbhum in selected articles in West Bengal portal. But I cannot for some reasons. Some sections are small compared to other sections.( I know it is tough to find out resources). Again. some portions, like the small poem on palm tree ( It was nice to remember tal gach ek paye dariye...) is unencyclopedic, even if I sound rude. Demographics may be enhanced with religion data (may be deducible from the following sites: please see: [ http://www.censusindia.net/religiondata/] and [1]) . I shall contact u again soon. Bye the way, how about starting a """"selected biography"""" section in west bengal portal? You have created some excellent biographies so far. Regards. (talk) 

I have tried to get the religion data but I am unable to do so. Can you help? 

Thanks for the excellent work you have put in. Don't worry about the slips. I will set them right but take care to avoid duplication.

 Statistic removal 

I am removing the statistics from the 4th paragraph for the following reasons:

 The source [] qualifies as a WP:Primary by definition of a primary source
 The source is not an original study in and of itself, but is instead a """"meta-study"""" based on the """"RCTs"""". The underlying RCTs were not random or controlled as I indicated earlier by the Gregory Boyle and George Hill research; my previous posts here linked to their research which is a reliable source.
 The sentence I'm removing is a an opinion of the researchers themselves and is not directly supported by the results. See []. The actual reduction is not statistically significant. See Statistical_significance. The """"gold standard"""" is ~5%.
 I cannot obtain the source article in question without paying for it, but it really doesn't matter since we're not supposed to be using primary sources directly anyway. Both the monitor.co.ug and the aforementioned research goes to discredit the research
 Prostitution, when taken into account, nullifies the """"benefits"""": []
 Additional secondary source finding no benefit of MGM: []
 Another secondary source discrediting the research based on non-sexual HIV acquisition. See citations at the following link: []
 See citations here; male-female transmission increased: []
 Commentary that RCTs were not random at all (this is a fact as participants were paid): []
 No relationship between MGM & HIV in Kenya: []

Well, there are definitely copyright problems. This edit includes blatant copy-pasting (as, evidently, did this). This one is uncomfortably close:
Source text  Article textAccording to a source close to Honey Singh, when the rapper received a call from Bhardwaj, he thought it was a prank, more so when he was told it was for song written by Gulzar.... After verifying the truth of the offer, Honey Singh is said to have set aside all his other commitments and rushed to Mumbai to meet Bhardwaj.   At first when Honey Singh was contacted by Vishal Bhardwaj over telephone he considered it to be a prank call.[1] His belief consolidate when he was asked to rap on verses written by Gulzar.[1] After verifying the entire incident he set aside all his prior commitments and travelled to Mumbai to meet Bhardwaj at the earliest

I'm not sure if a full-blown CCI is called for, though. I generally look for 5 examples of outstanding copyright issues to make sure it's worth asking for community resources. It can take hours for me to review fully - especially where close paraphrasing is the issue instead of copy-pasting. (Copy-pasting - so much easier!)  I jumped heavily through his history and didn't find a lot of problematic content that seems to cross the line into copyright issues. What I did find seems to be gone. Mind you, this is a judgment call and I'm not 100% sure I'm suggesting the right one. Without actually DOING the CCI, I can't be sure I'm not missing something major.  (talk) """,0

Originally there was one site given as a source for the Sonja de Lennart claims - www.sonjadelennart.com, a site owned by Eleonora de Lennart and created in February 2008.  A simple glance at this website will show that it is not a reputable source.  Instead, it was fabricated for the sole purpose of fooling Wikipedia.
Unfortunately, the Wikipedia hoax was not detected before answers.com and other websites picked up the false claim of authorship and it was included in an Associated Press article that was widely syndicated.  The success of the hoax in tricking a reporter is now being used to give the hoax legitimacy.

"Hi Jerzy, I am sorry, but I am having trouble following your logic above. I don't want to be dogmatic about this; for me it is strictly a practical matter. I use the As of primarily for temporary situations, and by temporary I mean a few months, or for example, when I refer to something taking place within a half year, such as the publication of a book. In principal it could also be used in this and many other places, but let's not abuse the thing. If you look at Special:Whatlinkshere&target;=As_of_2003, you will see that there on the order of five hundred links which haven't updated. If there are two or three thousand I assure you no one is going to check them all. If HM published a new edition every three months, I would wholehartedly agree, but we are talking about eight to ten years. Hence, the text As of 2004, it remains the current edition. is going to go out of date far sooner than is necessary. Simply listing the fourth edition and its publication date is IMO quite sufficient.

"Perhaps. AFAIK his resignation is at least as big an event as the Titstare controversy itself, probably bigger. We probably can't or shouldn't create an article about him, or it, for WP:BLP1E reasons. Also, reviewing this, it seems that his Titstare comments were a trigger for his firing but not the real reason or cause, they just set some things in motion that led to people reviewing his Twitter feed. In that sense, I do think it is of due weight with respect to this controversy because it is perhaps part of the aftermath. As it stands, I think that reporting his Titstare comments and people's reaction to them, without mentioning that he was subsequently fired over a history of Twitter comments that were perceived as sexist, etc. (but that he defended as satirical) would be missing the bigger picture. Although I think we have enough sourcing to include his firing and the surrounding controversy, I think that if we decide that it's too irrelevant or too much of a BLP problem to include here, we should take most or all mention of him out rather than giving readers only part of the story. -",0

Elelland

Hello Humus

I am sorry if I have placed this note in the wrong spot. I m very inexperienced with Wikipedia. I was enthralled by Wikipedia. Initially. That is until I met Eleland. I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland. Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted. He organised a """"kangaroo court"""" made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.

The Article was on Ed O'Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent. The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. He was amongst the candidates for this year's HR.com dishonest reporter award - despite being in the Australia only catchment area - so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.

Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.

So I studied Eleland a little.

I've looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict. More than 95 were directly anti-Israel. His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro-Israel side. In this way he has undermined many many articles.

Personally I don't care what his opinion is, but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate, delete, manipulate etc. I think there is a problem.

Wikipedia is, I am afraid, beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script.

Who is Eleland? What power does he actually have?

Can anything be done?

"connection between 4chan and anonymous and anonymous culture 

I'm not sure the extended section on 4chan users is really necessary in this article.  Here's my formal sounding original reasoning that I thought started sounding too formal:

As it stands, the lines drawn between those three things are rather thin.  While Anonymous does profit from Anonymity, and 4chan users can profit from anonymity, I think there needs to be a more direct connection shown in this article before there needs to be an extended section upon 4chan within the article.  Consider it like this:

My father doesn't like potatoes.  Turnip eaters often don't like potatoes.  My father must eat turnips.
Anonymous profits from anonymity.  4chan users profit from anonymity.  Anonomous members must be 4chan members.

I don't doubt that there are many participants in Anonymous that use 4chan, I'm just not sure it is relevant to the point of extended discussion of Anonymous unless' there is proof that 4chan was the main location where Anonymous was organized.  There have been several sites akin to 4chan both preceding and following, and in addition IRC also served as a gathering place for anonymous individuals to share information collectively - including early hackers.  A discussion of 4chan as a subset of anonymous culture should be listed on cyberculture and 4chan and if necessary on a new page dedicated to anonymous(culture).  This article purports to be about Anonymous as a loosely associated hacktivist group - the focus, thus, should be on Anonymous(group)",0

I am unable to treat your explanation as clear and specific because it does not cite specific edits nor demonstrate how the edits match your description. Since you brought it up, WP:AGF says: """"Even if bad faith is evident, do not act uncivilly yourself in return, or attack others or lose your cool over it. It is not necessary to be a fanatic yourself. Even though it demands a lot of self control and patience, it is ultimately a lot easier for others to resolve a dispute and see who is breaching policies, if one side is clearly editing appropriately throughout .... Making unwarranted accusations of bad faith (as opposed to explanations of good faith) can be inflammatory, and is often unhelpful in a dispute. If bad faith motives are alleged without clear evidence that others' editing is in fact based upon bad faith, it can also count as a form of personal attack, and in it, the user accusing such claim is not assuming good faith.""""

 Parting thoughts on Jmh649 RFAR 
This is getting posted on every arb's talk page and I will courtesy notify Doc J. I am appalled at how low the standards of wiki admin behavior have sunk. We've seen admins lose their bit for nothing more than one wheel war and yet here we have multiple instances of involved protections, edit wars, hounding new users, involved blocks, etc, and absolutely nothing gets done about it. Why? So Doc J can """"adjust""""? What about all his victims? What do they get?diddly squat, just like in the real world. I actually truly hope Doc J can change, but that is not what wiki history teaches us. Wiki history teaches us he will lay low until the heat dies down then steadily go back to his old ways and he'll be back at RFAR within 6-30 months from now. Just like the arb case from my day when a drafting arb came within a hair of posting sanctions on Willbeback but didn't and what happened? Will kept going on in the same old fashion and two years and countless victims later, Will loses his bit and gets banned. And Doc J gets to use a secret mentor? He'd only not disclose that person if he felt the community would not accept the mentor, such as the mentor wasn't neutral or some such reason. By not taking this case and not issuing any guidelines or admonishments, especially with several extremely weak comments by the arbs (ie, how can some of you see nothing wrong in his behavior) all AC did here was send a clear signal to admins that there are no more admin standards of behavior and admins can do whatever they want and get away with it scott free. This juxtaposed with those who lost their bit for one wheel war also shows there is no consistency at all in AC's rulings on admins. At a minimum AC should have issued a statement on unacceptable behavior rather than turning a blind eye to the RFAR. This is an unacceptable precedent for which the community and AC will pay for many times over in the future. The UN can do a better job of fixing things than wiki and AC can, and that's really sad. This is a classic case of how those committing harmful acts rationalize their behavior and others rationalize excuses on their behalf. See you at """"RFAR/Jmh649 2"""". talk """,0

                          The Colour out of Space      

I dreamed that I was in the grasp of a great and horrible paw; a yellow,hairy, five-clawed paw which had reached out of the earth to crush and engulfme. And when I stopped to reflect what the paw was, it seemed to me thatit was Egypt. - HP Lovecraft

This is only a test

At 5:05 on November 22, 1977, regular television programming in southern England was interrupted by a voice claiming to be that of """"Grahama,"""" representative of the """"Ashtar Galactic Command,"""" bearing the usual """"space brother"""" boilerplate of coming in peace to save us from ouselves at the dawn of a New Age. It was quickly dismissed as a hoax, but an extremely complicated one to execute. 

Though the The Sunday Times the following December 4 surmised it was accomplished by students using just """"£80 worth of equipment powered by an ordinary car battery,"""" no one ever claimed responsibility, and independent investigations found that the message must have cut into at least five transmitters simultaneously,and it evaded detection by monitoring equipment which did not even register an interruption, """"suggesting it was achieved in some way that by passed our electrical system.""""

This was actually the second message from Grahama. A month earlier, he had said pointedly that """"We conveyed to Sir John Whitmore and to Dr. Puharich that we would interfere on your radio and television communication systems to relay when the civilisations are coming close to landing on your planet Earth. It is now in motion. We wish you to know that we love you.""""

That """"Grahama"""" would single out the aristocratic former racing champion Whitmore and parapsychologist and MKULTRA researcher Andrija Puharich suggests this was no simple hoax: both men were deeply involved with a decades'-long channelled communication with entities representing a universal hierarchy sometimes called the """"70 Brotherhoods of the Great White Brotherhood."""" The entities governing our reality identified themselves The Nine.

Another link to Whitmore and Puharich was British author Stuart Holyroyd's recently published Prelude to the Landing on Planet Earth, which the two had commissioned as an account of their work with the Nine. In the book, Holroyd wrote that the Nine intended to “interrupt televisionand radio transmissions during the period 18th to 22nd November.”

Regarding the television interruptions, Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince write in The Stargate Conspiracy that, """"as usual, there were only two options considered: either the wholething was genuine and extraterrestrials had really spoken to the southern English through their television sets; or it was hoax, just done for a laugh.The idea that such a message could be easily contrived by, for example, an intelligence agency that would have the necessary technical skills has never,to our knowledge, even been considered.""""

Of course there are several pages about me in that same book and I worked with Puharich for a short while.

This seems a bizarre oversight given the circumstantial connections to Whitmore and Puharich,and especially the latter's service in Army Intelligence and later as a CIA contractor researching the induction of altered states of consciousness.(Whitmore, incidentally, is now also Britain's """"number one business coach,"""" training top executives from companies such as Barclays, Lloyds, Pricewaterhouse Coopers and Rolls Royce.) Uri Geller,for a time one of the Nine's channellers, told Picknett and Prince that """"the CIA brought Puharich in to come and get me out of Israel,"""" and in his essay In the Thick of It, physicist Jack Sarfatti writes that """"Puharich was Geller's case officer in America with money provided by Sir John Whitmore.""""

The """"Council of Nine"""" have been delivering curiously consistent messagesthrough a succession of mediums to influential patrons with names like DuPont, Astor and Bronfman since the early 1950s, and nearly always in the shadow of military intelligence.

Energiewende
This is all about granularity.

I renamed it as it makes more sense as an article purely about Germany's efforts in transitioning to a low-carbon economy. An article only about Germany's Energiewende only will tend to remain on-topic and will in time become a good reference for Germany's efforts in sustainability. An article about every country under the sun can quickly become long list of overviews lacking in quality and usefulness.

If I were you I'd create one Wikipedia page for each country's Energiewende/Energy transition plans and efforts. Then you could create a """"metapage"""" – yes, call it for now """"Energy transition"""" (in lieu of a better title though something like """"Energy transition by country"""" or '""""Energy transitions worldwide"""" would be better) – and on that page there can be sub-headings for each country, each with a """"See also"""" link directly under the sub-heading which links to each of those country-specific articles on Wikipedia. Then a short summary can be provided summarising the info on each country-specific page (which, as I mentioned above re: Germany, will tend to remain on-topic and will become good references for the Energy transition efforts in each county over time, blah blah.) Such summaries are easier to keep concise and sticking to the salient points of the pages they refer to; this is of enormous benefit to the reader.

Contrast this to Wikipedia pages crammed with information on many countries. Such pages abound throughout Wikipedia. These pages tend to ramble on and on and are often the cause of so much duplication on Wikipedia. It is so much easier to write text and stick it up on Wikipedia than it is to locate, edit, and re-organise the info already on Wikipedia to make a single repository of information about it - that's the granularity I'm talking about.

So question in point, how will your page differentiate itself with pages like the Renewable energy in Germany page for example or the Energy in France page? There are also other pages out there which have overlapping information just for Germany alone such as Germany National Renewable Energy Action Plan. Are you going to add to the jumble? Stick to the principle of granularity and its easier to not do so.

I'm sorry to disagree but, at Wikipedia, secondary sources trump primary sources.  This seeming contradiction to your experience with academic papers actually makes perfect sense when you understand the rationale.  When you write an academic paper using primary sources, you are performing """"original research"""" based on your understanding of the sources.  Whether your work is respectable and legitimate enough to be considered by the academic community is based on some sort of peer review (usually a peer-reviewed journal or an editor at a respectable publishing company).  Wikipedia has no such mechanism for vetting submissions and so it relies on the concept of a verifiable reliable source which, in plain English, means """"a published source which has been through some kind of peer-review process"""".  If a Wikipedia editor writes text that is based primarily on primary sources, he is vulnerable to the charge of performing """"original research"""".  All we can say is """"Unknown Wikipedian X believes A, B and C based on his own interpretation of the primary sources.""""  If we cite a secondary source, at least we can say """"Published author Y asserts A, B and C based on his peer-reviewed interpretation of the primary sources.""""  There is still room to debate how reliable """"published author Y"""" is (he could represent a fringe POV, for instance).  However, in such a debate, Wikipedians bring more information from other secondary sources to either assert or refute the reliability of """"Published author Y"""".  The basic principle here is """"not published => not reliable"""".  And self-published doesn't count.    18:09""",0

Your accusations are false and malicious. You hurl accusations to justify your attempt to enhance POV editing in the article. There has indeed been bullying on the article but it has been directed AT me, not by me. You are obviously looking at this is a very biased manner. You punish Wikid for making a joke about a swine that offended The Magnificent Clean-Keeper. Yet, you punish me when I complain about horrible words being directed at me, including the repeated use of the """"F"""" word by The Magnificent Clean-Keeper towards me. There has been a great deal of harassment directed towards me, yet you totally ignore it or never looked into it. Then you make the totally false charge that I  misused mediation. That is outrageous. The mediator turned out to have a srong bias. He could not fulfill the role of an impartial mediator, in my opinion. To say that rejecting a mediator who had openly expressed a strong bias is wrongful is just more bias on your part. I agree that Wikipedia is not an advocacy site, and that is the exact point I have tried to make. BOTH sides of the murder mystery need to be included but since you have blocked both editors on the same side and encouraged the others to remove ALL of our work, it will hardly be a surprise when this article reads like the prosecutor's brief. But to me the worst part is to see the condoning of abuse of a woman editor. That is so sickening it is beyond what I am willing to tolerate, even to try to help achieve NPOV in an article.   """,1

"""

I've got to say, I've read you """"pacafistic"""" rules, seen your idea of """"logic"""", and have heard tales of your """"justification"""" and I just have to say:

I have this to say on my behavior:
I'm a perfectly reasonable person when it comes to arguements, even when they are against my favor. I change subjects, help the people with simple little details they might have gotten wrong, ask them for proper information that I might use against them, basically anything a scatter brainer would do.

I let people have their ways for a little while just to experiment with how it turns out, I try to help BOTH OF US come out on top, I treat both equelly, and I don't get angry when someone yells in my face.

Why should I? They are angry first so I know they are suffering enough and would only poke at them some more just to annoy them (sound fimiliar?) I give them their space though I would still do what I did/do to annoy them. Except, I do it without coming into contact with them (as they would do to me) which I know we'd both appreciate.

I keep the sitch isolated someone else doesn'tblow the entire thing out of proportion before me and that person can resolve the matter only with each other which is inevitable. Others can't resolve the problem, only make it bigger and more serious for either 1 or both. see below.

If they ever try to apologize I tell them not to→ because I wouldn't→ because I have no reason to→ because we shouldn't have been in a scrabble no if ands or buts about it. Conflict is stupid. Almost (but not quite) as stupid as the species that create/embrace it. Leave the creatures space to realize this and you will have peace once more until the next pointless bicker and inevitable resolve.

Now, I have this to say about the """"good"""" people of wikipedia:
Wow.
There sure aren't a lot of you. I wonder why... You've seen many cases and classes of human behavior and traits, you (think) you know what to expect. Well you have most of it down. But you went wrong at a few turns:
1. You (blindly) follow invalid rules and principles that completely misinterpret the act and are constantly showing how much shit they're full of.

2. You think you got """"human psychology"""" in the bag and have tried to play from this to class your principles into rules but your system is far outdated and very inhumane.

3. You don't want to and try not to link yourselves and articles with POV(point of views) but little have you realized your entire system thrives apon it. 
You take sides in arguments between users based solely on what YOU think is most right based apon how YOU have been taught what is right. You are NO ONE to interpret what """"mad"""", """"kind"""", """"eccentric"""", ect. is. Just another group of the bunch and they all think seperately on subjects or else we'd look and be exactly the same. And you don't want that. 
And don't you tell me to calm down, I get just the opposite when people try to make me look crazy that way, and it certainly isn't any diffen't with Bots. 

4. Most importantly, you robots are full of shit:
You take leaders/favorites→ who take favorites→ who put up with your shit like its the right thing to do because they don't knowwhat else to do. Sickening.

2a. You abuse your power instead of embracing it's enlightenment.
Don't you get it?! He wasn't going to block me himself because he wanted to toy with me. He knew I knew he was higher than me and could just as easily waved a hand and blocked me himself. But he didn't. He wanted to add insult to injury. 
You think people want to have someone powerful to look up to? NO! They want to be someone powerful so they can feel embraced/in. 
We all want what we shouldn't have. 
Unfortunately, there are some of us who already have what we shouldn't have.

5. How you go about it is the wrong way. 
Some things people must learn for themselves. You have a problem, try relying on yourself and no one else to resolve.  
If some people are fighting with each other over the internet just sit back and let them/butt out and leave them to their bickering. Sooner or later they will stop arguing of their own account/or reasoning. Or they may even just """"stop"""". BUT if someone bigger than both of them butts in and takes a side however they see fit, things will get much worse.

I'll let you know whether you care or not...:

 The precise definition of race is under dispute.. 

I wrote this to help spread understanding, please make sure to read the definitions of outcrossing on the link.

There is a lot of misunderstanding of genetics and further there is a lot of misinformation that people spread because they WANT you to think that there is no difference between peoples for a political or social agenda, that does not make it so. Humans share 98% of our genetic code with Chimpanzees, yet that 2% defines our differences and is important as is the difference in the human population, no matter how small the difference.

There are obviously differences in the expressed traits between Asian, African and Caucasian. These are different types of humans, if you choose to call the a race/breed or type it's up to you and it's immaterial. My argument has always been that racial diversity should be preserved which is a more neutral position rather than promoting that race mixing and interbreeding is somehow positive.

You and many people that listen to pop culture may think that by interbreeding you are helping humanity and there are lots of myths about how you will create better offspring; offspring that have the best of both parents. This is just a myth told by people who, are trying to say that people are equal, if different. Yes, people are people as Americans we believe that all people have certain inalienable rights but the best position for humanity is for each of the races to exist, separately to be the best we can. If you truly understand the advantages that diversity offers you will agree too.

I personally breed horses. And this is where I'll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic """"learn to breed"""" guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.

What Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it's very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake. You can't through bad human crosses in the trash like you can with corn.""",0

It would interfere with DNS, Proxies and anything, including openDNS. It would gain powers from late DNSChanger.

Wikipedia is hosted in the US, so US laws on copyright, etc. are enforcable. That's just the way it is, and we need to avoid legal action being taken against the foundation. To be honest, I don't see big differences in behaviour of editors by nationality, so far as nationality is apparent - I suspect that there are just more Americans here than any other nationality, simply due to sizes of populations of English-speakers, so any group of editors is likely to have more Americans than anything else, including the helpful, constructive, thoughtful ones. I think, however, that there are a higher proportion of editors here now than ever before who have little interest in adding and improving content, preferring to delete, argue, try to raise the bar on notability and fair use guidelines to allow more to be deleted, etc., but I don't see this as a wholly US phenomenon.  08:15",0

"""::::::Even the claim of """"essentially segregated lives"""" is bogus. Of course lives aren't 100% integrated, since these are two different cultures, with different customs and languages. But what separation exists is purely voluntary - some Arabs prefer to live in an Arab town/village, and that's understandable. Most Arabs send their kids to Arab school - so they can study in Arabic. However, some send their kid to a Hebrew speaking school - I had an Arab classmate, for instance (whose father was a department head in the city hospital, by the way). Many Arabs live in towns with a Jewish majority, and there's no law against that, and no one prevents them from doing so. Several cities in Israel have substantially mixed populations, including Jerusalem, Haifa, Jaffa, Lod, Ramle, Beer Sheva and others. There's no segregation, and no separation.

 Your revert 

Hello.

I would like to kindly request reconsideration of your revert (see link above). I had reinstated an edit removed based on a misunderstanding of a previous editor. The other IP user had replaced somebody else's comment with his own, and, when I attempted to take care of it, somebody had already reverted the edit, resulting in the old comment being restored and the new comment, which the IP editor posted (and removed the other comment in the process) being removed. Please browse the diffs starting from here. In my opinion, the edit was made in good faith. I restored the comment. The editor appeared to be legitimately inquiring about a deletion or revert. I reposted and signed it. I had noticed that you have reverted my edit. Please note that I have not at all made my edit in bad faith, and that I have never made bad faith edits to Wikipedia. I have been editing since 2008, had an account, but do not use it anymore since I am quite retired. I had a clean record and had never been blocked from editing. I do not know if it is possible to have those entries removed from the block log, since blocks count against an editor's reputation and I have not made any bad faith edits.

The last ten year (2001 – 2011) Sinanoglu became the “Hero of People” by using these fake titles that he published them in his bestseller autobiographical book. Today, by contributing a few million college student, the “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” was like the superracist “Hitler Youth Movement” in Turkey and Sinanoglu became the icon of the """"Turk Superracism"""" everywhere. By reading the autobiographical book of Sinanoglu, large amount of college students became “superracist Turks” under the influence of Sinanoglu’s megalomanic and fake titles. So, they are conducting the election campaign: “Sinanoglu must be the President of The Republic of Turkey!” Eight years ago, the first edition of this article was written by some members of “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” as the summary of Sinanoglu’s autobiographical book and this Wikipedia article was used by them in Turkey as the proof that the titles of Sinanoglu had been accepted as exactly true by whole world, so every Turk must believe that this titles of Sinanoglu was exactly true.

They have looked only at the effects of collision on HD+; there are hardly any equations. They are not interested in quantum description of the whole process but only on what happened with the HD+ from which they read about used slit(s). But please respond, does the hellium go through the slits as a wave or as a particle? The Copenhagen interpretation discretizes experiments: during one, it must be either the former or the latter. If it is a particle, then it has a position or momentum during measurement (subject to uncertainty; they """"arise"""" upon measurement, according to orthodox Copenhagen, and arise randomly). Then, there are also things such as momentum transfer etc. which are usual for particles. If it is a wave, however, then it can interfere, and also it can be in many places at a time during measurement. But in this experiment both momentum transfer and wave effects happen during one process of leaving a slit. So please admit that the experiment shows something that is against the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation. Already for this reason it is worth mentioning here(!), but there is one more point.
If you take the Bohm's interpretation (which spreads properties such as charge or mass in space, if the article is not mistaken) and then apply the guiding equation not to one selected point, but to all continuum of points within the orbital, then you can easily explain how can something that acts as a particle go through both slits at a time. The interference pattern will arise due to similar effects as in Huygens' principle; momentum transfers from points (integrated, of course, because normally they will have only something like density of mass and thus density of momentum) will also follow normally. This looks like a quite natural explanation of the phenomenon, especially that photons most likely encounter the same thing when they bounce from shutters between the slits, etc. A very natural explanation is, then, that the apparent """"particle"""", subject to all QED equations etc., acts proportionally """"with its whole body"""" (can be normalized to 99% like with orbitals, so that the body does not extend infinitely in space). Every point follows its own way, when confronted with potentials of external fields, for instance (as in QED), though they have a common wavefunction and this makes them one and the same """"particle.""""
But this emergent interpretation, so natural and obvious, will never be compatible with the Copenhagen interpretation and the like, which assign certain probabilities to different outcomes of a measurement. This is why CI needs the distinction """"acts as a wave""""  """"acts as a particle"""" in experiment; in case of a particle you will have 1 position or momentum, subject to Heisenberg's, and in case of a wave you don't take these into account, so no problem! But never, in CI, you have a continuum of measurements for a certain wave function; because, then, without any collapse in between, ALL POSSIBILITIES would have to occur, otherwise I don't know how do you understand the word """"probability."""" You will not have an explanation why these other points are still """"with"""" the wavepacket and have not flown elsewhere.

"Hey Fred,

It's upsetting for me to see that someone can falsify and deny the existence of true Turkish novelist F. Rifat Ulkuman just for not to get punished because of the vandalism. I really wonder if you did a complete research about him before deleting his article but just because some random person claims that he doesn't exist, shouldn't give you a right to delete the article of such a big novelist and politician. Labeling the life and publications of such a person as 'Hoax' is a serious claim which needs to be supported by a great research and some and as i can see you haven't done that ,did you? Even though doing that research should be your job let me help you to realize what a serious mistake you have done.

""":Support the removal of Iran.  Conditions are different in Iran than in the Arab world.  It's not connected to the Arab world in the same way that the Arab states are connected to each other, and is only included by dint of being a Middle Eastern autocracy.  But I believe that WP:COMMON should be our guide, and in this regard, media seems to be contrasting Iran with the Arab countries, rather than including them.
I ran a Google News search for """"Iran Arab Spring"""" and will list a run-down of the treatment by sources on the first page:
The Christian Science Monitor refers to """"protests sweeping the Arab World"""".
The Huffington Post refers to """"another spring on the Iranian scene."""".
The next two articles, and two later down talk about the threat posed by Iran to the Arab Spring,  or Arab World 
The next article talks about Blackwater for some reason. 
Jerusalem Post calls its article """"Arab spring, Persian winter."""" 'Nuff said.
The BBC includes Iran with China and Azerbaijan as related protests. 
The AFP (Whatever that is) says that Iran is different from the Arab countries, but also uses Arab spring to refer to the protesters there.  At four days old, it's the second oldest source on the front page. 
The oldest article, coming from The Telegraph, doesn't provide any indications either way. 
In short, all these articles either exclude Iran entirely from the Arab Spring, recognize it as distinct from the Arab countries, or remain silent on the issue.

I see your point about the weakness of the other parts of the article. They will work themselves out in time, especially since the section now tightening itself out can serve as a guideline for the rest of the piece. 
As for my removal of uncited info, you needn't take it personally at all. People usually don't know what needs citation until it is pointed out to them. People usually don't get off their duffs until that info goes bye-bye. Not to put too fine a point on it, but you leapt into action after I repaired the material to the Discussion page, right? 
Lastly,I'd point out that after you told me you were working the piece, I didn't get into an edit-war with you about it. I was happy you were knocking out citations, and (mostly) excellent ones, at that. I gave you the time to put them together, doing no more than adding cn tags to replace those references which weren't that strong. I'm not that hard to work with; I just hate having to cover the same ground repeatedly. Once a citation/section is done, it shouldn't need further examination, like, 'job done; what's next?'

"""::::::: Hi everyone this is the first time I've closely examined this page. I've been heavily involved in OWS since last October, which means two things: 1) I know a bunch of stuff first-hand, including things the media has failed to document, and 2) sometimes an NPOV is going to be difficult for me to maintain. That said, I have many concerns with this article, mostly on the facts. For example, this quote above: the rules of Zuccotti Park aren't self-justifying; this quote and others in the article seem to indicate that they are actually material. They're not; they don't actually exist; there is a rule-making procedure that is required by city law which the police and Brookfield have totally ignored. So, using them to explain police action without quoting or citing a police source is not NPOV. Secondly, these rules have nothing to do with the police tactics used that day, which were employed all over the Financial District, well outside the region where the """"rules"""" of Zuccotti Park apply. What happened was the police grab whoever they feel like at any given moment, apply laws like the disorderly conduct statute willy-nilly (""""blocking pedestrian traffic"""" is frequently absurdly applied), and have a goal not of enforcing laws but of maintaining an extralegal standard of order. This is called """"crowd control policing"""", and it explicitly involves unconstitutional conduct and arrests. Remember, sometimes a point of view is political despite being neutral, i.e. based in empirical observation and fact. Thanks for your work, and perhaps you can offer some guidance as to how first-person expertise can properly be used to make sure a wiki article is factual and not based on flawed or incomplete media interpretation.

"""::::::Part of my problem with your (and Geogre's) request is that if I accept it and follow it strictly to the letter, it would be pointless, and if I accept it and follow it in spirit, it would be cruel as well as undermining of my major work in Wikipedia.  

As I mentioned above, I rarely visit the arbcom IRC channel (which itself is not heavily used even by members of the ArbCom); swearing it off is largely a meaningless act.  I could readily stop participating in the mailing list, because I would essentially get the same information via other channels.  You seem to think that this is the only backchannel that exists or that I participate in.  It's not.  It's not even the most important one.  For me to accede to the spirit of your demand would require that, inter alia, I cut myself off from personal communication with people like James and Kat  people I count as friends  because they would likely continue to discuss the same issues with me that we currently discuss from time to time on the arbcom list; my opinions would still enter the discussion, just not as directly.  Furthermore, one of the major resources I use for collaboration with the Foundation, and specifically with Danny and Brad  which, by necessity is a wholly private resource  includes James and Kat as regular participants.  Withdrawing from that particular resource would hamper my ability to provide assistance to Brad and Danny, which represents probably the bulk of what I do on the English Wikipedia these days, and the part that I find most fulfilling.  I also frequently participate in """"backchannel"""" conversation with Kat, James, Dmcdevit (another arbitrator), and occasionally smoddy on the restricted IRC admins channel.  Should I also withdraw from that channel?  It seems that the you and Geogre, through your joint demand, are seeking to require that I isolate myself totally from the entire ArbCom (Geogre's proposal even requires that I even refrain from public communication with members of the ArbCom; I don't recall if yours does, although I believe it does not).  Those people, some of them, at least, are my friends.  For you to ask such a thing is really quite heartless.  It would be akin to my demanding that you have no nonpublic contact with the myriad of friends you have no doubt made on Wikipedia.  

So, you must forgive me: I would rather resign my privileges with honor than accept either of the alternatives left to me:  giving you a hollow victory gained through my unethical manipulation of your own ignorance, or the personal harm of agreeing to cut myself off from those I count as friends.

"My explanation
Hi,
I'm glad you like the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section. Thanks!
The reason for my edit is that the paragraph you are referring to:
 Some of the leading providers of multitracking software for a personal computer....
is repeated twice in the article. 

If you read the History section's last paragraph you will see it there. Then if you read the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section, you will see it there as well with a slight addition.

I deleted this paragraph from the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section, since it had to be deleted from either one of the two sections. 

The reason I deleted it from the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section is because the History section has a line about how multitracking software has been written for personal computers:
 At the same time, with the power of the personal computer increasing, multitracking software was written for it ... 
And this is where this paragraph was originally.

If you see the edit differences between my deletion and your addition, you will clearly see the paragraph appearing  twice.

If you think that the paragraph belongs in the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section instead of the History section, that works for me too!

Hope you will find my explanation adequate.",0

Typically, a being from the Reverse Maruhage can only individually teleport back and forth between dimensions (we see when Crimson, LOVE and the Sacks return to the Dark World, they use a teleporter that allows them to raise and fall between the surface).

Thus, the Table of Sacrifices is needed to gather energy from twelve individuals (in the form of a clock) to power the Yamiking.

Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better. Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians.

Hi RetroS1mone. Thanks for coming here to reply to Guido - it's no problem at all, especially when I'm not around. I replied to Guido above about the 3RR block. If Guido does take my advice to work on that table in his userspace, would you give him the time to marshall his arguments and listen to what he has to say? I know he does have COI with the activist organisation, but while strongly discouraged it is not forbidden to edit if you have a COI. See WP:COI and also Wikipedia:Suggestions for COI compliance. Me personally, I would prefer Guido edited chess articles and only participated on the talk pages of CFS/ME pages (or worked on the article about CFS activism that has been suggested). Oh, and you are quite right about the forum-shopping. Guido, if you have a complaint about conduct on those articles, you will need to find another admin and not come to my talk page. I've commented on the talk pages of some of these articles with suggestions about the content, and (for me) that makes me too involved as an editor to use my admin tools in relation to those articles. RetroS1mone, speaking as an editor and not an admin, I would advise you not to say things in edit summaries like """"tendentious editor with strong COI POV"""". The reason being that edit summaries are permanent records, and if you say something incorrect, you can't retract it. It is best to keep edit summaries focused on describing the content (not the editors) and then to say """"see talk"""" if you want to go into more detail. That way, if you are wrong, you can retract and apologise later. For the record, I think you are mostly right here (though I would have phrased it more diplomatically), but I hope you see my point about the difference between saying something in an edit summary and saying something on a talk page.

 Replaceable fair use Image:Todd_Friel.jpg 

Thanks for uploading Image:Todd_Friel.jpg. I noticed the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link]. Note that even if you follow steps 1 and 2 above, fair use images which could be replaced by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted 2 days after this notification (7 days if not used in an article), per our Fair Use policy.

 Still concerned about balance 

I've put in a fair bit of time on the article, both in verifying/cleaning content and filling in material, enough that I think I can say I have gone over things in detail.

Look, for example, at Korea and the Caribbean/Cuba/Cuban missile crisis; those are a start on what I think is encyclopedic coverage. Just to say, with no other background, that the CIA trained police or set up an Operation Gladio network really doesn't give information; I'd recommend waiting for more background and context.

There are news reports from reputable journalists, but there are also quite a number from activists for varying positions. I'm afraid I don't give equal credit to a staff writer for the Washington Post and for the Revolutionary Worker.

The article is impossibly long, yet its covert operations section is full of fragments. It's going to have to break up so those fragmentary sections can be edited; it's taking a long time to save the file now.  Note that I was able to put estimative/analytic material in for Korea and Cuba. Much data of that sort is available, often in the form of the actual declassified documents. Not to put in relevant reports, National Intelligence Estimates, etc., gives the impression that the agency is purely covert operations, since the reports were almost never mentioned for countries I sawjust controversial """"dirty tricks"""". That's not NPOV.

Many sources are available for the report literature, including the George Washington University National Security Archives, the Avalon Project at Yale, the archives at Mount Holyoke, the military staff colleges and research institutes, the Foreign Relations of the United States series, and even the CIA FOIA Reading Room. There is, for example, a huge amount of reporting about Southeast Asia, including strong disagreements among the CIA, military, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and White House (Sam Adams' book, War of Numbers is excellent, but also see the Pentagon Papers).

I'd like to suggest that people editing this look at some of my articles on the process of intelligence, which may help understand things that aren't just covert destabilization. Start with Intelligence cycle management, which will take you through a hierarchy of articles. The HUMINT sections do deal with clandestine rather than covert activity; I'm actively working on them. The article on Clandestine HUMINT and Covert Action is particularly relevant both in history, and balance between clandestine and covert activities. Especially in WWII, there was often a conflict between operations and intelligence gathering. 

Please let me help, but understand that my reaction is that things come across as very accusatory and unbalanced. Believe me, I am very aware of both improprieties and just plain incompetence in intelligence agencies, and they need to be brought out  but in an encylopedic, not fragmentary and accusatory way.

 Removed the """"central planning"""" nonsense 
""""Central planning in USSR"""" refers to centrally planned economy as opposed to the 'free market' economy. While it may be argued as reason for general economic inefficiency of the USSR during its later years it is completely out of place as a reason for space exploration setbacks in this article. First of, it was precisely the central planning that made Soviet space program possible. Without centrally allocated resources and planned activities it would never see the light of day nor would it be able to compete against a similar space program undertaken by the wealthiest nation on the planet. Secondly, the US space program (or any large technological program, Manhattan Project being such an example) is equally 'centrally planned', financed and controlled. Very little if anything is left to the works of free market forces. Similarly the US space program has its own also sadly impressive list of setbacks and disasters.

"Chart order 

At the moment the budgets are charted off the IMDB amounts.  It seems silly to arbitrarily select a source for the chart order, expecially when there are concerns noted above over the site being a reliable source.  As you can see I've been working through the films adding reliable sources from places like The New York Times, Variety etc, so there is now better sourced information to rank the films from.  

Given the nature of budget estimates, they often differ from source to source and that has to be taken into account.  I'm against arbitrarily 'picking' a source to rank by.  I am also against the idea of averaging the amounts given by the sources or picking the most frequently cited amount, since this system would be open to manipulation by adding more sources.  My solution would be to rank using the lowest common denominator; case in point:  some sources say GI Joe cost $170m, and some $175m, but while the figures don't match they both agree that the film cost at least $170m.  In view of that, my suggestion would be to rank off the lower amount, but include the higher amount as an alternative estimate.  In the case of films where we have an official figure I'm of the opinion that the films should always be ranked by the official budget with any further estimates included as an alternative estimate.

I'll hopefully finish sourcing the remaining films on the chart over the next week and will then implement the new chart structure if no-one has any objections.",0

 Also concerning TheCommish21 

First of all, your statement about the Underground Football League was incorrect.  It is not a fantasy football league.  The UFL is a full-contact, tackle football league based in Macungie, PA, that attracts teenagers (ranging from 9th to 12th graders) from all over the Lehigh Valley.  There are referees, statisticians, an official rulebook, and permenant teams.  It is not just a hobby that was created without any sort of solid foundation.  It's website is growing rapidly, with nearly 6000 hits since the beginning of October.  Merely because it is local and young, does not mean that it doesn't hold a solid enough position in the world to have a Wikipedia page.  Your response to the Perl citation was a weak showing of how the UFL did not deserve a page.  Perhaps there are people who are very interested in football.  They might be interested in seeing how leagues in other areas.  If someone has a vested interest in something, they should be allowed to access information about it.  Isn't that what Wikipedia is all about?

Second, merely because you have a personal vendetta against TheCommish21 does not mean that you have the right to block him and deny his appeal to be unblocked.  And you and WarthogDemon both know that he never referred to you as """"cyberidiots.""""  The term was """"cyber police.""""  I don't understand how you can hold yourself in such high esteem if you are lowering yourself to mocking those whom you have problems with.

 Please don't imagine that I consider this a matter of great consequence or that I take any offense at your actions.

On another note, I think it is extremely poor form to delete any Talk page, even if the primary page is itself deleted  thus I say """"copy"""", and I think you are wise not to move the Talk to my user space. 

 I consider the RfC to be of exactly zero consequence. I took it seriously until Radiant flipped over the Etch-a-Sketch, shook, and started over. Now, it's simply become a joke, and I have Conan O'Brian for that if I want. But I appreciate your expression.

Half of the debate in this project is disruptive in some way; yet what I've done has destroyed nothing.

 If you want a real example of bottom-feeding, take a look at Netty's last edit to this Talk page. Some time ago, I substituted a template on this page, which he had previously peed on; thus this page got tagged, as a template, for deletion. A couple days ago, my nemesis decided the continued presence of {tfd} on my Talk page was an embarassment, and he attempted to remove it. Check out the smarmy edit summary. 

 But I came by that tag honestly, and I shall wear it as a badge of honor until wiser heads knock some sense into TfD and templates are no longer vandalized when nominated, presumed guilty until proven innocent.

Further FRINGE states we give fringe views a neutral, fair treatment with the associated weight of ink they get from RS.

And that I'm """"trying to use an avalanche of incredibly negative stories"""" to say its about ethics is 100% wrong. I'm trying to introduce the required impartiality into the article per NPOV. I don't necessarily believe at the end of the day GG is about ethics, but they have presented that as their case, and as we are an impartial encyclopedia, we should include any facets of their case that have been appropriately documented in highly reliable sources. Failure to do so is showing a partial view of the story. The fact that these claims are made in negatively-charged stories doesn't matter, they are stated in what everyone here is considering as highly reliable sources; most of what we know about Westboro Baptist Church, for example, comes from highly-negative sources about the congretation, but we still can document what the church claims about itself from them.

"In 1912 (long before Landis) Cobb attacked a fan in the stands and was suspended. The fan was indeed handicapped, but he was also hurling vile words at Cobb, who wouldn't put up with it. His teammates went on a one-day strike, then came back when told they would be banned from baseball if they didn't. Cobb did not escape suspension, he served it. The allegations against Cobb and Speaker in the mid-1920s came from another ballplayer, about a game several years earlier. It was that one player's word against theirs, hence insufficient evidence. Landis didn't hesitate to punch out the big stars (like Ruth) when it seemed warranted. The stats for Jackson in the '19 Series don't suggest he did anything much to help his team win. I don't know that he denied throwing the Series, some sources claim that. But did he keep the money? Far as I know, he did. There is a rule that banned players can't be in the Hall, because their actions are ON THE FIELD, and are a stain on the game.",0

 Third sentence of the lead 

Hello, I was just perusing this article randomly and I have a suggestion for the third sentence of the lead paragraph. It reads """"Anatomical similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor through a long series of these divergent events, stretching back in a tree of life that has grown over the 3,500 million years of life on Earth."""" I have two comments on this sentence.

1) First, it seems to me that the purpose of the sentence is to lay out, at the highest level, the independent lines of evidence in support of evolution. As such, I think that DNA (or genetic) similarities is a fourth line of independent evidence of the same level of importance as the three lines already listed in the sentence. Certainly, those three lines of evidence are the ones Darwin primarily relied upon when he laid out the theory (actually, he more apologized for the fossil record than relied upon it as an independent source of supporting evidence), but I think the incorporation of genetic evidence into the theory of evolution is at least as important a source of independent evidence and should be included in this sentence.

2) Secondly, for both anatomical similarities and genetic similarities, it's not so much the similarities per se that are crucial, it's the pattern of those similarities. The article states later that it's the fact that these similarities can be classified into a hierarchy of nested groups that is key to their support of the theory of evolution. I understand the lead isn't supposed to go into all the detail that is laid out later in the article, but I still feel it's crucial to say something about how it's the nature of the similarities that's important.

I might suggest: """"A nested hierarchy of anatomical and genetic similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor through a long series of these divergent events, stretching back in a tree of life that has grown over the 3,500 million years of life on Earth."""" for that sentence.

Read very closely .
Per WP:VERIFY and WP:BURDEN, the burden of proof that the image shows Godane has already been proven through the many, upon many reliable and reputable sources. You seem to have an issue with this, therefore the onus has now been transferred to you in order to prove to the contrary, something which you have so far failed to do. 
None of the sources you have cited have explicitly denied the authenticity of the image. They have merely used a different image of Godane. This does not support your contention that the image which is being discussed here, which is used by sources more reliable and reputable (e.g United States State Department , BBC and Reuters, among others) against the sources which you have cited, of which I have not heard of any one of them ( 'Suna times' and 'Waamo news'). 
No, there are not """"multiple images on Godane"""", there are only two: The one being discussed here, and the one you consistently regurgitate. Yes, it won't make the other various portraits vanish. This still dose't help you, becuase through the above sources, it is seen which image is clearly favored by the more reliable sources. This source here,  is the only thing that you have showed me which highlights that the image may not be Godane. I bet you're smiling and clapping your hands right now that through this magical source you have proven the image is not Godane, right? WRONG. This source is meager. It is unreliable as it is questionable. The article is a blog, unworthy of proper accreditation, and it's riddled with spelling errors and grammatical errors, e.g (""""Hammami is still advocating for Robow’s troopss."""") Are you kidding me? The author can't even spell, and you're taking this blog over acclaimed sources such as Reuters or the U.S State Department. Wow is all I can say. Furthermore, the blog doesn't identity which picture is incorrect (If indeed any image is incorrect, the author never cites his source), and the article was published over a year before those media sources cited above circulated the image being discussed here. Moreover, even if the images were used prior, it still doesn't help, as the author hasn't established where he got his information from concerning this supposed 'incorrect' image of Godane. Again, you're going to have to do more digging than that in order to prove your point.
The basis that 'foreign media agencies' have no credibility on reporting in areas where local media is present is just well, stupid. By that logic, any material/information coming from any part of the world which is not from the United States, the United Kingdom or Europe already excludes many of those sources. This geographical argument is meaningless. Ok then, how about I remove all references to BBC,Reuters, Council on Foreign Relations, Brookings Institution, Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, the National Counterterrorism Center (Oh look, they use the image as well! ) and many, many more sources just becuase they are reporting from places where they are not 'based'? Hmm? Seems reasonable logical to me, if we were to follow your logic. What you are forgetting is that each news agency, no matter if its western gets its information from local sources from the places where they are covering a story or reporting from, whether that's Somalia or Timbuktu. This source for example from BBC  is from the BBC African branch, BBC Africa. They will have reporters, correspondents, sources, all across Africa. And this is only one media source. The Somalian media are going to be no more accurate than BBC Africa , as they will not have the extensive resources that the BBC have, even in Somalia but also elsewhere.
And finally, this. """"the various portraits can perhaps go in the body as StantheMan87 suggested """" -. So now you're willing to compromise? Ahh, I see! So when you find yourself in between an undeniable rock and a hard place when it comes to your POV, you finally are willing to take a compromise that was offered to you by , which you rejected? """"We can't do that"""" -.  was way to conciliatory towards you by even offering you a choice: """"What you believe should happen to the image is now up to you."""" - . I'm afraid that I'm not as conciliatory,",0

Thank you for putting that vandalism notice on 69.118.94.155's talkpage. This anon has done this countless times, won't listen to reason, and just vandalized my userpage . Please keep a close eye on him!

Thank you for reverting all of  Rainbow Sneakers 

I requested a check user, and I've found Po132 and Minun132 are the same person and Iloveminun and PokemonFan are the same person. What should I do now?  Rainbow Sneakers 

PokemonFan was used vote in a controversial TfD after Iloveminun (who nominated the template) got told to stop voting delete. PokemonFan also vandalised the user page of the admin taking part in the vote who wouldn't delete it for him. It's more of a larger problem by Iloveminun, who is trying to replace Serebii, a valued and incredibly useful website most of the actually reference, from hundreds of Pokémon articles (first he tried to remove the template that links to it manually, then from the template that produces references in all the Pokémon articles and replace it with his own website, Pokémon Galaxy. Pokémon Galaxy is not at present even finished, but it seems to be pushing it. Which is how I got caught in everything. (Bit odd how I caught the real sockpuppet when I was originally way off) Thanks,  Rainbow Sneakers 

I will. Is Minun132 being abusive? Hmm, I had missed that. Thank you for the offer, I will wait for your return since this is a new situation for me. Thanks again,  Rainbow Sneakers 

Nah, I'm writing I'm just ill. And getting sidetracked. It's nearly done. Cheers,  Rainbow Sneakers 
Is there any particular way to do it? Or do I just note notarize the points and link to the evidence?  Rainbow Sneakers 

Done, you can find it here. Sorry for the wait, I'm feeling bad and Mailer Diablo and I were discussing FAC problems. Cheers,  Rainbow Sneakers 

We did it! Thank you for all the help, I feel slightly embarrassed that someone who has been here a month in so much more knowledgable than I am in certain aspects. If you ever need a hand with something (Fair use, FAC, GA) just drop me a bell. Cheers,  Rainbow Sneakers

"Hmm, I must say I find you suggestions quite perplexing. You say that Technocrats are attempting to push they're political ideas, but if you know anything about Technocracy you will know that it is avowedly A-political or Anti-political, so I don't know where you get that idea from. As for your argument that the article shouldn't talk about Technocracy's ideas and goals, etc. well I find that a bizarre suggestion. I mean, every article on Wiki about a specific group would be expected to have info on the ideas, goals and beliefs of that group. That would be like saying that the article on say, the Republican Party (United States) (or any other group we care to mention), shouldn't have any info on what that group advocates. Obviously it should have as much info as possible, the only thing that matters is that it is presented in an accurate and neutral way.
Eh, you said there existed entries on Technocracy in some encyclopaedias, can I ask which ones? As for using them as sources, I don't think we're actually meant to use one encyclopaedia to write another, as that would be getting the info second or third had, and the other encyclopaedias must have eventually derived their knowledge of Technocracy from the movement itself and it's literature, so I see no reason not to simply present that info first had. Besides, I've not seen any online encyclopaedias that have better information about Technocracy than this article, I believe I've seen brief overviews, but nothing of any great detail (of-course if you know of any articles that have potentially useful info, then go ahead and present it).

"Irving quote 

Re: Authoritive statements of Irving in [Battle of Britain] article.

You have re-wrote the section as following:

Historian David Irving states that part of this reason was due to the totally inadequate production levels, with 250 single-engined and 64 twin-engined fighter aircraft produced on avarage per month during early 1941Irving 1974, p. 163., and that as a result, the number of German front line aircraft were declining, and this problem would not be improved until the spring of 1942, with a huge effort to expand production, reaching 1,200 by March/April 1942.Irving 1974, p. 142.

In fact, however, Irving does not make these statements. If you read the book  (which has been linked in free pdf format), here is what he writes on page 163:
On Milch’s desk there were already the most alarming reports not only of the gathering RAF bomber strength but of bomber production in America too. To him, air defence rested primarily on the fighter squadrons, but at present the Air Staff was calling for only  fighter aircraft to be produced a month. Fighter production had averaged  single- and  twin-engined aircraft a month during . Milch and his new planning chief von Gablenz wanted far greater numbers, and with more bombers as well  not only the  He s but  Ju s of the latest type as well.⁴⁰

etc.

Ie. Irving does not state 'totally inadequate production levels' (and even less, mentions bombers), this is the addition of one editor to the Irving book, which has been described as 'Milchs diary' (which is it not, either)",0

"- Everyone is missing some valuable information / pitfalls.  Let me explain:

1.) The Federal Governemnt does not automatically repay any loan deficiency, a lender can file to have any deficiency paid them via the Federal Government i.e. the FHA reserves the right to pay or not pay any shortfall

2.) These loans are extemely expensive for seniors and until regulated or limited more heavily I think they should be avoided i.e. upfront costs are absolutely too high!

3.) You may get 60% to 70% of your equity in monthly installments / payments but, you are also loosing equity in that the interest (you are not paying) is compounded on the back of the loan.  Interested is paid on the principal balance (growing each month) but also compounded on top of interest on top of interest.  So, when you get to the end of the loan you may have given up 30% to 40% of your homes equity to obtain a fraction in a monthly payout / installment.  It would be wise for seniors to sell instead of taking on this risky loan program.

4.) Seniors / borrowers of Reverse Mortgages also get hit with a monthly fee.

I think the pitfalls need to be clearly listed here so that seniors can see all the facts.  The fact is that they are only givin' the positives.",0

Re: the """"KKK"""" connection.  

As I recall, Napier forms a rebel group known as the """"Soldiers of Liberty,"""" but to maintain their cover, they only speak the initials of the organization.  I don't recall if we're told the Amtorian word for """"soldier,"""" but we do know that in their universal language, plurals are formed by adding a prefix, either """"kloo-"""" or """"kl-"""" depending upon whether the root word begins with a consonant or a vowel.  We do learn that the Amtorian for """"of"""" is """"kum.""""  Therefore, """"liberty"""" must either be a plural concept, or must begin with a """"k"""" anyawy.  So, the group is named the """"Kl-something kum K-something,"""" initials K-K-K!  We're told that's spoken kung-kung-kung on Venus rather than kay-kay-kay, by the kay ... er, way.

Wait a minute, on this basis, wouldn't just about every Amtorian organization have at least two K's in their initials? Wouldn't the K-K-K get confused with the K-K-P and the K-K-S-K and all the others.?  Hell of a way to carry on covert operations.  Sounds like that Monty Python bit about the Judean People's Front versus the People's Front of Judea and the other splitters.  (""""What!  You're from the kung-kung-kung!  How dare you?""""  """"No, I said kung-kung-bung!"""")

Ergo, it would be pretty stupid to use actual initials given a language that uses kl- before every plural noun.  

Such a language ought to sound pretty awful, and to initiate choking in the speaker whenever a long passage is spoken, but never mind.  If a language expert like Tolkein had pulled something like this, you might infer a sinister motivation, but Burroughs never let logic get in the way of entertainment, and this served him and his readers quite well.

Napier smiles in amusement when his organization is rendered as K-K-K. Given my explanation, he should have laughed out loud.  That's hardly a political endorsement. Pursuing that track is S.O.L., and that ain't Soldiers of Liberty.   05:46, 3 August 2010 (UTC""",0

 Swastika as a mnemonic device http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html 

The article needs more information about the swastika's use as a modern mnemonic device. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Rex Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by the National Socialist German workers Party as alphabetic symbolism, including meshed """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism."""" The leader of German National Socialists at that time altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  Professor Curry showed that many modern myths use a false belief that Nazis called themselves """"Nazis.""""  The myths cause widespread ignorance of the eytmology of the word """"Nazi."""" Party members called themselves """"National Socialists,"""" not """"Nazis.""""  Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas use the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not call their symbol a """"swastika.""""  Another person conceded the point with the comment that """"It does seem to be the case that the National Socialist German Workers' Party originated the 45° orientation...."""" though they did not necessarily originate that use, the German National Socialists did independently alter their use of the symbol for their specific desire to highlight the """"S"""" letter for """"socialism."""" Of course, the additional comment that they didn't use the 45 degree orientation consistently also concedes Professor Curry's work showing that their leader deliberately altered / evolved the symbol from its historic orientation into meshed """"S"""" letters for socialism. The graphic resonance is highly suggestive... and in fact it is compelling! In fact, one of the flags that Dr. Curry cites argues for that thesis: The swastika itself comprises two S's, and that is shown to have been known consciously when the German National Socialists overlay two additional S's for another group (as German National Socialists had other examples of similar alphabetic symbolism). Hitler even altered his own signature to reflect the same """"S"""" for socialism and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html The leader of the German Socialists had no reason to harp on this idea because he was an ex-artist. Nevertheless, he did allude to the alphabetic symbolism in his own comments in his notorious book. Of course, he would not drone on about it just as he did not drone on about what the stylized """"SA"""" symbol meant, or the side-by-side """"SS"""" symbol, or the """"VW"""" (all of which other writers concede for some inconsistent reason). The only reason it is so hard for most people to understand today is because they have been trained to use the hackneyed shorthand for the Party and most people are ignorant of the name of the actual Party, and thus have no idea that the Party actually espoused a dogma that they called """"Socialism."""" Even to this day, people repeatedly delete Dr. Curry's work in an effort to perpetuate the ignorance and the myths.""",0

 Article Clean-up

 Co-host auditions

Incomplete Segment List

I noticed last time that there was a complete list of segments that were there before AOTS started its new set. Now after they got back from E3 and the new set took effect, some of the segments are gone, both former and current. In order for a wii to be effective and accurate, ALL of the segments, including those that are deleted, should be listed. So somebody needs to add the deleted segments there please.  

I cleaned up the section around that time and deleted segments that didn't need to be listed on the article. There were also a lot of segments listed that only happened once or twice. Also there were a lot of skits listed as well which are not segments. I think after a certain period of time old segments probably won't be relevant to the article. -

 Article Cleanup Co-Ordination Point 

 Cleanup Co-ordination This article has recently been tagged as requiring cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards.
The article may have been flagged as needing cleanup because it has been suggested that:
the article needs formatting, proofreading, or rephrasing in comprehensible English. 
the article has multiple overlapping problems. 
the article is very short and might need expanding, removal or merging with a broader article
For a full list of possible problems see Wikipedia:Manual of Style.

You can use this section to discuss possible resolution of the problem and achieve consensus for action. When there is a consensus that the article is cleaned up please remove the cleanup tag from the articleDiscussion
To be honest, I do not know why this was tagged as needing cleanup. I think the information is laid out pretty much as well as could be. I do feel that the History section needs work, but everything else looks fine (and the tables listing the show's features are quite excellent), so I don't think a cleanup tag on the aritcle as a whole is necessary. However, I am not going to simply remove it, as others may disagree with me.   

I got the botmessage on my Talk Page when I logged in today, and it said that this  article needed cleanup. I checked it, thinking someone had shifted the tables all around or made all of the paragraphs single-sentence rambles... But it was essentially the same as it always was: tables in good shape, information about the cast, etc. This might never be a complete article (seeing as it airs 5 nights a week) but I don't think a """"Cleanup"""" tag is necessary in this case. Maybe something more specific is required, but I would support deleting the tag.  

Still has the cleanup message, and I don't know why. It's not like the page is getting vandalized; it was put on Semi-Protection on January 26th. Any thoughts on this? The article can never really be """"complete"""", since the show is an ongoing process.

"Another issue / suggestion 

I noticed another issue that I guess it's not listed anywhere: when some articles start getting big and full of information, wikipedia users refrain from deleting weak or even nonsense parts. They believe it's good to keep all that (useless?) stuff, probably reasoning that some information is better than none. That's why many many articles get huge and are tagged to need the attention of an expert (who would hopefully clean up all the junk).

I strongly disagree with this behavior of keeping junk on the main page. I guess the editing system should allow two versions of an article: the main one, with the information that was agreed by everyone (intersection of information) and another, longer one with all the possible information for that subject (union of information). In this way people would not be so afraid of deleting junk because it would be stored on the second page, and the main article would always be a cleaned up version, which, if not complete, at least would not fail on quality.",0

 Whoops. Nice job, kiddo. 

You said, one some poor guy's talk page:

I hope you will use this block time to consider a few matters that could make you a better editor, should you decide to continue. First, Wikipedia editors aren't nearly as stupid as you think they are. We include many people with advanced degrees who work in scholarly professions. Many of us can see through the kind of lies that you tried to use better than we can see through glass. Secondly, disruptive editing, lying, and attempts to sabotage the system not only get you into trouble, they also defeat the very goals that you are trying to achieve. If MattyBraps is deleted, one of the major reasons (but certainly not the only reason) is your behavior as creator of the article. You did serious damage to your own efforts to keep the article on Wikipedia. And finally, take some time to read Wikipedia policies. Start with WP:5P, and every time you see a blue link, click it and read what you see. If you can do these things, you might stand a chance of becoming a good editor. Otherwise, you need to move on to somewhere else to spend your time. Think about it.   

I would contend that Wikipedia editors are, in fact, as stupid as I suspect, as you still fail to grasp that the BT guy and I (the IP user you believe he sockpuppeted) are not the same person. All it took was me mirroring the way he types, pretending to be angry, and claiming """"I made the [Mattybraps] page,"""" and boom, I got him blocked. Thanks for helping me settle a bet about whether or not I could get the creator of the Mattyb wikipedia page (it's an embarrassment that it exists) banned inside of a week.

 The various local government areas pages only list them.  I was thinking something like that.  These three paragraphs are from a couple of papers I wrote, they can be incorporated into the article.  

The states (and territories) run the majority of the government in Australia and devolve some of this power down to local government, local councils.  Because this devolution of power happens on a state by state basis, in different states, the local councils have different powers.  Though generally they provide water, sewerage and look after local roads, with the states looking after health, education, police and so on.

Tasmania, like the other states, has a constitution.  Unlike the Australian constitution the Tasmanian one is simply an act of parliament, as such to change it requires no more then a majority in the parliament, not a referendum.  This constitution (among other things) establishes local government in Part """"IVA - Local Government"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  However, this part while establishing the fact that councils will exist, leaves open how they are operated and what their powers are.  Both the system and power of the councils being provided by the """"Parliament ... from time to time"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  It is the """"Local Government Act 1993"""" (referred hereafter to as either the 'LGA' or 'the act') that currently provides for the creation of the various councils, the role of the councillors, what power the councils have and so on.  

The act requires that the various councils """"provide for the health, safety and welfare of the community"""", """"represent and promote the interests of the community"""", and """"provide for the peace, order and good government of the municipal area"""".  Generally the act permits councils to """"do anything necessary or convenient to perform its functions either within or outside its municipal area"""".  Specifically, the act provides for the various councils to have the following powers (among others): to charge land rates, """"service rates"""", special rates and to levy fines (in relation to by-laws); and, to make by-laws in respect to anything the council has power to do.

Hi

Not that I know what I'm talking about, but I was very confused to see the late Queen Mother listed as a C.C. under her Christian, maiden name.  She was once the Queen Consort of Canada, and she was in any event married, so I would expect her to be listed under her regnal name, or (if the Order of Canada has gone democratic) at least as Elizabeth Bowles-Lyon Windsor, odd as that sounds.  As I say, though, I'm an American, so I am clueless.  Could explain this to me please? Thanks,",0

Yes, In 1818, Moshoeshoe I consolidated various Basotho groupings and became their King.

 Problematic character analysis

I have removed this unsourced sentence from the Origins section of the article, for the following reasons:
As the lede states, the characters in qilin can also be written with the """"horse"""" radical 馬 (maybe a more recent, less traditional variant, but this would have to be addressed, and sourced).

there is no electron

2) Maxwells electromatetic theory is in direct violation of electron theory. Most notably from his theory displacement current is still taught as mainstream science. Source physics Textbook 
3) In chemisty the number of electrons leaving a mass is determined by the voltage Source: chemistry textbook 
4) In induction physics, the current is determined by the number of coils in the winding source: physics textbooks 
5) In circiut theory the current is determined by the load Source: also physics textbook 
6) these three things are all different 
7) In the power industry, there is also something called """"current draw"""" which is a current not determined by the load but the power supply Source: Con Edison training manual 
8) All of these things with the exception of 7 are excepted theories of science that contflict with the electron. Number 4 and 5 conflict with number 3 which is part of the definition of the electron. 
Known people in the scientific community who said that they did not hold electrons to be true without proof(or admitted there existance to be different than that of mainstream science)

1) Albert Einstien said that their existance was different 
2) Max Planck said that he would not hold it to be true without proof 
3) Faraday was totally against the idea before it ever came out

 The reasons I dont contribute to Wikipedia anymore 
Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology.  I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance. So thank you for giving me one more reason not to contribute to wikipedia.

The collapsible boxes contain information that serves as an addendum to what is in the article. It adds to the reading experience by making the page neater. The example I used with the """"Genes"""" is a prime example, looking at that abortion is enough to give somebody a headache.

That is an interesting spin on your earlier comment: my views have """"zero validity"""" on my talk page, but """"100% validity"""" at an RFC. I am not sure I can make a cogent response to these conflicting statements.
In answer to your question, I think it important to maintain clear personal boundaries when it comes to disputes between editors. Not accepting personal attacks is one such boundry, another is courtesy, and another is mutual respect. If these personal boundries break down, subsequent discussion can degenerate into generalised mudslinging, which I think is what happened with the RFC's I have been the subject of. These RFC's have brought accusations that are too generalised to either prove or refute. As a generalisation, it is generally a good idea to avoid accusations based on generalisations, because I would end up being painted in a bad light whether I particiated or not.  
With regard to the RFC, the lack of courtesy shown by not being notified of a draft being started is indicative of a lack of respect for myself, or at least that is my personal view (valid or not). Evidence support this view is indicated by the fact that if the proposers of the RFC were really interested in resolving their personal disagreements with me, they would have brought their pet peeves to this talk page first, and we could resolve them in an amicable way. Unfortunetly, that did not happen. I can only speculate why, but I think it has something to do with the inabilty of a group of editors (myself included) not being able to come to shared understanding of how notability applies to certain topics.
I am a reasonable editor, and I am confident when it comes to disputes (personal or editorial), a that shared understanding of the issues involved can be reached. But it can only come about in an atmosphere of mutual respect and courtesy. (talk|contribs) """,0

 BLACK DAHLIA MURDER IS NOT 'MELODIC DEATH METAL'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE DEATHCORE PUSSIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Black Dahlia Murder IS NOT Melodic Death Metal. They are the farthest band from that genre. Black Dahlia Murder are pieces of shit scene bitches that are trying to be """"METAL"""" along with all of the other Deathcore/Grindcore bands like Job For A Cowboy, Suicide Silence, etc. Fuck all of them! They aren't true Metal and they never will be, they need to stick to what they know...American Eagle, MTV, and all of their other lame trends. Melodic Death Metal is Scar Symmetry, In Flames, Sonic Syndicate, and Disarmonia Mundi. Melodic Death Metal is REAL music, it's not a disgrace to music like Deathcore and Grindcore.

I will continue to change Black Dahlia CUNT'Murder's genre to Deathcore/Grindcore, I don't give a shit..I'm not letting you stupid scene bitches take away the only thing that you and the Mainstream hasn't destroyed and that's the amazing genre of Melodic Death Metal. So fuck all of you trendy conformists, go fucking die.

Black Dahlia Murder are Deathcore pussies that need to be beheaded, them and all of the other Deathcore bands that are ruining Metal.

Deathcore is the biggest piece of shit I've ever heard...it shouldn't even be considered music, it's a bunch of pussy scene kids trying to be """"METAL"""". Deathcore and Grindcore are the two worst forms of music ever invented.

So yeah, you can listen to Deathcore if you enjoy hearing """"music"""" that has no tempo or beat to it whatsoever, they pretty much just hit random shit on the drums and play random notes on the Guitar while the vocalist does terrible random screaming and pig squels. Don't forget the hillarious millions of breakdowns they put into their songs.

""""DA...THIS SONG IS CALLED BIG FUCKING TREE!""""

""""Ya boi....we are so down wit American Eagle..ya boi, my hair does that flippy thing.. RAWR RAWR RAWR I'M SO LYK HARDCORES OMGZ@!!!@@!!!! GAGES AND SNAKE BITES RAWWWRRR""""

Fuck Job for a Cowboy and Black Dahlia Murder, trendy pieces of shit.

Melodic Death Metal owns all. 

There really isn't much of a difference between any """"Deathcore"""" band for that matter, they are all just a bunch of pussies that are trying to fit in with this new trend of trying to be a """"Metal"""" band.

So please don't try to tell me """"OH...YOUR STUPID...THE BANDS AREN'T THE SAME.""""

Ok, so maybe....JUST MAYBE.. Job For A Cowboy's vocalist does 3 more pig squels in a second than the vocalist from Black Dahlia Murder, there I said it! I guess they aren't all the same!!!! Oh dear fuck ..... And my bad...my bad, White Chapel actually does 200 breakdowns in a minute rather than Suicide Silence's 100 breakdowns in a minute. My bad dude you were right all along!! Deathcore and Grindcore bands aren't all the same!!!!!!!!!

But seriously, the genre is pure shit and is just another trend in the music industry that bands are following to """"make it to the top"""" and to fit in with the rest of the bands these days.

I mean, I have nothing against every band in a certain genre sounding the same or anything, but when the """"music"""" of the genre they produce is pure shit and can be done by any living human being on Earth...then I have to draw the line. It doesn't take much talent to do shittty raw screaming, hit random notes on a guitar, and hit your double bass pedal at like 500bpm.

Another reason why I don't take any bands from this genre seriously is their hillarious excuses for a """"band logo"""".

They try oh so hard to be """"HARDDCOREEEEE"""".

I also find it funny that all of these pussy bands have names like, """"ANAL CUNT"""" or """"DEAD DEATH BLOODY DEAD HAND"""".

Fact is, any band that produces """"music"""" under this genre sucks and is just trying to fit-in.

"Photos
Hi. On the Wikipedia: WikiProject Christian Metal talk page you said that you've been an photographer for Cornerstone festival for years and could provide photos. Basically any band on the List of Christian metal bands that don't have a free photo could use one. Do you have photos for, say, Tourniquet, Deliverance, Saviour Machine, Antestor, Extol, Crimson Moonlight, Crimson Thorn, Circle of Dust, Barren Cross, Stryper, Bride or some other that have performed at Cornerstone? If you wish to provide one or more photos, I could help you adding them to Wikimedia Commons. Basically that just needs your permission.",0

ive posted this on the clairvoyance talk page after someone completely removed the clar#irsentience article which had gone through a process of months of work , rewrites , endless discussion , removasl of personal matereal , edits for style and content .... endless work on correct sourcing and wikpedia referencing and formatting.....  the article which had been arrived at with co operation and discussion over many weeks and v man who himself put some hours into grammer , punctuation ... re editting for stlye and content ... and much help in correct sourcing and referencing  .....

this article was the sum  of many peoples input , effort and hard work  so i dont know how or who removed it so thoughtlessly and put the meaningless redirect to the clairvoyance page... any help would be great.... cheers.. 

hi guys

i see youve redirected  the clairsentience article.... let me ask....what was the point of the weeks of discussions and rewrites if you guys were going to redirect it anyway....you should have told me t get lost out of here...... what was the point of it all?  why did i listen to you ? at all?  why did i remove all personal references?  why did i reference and source all of my matereal diligently and in great detail ?  why did i edit and re edit for style and content ?  why did i make additional references to religios , anthropological ,socialogical , philosophical ,medical , physics , chemistry , botany , mental health etc  so that all views were included and respected?  why did i fulfill all of the above hurdles and hoops to fulfill wikpedia formatting and guidlines for you too to delete months of hard work and effort.  your actions are without integrity or honour .....
clairsentience article redirect ?

Hi ..... whoever removed the clairsentience article and made it redirect ... can you please try and respect that the article that was there had evolved over a couple of months of discussion and many rewrites and multiple edits which involved much discussion over a long period......
.........i could delete this clairvoyance article.... but i wont because revert and delete wars then stupidly take place   which is a real shame when a library becomes a bar room brawl......

..... i hope you can respect the clairsentience article...

..... ive been clairsentient for most of my adult life and it wasnt easy to come this far and to struggle for  decades to articulate my experience in a way which makes rational sense to the world at large of which the clairsentience article is a manifest example..... so please try and respect the vast amount of struggle and work which has gone into it....",0

 Re: Thanks for restoring links 
Hi; you're quite welcome. I didn't think you removed the interlanguage links intentionally. The spam/vandalism was indeed added by 221.197.20.66—the same spammer/vandal returned today via 221.198.74.212. Since this is an obvious (and shameless) attempt to use Wikipedia to increase the page ranking of the spammer's website (see Wikipedia:Spam), I've put in a request at m:Non-development tasks for developers#Spam regex requests to have the domain shop263.com added to the project-wide spam filter. With any luck, a developer will see the request before too long. Once the domain is on the filter, a page containing the domain cannot be saved (annoyingly, there are ways to get around this, but it usually takes care of the problem).

Anyway, nice work on the rewrite. I hope you like it here and choose to stick around! Cheers,   07:32, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)

 Zone system 

I would appreciate your leaving the mention in. First Ansel Adams, in his three volume 1980 basic photography series, presented the Zone system this way and he explicitly said, in so many words, that his aim is not to force his own system of photography on anyone, but to encourage photographers to better understand their equipment in order to control the finished photograph. He disapproved of winging it, not of any particular system. The Zone system worked for him. And the Zone system is controversial, believe it or not. I know of at least one vocational school photography teacher (years ago when I lived in Montreal) who told students not to bother with it, and it seems he was not alone. 

Also, please wait a few days before doing a major edit job. I liked the article as it used to be and I was sorely tempted to revert most of your changes, but did not. I particularly liked the wording """"dynamic range"""" and miss it, and I'm sorry to say I now personally find the article less approachable to a newcomer. 

Dynamic range is very appropriate: for instance (I'm making numbers up here for the sake of argument) if we say reality has a Zone 0 to X range of 1 to 100,000 , then a finished print has a range of 1 to 10,000 , while a typical digital camera will only provide a range of 1 to 1,000 . A move from 100,000 to 10,000 to 1,000 seems pretty dynamic to me...

However, since I'm not going to reread the whole Basic Photography series or even go into a darkroom again (space is at a premium in Tokyo) I'm not willing to put too much effort into maintaining this page.  05:52, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)

Hi Vincent:
Which idea, specifically, did you wish to restore to the zone system article? That the zone system is/was not advocated by all? (I'd say that's probably true for most any school of thought.) That Ansel Adams was not dogmatic about this being the only way to do things? (I'd say that unless there is a large public misimpression that he was dogmatic it's not worth mentioning, no more than it's necessary to mention that every painter or sculptor or engineer held other approaches to various disciplines were equally valid.)

Here's the problem with """"dynamic range,"""" Vincent: it's inaccurate jargon. (It's oft-used and familiar jargon, but sloppy and inaccurate nonetheless.) First, it's redundant. The meaning most attribute to """"dy",0

The message you left me was rather offensive, it's not like I'm vandalising Wikipedia. 77.250.200.70  
The fact that it is so famous is of extremely important encyclopedic value, since most readers will have no knowledge of the fact that the Ajax Academy is any more important than the Chelsea Academy (for example). The Chelsea Academy has in fact been modeled on the Ajax academy, and has been implemented by Piet de Visser and Henk ten Cate (well until Grant was fired). The Barcelona academy was totally based on the Ajax Academy and was implemented when Cruyff was manager there. These are historical facts and it's not like I'm some kind of marketing executive from Dubai trying to say that Manchester City has the best academy ever. Incidentally, the Ajax Academy in it's current form was originally set up by Rinus Michels, who is credited with the invention of a major football tactic known as """"Total Football"""" (as played by Ajax, Barcelona, and Arsenal today) and was named """"coach of the century"""" by FIFA in 1999. It is not a peacock term if it has been widely recognised and acknowledged and can be referenced by multiple sources like the BBC and Fifa. 77.250.200.70  """,0

Remember how viruses work: They are merely little bits of genetic material that """"hijack"""" the host cell's mechanisms and cause the host cell to start cranking out many, many new copies of the virus. Eventually, the host cell bursts, releasing all the new virions (virus particles) to go infect new hosts.

"While the overly simplistic capitalist view I expressed may seem naive it would also be naive to assume that there is such a solution.  While there are exceptions to every rule it is generally a good assumption that price and performance will diverge.  Unless the answer is exceedingly simple and cheap you will be at a competitive disadvantage if only because you have research and development expenses to cover in the sale of your product.

Debate of market economics aside (as this is not the place), I still feel the last sentence is either not very encyclopedic (lack of supporting research or citation) or not clearly conveying its message and therefore should be removed.  I would gladly cede this argument in the face of evidence that such a product existed, but a quick search for such research did not reveal any.

Bad LOGIC

=Progressivism
On the progressivism and economic progressivism pages  some editors have deleted criticism on the following grounds.

1.  The article needs to be expanded first.
2.  The article needs to be improved first.
3.  Criticsm section puts undo weight on negatives.

Well I say this logic leads to only one outcome, the articles purpose is to argue the point which is a violation of NPOV.

1.  If the article needs expanding, expand it...criticism also helps expand.  THe purpose of the article is to report all the facts not just the facts in favor of the article title.
2.  The article is improved just by including a criticism section.  Again, THe purpose of the article is to report all the facts not just the facts in favor of the article title. Deleting the criticism on the grounds that the article needs to be improved suggests the only way to improve the article is by aruging the point. Again, violation of NPOV.
3.  Criticism does not put undo weight on negatives. Again the purpose of the article is not to argue the point of progressivism but to report the facts.
4.  The fact is criticism exists and it should be reported.  The criticism section included an AUthor and his book.
5.  The addition of a pov original research counter arguement to the criticism further proves my point (And you can look on the history page) that they believe the purpose of the article is to argue the point rather than report the facts.

All were poorly reasoned excuses to delete material they objected to.  These editors are not trying to preserve the integrity of wikipedia or be """"Fair and balanced"""" they are simply trying to push a leftist political objective by censoring any alternative regardless of the source.

Classical Liberalism

Editor Slizor has deleted several sections and paragraphs which were cited and refrenced, including quotes from economists and think tanks on various things which Slizor has expressed disagreement with.  Dispite these citations, he deleted the material on the grounds that what he believes is the truth does not fit the facts provided.  He claims, dispite contradictory evidence and no evidence of his own that classical liberals have nothing in common with libertarians.  That classical liberals are not inheritors of liberalism.  and that modern liberals do not have a different understanding of liberalism than 200 years ago.  Furthermore, he makes the original research pov claim that classical liberals are more like elitist Republicans than libertarians (for which he has NO CITATION, and this is one of the grounds for the deletions).

This is just another example of the abuse some wiki editors will make up in order to push their own agenda.

The logic is poor.  The citation is non existant.  The pov is massive.  Slizor's edit needs a massive revert...and he needs to be drawn away from his computer and beaten with Milton Friedman and FA Hayek books until he understands the quotes from their books that he deleted.  ( )""",0

LOOK HERE AND EXPLAIN YOURSELF:

Vandalism is any addition, removal, or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia. The most common types of vandalism include the addition of obscenities or crude humor, page blanking, or the insertion of nonsense into articles.

Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated. Not all vandalism is obvious, nor are all massive or controversial changes vandalism. Careful attention needs to be given to whether changes made are beneficial, detrimental but well intended, or outright vandalism.**

"Purposeful misinformation on the Orban page 

Hi - I noticed by chance that earlier this month a user from Malaysia decided to use a modified version of the script of the Fetih 1453 movie to alter the text of the Orban article. He continued with some minor changes and someone else just did another grammar change. The modifications are both unsubstantiated and ridiculous (both in terms of the language used and the obvious ideological angle).

I am hoping you can help since I am already seeing people outside of WP cite the article (which is how I noticed it).

Please read the relevant guideline, which is WP:EL.  Basically, there is no way to add that link.  We are not a linking site.  The only way that link could possibly appear would be if Dedalo were itself notable enough for an article.  This would only be if Dedalo had been discussed, several times, significantly, in reliable, independent sources.  So, if there are news articles or trade journals that discuss Dedalo (please note that press releases don't count), then we could consider making an article on Dedalo. If Dedalo does not rise to that level of importance, then it's somewhat possible that there could be a discussion of """"software used for ICH"""" in the ICH article.  You should discuss that with other editor's on that articles talk page.  You'll still need at least one reference in a reliable source to include the info, and you will not be able to add a direct link to the Dedalo website.  
Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that Wikipedia articles should have as few links as possible, and those links have to be absolutely critical to the topic at hand.  Sure, many articles violate this rule, but they're not supposed to.   """,0

Attention: Sandra [[User:69.11.10.188|

When indicating """"passing"""" in your statement above, could you please respond to the following questions re:the various registries you have referenced:

1)What do you mean by """"passing"""". Do the registries disallow breeding of dogs who have higher than your indicated ratings?  How do the registries gather the individual scores of each of their breeding dogs? How do the registries """"enforce"""" these requirements?

2) Could you state what testing organization(s)are accepted by each registry for these """"passing"""" grades?  Your """"grades"""" indicate they are probably OFA scores, but how are Penn-Hip scores treated in the registries, since this testing is also being used with Shiloh Shepherds, from what has been previously mentioned in this discussion?

3) What are your references for your gathered information; that is to say, what are the web page addresses for the various registries where this info is stated as required/enforced/recommended?

4) Most importantly, since the term """"required"""" calls for a resource by which adherence to this """"requirement"""" can be enforced, could you also please provide  the resources through which interested puppy buyers can confirm testing results for the individual dogs (or their parentage) they are interested in purchasing.  Whether claimed as required or not by whichever registries or breeders, these claims have no value (other than through """"blind trust"""") to potential puppy buyers unless they have an opportunity to verify the results themselves through independent means.

In other words, if a reader wants to research the hip """"grades"""" of the parents of a puppy they are considering buying (not generic group testing results) would you please indicate where that information can be found for each of the registries (NSBR, ISSR, TSSR)?  
 
Example: 

NSBR - Hip registration is primarily through OFA. To view OFA's hip information on NSBR dogs, please view website address www.xxxxxx.org""""
      AND
ISSR -  Hip registration is through OFA and Penn-Hip. To view OFA's hip information on ISSR dogs, please view website address www.xxxxxx.org. To view Penn-Hip's hip information on ISSR dogs, please view website address www.zzzzz.org  """"
      AND
TSSR - Hip registration is conducted through XXXX, however individual results are provided to prospective and current puppy owners by submitting a Request for Health Results Form, available at www.TSSR.com/Request for Health info.
 
4)If verification of these requirements for the registries is not published nor can be obtained in writing, would you also please indicate this policy.

If you can only provide resource information for a registry you are affiliated with, I would then ask that other discussion participants (i.e. registry members or non-affiliated breeders) provide this information and their policies in answer to my requests above.

Thank you very kindly. M.Dùfy

I think you need to request major intervention by moderators on this topic. """,0
"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE

a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?

b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. 

c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.

d. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.

e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.

Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.

So now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.

Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.

So GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.

I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.

While some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.

Now I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.

Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.

Now Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.

The fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.

9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.

2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.

So 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.

My site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. 

Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due",1

An unregistered editor keeps adding climate data to the article, but I have removed it because it isn't clear where the data has been gathered.

It is quite likely the data was gathered at a weather station such as on the Isle of Portland or at Yeovilton in Somerset, and because of this I consider it misleading to the reader to present the info in the article as if it applied specifically to Chideock.In addition, some of the text added by the unregistered editor was not supported by the source - for example, the claim that Chideock is one of the sunniest places in the UK.

 Would you take on a project?? 

There are two users, currently both with a week-long block for edit warring over an article Che Guevara (photo), although the blocking admin is vacillating, suggesting an RFC which I know is useless. One of the editors, User:Redthoreau, I tangled with a while ago and ultimately ended up nominating the article in question for FAR, Wikipedia:Featured article review/Che Guevara/archive1. The other editor User:Damiens.rf I don't know, but his current complain is that 61 quotations in an article is too many. 

The blocking admin User talk:EdJohnston wants to handle the situation constructively but does not know how. I suggested to him that someone like you, an experienced editor might be willing to be a neutral editor between the two, focused on article quality.

I suggested you (and perhaps also User talk:Geometry guy) to direct the warring editors to concentrate on article quality. My experience in the past with User:Redthoreau is that he does rather well when a """"father figure"""" type takes an interest. Some of his obnoxiousness, I believe, is due to youthful aggression and ignorance. I think he would respond positively to someone whose goal was to produce a quality article. As he dominates all things Guevara, the only way to improve the Guevara articles on Wikipedia is to move  Redthoreau over onto the side of the forces of good.

Since the focus would just be this one article, and your job would be to render advice/judgement on article criteria, I think the job would not be unduly burdensome. Redthoreau had a past mentor-like relationship with User:Coppertwig and did very well when pointed in the right direction behaviourally. (Of course, you may not be quite the right model there!)

Would you consider taking on this project? It might be just up your alley. I figure that since Redthoreau is not going to go away, he may as well put all that energy into writing articles that don't have 61 quotations in them. How about it?  — (Talk) """,0

"Parishan, the claim indeed is true and you are actually not saying the truth, the evidence above gives examples of dozens of articles, not one. And your claim of double standards was being brought which you failed to address convincingly. The Azeri term is the Turkic term; Jerusalem’s foreign names are there for a reason. All Persian, Urdu and Hindi qualify as such because they are relevant and present in several historic documents, maps and manuscripts influencing other languages words for the place. There is no proper Azeri distinct term for the place, it is the official Islamic term and the variants are either Turkish or Persian. We can write Jerusalem in Zulu language too, it doesn’t mean it has any historic or notable value. The evidence above documents that the edit happened in a period when you have found various articles where Armenian terms were present and added Azeri terms when it was not relevant. It was explained to you that the Armenian term for Jerusalem was present because there is an Armenian Quarter in Old Jerusalem and there are manuscripts dating back to a millennium and a half. As for the notability, if you’d have taken the time to read others concerns, you will actually remember one example, in which it was asked to you to provide another source while you were stuck to one article in Azerbaijani admitting to have nothing else.

snakes have a special little bone the skull connected to the lower jaw and

bone to be analyzed by the snake's inner ear. This function picks up

Good afternoon DreamGuy. I would like to reply to the message you left me since I could not do so privately in e-mail. Please feel free to delete this whenever you are through with it. I rather think posting those links in commercial and personal spaces are acceptable and based on the rules of Wikipedia are not out of line. If posting them on all sub-links of Savannah as points of interest is wrong, I am sorry, but it seemed pertinent to me, especially since there is hardly any other information on those pages.

Why you chose to pick those two links, out of many commercial and non-commercial links on the pages to dispute, I have no idea. I am sorry if you have a problem with ghost books but this one is directly related to Savannah, Georgia so it seems to me that this link would be the last one you would erase off the Savannah page.

 Cultural depictions of Johannes Gutenberg 

I've started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia's Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on in popular culture information.  I started that last year while I raised Joan of Arc to featured article when I created Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc, which has become a featured list.  Recently I also created Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great out of material that had been deleted from the biography article.  Since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion, I'd like to suggest this approach as a model for the editors here.  Regards, ''' 

Clean-up and changes by Mukerjee Oct 18

A number of changes were made and the article was considerably cleaned up on
Oct 18:

 The claims of printing in Korea and China, largely unreferenced were referenced with extensive quotations
 The Biography section which was only a paragraph with other fragments scattered elsewhere was cleaned up (but still needs work). 
 The contributions of Gutenberg as the father of the printing press and a leading catalyst of the Renaissance have been under challenge from a number of quarters, this was presented with documentation
 The possibility that East-West traffic over the two preceding centuries of the Mongol Empire may have led to some knowledge in Europe of movable type  was introduced 
 A number of sentences and structures (such as the unwieldy initial paragraphs) were copyedited ruthlessly, merged with other fragments, and cleaned up. 

User Dicklyon reverts with the comment: too much of a change to do without discussion. 
This is not a criteria in Wikipedia, where ruthless editing is consistently
encouraged. 

Please justify in what way these changes are inappropriate and merge them by
putting in extensive work instead of just a revert. 

I am reverting back to the new version which certainly reads better, and has 
far better referencing and citations than the present version.  Please give
your reasons here; please do not blindly revert; edit''' the text 
to merge the elements you don't agree with.   It does not make sense to keep
the older inferior version that people are working with still.   

Such an extensive edit that throws out the stable work of many editors over many months, with no chance for incremental review and collaboration, is just too disruptive and disrespectful, in my opinion.  But I'll let someone else decide now whether to revert you again.  I recommend a revert, followed by you re-integrating changes piece by piece, with time between for reactions and negotiations.  

p.s. We don't need weasle words in the lead.  If it is verfiably true that """"Even within Europe, there are those who claim that Laurens Janszoon Coster of Holland may have used movable types earlier,"""" then you have to say WHO makes such a claim, and give a verifiable reference for it.  The things I have read about Coster did NOT say that anyone actually claims or believes that, only that it was a local legend for a while.  

I understand your angst at having many microscopic changes gone.  But the so-called """"stable"""" version read rather poorly, and at least the English and the flow is a lot cleaner.  There were repeated references (e.g. two consecutive parags referred to his family in Biog; the A&E; award had two references, etc), there were poor constructs,
and of course, the referencing was admittedly poor.  So please try to look at the whole picture.  Wikipedia says it right up front - edit the page only if you don't mind others """"ruthlessly"""" editing your text. 
As for the weasel word issue, this is what the current version reads (pls see the Biography section) - these were edits that were made before your comment here:

His business partner was Johann Fust who was more of a banker than a printer, but a 1568 history by Hadrianus Junius of Holland claims that the basic idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from Laurens Janszoon Coster via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster around 1940 and may have brought some of his equipment to Mainz",0

 Identity of the designer 

The paragraph just above the heading """"Origins of the term"""" states:

""""Intelligent design deliberately does not try to identify or name the specific agent of creation — it merely states that one (or more) must exist. Although intelligent design itself does not name the designer, the personal view of many proponents is that the designer is the Christian god.[34][22][35] Whether this was a genuine feature of the concept or just a posture taken to avoid alienating those who would separate religion from the teaching of science has been a matter of great debate between supporters and critics of intelligent design. The Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District court ruling held the latter to be the case.""""

The above statement contains a popular misconception about the identity of the designer. ID leaders have indeed named the designer. 

The article's reference #34 above is to Dembski's 1999 Touchstone article in which he says that """"intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory."""" When Dembski said that, he was identifying, indeed defining, the designer as not only God but Jesus Christ, to which """"Logos"""" refers in the Gospel of John, as Barbara Forrest points out on pp. 3-4 of her paper http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/intelligent-design.pdf.

See also the article's reference #142 at pp. 39-40 of """"Is It Science Yet?

The Yemen times article is full of misinformation (950 AD? Ethiopian civilization starting in 500 AD? Maybe they meant BC, but still, Ethiopian civilization is older than that. Good job on finding the link by Negash, I've seen it before and it's informative on the post-Aksumite and Zagwe period. It has nothing to do with Sheba, however, as that happened (if it even did) ca.1000-950 BC, not AD. The first one is rather odd because it's written by the same person who wrote Aksum. I can't really comment on it, but no one has ever said that D`mt was founded by Sabaeans, as it predates the Sabaean migration by a few centuries. I'm not sure why he assumes that all of the 500 BC inscriptions in Sabaean (does he mean script or language?) were made by Sabaeans either, since Ethiopians used the same script...

{{unblock|1=
Ruslik0 is incorrect in his block of me. I wasn't edit waring as defined by Wikipedia: I made one reversion of an edit today.

Furthermore, Ruslik0 is incorrect that I made a false accusation regarding the objective fact that Jeffro77 is engaging in vandalism: Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of """"WP:FRINGE,"""" which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.

In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""". Whereas the version before was properly cited: """"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.""""

As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

Additionally, while Jeffro77's """"fringe"""" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, """"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,"""" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals). The Wikipedia article on the Omega Point Theory lists seven different mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journals in which Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been published (and that's not including the Zygon journal). That is quite a significant amount.

Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger
I reverted your edit because you just destroyed the continuity of that section. 

As for your claims, I don't see any standards/templates set for what a player's season recap should include. I know the team season recaps are very suspect in not giving out much information, and certaintly not enough for individual players. I think those articles are poorly done, and I'm not interested in improving them. I do not like the prose-style recaps on this site because it becomes way too boring to read line after line of """"In week X of the XXXX season, Player X did this and that against Team X in a XX-XX win/loss..."""" For the longest time that's how Drew Brees' 2009 season (a great individual season that deserves better writing) read. It still has some of those problems. 

The way I've done it gives it structure. You don't have to repeat who the opponent was, what week it was or the result. And these are NFL players. They'll play 16 games a year, 20 at the most with the playoffs. I'm not writing what a NBA or MLB player did in 82 or 162 games. It's a small sample. Write a sentence or two for each game and you're talking 16-40 sentences at the most. Hardly creates a long section.

I really suggest you look at Denard Robinson (Michigan QB) and his current season recap. He has sub-sections with lots of text for each individual game this year. And you know what, I don't see anyone changing it or complaining about it. It doesn't bother me. While I would never make anything like that for the NFL players (so don't get worried), I have to say their info is written pretty well and it's sourced and everything. That much info on one game is pretty crazy, but you know what, where are the restrictions on space?

Come on man, this is the internet. We're not limited to page restrictions for some paper encyclopedia. The space is there. I'll make sure to refrain from any further mention of team-oriented things like """"going on a bye week"""", but other than that, the text has been about Ben, so it's on topic and referenced. I don't see the big deal, and I can't say I'm seeing other people questioning it besides yourself. I didn't even start Manning's 2010 season using it because I was waiting to see what kind of season he was having, but someone else went ahead and formatted it that way today. Looks fine to me. And since there's been free reign given on these kind of sections, again, I don't see the problem.   """,0

"Meijer Gardens, American Horse, Statue copyright
Hi Asher196. I have come here to follow up with you about Image:MeijerGardensAmericanHorse.jpg‎. I used to contribute a lot of images to wikipedia, back about a year and a half ago I would make trips to specific locations to take high quality pictures for inclusion on Wikipedia. In doing so, I learned more about copyright of photography than most lawyers do (because most lawyers do not work in the copyright space). Suffice to say that your perception of image copyright is an incorrect one. A summary of image copyright has been written elsewhere far better than I can try here, but i am so out of practice on WP I cannot find it. First, please carefully read the copyright template that I have placed upon this image. The image is copyrighted because it is a 2d representation of a 3d statue. Statues, just like paintings, soda can artwork, music and movies are copyrightable. As such, one cannot make derivitives of that work that one can license (i.e. take a picture). If one takes a photograph of a statue, the original copyright holder still retains rights over that image, rights that can only be bent through the implying the fair use provisions of copyright law.

I was involved in a rather epic struggle between good (fair use) and evil (anti-copyright) people on Wikipedia, one that we sadly lost because this project is dominated by people who are so leftist and anti establishment that they desire nothing short of completely free. Sadly, this is a battle my side eventually was overcome by noise and numbers generally, but even these nazi's must admit defeat in the face of being able to include photographs of statues. There is no other option. One simply cannot create public domain or freely licensable photographs of statues. I hope this post brings to you a greater understanding of copyright of images and will serve you in your future editing.",0

"""You also make the following defamatory attack on my authority by claiming """"So she [Janet Marlow] is a more authoritative figure than Viktor, at this stage.""""  Your claim is based on nothing scholarly, only google hits and the fact that Marlow has self-published a method book. A method book, I might add, with proven misinformation contained therein. Among many errors in that book: In the front matter the author states falsely that """"Narciso Yepes [...] heard that there were four tones with less sustain due to missing sympathetic resonance on the six-string guitar"""". That is, even though Yepes ubiquitously indicates eight (not four) missing resonances in various articles and interviews as referenced here as well as in his Speech of Ingression into the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando delivered on 30 April 1989: """"The strings that I have added incorporate all the natural resonance that the instrument lacked in eight of the twelve notes of the equal tempered scale."""" 

Despite discussing this last issue with you numerous times, you still made the folowing statement: """"there is no misinformation on the particular page to which I linked. Both sides are describing the same eight notes being provided by the same four resonant strings. Whether that is four """"resonances"""" or eight is a non-issue.""""  That is, even though eight clearly does not equal four and both sides are clearly not describing the same thing, you still defend your support of misinformation.

Even though I've explained this before, and my site explains it in detail, I will say it again:

The western musical scale has 12 notes per octave. On the guitar, Yepes observed, four of these when palyed on a treble string induced a unison resonance from a bass string. These four notes are E, A, B, and D. If any octave of any of these notes is played on a treble string, a bass string reproduces it in unison. If A5 is played, A5 is reproduced by resonance on a bass string. Yepes observed that the other eight notes do not have the same resonance. These are C, C#, D#, F, F#, G, G#, A#. By adding four strings to the guitar tuned a singular way (C, A#, G#, F#), all twelve notes of the octave, played anywhere on the treble strings, now have unison resonances from bass strings. If C#4 is played C#4 is reproduced on string 10 (F#). If F#4 is palyed, F#4 is reproduced on strign 10 by resonance. If both C#4 and F#4 ar played, string 10 produces both the pitch of C#4 and the pitch of F#4 simultaneously. This is a proven fact of acoustics.

If Janet Marlow claims there are only """"four missing resonances on the six string guitar"""" (and in her book even attributes this to """"Narciso Yepes""""), it is totally false. Yepes said eight missing resonances (C, C#, D#, F, F#, G, G#, A#) not four (C, Bb, Ab, Gb). Marlow knows that because she has (in Soundboard magazine) referenced an interview with Yepes (Snitzler, L. 1978. """"Narciso Yepes: The 10-String Guitar: Overcoming the Limitations of Six Strings"""". Guitar Player 12: p. 26.) in which Yepes very clearly indicates which notes do and do not have resonance. Yet she has published at least twice the disinformation that Yepes added four strings (resonators) because four resonances were missing.

If you still have a problem understanding this, I am happy to meet with you and illustrate it on an actual 10-string guitar, since you've never owned/played one.

This New Ocean verifies the senator's remark, but makes it clear that JFK, while disappointed like everyone else, believed NASA knew best what was required to make the flight with reasonable safety, and describes Glenn's February visit (incidental to his visiting family in Virginia) as """"a brief visit with President Kennedy, who asked him many semitechnical questions about plans and systems for the orbital flight"""" (citing several newspaper reports), but says nothing at all about Kennedy demanding Glenn """"explain delays"""". This would seem totally out of character for JFK; I removed it. I have no idea who this Brit John Catchpole is, but I would suggest being cautious about regarding his Project Mercury - NASA's First Manned Space Programme as a reliable source about certain things.

 To improve the Sustainability article to meet the  featured article standard as assessed by  Wikiproject Environment.
     
Process
 This will be a collaborative editing project. Decisions on article content will be made by consensus. Consensus decision-making is defined as: """"a group decision making process that not only seeks the agreement of most participants, but also the resolution or mitigation of minority objections."""" When a vote is required, a two-thirds supermajority will be considered consensus. 
 Participants working on the project will strive to be civil, assume good faith, focus on content, not contributors, and observe Wikiquette.

Sign-up

 Peer Review 

I missed the following comments which have been available for a few days and have put them here so that all is clear - please put them back if this is not procedure. A few brief comments:

 R says there is a way to go on WP:MOS which is his area of expertise. I assume if we address each of his points one by one then that should improve matters. He does not suggest going for GA but that is still an option.
 He thinks the UN references look reliable - but not sure if this is a comment on npov too.
 Perhaps we need additional comment on the subject area, npov and other aspects of the article as well as WP:MOS etc.

I do believe that what is being stated in the quote improves the article, namely that although bitcoin is not legally banned in terms of Russian law, it is in fact banned by the authorities on a de facto basis. On the other hand it is also true - as implied in the quote - that there may be many millions of USD (it is a big economy) worth of bitcoins present today in Russia on computers owned by Russians since they bought them from and paid for them in Russian Roubles on exchanges accessible to them outside Russia - and that this practice most probably would continue with and equivalent increase in the number and value of bitcoins inside Russia. If the article would have continued to state in two sourced instances only that bitcoin is illegal in Russia, it would have projected the wrong impression that there are no bitcoins in Russia and that bitcoin plays absolutely no role in the Russian economy. I do agree that the section in question deals with the legal status of bitcoin in a country. Embellishing the section with reality improves the article.",0
"""Read this Article

It all started about 3 months ago. An innocent girl was diagnosed of (curable) kidney cancer at Eko Hospital. All was well from the beginning, she was admitted and went through the operation of removing one kidney (primary source of the cancer). After all the fear for the worse, prayers and the pains she went through, the operations was successful and all was well again. She started gaining back her weight, cracking jokes and doing every continued living normally.

She was discharged from the hospital, and was told to come back in the next couple of weeks to start (radiotherapy treatment) (Doomed)
We all know what radiotherapy involves and there is nothing wrong in the treatment, but the manner the patient was been treated using the new radiotherapy device, with little or know knowledge of how it operates.

She has to go through a one month of the radiotherapy treatment, 6 mins per day. Monday to Friday every week. Now she's lost plenty of weight, loss of appetite, always in pain, vomiting and diarrhea and every radiotherapy symptoms you can think of. By now, the fear in the family is intensely growing.

I believe a patient in that kind of situation should be in an intensive care of the hospital in question, but eko hospital sent her home with some paracetamol. They said, in the next couple of weeks she would be fully okay and they insisted in her continuation of the treatment.

By now, everything you can think of is happening to this little girl, she's as skinny as you can describe it. From time to time she asks if she's going to survive this, and everyone around her said yes based on what they were told at Eko Hospital, one person accidentally said, """"madam I'll tell you the truth, your day is doomed and she will not make it, just take her home and pray for the rest of her life."""" patient mother confronted the doctors with this matter and they said that """"the head nurse that shared that information does not work in their department and knows nothing about what she's talking about"""".

To cut the very long story short, on the 2nd of October, yesterday, she has to be rushed into the hospital, she said """" I don't want to stay at home, I want to be in the hospital, I believe I will be okay when we get to the hospital"""" When they got to the nearest hospital to their home, they refused her why, because they do not have loads of cash at hand at that moment in time, they progressed further to the next hospital where they required instant deposit as well. Then finally progressed to a further hospital where instant cash is also required.

She herself begged the last doctor, because she doesn't want to go home. Now the time is 1.am all at home trying to make this poor girl comfortable as she was in pain all over, this is a very bright 19 year old girl for God's Sake. 2 am, now she's now twitching all over, and mumbling some word we do not understand. the last sensible sentence she made was """"you, you, you have new clothes, I'm happy for you o, I will tell my daddy and my mummy they will buy clothe for me too""""

They had to rush her to EKO Hospital, at the early hours of the morning, like about 4.30 am, right outside the hospital she was confirmed dead!

She'll be buried today Wednesday, October 2007. Another potential Nigerian youth gone.

Although, she's gone, I want you guys to know that this is something that can happen to anybody. Though cancer is not actually the course of her death, but the treatment given to her and the manner the treatment was used.

Key Points
Misleading Information by eko hospital to patient family
throughout this ordeal, only 1 blood transfusion was done.
On her death certificate primary course of death """"Malabsorbtion"""" secondary course of death """"renal failure"""" Note not cancer.
This is poor negligence, this girl would have been alive if not for the negligence.

I want the medical lawyers in this forum to shed some light, at the moment, take me as a very angry man, because the 19 year old angel is my baby sister.

Update1
At the burial ground a doctor had to be called out on emergency, because when her friends asked to open the casket to see her face for the last time, she was sweating. All hope high again, like there's going to be another miracle of the century, we were all confused and wondering why someone confirmed dead will be sweating.

Though we'd thought that it's possible because' she'd just been brought out of ice,  But when a doctor arrived he reconfirmed her dead, and he said that the sweating is possible due to some reasons he mentioned, 

Anyway we've buried her now, but another question arises, was she actually dead or unconcious when they confirmed she was dead?, Cos the staff that",0

Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, has admitted that the much loved """"free encyclopedia"""" has at least some quality problems. To some of us, this is nothing new. I've had more than one student rely on Wikipedia for accurate information for a paper, and it always ends up the same way: """"well, I got it off of Wikipedia, thinking it was good..."""".

And therein lies the problem. If you keep in mind that anyone, and I mean anyone, can edit a Wikipedia entry, then you are treading on dangerous ground if you're going to cite it as a source of fact. While it's true that errors often get corrected, they don't always, and what happens in the meantime is that bad info sits there, misinforming people. Of course, this isn't true just in the case of Wikipedia. It's a problem online, in general. I recently was party to an argument over the historicity of Jesus, and one person used a source that claimed that Philo of Alexandria lived in Jerusalem. He's called Philo of Alexandria for a reason, you know.[] 

I used to be such an unadulterated fan of Wikipedia you know. The idea of an open source online reference that grew on a daily basis was quite an attractive one back in the day. But in recent times I've become wary of the encyclopaedia anyone can edit, and not simply because of a few high profile choice edits.

Whatever about libel and congressional cherry picking amidst the many articles of this once noble enterprise, what really gets me about Wikipedia is that I can't trust it on most issues. There are so many agendas, axes to grind and purely mischievous vandals that 90% of what I would be interested in reading about - history, politics and so on - is tripe. To read an article on a contentious subject one can pick out bias, attempted compromise and ultimate failure almost immediately. Wade into the """"Talk"""" page, where these edits are discussed, and you are confronted with chaos. There are too many vested interests at stake, and from the War on Terror to the Welfare State one will find an army of people taking one view or another entering into what are known as """"Revert Wars"""", where they revert any edits back to the version which suits them.

From self-interest to political interest one can find """"POV"""" (Point of View) shading almost every major article that touches on the live wires of our society. Thus I wouldn't trust anything that's even half-way current or ongoing on Wikipedia.

For one, the facts can be skewed. Secondly, the article can change overnight depending on how organised a campaign is launched against an article (and they do happen.)

"Historicism has been held pretty much the same from antique through Medieval through modern times. (There were a few outliers at first.)  It's not until you get to the Counter-Reformation that you begin to get large promotion of Futurism and Preterism (both of which were invented and designed by Jesuits as a specific challenge to protestant Historicism).  Its interesting the Catholic Futurism and Modern Critical Scholarship find their basis in Porphyry a pagan philosopher who railed against Christianity and especially against Bible prophecy in the 4th century.  I don't find it at all curious that John J. Collins, as a Catholic, promotes Modern Scholarship and Futurism.  Its what I'd expect.
Whenever you take on any part of the topic of Bible prophecy you can expect that it is a huge undertaking, because there is nothing simple about it.  One might limit oneself to just a single viewpoint, but that's not what Wikipedia is about.  You have to have a NPOV, and to do that with Bible prophecy you have to discuss just about every aspect of it.",0
"I think the major point made by my RfC was that the addition of controversial material by one editor set off a major row, with edit-warring, wikilawyering, trolling and general unpleasantness.

Although one could always start off a page about Attempts to charge John Howard for war crimes, which would be useful for those few with a genuine interest.

"""

OK, here goes at another attempted explanation.  Ignore the IP currently using 221/6. His intentions appear to be good, but I don't think he is helping.
 Stop taking this personally. No-one actually knows you, all we have to go on are a set of edits. We are largely strangers to each other - strong statements like """"betrayal"""" and """"slander"""" suggest motives that imply the other editor has taken against you personally.
 You are treating people's comments in a strangely literal way. If you don't understand what someone says - just ask them to explain a different way. Do not assume that everything is an attack.
 Copyright - yes you may absolutely tag and report something that appears to have been copied and pasted from another source.  What you need to watch for is that the other site didn't get its material from Wikipedia to start with.  They don't always credit Wikipedia as the source. However, it is better to tag it than not - the project cannot afford the risk.
 Notability - rather than tag an article for deletion, start a discussion. With the soap opera characters, starting a general discussion about notability at the WikiProject is a good idea.  If the talkpage is active, start a discussion there. Always try to notify the article creator.
 Read WP:BEFORE.  Non-notable articles rarely damage the project unless they are also inaccurate or completely foolish (an article about my cat for example would be completely foolish, as the cat is known to no-one outside my family and our neighbours, and is just an ordinary cat), so there's often no urgent rush to delete things that are non-notable.  Someone spent time and effort working on it.  What other steps might be taken - can the information be merged into another article and a WP:REDIRECT used, for example.
 If you eventually decide that nominating for a deletion discussion is the only option, use a neutral rationale. Do not attack the article creator because they have disagreed with you. Remember it is a discussion. Do not attribute any motive to those who disagree other than the differing viewpoint of a stranger.
 Images - if you find someone has pirated an image from a newspaper website, and uploaded it as their own work, yes you absolutely must tag it as a copyvio for speedy deletion.  In other instances, it is better to identify the least drastic option to deal with the damage.  Can I fix it myself? Can I alert the uploader - maybe they just made a mistake? If in doubt, always tag for WP:PUF which results in a discussion, not for deletion.
 Talk - explain why you thought what you did. Don't post reams of justifications and question the motives of others. You may be right, but you'll lose if you can't discuss things with people.

Again, I began by saying that I don't think the word is perfect and that it needed to be worked out here rather than simply excised with an NPOV comment on the edit. And, actually, I do have a similar remark from Raul Hilberg's mouth later in the article, but I don't believe that this entirely addresses POV/NPOV. My point is not to say that the Anschluss cannot be viewed as the military annexation of Austria but that to view it as """"simply"""" that would be to """"misunderstand"""" its essence, which would not in any case provide anything like absolution but does have the effect of changing the subject (hence my wording """"tends to conceal""""). In any case, to make such a claim without remarking on its limited analytic value and obvious propaganda value would be to set aside a number of basic facts presented elsewhere in the article, and to simply reiterate an argument without quotation or attribution and in any case without pointing out what immediately contradicts it is POV of a subtle sort. Certainly you can always resort to attributing remarks to """"some"""" and """"others,"""" but this is below the Gallup level of presenting opinions and does little to inform the reader or grasp essential truths.

"MSU Interview 

Dear Jimfbleak,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar",0

 Hi Edward. You have a few options. First is to start on the article talk page, which I see you've already done. I know a few days has already gone by, but maybe ping your posting again and see what happens. 
 Your next step would be to bring this to WP:RPP and request semi-protection, but make sure you have your evidence at hand. Gather a few diffs (both your edits and the IP edits), and show that you've attempted resolution on the talk page. Look at other requests for PP and see what the standard type of format is, and successful or denied reasons; that'll give you a good idea how to submit your request. If the reviewing admin agrees, the page won't be editable by IP editors. Semi-page protection usually is usually a finite period of time, but after protection lapses, you can re-request it if need be. Just mention previous page protections on any subsequent requests.
 I'd also look at WP:ANI, where you can post for admin intervention. If semi-PP is denied, I'd go here, but there may not be much that they can do. Since it's a school IP address range, admins are generally hesitant to block those types of IPs. Yngvarr """,0

"First off, we are not discussing 2015, we are discussing 2016; that much should be obvious. Second, the fact that we've always done things a certain way does not erase the possibility of improving our process. I would argue, and I'd hope you would agree, that these articles have only gotten better over time. That improvement did not happen because we sat on our hands and were content with the level of quality we had already reached. Third, I do not think Lotus/Renault and Marussia/Manor are relevant situations to each other. With Lotus, we know the Renault takeover is going to be done, and we know the name will be changed. Both have been confirmed. With Marussia, as F1 fans we know the name was only kept to keep their FOM TV rights money, and we have every reason to believe it will be changed now that Marussia is entirely out of the picture, but that's nonetheless original research that isn't fit for this article. I now agree that I was wrong to fight for the Renault name, but Lotus is equally wrong. We have no specific confirmation of the former, but we do have confirmation that it won't be the latter. So what we know for sure is very little - in fact, I believe all we know is the drivers and the engine. That that's why it should say TBA-Lotus. Additionally, think of it from this perspective: a person reads a news article announcing that the Renault takeover has been completed. They read another story from the head of Renault Sport indicating the Lotus team name will be dropped. These articles are from reliable sources and feature direct quotes. They then come here and see...Lotus. Their only reaction is going to be that Wikipedia is clearly wrong. And they're right to think that. And if you DON'T agree that reliably reported quotes from the head of organizations are good enough sources for Wikipedia, then there's quite a lot that needs to be removed from this article. You can't have it both ways.",0

"High school graduation rate 

Someone made this edit saying that Minneapolis had one of the lowest high school graduation rates in Minnesota, citing this page from the Minnesota Department of Education.  When I checked the report (the 2005-2006 Dropout/Graduation Rates-Special Populations report), it reveals that Minneapolis has a low graduation rate of 66.08%.  I sorted the data and found that there are several school districts with lower graduation rates.  Intermediate School District #287, Red Lake, and Cass Lake-Bena appear to be the only public school districts that have lower graduation rates.  I'm not exactly sure if some of the other school districts listed are actually charter schools or some special vocational school districts.

Regardless, I think an explanation of the school graduation rate should be listed within Minneapolis Public Schools, since they're the responsible school district, and the data should be better qualified as to exactly which districts are selected within that sampling.

Constantine founded a new city named after himself: Constantinople. Christian writers played up the idea that this was to be a 'new Rome', a fitting Christian capital for a newly Christian empire.

"Departments or States? 

I am confused.

Are the Departments of Honduras defined geographically, like the states of Mexico, or the Lands of Germany, or even the states in the United States?

When can one Department of Honduras exercise authority over another Department of Honduras?

Does the constitution of Honduras subscribe to any theory of jurisdiction when it comes to organizing its departments, and is the jurisdiction of one Department explicitly limited by a specific border or boundary with another?

If an individual (or his property) is taken into custody in one Department, is there a hearing before a magistrate (as one would expect in a civil code country) before he (or the thing he has an interest in) is extradited to another Department?

I think the main article could be improved by explaining when one Department can exercise jurisdiction over an individual or corporation doing business in the area of a particular Department, and when it is supposed to refrain from exercising that authority.216.99.201.180",0

"""==Why I don't edit often anymore==

Back in the day I used to edit wikipedia on a fairly regular basis. One of the pages I edited was the eXile. One detractor of the eXile, Peter Ekman, was so pathologically obsessed with discrediting the periodical, that he would devote weeks at a time to blanking and otherwise vandalizing the eXile article while launching reckless accusations at everyone who """"defended"""" the eXile. Although many editors did our best to contain Mr. Ekman, eventually he wore me down. It just wasn't worth it spending my free time containing the vendetta of some aggrieved middle-aged jerk.

As a parting bow in my too-long Ekman drama, I wanted to post here a summary about Mr. Ekman's character and the original wiki text that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade.

About Peter Ekman

Peter Ekman is the aforementioned hack journalist who crusaded against the eXile. But once upon a time Ekman actually had an impressive sounding job working as an editor for the Moscow Times and dispensing right-wing platitudes in the heart of the former communist empire. Moscow in the 90s was a place where failures didn't fail. And for a long time Ekman didn't fail, despite his total lack of social graces and limited intelligence. Eventually his columns attracted the ire of the fellow Moscow publication, the eXile.

Originally the eXile was planning only on criticizing Ekman's written work, but Ekman's response was righteous, menacing, and hinted at violence. So the eXile's added a personal detail: they included the account of a female employee who had been subjected to unwelcome sexual advances by Mr. Ekman. Mr. Ekman had groped the employee while inviting her to a weekend get-away while his Russian Bride was out of town. Ekman responded with the same witless ape-shit animosity that I have since personally witnessed many times on wikipedia. Ekman attempted to get the eXile banned from Johnson's Reading List by declaring the eXile was a fascist, neo-nazi periodical. Ekman's evidence for such nazi sympathies was a spoof fashion piece entitled """"The eXile's Third Reich Uniform of the Week,"""" in which a fictional gay fashion designer breathlessly reviewed the 1938 version of the Nazi Field Bishop uniform.

Eventually Ekman lost his position at the Moscow Times. Since then he's occasionally surfaced as a professor of finance at various 3rd rate universities and, of course, here on Wikipedia.

The following is an excerpt from the Wikipedia Article on the eXile that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade:

Peter Ekman, Johnson's Russia List, and an Unsubtantiated Groping Allegation
In November 2000, in Issue #23 of The eXile, Matt Taibbi published a press review entitled Peter Ekman Groped Me.  The article ridiculed Ekman, then newly appointed editor of The Moscow Times, for his approach to the economic and political development of Russia.  Taibbi characterized this approach as high-handed, condescending, and arrogant, and went on to mock Ekman personally as a pompous hypocrite: """"Ekman has only one idea (""""Russia has a lot to learn from America""""), which he tries endlessly to sell and resell as a varied package of ribald wit and insight.""""  The article also ridiculed Ekman for describing himself as a """"financial educator,"""" and described him as having """"a head seemingly worn bald from improper use.""""  As a finishing touch, Taibbi recounted an as-yet unverified account of sexual advances made by Ekman to an eXile employee, made at late at night at the Garazh nightclub in Moscow during a visit from Ekman's mother-in-law.

Ekman responded by writing in to Johnson's Russia List to claim that """"the eXile is fascist and racist,""""  that """"every eXile issue contains unverifiable stories that smear someone's reputation,"""" that The eXile """"is associated with the fascist party of Eduard Limonov."""" The accusations of fascism were discounted by many in part because of the eXile's Jewish roots - Ames, along with the eXile's publisher, deputy editor and several contributors are all Jews - and because of the paper's satirical editorial bent. It remains unclear as to whether Ekman did in fact make advances toward an eXile employee, or who that employee may have been.

No, Dolphin52, you have not provided any such """"numerous authoritative sources"""" for the definition. I understand why you feel that my request for documentation """"doesn't make sense"""" to you. The request needs to be understood in the context of (A) Wikipedia policies and guidelines, and (B) rules of legal analysis. What you have done is provide numerous quotations  taken out of context  from various court cases and from other sources. Many of the court cases did not even involve federal taxes.

Further, assuming you are still defending the verbiage that was removed from the article, you appear to be arguing that an """"excise""""  in the U.S. constitutional law sense  is limited to a tax on privileges, etc. That argument is completely invalid.

There are two problems with the argument. First, none of the sources you provided say that all excises (in the constitutional sense) must always involve a tax on a """"privilege,"""" and none of the sources you provided stand for that proposition. Second, by contrast, I have specific federal court cases where the courts ruled various events or activities to be taxable events  yet those activities or events do not involve any """"privilege.""""

Later, I'll repost, on this talk page, the actual text that was removed from the article, and I will again summarize  applying Wikipedia policies and guidelines and rules of legal analysis  why the removed material was objectionable. The analysis you provided violates various Wikipedia rules, and it also violates some of the basic tenets of legal analysis.

Now, for some more background.

The argument that an excise (in the constitutional sense), must always involve a """"privilege"""" to be valid is called a """"tax protester argument."""" It is not only legally invalid, but it is worse: it is also legally frivolous. A person can be penalized monetarily for even raising such an argument on a federal tax return or in a federal court. Later, I'll also post examples of actual court cases where people specifically argued, using the """"privilege"""" argument, that their income could not be taxed under the federal income tax laws, and their arguments were ruled invalid.

On a separate note, it should be obvious that the argument that a excise (again, in the constitutional sense, not the statutory sense) must always involve a """"privilege""""  is legally nonsensical for an entirely separate reason: Engaging in criminal activity is not a """"privilege"""" in any correct legal sense. Yet, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that the federal income tax (which is an excise) may validly tax the receipt of funds in a criminal activity (specific examples: funds received by extortion or embezzlement), even though the wrongdoer is required to return the funds to their rightful owner. And the federal courts have repeatedly and overwhelmingly ruled that the federal income tax is fundamentally an excise, not a direct tax. (I know of only a couple of cases off the top of my head where a federal court actually ruled a particular federal income tax to be a """"direct tax,"""" and one of those cases was later overruled). On this basis alone, an """"excise"""" cannot possibly be limited to ONLY a tax on a privilege, etc.

"Gnip is on the right track here, though I would like to suggest a few corrections to his last statement. The reason the book received so much negative feedback from academics was not only because of its high profile, but it certainly did play a major role. Historians did definitely want to counter the widespread praise the book was receiving from journalists and other non-specialists, but it was also the book’s clear and obvious failings that drew a lot of attention from academics, who felt it was their responsibility to expose the book’s problematic research and unsubstantiated conclusions. Any work claiming to provide a comprehensive biography of one of the world's most famous (or infamous) leaders will get noticed, and will certainly be watched closely by academics specializing in China studies. As someone currently working within this very millieu, I can say that most specialists I know of have spoken to were at least aware of the book. Gnip is, however, correct that the published response to the book (such as the Benton volume, or the China Journal response) were unusual, as I have stated before in this article's discussion. I think this is the part that is getting lost on John Smith's, unfortunately. Though I may be splitting hairs rehashing Gnip's words, what I am trying to clarify is that people should not be under the impression that academics only noticed the book due it its huge publicity. It is not correct to say that without its ‘high profile’ “the academic world would [never have known] about such a book.” Professional historians deal daily with the “low profile”, often reviewing books that never become very popular or well-known (ie. they don't sell very well outside of academia). In fact, they frequently research and dissect works that few outside of a very small circle of individuals will ever read. In this sense, academics are very insulated in what they do, and are often disconnected from the general public. That is not to say, however, that they are unaware of new publications outside of academia, particularly those re-evaluating major figures in history. Also, Benton’s volume “Was Mao Really a Monster” was not, in my opinion, a major contributor to the book’s popularity, as Gnip suggests. As you know, MTUS was first published in 2005, and this collection of reviews was only published in 2009, quite some time after the book had already become popular (and as you know, the reviews found in the volume had been previously published elsewhere). What is important about this recent volume is not how it contributed to the book’s popularity, in my opinion, but rather as a reflection of how distressed the academic community truly is by the MTUS’s continued popularity. This last fact is what I am concerned does not quite get across in the article, as it stands. Unfortunately, I’m not sure how to appropriately correct that issue. I think that is what Midnightblueowl has been trying to address, and what I myself tried to do some time ago.",0

Freud's ideas are certainly much discussed today, and I would be the first to agree that they must be grappled with and dealt with seriously, if only because of their currency.  So Freud deserves a long and thorough article in Wikipedia.  I believe that a balanced article would include A) explanations of Freud's theories, and B) the status of Freudianism today.  The existing article is quite thorough on """"A"""" and had almost nothing on """"B"""".  A neophyte who read the article as it stood a month ago would imagine that Freud's work has the same relation to current psychology that Darwin's work has to current biology.  

Let's compare them:  Darwinism thoroughly permeates modern biology, and his fundamentals, built on copious observation and collegial collaboration, now much extended with new data and new theories, continue to provide accurate predictions and fruitful avenues of exploration.  Freud's fundamental ideas were founded on minimal and dubious observations, and his theories do not meet the test of being logical, minimal, reproducible explanations of the data.  As far as Jung goes, I haven't gotten to him yet  ), and I don't know anything about Maslow.  Freud draws my fire precisely because he is so high profile, so influential, and so wrong.  I was required to study The Interpretation of Dreams in high school as if it were scientific fact, and the disgust I felt when I later realized it was all as stupid as it sounded has turned me into - yes - a Freud critic.  Of course, I am striving for NPOV.  Do you really feel that presenting Freud's pseudoscience without comment is NPOV, whereas quoting one of many eminent critics is not?   21:55, 14 Sep 2003 (UTC)""",0

First, because you would never have denied the racial significance of a white-on-black attack, and secondly because I have no doubt that the attackers expressly targeted Gordimer because of her race. As anyone who follows life in South Africa knows, such daily race-based attacks, and official indifference towards them, are a part of the institutionalized fabric of that nation's life. People who oppose racism seek to publicize such systemic racial violence. Unfortunately, there are quite a few folks at Wikipedia who seek to suppress all knowledge of black racial violence.

"""== Categories related to the National Audio Theatre Festivals page ==

It is unclear why a number of categories were removed from the National Audio Theater Festivals page. I can only assume that the person who made the changes did not read the page carefully. The remaining categories imply that the NATF is simply an American radio drama performance festival and """"artists collective"""".  

The festival is not a performance alone, but comprises a professional organization - not a """"collective"""" or amorphous """"group"""" - of audio engineers, sound artists, voice actors, playwrights and producers. Its yearly event, also known as the National Audio Theatre Festival, involves several days of instruction, training, special talks and other discussions on these topics. For example, training in sound mastering, sound production, voice acting.  The Friday night performance is the """"cherry on the sundae"""". 

It is one of the only conferences of its type worldwide. Many of the participants do NOT work on the radio at all, but in audio books, film or animation, and likewise, while all the training involves the audio arts, it is not just an """"audio drama festival"""". The upcoming 2011 festival, for example, will be focusing on voice acting in animation.

Several of the categories are rather egregious removals, such as """"Audio plays"""", """"radio drama"""", """"sound recording,"""" """"sound technology"""", and """"voice acting"""", for which NATF is one of the only national training grounds or gathering for professionals... and even as other pages in those categories that are affiliated with NATF or are similarly themed stay in those categories. I therefore have returned most of the categories back.

That one is removed, 

(edit conflict, but pretty much agrees with above) The fourth reference is known as a secondary source, which is the kind of sources that wikipedia tries to cite. We take as little as possible from primary sources, and instead use secondary sources, verifiable secondary sources in fact. Google video is not a secondary source, nor is it a verifiable source, so any evidence gleaned from people's postings there is not permissible as evidence. Unless you can find any verifiable evidence that supports your reasoning, I'm gonna call on Occam's razor and say that the more simple explanation that fits the facts is true. Please stop trolling this page unless you have cold, hard, verifiable facts that support your thesis, as any further rants will be removed as trolling. Thank you.  

That one is modified,

This is trolling. Can we please close this, since it is obvious that Gaby de wilde is either unintrested in accepting that the majority don't buy his/her conspiricy theory, or he/she is trolling.

That one is removed, and there are a bunch of others. So when you compress your own comments, please don't remove or change other people's, ok?

I honestly ask you: Did you even read it before you hit delete?  I removed some postings that contained only accusations of trolling. Everything I wrote so far in wikipedia has been deleted!

So far I have not figured out what to do about this. If you read the post you  deleted then you would know there is no link between Osama and 911.

 Re: Ridiculous bands listed as supergroups 
I completely agree with this sentiment. Theres something wrong when there are 10+ groups listed as supergroups from 2005-2006. A band that forms with members that have been in previous bands does not automatically make it a supergroup. The last few bands listed dont belong in this article.


 I don't think it should matter whether the previous bands are household names, but I DO think they should be removed from the article if they weren't formed with promotion from previous bands. For example, several of the 2000s bands are promoted as such: Velvet Revolver was promoted as """"Stone Temple Pilots meets Guns n' Roses"""", Audioslave was promoted as """"Soundgarden meets RATM"""", Army of Anyone is being promoted as """"Filter meets STP"""", etc. In other words, bands with promotion like The Raconteurs being """"Jack White with a band"""" aren't supergroups, because they're widely known as Jack White's side project, and NOT """"White Stripes meets The Greenhornes"""".

Whatever it is, it's pretty thin soup, if you'll pardon the pun.  I'd give you CSNY, ELP, Travelling Wilburys, and the Bloomfield-Kooper-Stills session, but the rest are pretty much bands (some great maybe, never even heard of Sky), that sold a lot of records.  

 Ridiculous Bands listed as Supergroups 
It seems that people are using this page to promote their own bands, or own obscure tastes, which they find """"super."""" I agree with the aforementioned, and will weed out some of the lesser-known acts, and those featuring lesser-known musicians. Feel free to restore this page, if you believe that I'm wrong. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) 23:02, December 14, 2004  (UTC)

I believe the text at the top of the page does a pretty good job of explaining the definition (or lack thereof) of the term, and its use as hype.  I think a better tactic than removing information entirely would be to move the """"ridiculous"""" groups, or those who are termed supergroups merely because of membership, not achievement, to a separate heading.  Keep """"Renowned Supergroups"""" at the top, if you like, while putting in an objective criteria for membership in this group (number of albums sold, perhaps?).  Add another heading or two for """"Other Supergroups""""; maybe even """"Failed Supergroups"""", and move the rest of the entries on the list there.

I sympathise with your desire to tidy this up, but removing information completely is seldom the answer.  \talk 23:31, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

There, I've broken it up with the groups you left on the page as """"renowned""""  expect others to move bands in and out of that section.   I'm not entirely happy with the result; I think perhaps a better structure would be to divide the list by decade  I think it might provide a clearer view of which groups have stood the test of time.  What do you think?  \talk 00:07, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)

If none of the members have pages in Wikipedia (I'm looking at you, Misery Index), then it probably isn't a supergroup.

Wow. When I last modified this page, it wasn't absurd. The average person when they end a relationship or employment will go on and find another relationship or job. This page is a tracking of famous musicians and all the new jobs they've started with each other. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  ([[User talk:1",0

Comment Hi There, In spite all my effort, I don’t expect any understanding or help from the other side regarding the English version of the article about Alexander Voytovych. Therefore if one insists on deleting this particular article then go ahead as it seems to me there is no room for democratic thinking on your website whatsoever. I’d like to add a few more words as my final statement. Wikipedia says:  “Sources may encompass published works in all forms and media, and in any language. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability. The art works and art life of the artist is the sourcefor academic press, Ukrainian media, academic institutions, as well as poets, writers and publications use his paintings & drawings to illustrate books. The artist takes a part in a busy art life in the Ukraine presenting a number of exhibitions & art projects. Having said that I see that there is no enough evidence for one?????

If one convinced that the article has to be deleted, than do not hesitate to do so, but before that please give me a straight answer to my question. What is the difference between the article about Alexander Voytovych and, for example, the Herb Roe’s article, why the mentioned article is considered more accurate? I must highlight once again that instead of explaining what has to be changed or corrected on the page, one awards us with thenoticeboards. Regarding self-promotion  which was mentioned a few times I’d like to make it clear  the artists is a Ukrainian and naturally all sources are Ukrainian, and if the mentioned language is unknown to one it doesn’t meant that it allows one doubts the genuine sources. The Ukrainian and Russian versions of Wikipedia have accepted the article and honoured it, which says a lot.I had in my mind to present more Ukrainian artist, however having such an experience; I’d rather leave this business behind thanks to you. Thanks for co-operation. From my point of view this discussion is exceeded, feel free to delete the article!

I looked through several bios on bookrag and none, some of which were pretty lengthy, mentioned Falk. It's off topic and additionally, he doesn't even have an article.  

Well, I'm not sure that Falk needs to be included in the Jordan article or not (though he did seem to have a huge influence on Jordan's career), but in any case, I have written a Wikipedia article for David Falk.  I would appreciate it if others would read it over to see if the article is any good, and secondly to decide if he should be mentioned in the Jordan article (as I look at the Jordan article again, it even says in the second sentence that """"he became one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation""""... since it was Falk who did the marketing, he probably deserves a link there).  My information for the Falk article came partly from David Halberstan's book Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made, which has about 10 pages on Falk, as well as a ton of online articles I found.  Cheers!   

I added a few brief lines about Falk in the section """"Media figure and business interests.""""  Falk is probably too off-topic to put him in the opening section, but I think he's important enough to mention in a section specifically about Jordan's role as a media figure, since Falk was largely responsible for crafting Jordan's image.  

 Divorce 

Is is just me or does it seem like, unlike an earlier divorce threat five years ago, Michael & Juanita's split seemed to have been kept quiet by most of the media?

I'm wondering because the first I've heard of the current proceedings was last night when I heard something about this being the most expensive celebrity divorce ever?   
Five years ago, he was still in the NBA, so obviously he has a bigger spot light on him. For the most part, Jordan isn't under the lime light anymore, so it doesn't have much coverage.  
It was announced in the press when it happened. But it was one of those things where people stopped talking about it a couple of days later.

Nick Names
I don't believe the Nickname """"Superman"""" is valid in the case of MJ. Yes, he was called Superman, Pippen was called Batman, and Rodman, Rod-man for a brief time. But Superman as a nickname has been used for almost every prominent player in the NBA; i.e. Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and especially Shaq. Nicknames should be identifiable to unique players. If you ask someone who knows nothing about Basketball, what were Jordan's nicknames, they would say Air, or Air Jordan, and throw in the acronym's, M.J. Jordan has had plenty of nicknames, but we don't list every single Nickname, only the most identifiable. That's why his NBA.com Historical Bio, only lists Air Jordan as his nickname. I propose mutual consensus on the issue, before more users begin to add obsessive Wp:fancruft to the article. Feel free to comment.  
Agree, Superman is not a common nickname for him. At all. It gets used all the time for athletes. Unless he gets a Superman tattoo on his arm like Shaq and starts calling himself Superman it's not worth inclusion.

"Wow! My thought experiment has gotten you all fired up, it seems. -) 
In the case of the Trouton-Noble experiment, all the interactions involved are electromagnetic interactions. So once a theoretician has granted that in the physics of electromagnetism the Lorentz transformations apply, things can be taken from there.
Now, of course, Lorentz had to assume that a planet that is moving through the lorentzian ether is flattened in the direction of motion, just as everything else. That is a modification of how the force of gravity is transmitted.

 Coulomb force couples to electric charge, what does gravity couple to? 
 
But does the force of gravity couple to the rest mass, or to the total mass? If gravity couples only to the rest mass then the ether theory stands a chance of reproducing the prediction of the Einstein interpretation, as the rest mass is invariant under Lorentz transformation. But as far as we know gravitation involves the total mass. This is an illustration of the fact that in relativistic physics gravitation just bursts out of the confines of special relativity. Something has to give. 
This theme is similar, I think, to the theme in John Nortons paper about Nordström's Lorentz invariant scalar theory of gravitation; gravitation just bursts out of special relativity, and a successor to special relativity is needed. (And was provided by Einstein.) 

Poincaré's 1905 Palermo paper (facsimile reproduction, non-digital, 3 MB file) has a considerable section about gravitation. I'm not sure, but I don't think that Poincaré demands gravitational-inertial mass equivalence as a constraint on the theory. I think that if Poincaré had anticipated that light is deflected by gravitation, he would have written so. 
I think it was well after 1905 that recognition came that light does not only carry momentum, it also carries inertial mass. When light propagates from an emitter to a receiver, it not only transmits momentum, it also transmits inertial mass. The inertial mass of the emitter decreases on emission of the light, and the inertial mass of the receiver increases on absorption. Of course, light has zero rest mass. Since light has zero rest mass, the natural assumption is that light is not affected by gravity. 
Possibly, considerations of this nature made Poincaré very, very cautious towards attributing inertial mass to energy. 

In his 1909 Göttingen lecture, Poincaré went very far in attributing the increased inertia of a fast-moving electron to increased energy of the ether surrounding the electron, in response to the high velocity of the electrons. Can that still work for muons and tauon's? My understanding is that electrons and muons are identical as far as electric charge and spin are concerned, but that they are different in rest mass. Should electrons and muons become more and more alike at higher velocities? To my knowledge: at all velocities the energy of muons is the muon's rest mass multiplied with the relativistic factor.

I am indeed very curious how Lorentz dealt with these issues. As you indicate: historians of science describe that Lorentz retained a preference for using a lorentzian interpretation, but from the lectures Lorentz gave in the 1920ties it can be seen that Lorentz had full mathematical mastery of special and general relativity.  | Talk",0

 A few comments on the article 
Good article overall, but in reading through it I think that certain areas are in need of improvement. Firstly I thought there wasn't really enough explanation of why it would be preferable to build a Space elevator. The economics section has info on costs and all, but this is rather brief and comes towards the end of the article, I would think that explaining the perceived necessity of such a device would be one of the first things to state.
There were some things about the specifics of the engineering which I think need a lot more explaining, for one, is it proposed that the cable be a single thick wire or many tiny thin ones? It seems to be talked about at various points as if it could be either, so I think that needs more clarity.
Something quite important that I don't think was addressed at all (or at-least I couldn't see it) was the issue of how exactly the cable (or the whole structure) actually gets up into space in the first place. Are we to assume that the cable will be towed up by a rocket or something? If not that, then how?
Several times in the article it is mentioned that the """"Counterweight"""", could be an asteroid or a space station. But these two things are very different aren't they? I mean in terms of mass, an asteroid probably weighs millions if not billions of tons, whereas a manmade space stations would be only a few hundred or thousand tons (unless some gargantuan station is proposed). So how can these to things be comparable? And what kind of actual weights will be involved?
Finally the article doesn't give much information on how the climbers are proposed to move. It is mentioned further down that Magnetic levitation might be used, but is that the norm, is that what they all propose? Or are there different plans, like just mechanical wheels, etc?
Well that's about all I can think of for now, I hope the article can be improved with some of these suggestions.  """,0

 islam the religion of peace???? 

My mind is not able to accept the fact that islam is a religion of tolerance,humanity,love etc. why? Let me elucidate it -

islam is the only religion which is spread through force or by giving some benefits to man as they will force woman & children to convert to islam.The benfits include four time marriage,divorce can be done by saying """"divorce-divorce-divorce"""" & you can """"buy"""" another girl & force her to marry with you by giving some money to her father.muhammad himself married to a 9 year girl when he is 60 year old fat ball (Yes muhammad is a pedophile).

Some of the ugliest punishments is reserved for islam like beating to death a woman or man by stoning(as this is happening is various muslim nations),beheading,lashes etc.

Womans are treated like animals & there job is restricted only to give birth to as many childs as they can(untill she dies giving birth to yet another child).They are forced to wear """"burqas"""" in public & to have a white plaster on face in home.

These all things attract only those people from a society who thinks that this is the """"opportunity"""" to satisfy there desires.They are ofthen those individuals who have lowest ethics in life.

And why muslims are spread all over the world? ,The reason is that as all societies in the world have some real opportunitists,cowards in some number then only those choose this religion,this is unlike HINDUS & SIKHS who are mainly concentrated in south asia initially(Now they are going to other parts of the world).

Now some of the muslims are even not fully confident about islam, they know that in todays world practicing this religion in it's full version is not possible so they have created there own version and labeled it as """"tolerent islam"""" that means that even they also knows that islam is not tolerent in it's full version.

How is it possible that you pick one thing from islam as per your convenience like only jehad is picked up by muslims all around the world.

Today even muslim don't trust another muslim(not to talk about another religions) most notabley is the numerous fighting between muslim countries & muslim groups like iran-iraq,balochistan-pakistan etc.This is why they are not able to achieve muslim ummah or unity of muslims.

Only muslims are fighting in all around the world(as they are intolerent towards another religions) name it chechanya,palestine etc.As long as they are in minority they live quietly only waiting for an opportunity to come.And also multiplying there numbers(thanks to 4 marrigies & 10 childs per marrige).Then they start the fight for a separate homeland.

One more mystery waiting to be demystified - How long can islam survives in this century ?""",0

"I disagree.  Nobody has yet made a case against the inclusion of statistical data when it’s used in support of a discussion about causal theories, which in this case it would be.

A. I don't think you're taking the Anonimu business too seriously, and I find Anittas' intervention rather bizarre, but the key is to keep watching and waiting, and acting when really ready. It's frustrating that he can get away with so much (and his attacks have been pointed out to a number of administrators so far).

B. I too despise the profusion of flags, especially when coupled with recentism. Take for instance a biography I was looking at today: that of Anna Politkovskaya.

"CEREMONIES AT MINDROLLING MONASTERY 

Vajrasattva Drubchen- 10th Day of 1st Lunar Month

The Vajrasattva Drubchen is a seven day ceremony based on the Minling Dorsem or Mindrolling Vajrasattva ritual. Minling Dorsem is part of the Vajrasattva cycle of teachings discovered by Chogyal Terdag Lingpa. The Drubchen is held every year for seven days beginning on the 10th day of the 1st lunar month.
This grand ceremony is performed to purify the negativities of all sentient beings, particularly of the deceased. On the 15th day of the 1st lunar month sangha gathers to perform a special ceremony for those who have died within the previous year.

Kagyed Drubchen- 24th Day of 1st Lunar Month

Beginning the 24th day of the 1st lunar month, the Drubchen is a ten-day ceremony. It is based on the Kagyed De-Sang Du Pa terma that is one of the treasure teachings discovered by the renowned Terton Nyang Ral Nyima Woezer and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
When Terdag Lingpa was about to pass into Parinirvana, it is said that he asked his disciples and sangha members not to weep but to realize the truth of impermanence. He then instructed them that if they had devotion for him and truly wanted to benefit beings they should do the Kagyed ceremony each year. This, he said, would benefit the Dharma and all sentient beings. In accordance with the instructions of the great Bodhisattva, from that time on, the Kagyed Drubchen has been held every year, now being performed at the Mindrolling monastery in India.
The final day of the ceremony is on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month, which is the Parinirvana Day of Terdag Lingpa. There are lama dances in the evenings of each day’s ceremony. The drubchen ends in the evening of the 3rd day of the 2nd lunar month with the ritual of Bgodrub Lenchog, the Receiving of Siddhis Ceremony and Marme Monlam (butter lamp ceremony). These are open to the public.

Tsechu Drubchen- 8th Day of 2nd Lunar Month

Since the heat in India makes it impossible for the dances in this ceremony to be performed in the 5th lunar month as they were in Tibet, this Drubchen is held for three days beginning on the 8th day of the 2nd lunar month. The tsechu Drubchen marks the birth of Guru Padmasambhava and is done in accordance with the terma, Lama Sangha, which was discovered by the great treasure master Guru Chowang and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
On the 10th day of the 2nd lunar month,a full day’s Lama Dance is performed in accordance with the ritual of Lama Sangdu. These lama dances are renowned for their blessings and are the foremost examples of the lama dances in Tibet in their original form. Many people come from all over to receive the blessings of this great ritual. On the next day, His Holiness Mindrolling Trichen would bestow a long life empowerment to the public in order to dispel the obstacles and difficulties in the coming year. The tradition has been observed down to the present day since the Tsechu Drubchen was performed in Mindrolling. It has been an opportunity both for everyone to receive the blessings of the Mindrolling Trichen and for the coming together of the monastic and lay sangha.

Saga Dawa Drubchen- 15th Day of 4th Month

This Drubchen held on the 15th day of the 4th lunar month marks the birth, enlightenment and mahaparinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha, one of the most important occasions throughtout the Buddhist world. Special prayers, rituals and butter lamp offerings are made during the ceremony.

Tel-da Tsechu- 10th Day of 5th Lunar Month

This auspicious ceremony marks the birth of the Guru Mahaguru Padmasambhava. This drubchen is performed for three days in accordance with the Lama Sangdu text from the 8th to the 10th day of the 5th lunar month. Suring the Drubhcen, secial feast practices are done and the Tsog ( feast offerings) is distributed to the general community.

Yarne, the Summer Retreat- 15th Day of 6th Lunar Month to 30th Day of the 7th Lunar Month

This is the rain retreat for one and a half months from the 15th day of the 6th lunar month to the 30th day of 7th lunar month. The retreat is held in accordance with the instructions of the Buddha in the Vinayana Sutra directingall monks to observe certain restrictions and engage themselves in meditation and practices for the period. Khenpos and Lopons give teachings each day and “So-Jong” or confessions are offered by the sangha during this retreat. Many butter lamps are offered and pujas are done during the retreat. On the evening of the 30th, the last day of the retreat, selected monks give teachings and expound the Dharma to the community. The retreat is usually followed by a 3-5 day holiday break for the monks.

It's pretty simple: you believe this recent Lancet study is the Truth, and, therefore you have to believe that virtually all other sources are way off. IraqBodyCount is a wild underestimate, ILCS is not """"legitimate"""" etc. Basically every edit you've made on all these pages is carefully orchestrated and loaded to lead everyone toward these beliefs. Now you're pissed that I've ever so slightly gotten in the way of your prolific POV-pushing by deleting a miniscule fraction of it, and now you're playing the victim. 

Let's put that act aside and look at what I've actually deleted. I've reverted basically three things here: 

1. Lancet page - claims about a supposed """"ILCS baseline 2002 mortality rate"""". Fabrications do not belong on wiki pages. I deleted that fabrication. The only """"sourced material"""" I deleted was stuff about Lancet baseline rates that were cited accurately enough, but only had any relevance to this section because they were being related to the fabrication I was removing. Once the fabricated """"ILCS baseline rate"""" is removed, the surrounding """"sourced material"""" from Lancet that I deleted no longer has any relevance to the section. It is entirely out of context and so properly removed along with the fabrication. The """"sourced material"""" that was there makes no sense being there unless the fabrication is there, so I removed it along with the fabrication. 

2. IBC page - I deleted an inaccurate and out of context claim authored by Timeshifter. I added a statement which says IBC showed an example of something, and provided a citation for this. Timeshifter then adds that Lancet authors dispute this claim from IBC, and he puts a footnote onto this, but the footnote leads to quotes by Lancet authors that address something else entirely. Thus, this claim of Timeshifter's is properly removed as it is falsely described as one thing when it is something else, and the citation leads to something that is different than how it's described. 

So the first two are just simple falsehoods and fabrications. Apparently it's """"against the rules"""" and """"POV-favoring"""" to delete POV-pushing falsehoods and fabrications.

3. IBC page - Guatemala study. I've questioned the relevance of this to IBC, and the accuracy of the description, and discussed this on the talk page. This one is at least more debatable than the others, as it is just tangential cherry-picking for a POV, rather than just fabrications and falsehoods for a POV.

Deleting these three things has been my great crime, causing poor Timeshifter so much pain and anguish, yeah right. As I've already said, I can't keep up with Timeshifter's proselytizing for the Lancet study on all these various pages. He's very commited to the cause, as proselytizers tend to be.""",0

"As I'm amazed by your intentional ignorance.  The only way I can comprehend it is that admitting 2 words interpreted LITERALLY as in the 1st way words should be interpreted according to most CHRISTIAN scholars - is that you've got something at stake financially.  Sorta like that Al Gore quote of how amazing it is to convince someone of the reality when their livelihood depends on them not understanding it.  Rather than trying to comprehend or acknowledge the reality of multiple references you're simply holding onto a religious dominance over the TRUTH.  That's a Pharasee - minded LIE.  You'll burn for that someday (IMHO).

FYI, """"Snugger"""" is a trademark; it's Emerson's name for their hugger-style fan. Personally, I disagree that a separate section needs to be added.

The motor, blades, etc. is no different. Refer to the section """"Bases for Comparison"""", subsection """"Height of the fan relative to the ceiling"""", for more info on huggers if you're interested. That section details their sole disadvantage; it is appropriate for it to be in that section since it is not a problem unique to huggers (though all huggers have it). The sole advantage of a hugger is that it saves spacesomething which is such blatantly obvious common sense that it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia article (any more than the statement """"water is wet"""" belongs in the article on water). Basically my point is that huggers are no different from ordinary fans, and so don't deserve their own section any more than each decor-themed fan at Home Depot deserves its own section.""",0

Hi, you deleted my post for the Bar Association of San Francisco.

Should I get a confirmation e-mail from the author to you directly or should I give you the e-mail address of the author to get that confirmation?

Also I would appreciate it if you could send me the deleted post or repost it because I do not have an archived copy with all of the external news links I put in to show its notoriety.  Thanks!

  
Apologies for the delay in replying, I only just noticed your post. Essentially, there are a number of problems with the article besides the copyright infringement. The article had a promotional tone and feel, largely as a result of copying the material form the association's website. With WP articles we try to maintain a neutral point of view so it may be a better idea to write the content in your own words. The article alo didn't cite reliable sources for much of its content in order to help support the claim that the association is notable. What I'd encourage you to do is rewrite the article, in your own words, using the information from the various sources to guide you and having very little dependency on the association's own website. If you feel you still need the deleted material for this please let me know and I'll strip out the references and provide them to you.

 Oxford Wikimania 2010 and Wikimedia UK v2.0 Notice 

Hi,

As a regularly contributing UK Wikipedian, we were wondering if you wanted to contribute to the Oxford bid to host the 2010 Wikimania conference. Please see here for details of how to get involved, we need all the help we can get if we are to put in a compelling bid.

We are also in the process of forming a new UK Wikimedia chapter to replace the soon to be folded old one. If you are interested in helping shape our plans, showing your support or becoming a future member or board member, please head over to the Wikimedia UK v2.0 page and let us know. We plan on holding an election in the next month to find the initial board, who will oversee the process of founding the company and accepting membership applications. They will then call an AGM to formally elect a new board who after obtaining charitable status will start the fund raising, promotion and active support for the UK Wikimedian community for which the chapter is being founded.

You may also wish to attend the next London meet-up at which both of these issues will be discussed. If you can't attend this meetup, you may want to watch Wikipedia:Meetup, for updates on future meets.

We look forward to hearing from you soon, and we send our apologies for this automated intrusion onto your talk page!

"""

Well, upon reviewing my original post I would like to moderate my original statements because I understand the confusion between the term """"Christmas"""" and the related practices.  It is my belief that we must clarify in the minds of laypeople(and people of other cultures) that Christmas is a commonly used term, often commercial, sometimes secular and used to apply to all seasonal celebrations, i.e. """"state Christmas tree"""", when in fact the united states government is not affiliated with any particular religion.

I would like to insist that the opening paragraph is highly bias and simply incorrect as it stands now:

1) Defines the Christian history of a celebration
2) Brief history
3) Anecdote
4) Note on the fallacy of placement of the celebration
5) Secular statement, as though the """"Christmas tree"""" and """"Santa Claus"""" are secular in origin, which they are not.

The way to fix this is to separate the term Christmas from the seasonal celebrations in the minds of readers.  Christmas is a commonly used religious and secular term first.  Second, it is a Christian celebration of a Jewish man's birth. 

Revised suggestion:
1) Define Christmas as a commonly used term
2) Christian definition of the celebration
3) Brief history of celebrations 
4) Note on the Christian placement of the holiday
5) Accurate attribution of Christmas, brief origins of 

Proposed pp:
Christmas is a """"[Christianized] term"""" for a traditional holiday practiced by many cultures throughout the world; the term is often used in a secular and commercial capacity. Christmas (literally, the Mass of Christ) is a holiday in the Christian calendar, usually observed on December 25, which celebrates the birth of the man, Jesus Christ.  The first Christmas celebration took place in Rome about the middle of the fourth century. The exact date of the nativity is not known, but the period from December 25 to January 6 — now known as """"The Twelve Days of Christmas"""", is traditionally a time of celebration for many cultures throughout the world.

Additionally:
I would like to ask that all references in the article precisely identify that """"Jesus"""" is Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ.  My Christian friends should also support this request, as my Mexican gardener is also named Jesus and I am left wondering which Jesus you are celebrating, lol.

Also, if you could please help regarding the Sante Kimes article. Apparently, because I am a scholar of that case, along with many other court cases, I'm being perceived as a person attempting to alter the integrity of the information on that page.
I have read that a user that insists on updates to only a certain page(s) is frowned upon, but is it not valuable to have a person who has extensive knowledge of a subject help construct an accurate article on that subject?
In my opinion, the Kimes article is rather biased and one-sided as to all the facts and available sources about the case.
Several of the sources listed in the """"References section"""" have statements by Kimes that are apparently being ignored, in favor for statements by judges or third parties quoted in newspaper reports. Likewise, the sources named in the """"References section"""" is, in and of themselves, biased. One very important aspect to the Sante Kimes cases has been her consistent plea of innocence and current appeals, however, that point is virtually ignored on the Kimes article. 
I'm glad you mention the pillars, because from what I understand, Wikipedia wants to display a neutral point of view on article subjects.

 The Cramp Twins 

The Cramp Twins is an animated series created by cartoonist Brian Wood. The show was produced in association with Cartoon Network Europe. It is about Lucien Cramp (Kath Soucie) and Wayne Cramp (Tom Kenny), not-so identical twins who live with their hygiene-obsessed mother (Nicole Oliver) and their Western-obsessed father (Ian James Corlett) in the fictional town of Soap City. Wayne and Lucian's personalities clash, and they rarely get along. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe (Lee Tockar), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Reverend Andrew Sparks) has a crush on him, but he hates her. Wayne's and Lucien's teacher is Miss. Hillary Hissy (Demi Buchanan, who also plays Tony's mom Lily and Mrs. Winkle). Lucien's friends include environment-friendly Tony Parsons (Terry Klassen who also plays Tony's dad, Seth) and Mari and Luke Harrison (Adam Little).

Season one premiered in the UK in September 2001 on Cartoon Network (UK) and on February 2, 2002 on CBBC on BBC One respectively and has reached high popularity with children. Season one ended on 21 June 2002. A second season premiered in Autumn 2003. Season 2 finished in 2003.
Season 3 started in 2004 and ended in 2005. Season 4 began in 2006 and ended that same year.
The show is currently licensed to Cartoon Network.

The show was originally canceled in the US in February 2005, when Mew Mew Power (aka """"Tokyo Mew Mew"""") was airing in its slot February 19, 2005, and it was originally intended to be a sneak peek for the series to air September 2005 with Cramp Twins continuing to air there, but 4Kids TV decided to cancel The Cramp Twins to put Mew Mew Power in its slot. A press release went out about a possible 3-part finale answering any unanswered questions, but the show returned in the summer of 2006, and later with more new episodes.

 Main characters 
 Lucien Cramp: Lucien is the smarter of the twins, but also considered the 'eco-loser'.  Gentle and sensitive, Lucien is frequently bullied and name-called by his brother; Wayne's favourite choice of addressing Lucien is """"Girlpants"""", but he sometimes calls Lucien a """"nerd"""". Lucien enjoys science, nature and is a vegetarian. Lucian longs for a pet, but due to his mother's extreme cleaniliness rules, he is denied owning any.  Secretly, Lucien keeps a worm farm under his bed, that only Tony, Mari, Wayne and Wendy know about. It is shown in many episodes that Lucien has a fear of clowns. He has many skills, including knitting, and has shown interest in playing the harp. Lucien likes going to Soap City's only swamp (the only place he gets peace from Wayne, who is afraid of the place) where Tony lives. Lucien is technically the older twin as he was born first in the opening credits. Lucien Cramp is voiced by Kath Soucie. 
 Wayne Archibald Cramp is the blue-skinned antihero of the series. He is taller, destructive, and the less intelligent of the twins. Wayne is obsessed with junk, which he collects and hides in his room; he spends most of his time at the junkyard, owned by only friend, Dirty Joe. Unlike Lucien, who loves the swamp, Wayne is terrified of the place, and also has a fear of frogs. Wayne is constantly annoyed by Wendy Winkle who has a crush on him. Wayne's only love is anything sugary, his main source of energy, and if he is deprived from it, he becomes tired and speaks nonsense. Wayne likes to give the impression that he's the best-behaved of the twins to his mother, and sometimes Miss Hissy, but in truth, he likes to manipulate to achieve his goals.  Sometimes Lucien who gets in trouble for Wayne's behaviour, although in many episodes, somehow the tides turn and Wayne is punished by pure coincidence. Wayne is vo",0

The article Gangtok is in FAR. The main problem mentioned is lack of inline citations. We've added some citations. More should be added. Also, prose may need to be improved at places. Indeed, while adding inline citations from different sources, new materials sometimes come up and can be added, too.

I have gone through the sections history, geography, climate, economy, and, civic governance. History section probably needs some more materials as well as inline citations. You can help by adding citations and materials in any section you like to. A good source that we have come across is the City Development Plan of Gangtok City. This is a collection of PDF files full of info on the city.

"One Modern Jewish Take
This article is taking an allegory too far. Most Rabbis acknowledge the Epic of Giglamesh as the original source material and value the science that says a global flood is pure bunk. Has the fact that a global flood would kill all the fish in the oceans? I am sad that this is singled out as the article of the day. People need to understand that for centuries Noah's Ark has been used as an obvious attack on science. Today it is religious fundamentalists' favorite method of attack upon evolution. - Sparky

"Hi Mary. I'm not going to bother adding anything to the Trance page, as that fellow Roux and his minions monitor what I say, to silence it before the public gets to read it. I suspect this has to do with the somewhat decline in Trance popularity starting in 2008. Last year I would go on this page to write about the trends of Trance, and they experienced a backlash, as their chosen leader (Armin) had not lost the polls yet. They couldn't believe that the trends could possibly be changing for the next generation in the dance scene. They experienced personal feelings of hatred towards me, thinking I was a House only propagator. In reality I am actually a Trance DJ, but don't tell them this, as it makes the whole situation even more fun for me. That said, there is no point in me adding stuff to the page because it will be deleted. I am currently writing a very complicated article on dance music if you want to proof read it, find a way to provide me with an e-mail address if you want.

The history of Trance is very complicated. For one thing, to put it simply, Trance isn't really a genre of music. (I hate to put it this bluntly and it kind of sounds crazy). This is why you can't find information. The Snoman section on Trance in his published book is mostly false hopes. When people do write about it, it is often from the perspective of industry interests who have equity stakes in the genre, so they often 'invent information' in attempts to keep the label in the media. Most of these clever music terms are the inventions of the English ) Sneaky buggers.

As Armin puts it, it is more 'A state of trance' like his show is titled. This observation is correct. It doesn't matter what its called, as long as its good. What he means when he says Trance is a state of mind, is that it is not some formulaic equation that determines what is and what isn't. All of these labels are just styles and buzz-words. You will find difficulty locating written information on Trance because it is just another offshoot of House, one of the many. The articles that you will find are probably from punters who came out of the Tiesto generation. Tiesto is in fact a House DJ, but don't tell punters this, or they may commit suicide. Many have currently experienced heart attacks or early menopause, when they found out Tiesto went back to a House sound now. Good Luck.",0

 Rasmussen Reports in Controversies and allegations of bias

Problems with the article
Apparently this is a very loose term used to distinguish people who have acquired some kind of long term fame or notoriety associated with popular culture.  Hendrix, The Beatles, Elvis, Sinatra, Crosby, Jolson, and so on might be described as """"pop icons"""" because they are strongly associated with, and in some ways personify, the zeitgeist or an era in popular culture.  This includes film and other popular art forms, and sport (De Niro, Monroe, Bogart, Muhammad Ali, Pelé).   It often includes people who died relatively young (Morrison, Hendrix, James Dean).  So far so good.

Then there are people whose work wasn't primarily in or related to popular culture, but whose image has been co-opted as a pop icon (Einstein).  Well, okay.

Now looking at the article, we see a section called """"Notable pop icons"""" comprising, presently, some forty names.  More than half of those names are sourced from a single news story based on a press release produced by a single media organisation in November, 2003. A further seven of them are base on a similar news story from a different media organisation in 2005  The criterion for the list of 100 members given in the first news story, it turns out, is a viewer's poll by a single cable television channel, VH1, from a shortlist drawn up by """"A panel of celebrities and experts – including presenter June Sarpong, newsreader Krishnan Guru-Murthy and GQ editor Dylan Jones.""""  Presumably the experts on the panel asked to remain anonymous.

Further examination of that single source also demonstrates that there are unexplained omissions from our list.  If we assume for the moment that membership of the VH1 list (which is biased towards the tastes and cultural memory of the British viewership of that channel) is a sign of """"pop icon"""" status, where is Princess Diana on our list?  She's number 5 on the VH1 list but completely absent from ours.  Similarly, The Simpsons (VH1: number 6) and Robbie Williams (VH1: number 9) are omitted from our list.

Looking in the opposite direction, Aerosmith is included in our list because MTV  featured the band in a program called """"MTV icons"""", but is nowhere to be seen in the VH1 100 (not surprising as the band, while not unknown in VH1's target market, isn't exactly a household name).  And while VH1 lists first man on the moon Neil Armstrong at 76, his trumpet-playing namesake Louis Armstrong (selected as one of 100 """"Icons of the Century"""" by Variety) is nowhere to be seen on VH1's chart.

There are also problems with the membership criteria of the sources.  I've already mentioned the UK bias of the VH1 list (which goes some way to explain the presence of Beckham and Robbie Williams, both household names in the UK but not so well known elsewhere). The Variety list, for  instance, sought to represent """"every side of show business"""", so relatively obscure figures such as Arthur Freed (who wrote the lyrics for Singin' in the Rain and produced many hit films) are listed as """"Icons of the Century"""".  Clearly the people on the list are there because they're """"iconic"""" in some sense, but not in the sense implied by this article.

Another thing that isn't addressed is the requirement of longevity.  Can we include Britney Spears, who a mere decade ago was an unknown with a recording contract and an audacious concept for a pop video for her debut single? Britney Spears' career has hit an air pocket, and there's no way of knowing whether her image will recover in the public mind.  Perhaps it's premature to describe this relative newcomer as a """"pop icon"""".""",0

Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real """"edit conflict"""" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - """"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references."""" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of """"Welsh nationality"""" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his """"explanation"""" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza8",0

So you are saying that the first Kingdom of Israel (1020–931 B.C.), Northern Kingdom of Israel (931–722 B.C.), the Kingdom of Judah (931–586 B.C.), the Hasmonean/Maccabee religious Jewish religious kingdom (140–37 B.C.), the region of Judea, and the Roman province of Judaea never existed? Interesting how Arabs can several centuries later invade Judea in the seventh century A.D. and somehow become indigenous.

Here are the origins for the name of the so-called """"Palestinians"""": H.H. Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, Harvard University Press, 1976, ISBN 0-674-39731-2, page 334: """"In an effort to wipe out all memory of the bond between the Jews and the land, Hadrian changed the name of the province from Iudaea to Syria-Palestina, a name that became common in non-Jewish literature.""""

This describes how the so-called """"Palestinian"""" Arabs invaded from Mecca and elsewhere in the Arabian peninsula and conquered Judea from the Byzantines (Greek Romans), who in turn had conquered the land from the Jews: Gil, Moshe; Ethel Broido (1997). A History of Palestine. Cambridge University Press, pp. 634–1099. ISBN 978-0-521-59984-9.

Clearly, the references cited by the Arabs on this page are inaccurate and not reliable.

"The law concerning the papal elections has been changed in the meantime. When Stephen was elected it was neccessary to receive episcopal consecration to assume the papal office. After the Decree In Nomine Domini of Pope Nicholas II (1059) the elect could have exercised papal office immadiately after his election, no matter whether already bishop or not. Besides, it is neccessary to distinguish the rites of episcopal consecration and of coronation. Celestine IV received episcopal consecration in 1238, three years before his election to the papacy, because in this year he became bishop of Sabina. He died before coronation, but not before episcopal consecration. Stephen was not a bishop when elected pope.",0

""":Moncrief, do you even know what a shepherd is? I used to work on a cattle ranch, so I know a bit about this stuff. To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, """"A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others."""" The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.

I am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a """"rodeo cowboy"""" to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd. But since I don't want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page, I'll settle for that as a compromise. Chris

"""The organization of the list of bandleaders by """"Nationality"""" in this article seems a bit arbitrary and perhaps not very useful?  Would a different organization be better?

Dispute over Human Rights Watch citation

This edit is the latest in a minor fracas over this cite, which fracas began here when Wehwalt removed the cite from the lede, describing HRW as a """"pressure group."""" Actually, in this controversial topic, probably the majority of sources could be described as """"pressure groups,"""" but that doesn't make them reliable when properly cited. I restored the cite in a less prominent position here, at which point Wehwalt added a rebuttal sentence, with edit summary """"added explanation of why the IDF knocked down these structures, consolidated into the Background section."""" I found this problematic, because the article doesn't actually say what Wehwalt added; it says that the group analyzed the claims by the IDF, and found them to be largely bogus. So, to leave Wehwalt's edit in place creates a false impression of what the HRW reports. I modified the section according, which edit was then reverted by Wehwalt. I'm going to leave it alone for a day or so to give Wehwalt the opportunity to clean it up. Incidentally, in Wehwalt's latest edit summary, he says that """"This is the article on Corrie, not on home demolitions. We are to give the reader a modicum of info on this, not draw conclusions."""" First of all, it seems to me that Corrie is only notable because of home demolitions. Secondly, giving the reader """"a modicum of info"""" would be best served by an accurate summary of the HRW cite, whereas altering it for POV reasons would be an example of """"drawing conclusions.""""

My name is Dean Estes. I met Snakefinger (Mr. Lithman) in 1981 when he and his band played on the front lawn of our high school. One of his band members, a former Dead Kennedy, had attended the school and made this cool event possible. I don't know why Steve Crabtree claims that Lithman was American and was not of European descent. Technically it may be true that the UK is not part of """"Europe"""" despite being a charter member of the EU, but Mr. Crabtree's claims risk giving an false impression. Phil """"Snakefinger"""" Lithman was English, as is easily verified and as was clearly obvious when the man spoke. Perhaps Steve meant that Snakefinger was living in America? (Specifically San Francisco.) Two years later I was fortunate enough to befriend one of The Residents. While I was savvy enough not to ask certain questions until enough trust had been earned, I do recall, during a discussion of the The Residents' remarkably unique sense of harmonization, asking if N. Senada had actually existed. My Resident acquaintance simply smiled and shrugged his shoulders, which I knew was a nice way of saying """"we aren't going there,"""" so I didn't pursue it. I believe it's pretty obvious that """"the mysterious N. Senada"""" never actually existed when you review the various things that have been said about him. Isn't the amusing play on the name of the Baja Mexican town """"Ensenada"""" clue enough? However, this is another case where the question of whether or not such aspects of the Residents mythos """"matter"""" is perfectly valid. Of course it doesn't really matter. As one of the people who actually does know the answers to some of the speculation here, it's so strange, seeing how some people post misinformation with conviction (intentionally?) while others deny facts. For the most part, to quote an old Eno lyric, """"those who know, they don't let it show.""""  -) Mystery and myth are more fun, and I think it's safe to say that's part of the point of the Residents' myriad mysteries. Nevertheless, while Snakefinger protected The Residents' secrets, he wasn't secretive about his own """"real"""" identity or history at all. My apologies to Steve if I've misunderstood him.""",0

No, the facts are pretty clear. You changed it away from the DSM IV in the DSM IV criteria section while claiming you know the DSM IV.
Well, the main point remains that you think that how the world at large uses it is superseded by the medical operalization, which is bogus. And really, you can cherry pick a source but the law version ios not really what the general public uses. So, lets take the general merrrian websters def: """"a young person especially between infancy and youth"""". But heck, I am not maki9ng those claims about ownership for nothing.
Well, my point is that with anorexia nervosa, the general use and the medical definition are rather close, and the article does not start with the DSM IV diagnostic criteria:
A. Refusal to maintain body weight at or                                      above a minimally normal weight for age and                                      height (e.g., weight loss leading to                                      maintenance of body weight less than 85% of                                      that expected; or failure to make expected                                      weight gain during period of growth, leading                                      to body weight less than 85% of that                                      expected).

B. Intense fear of gaining weight or                                      becoming fat, even though underweight

C. Disturbance in the way in which one's                                      body weight or shape is experienced, undue                                      influence of body shape on self-evaluation,                                      or denial of the seriousness of the current                                      low body weight. 
D. In postmenarcheal females, amenorrhea,                                      i.e., the absence of at least three                                      consecutive menstrual cycles. 

Does not look like those criteria are in the second line of the article. So, lets stop the pretense that the article is even close to this out of balance article.
Yes, I just have to go through all the edits and make a tally.

You know what, forget it. The guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here, because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why (except of course to start SHOUTING) has reported me for not being civil. How ironic is that. Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that. I guess once you get to the end, you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal, but that's assuming you haven't fallen asleep, or shot yourself, having read the same four words - Brazil, Germany, biggest & loss (and their million variants), multiple times. Seriously, if people here think what's currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way, perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are """"unencyclopedic"""", frankly you couldn't be more wrong. There's no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation - that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match, both now and in 20 years time. If you don't want it to be in this one, please think of a better reason than """"unencyclopedic"""", if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.

That said, on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article, here's what the opening should look like, if you're trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.

Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.""",0

"Wikipedia is a source of information on a huge range of issues and topics, many of which do not get an airing in conventional references; it is particularly useful in providing details on obscure flags across the planet that are not often featured in standard works.  Included in Wikipedia’s annals are the flags for example, of Khuzestani Arabs, ethnic Somalis in Kenya,  the Bakonjo of Uganda, the Turks of western Thrace – some decidedly obscure banners but I am grateful to Wikipedia contributors for providing information on these myriad groups which  allows me to know exactly whom these designs represent and understand the context when I see them aloft on news reports and elsewhere. Why therefore are we to be denied similar access to information concerning the extant flag in the English county of Dorset? 
The fact is that a gold flag with a red edged white cross, designated the “Dorset Cross”, can be seen flying across the county; it is also a fact that the town council in the Dorset town of Wimborne has embraced this as their preferred county flag. The design is therefore a tangible reality, that has evident popularity and the full support of a local authority, what factor in these circumstances makes the Dorset Cross ineligible for inclusion in Wikipedia? One might argue that the Dorset Cross is not an official flag - how many of the examples cited above can claim to be official? The four snakes and cross flag depicted in the entry on Martinique in fact specifically states that this is an “unofficial region flag” however, one presumes that it actually flies in the island i.e. it exists and is possessed of a certain popularity and is therefore worthy of note. How does the circumstance in Dorset differ? As in Martinique, the Dorset Cross flag is not official; as in Martinque, the flag can be seen flying in many places, how is this flag then not worthy of mention or depiction in Wikipedia? A trawl across the internet reveals that there are two flags currently commercially available as Dorset flags – one is a banner of the arms of the County Council, which design the general public is not legally entitled to fly, the other is the Dorset Cross, which the public demonstrably are flying but this reality is not being reflected in Wikipedia, where we currently have an illustration of the banner of the arms but none of the Dorset Cross – this strikes me as imbalanced and tendentious. 
The Dorset Cross is a contender in a current competition held under the auspices of the Dorset County Council to select a flag that they will themselves endorse. The competition itself is of course worthy of mention and when all the contenders are revealed they should of course all appear in Wikipedia but the fact is that notwithstanding said competition, the Dorset Cross is already flying and predates the competition and Wikipedia, in not allowing its depiction is guilty of misinformation. One relies on Wikipedia to advise that the flag of the Dinka is a five striped horizontal design and takes such advice on good faith; how odd therefore that one should not be similarly able to consult this resource on a flag that one can see flying in the streets and all about.User:Vexilo",0

Portal:Architecture
Hello, are you interested in rotating the Portal every third week? 

Very nice pictures of Barcelona. May I nominate some for featured picture at Commons? Thanks  

You're right that it always needs updating in many ways. Don't forget also DYK and in the news (in the news we sadly seem to neglect the most). It would be nice to even rotate the SI and SAs on a shorter than 1 week basis sometime, I don't know if were ready for that yet even though we have something of a backlog developing in the nominations. What do you think of this, Hallidie Building? I found a picture for it finally, and need to substantiate the claim about the first curtain wall. I forget where I read that, but know I did somewhere. Once I remember and add a little more, it might be my first DYK. Best, + R/W 

 Proposal accepted - re: """"…so my proposal is:- perhaps you guys would consider lending a hand keeping those bits up to date and I'll rotate on the 3rd week. How does that sound?…"""" See also new toolbar, below. Feel free to edit if its useful. — (talk • contribs) 

Thanks! You can rotate the portal tonight, if you'd like to, or I'll get to it tomorrow, since I delayed two weeks now. — 

mosque to house
I think that will be more accurate. it's a pilgrimage site therefore a shrine... the use of mosque in the ref is used not in accurate fashion.  

Pilgrimage site and worship site. It is more accurately a worshiping site and muslims come from all over the world to visit it as it is one of the 3 holiest sites. Maybe having it Mosque for worship is enough and fair along with the word shrine.  

house of pilgrimage. if not, it's best to leave it. almaqdisi, stop stalking.  

I do not undersand. Mginnly is saying that there are many sources which mention it is a Mosque. This is true. Now you are discussing it is for piligrimage or worship. Pointless. Keep the word a Mosque only if pilgrimage will be an issue of debate too! No need to mention piligrimage or worship, just a mosque. And accroding  to the definition of a Mosque, it is a place of worship. In Mecca the piligrims go to worship in a Mosque called masjid al-Haram. But again, if this is an issue of debate, forget it and just keep the word Mosque along with the word shrine. Simple...  
it's by definition not a mosque. some refer to it as mosque because of pilgrimage. No, the article will never say in the lead that it's a """"mosque"""" because it isn't. Live with it.  

Alternate version will be to leave """"shrine"""" and in the end of the lead say something like """"Some refer to the Dome as a Rock as a mosque even though it isn't"""". That can be acceptable too.  

Amuros, please let us not repeat the stuff we did in several talk pages...! Any one can go to Google and find """"Dome of the Rock Mosque"""" or """"Mosque of Umar"""" to see that this is indeed a Mosque.! I will stop discussing this any further.  

Please do stop this nonsense and violations.  17:30, 12 October",0

The trouble with Mahler analysis is that there isn't a consensus about his compositional thinking.   So, like it or not, comments are going to be subjective, and may well look like """"original research"""".    But it ought to be possible to explain why he thought of this work as a symphony (he deliberately withheld a number from it, because he had a superstition about Ninth Symphonies being terminal: the work we know as his Ninth was in fact his Tenth, and, like Das Lied von der Erde, posthumously premiered).   This article doesn't address that.   It has been suggested that the six movements can actually be seen as covering the traditional four - movements 3 -5 jointly fulfilling the scherzo function and helping to balance the finale.  (One also quotes the Eighth Symphony's second movement).  It might be possible to find in the finale a texture resembling a hybrid of scena and aria (two of each, separated by a funeral march, based on elements of the Trinklied which begins the work, in the role of a development section) and sonata.  The last section of the finale with its repeated """"Ewig"""", could also be seen  both as  a cabaletta and the coda to the whole symphonic conception.   So the intellectual and formal weight distribution of the classical symphony is completely reversed.  But we still have something which can be called a symphony, even though nothing more different from its immediate predecessor, the Eighth, could be imagined.   I'm not proposing this as an addition to the article, simply suggesting that it wouldn't be too hard to find similar thinking in the literature.94.192.68.44    Croy379""",0

Actually, most of the romance words in English come from Norman French, abit removed from French (especially modern French). Then there is another grouping of Latinate words which came in via the Grammar school boys (Grammar schools of the late medieval being schools which taught latin grammar, and which required students to speak grammar at all times), and the ecclesiastical coinages, from around the same period (late Tudor England onwards). The first lot, the Norman French, had a rather different historical journey from the second lot, the second lot being rather closer to Classical Latin (actually most are Church or Medieval latin, but the difference here is not so great). The Norman French borrowings have a little more fanciness than regular Germanic English because Norman French was the language of the English ruling class (and law etc) for about 300 years. Most the food words come through this path. The second group (borrowed in from about 1400 to 1700) are fancy not so much because they represent the ruling classes, but because they represent learning. Then there's a few other words which come in from other places, like Piano (from Italtian), and others which are similar because they actually come from a common germanic/italic root even a proto-Indo-European root.

I think that it would be worth noting the path of derivation (NF vs Lating vs other).

On a second related point, the Germanic in English comes from several dialects, from both the North Germanic group (Norse) and the West Germanic. Old English had a few differing dialects. Northern English dialects tend to have a little more Norse and a little less Anglo-saxon, than the south-east. There are Norse and Saxon cognates which both made it into English, skirt and shirt being the famous examples. So, again some more information regarding the exact derivation of the Germanic, unless someone wants to go the whole hog and put in the proto-Germanic reconstructions. But that probably cannot be done. 14:17, 15 July 2007",0

Your Uncivil Friends Refuted

Or were you saying something to the over 300 people who've downloaded this refutation of you're lies?:

And so that everyone can see part of it here:

JoshuaZ said:

""""Starfire, as I tried to explain to you Wikipedia cares about reliable sources and verifiability, not truth. Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.""""

Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, """"Now"""" is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?

JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.

Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, """"Now"""" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?

Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:

Joshua also said:

""""In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.""""

Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?

Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:

""""ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using """"Darwinist"""" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?

""""if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!

""""I suggest you calm down""""

I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?

I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:

""""Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."""" - Ephesians 4:26-27

Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's. 

""""and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.""""

Oh the old """"you need to read it but I don't"""" and """"you sit and think while your grounded young man"""" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.

I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.

I'll enhance the list for you:

"Johnuniq and Quietmark, 

This is my last response. I do not have a problem with how you handled the discussion page and I appreciate the polite responses. I brought up my PhD in statistics because a contributor thought it would be appropriate to just delete my discussion, so I wanted to know why they felt that was within their purview. Do they hold some higher degree or happen to be an expert in evolutionary theory to whom I should defer? I am not a creationist trying to tear apart evolution, but a scientist trying to scientifically discuss the article. As such, my comments should not be quickly dismissed, but should be answered. 

I made the suggestion that there are many verified methods of falsifiability, which have been in either peer-reviewed journal articles or stated by Darwin himself (I believe this post was deleted, but I can provide them and their references to help out this section, btw I can find at least four or five, which is more than are currently listed, but are actually correct). This article listed none of these methods of falsifiability in the section labeled falsifiability.  

I don’t want creationism taught in school. One of the methods of falsifiability this article mentions requires a deity. This opens up Pandora’s box.  How easily could a creationist say “What’s good for the goose is good for the gander?” If a deity can be used for falsifiability (the cornerstone of a scientific theory), then obviously it is allowed into science.  If it is allowed into science, then keeping creationism and ID out is not justifiable. Do not give creationists such an easy target.  

Other methods mentioned in the article, I easily disputed using only the definition of falsifiability found at wiki, among other places.  While you (in general) have dismissed my claims as being SYN, you could not break the logic used nor provide an argument as to why I might be wrong. This is like shooting fish in a barrel and you are giving creationists the ammo to do so.  How much ammo do you want to give them?  

Royboy, first the definition of chimera they are using has change from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics) so the definition has already changed, because these exist.  Beyond that, evolution does not inherently predict that there are no chimeras as long as the lineage can be traced back and it was advantageous to have say a lion’s head and a horse’s body.  And as for the genetic variation being easily verified, how would this be done?  Our knowledge of genetic coding is very limited, and is certainly not to the point of finding the small changes that would appear relatively quickly in a population as you are suggesting. The number of microarrays involved would be cost prohibitive and lead large error rates that would only find very large genetic anomalies.  Beyond that, reason would dictate that mankind as been relatively the same for a million years, thus these are very slow processes.  In fact, I think you could be the first evolutionist I have ever heard, that is suggesting that these are quick processes. 

I am playing devil’s advocate, because I have found that it is the best way to truly test the validity of what is being stated and this is the scientific way. Look again at my previous posts (at least the posts that have not been deleted), not only do I say what section needs to be changed and why, but I have “quoted reliable sources that throw doubt on some aspects of the article”.  I have no peer-reviewed journal article stating that these methods of falsifiability are wrong because nobody has a peer-reviewed journal article stating that they are correct, so why would anybody argue against a point that hasn’t been made? I may be able to find some creationist webpage, but I don’t want that in the article either.  You may be right that I am committing SYN, but these are relatively simple arguments that can easily be made by others.  I’m not trying to denigrate evolution, so there would be no point to making an article called “Are objections to evolution valid”.  I just want science to prevail.  Make arguments strong and scientifically justifiable or they will be used as weapons to attack evolution. 

I believe that the section on falsifiability needs to be overhauled and carefully reconsidered, this is the wiki wringer you are mentioning Quietmark, my posts are part of that. I’m not asking it to be overhauled right now, but I think it does need to happen. This, however, I leave to your (collective) judgment.  If you would like me to review or help out, I am willing to do so, but only by email or talk.  I will not be editing this site or discussion page again.  It is my opinion that fair scientific discussion is not prevailing here, as nearly all of my material have been deleted or archived.

I admit that it is hypothetically possible that opposition to reducing abortion time limits might be motivated by concerns about late diagnosis of fetal abnormalities.  As you know, such abortions account for a very tiny fractions of abortions, but you're correct that concern about such situations could hypothetically cause someone to block a general reduction in time limits.

However, RCOG has said it is pro-choice, explicitly supporting """"rights of women to exercise personal choice.""""

You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to """"cancer"""". It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. nableezy - """,1

"DrPrinceton

GITHUB is the top place where new computer projects are created and discussed by computer programmers. Anything that isn't right gets corrected pretty fast. For over two years the PyPrimes speed test which is open source has had not one person question the results and since it is open source anyone can download the core of Python a major new computer language and run PyPrimes and test all the various prime algorithms. Every algorithm lost to the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, every one but Prime Spirals.

Now, outside of that real world test, the average mathematician or computer programmer is pretty much clueless as to primes and how they really interact in the modern world today (ie. Cryptology).

Now I could have used a ton of links to NPOV and alternative sites where for 20 years you have various groups arguing what this new algorithm means for the world. In fact much of the original argument was erased from Usenet in the 1990's, and the only group that could have done that was the NSA. 

Since the original algorithm was released when the NSA still controlled encryption related publishing (original paper was 1995) NO PUBLISHING COMPANY would have touched anything claiming to be how this algorithm made all encryption OBSOLETE, that was the original paper, saying to the world in 1995, here world, here is where every prime number above 5 MUST BE, there are only 8 Prime Spirals, now your whole concept of encryption has been DESTROYED by this work.

So, this prime algorthm was tied to national security issues in 1995, and in 1995 the NSA had a headlock on all academic publishing and guess what they still do today, who funds the AMS and the top journals? THE NSA

Now my original article didn't go this deep into why in 1995, this work could not be published in academia due to the NSA chokehold on academic publishing for anything that could possibly be used to create new encryption or damage old encryption.

Now 99.99% of the world is clueless that PRIMES are a big deal in crypto.

A HUGE DEAL

So understanding where they all exist and on what spirals they exist, you can now do neat tricks, like create huge seed keys for ECC crypto that gives the person that creates such a seed key a backdoor to that crypto, oh no, now we're talking about the heart of the issue WIKI LEAKS is all about crypto and how the NSA has a special skeleton key to the seed keys released by NSA projects like NIST and ENISA (europes equivalent).

Now in 1995 to 1999 or so this was discussed in many thousands of pages all over usenet, try to find them now, most are gone, now I actually participated in that era in some usenet discussions about the ENNISA paper, you cannot find one thread now mentioning ENNISA from the 1990's.

So erased all the discussion in math and physics groups about ENNISA?

Yet, if you really know where to look, you can find some references to the work, not ENNISA but the person's name and some of the the actual math still exists.

Now, the math is in books, who published the books, the guy that released it has his own publishing company and it was done via ebooks.

So I have a copy of the ebook. I know it's real.

Now today you have academics taking credit for bits and pieces of his work, and they are 100% controlled sock puppets of the NSA.

So the NSA is now controlling what the public learns about this discovery 20 years after the fact it was released via usenet.

One of the new algorithms is the Atkin sieve, look who published it with Atkin, the guy that sued the US Government in the 1990's to allow software to be published without interference of the NSA.

Look at the guys wiki page, he was tutored by the guy that actually created ECC, the stuff the NSA is using to backdoor all encryption today.

So 1995, the guy is suing the US Gov and 10 years later he is at AMS as the co-author of one of the 3 prime algorithms discussed in ENNISA in 1995.

Just google NSA and AMS, see all the NSA funding.

Just like when academics rebelled in the 1980's against the stranglehold the NSA had on crypto, guess what the NSA did, they bought out all of academia with grants.

Now I'm not a tin foil hat guy/girl, I'm retired, I was in academia and I can actually discuss stuff about math and how academia works and how various topics were taboo in the 1970's through the 1990's.

So AMS MAA AMA, etc, all are now in bed with grants and funding from the NSA.

You look at sieve of Atkin and who is on the paper the kid that sued the government over crypto software in the 1990's, who was groomed by the daddy of ECC now the top crypto used",0

 Infobox cast list/billing 

I've noticed that the order of the cast list has been changed several times in the past few weeks, mostly moving Patrick Dempsey and/or Isaiah Washington higher in the list.

First off, your baseless accusations. You accused me of bad faith. Precious. As recently as yesterday you refereed to the inclusion of Dado Prso's first name in the article (as is the case on hundreds of other sportspeople bios throughout Wiki), as a """"Serb nationalist talking point"""", a """"thinly veiled political advocacy"""", and an """"unverified Serbian name claim"""", also back in 2006 you were dismissive of the AFP source, at one point even calling for Prso's ID scan. When I brought this up, your response was calling it a figment of my imagination and making ridiculous accusations of bad faith!? You also accused me of proving a point, basing it on my mere presence here. The only reason I'm here posting on this page now is your removal of Prso's first name based on a claim that its inclusion is """" tendentious & unreferenced"""". Clearly there are and there have been references on this page all along. Frankly I found it extremely unlikely that someone as nit-picky and anal as you would fail to notice the references on the talk page when you removed the first name from the article, but I guess it's possible. Also, as per your """"I (Joy) didn't overlook anything - none of these links were referenced in the article or in the talk page"""" claim, it is not true. The first three links I presented to you just above have been on this talk page page for 8 years (and the AFP story from the FIFA official page is among them) and you clearly were aware of them back in 2006 as the ANON referenced them when addressing you directly and you even mention some explicitly yourself in your responses. So assuming in good faith that your failure to notice them now in 2014 was an honest oversight on your part I have to inform you once again that you DID overlook them because they've been here all this time. For the dissection of the Nezavisne ref, I'm not even sure what you're pushing and arguing for there. Nobody on this page, least of all me, has disputed that he goes by Dado (the article is called Dado Prso in case you failed to notice that too) so why you felt compelled to argue that is beyond me. From the best that I could gather, you don't want his first name Miladin in the intro, but you can live with it in the 'early career' section and you're basing all of this this on the fact that when you total them up most references are to Dado and Miladin, which is completely ridiculous, IF this is what you're arguing for (if not forget the previous sentence). Yes, of course they're to Dado, this is what he goes by, but that doesn't negate his first name.  """,0

I removed the following content which seems to be not particularly well-sourced, and a bit off topic - seems more related to a public relations type page, but I can't find exactly where it'd fit best, if anywhere at all.

""""==Two-Way Communication in Public Relations==
Two-way communication can be contrasted with [[broadcasting]], a one-way form of communication.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Two-way communication uses communication to negotiate with the public, resolve conflict, and promote mutual understanding and respect between the organization and its public(s). 

There are different types of two-way communication in public relations; symmetric and asymmetric.

'''Two-way asymmetric'''
*Employs social science methods to develop more:'''Persuasive communication'''
*Generally focuses on achieving short-term attitude change;
*Incorporates lots of feedback from target audiences and publics;
*Is used by an organization primarily interested in having its publics come around to its way of thinking rather changing the organization, its policies, or its views.

'''Two-way symmetric public relations'''
*Relies on honest and open two-way communication and mutual give-and-take rather than one-way persuasion;
*Focuses on mutual respect and efforts to achieve mutual understanding;
*Emphasizes negotiation and a willingness to adapt and make compromises;
*Requires organizations engaging in public relations to be willing to make significant adjustments in how they operate in order to accommodate their publics;
*Seems to be used more by non-profit organizations, government agencies, and heavily regulated businesses such as public utilities than by competitive, profit-driven companies.Source: Managing Public Relations by James E. Grunig and Todd Hunt, 1984

""""NDP-affiliated""""
I added a fact tag to the four-times-reinserted modifier """"NDP-affiliated"""" to the mention of Bill Tieleman; other journalists are not generally singled out by party affiliation/loyalty, nor are publishers such as CanWest (which is widely seen as a propaganda arm of the BC Liberal Party, also one of the party's major financial contributors).  It's not that Tieleman isn't an NDPer, but his credentials go beyond his NDP politicking and he is increasingly a critic of that party, also.  I'm responding partly, also to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christy_Clark&action;=historysubmit&diff;=401129881&oldid;=401095803 this edit by ).  I've puzzled long and hard over my own real-world COI on BC political articles, but I see no reason to recuse myself from participation in BC political arti9cles, though generally I give them as wide a berth as possible; but when I recognize POV political activity/wording, as a responsible Wikipedian I can't not say something about it, or challenge the POVism - and COI/spin edits - when I see them.  My interest here is to prevent Wikipedia from being used as part of any campaign p.r. machine (of any party), and to make sure Wikipedia principles are observed - particularly by party operatives who have no reason to respect Wikipedia guidelines or concepts like WP:NPOV.  In the case of this item about BC Rail, there's lots missing, including the search of the Clark-Marrissen home during the opening of the investigation (and that curious telephone call thelling them the police were coming, and why no warrant was needed....vs. all the other highly suspect/irregular warrants to do with that case).  But there's also lots of other commentators, particularly from smalltown papers or independently syndicated, but also notable bloggers/indepednent reserachers like Sean Holman, Laila Yuile and BC Mary who have similarly spoken out about Clark's involvement in the BC Rail matter and how it weights against her in the eyes of the public, and of the """"informed media"""".  She may have been out of teh way for the HST fracas, and the Big Media have pronounced her """"clean"""" of that - but he Big Media also have maintained a veil of silence over BC Rail.  The current text says that she resigned for family reasons; but it's well-citable  that the timing of her resignation was seen to have to do with the BC Rail affair.  And about the Tieleman thing, unless every time Conservative-affiliated columnists or BC Liberal-affiliated columnists and media outlets are similarly tagged in articles mentioning their opninions and claims (often false), it's not fair to single out Tieleman for this; that's the reason for the cite tag; Tieleman's own byline says only """"Bill Tieleman is one of BC's best known communicators, political commentators and strategists. Bill writes a politics column Tuesdays in 24 Hours newspaper and The Tyee online magazine. Bill has been Communications Director in the B.C. Premier's Office and at the BC Federation of Labour. Bill owns West Star Communications, a consulting firm providing strategy and communication services for labour, business, non-profits and government.""""  And frankly, seeing whats going on with the NDP and teh things the Party Council/James supporter types have been calling him, he may not be """"NDP-affiliated"""" much longer....  """,0

To respond your points: 1) The National Council of Young Israel is I believe the parent body so to speak of that speaks for Young Israel type Jews - Which is what I meant by calling it """"branch of Judaism"""". I am not aware of them being an advocacy group. Perhaps you can source your statement for that. Your personal feelings on their opinions and what you imagine them advocating obviously does not count here. What matters is that they are a notable organization by WP standards (while your neighborhood association probably is not), and therefore their opinion is notable on Wikipedia too. This is in addition to the fact that they've been cited by a noteworthy newspaper, The Jewish Press. 
2) You haven't stated why their opinion is not relevant to Goldstone himself. While there has been much criticism of the Goldstone report which has been covered in that article, this criticism is specifically about giving an award to Goldstone himself and rightly relevant to an article about him and the awards he's received.

1. I do not want to hide Darwin, but give him is place where he belongs, as a historical figure and definition. 2. What I have seen in the old talk before I arrived, and during the time that I have been here, is that all specialists try it work on this and leave disillustioned.  
  
  . I agree with Slrubenstein above. I have long argued that my position, Endler's position (position 1 high up in this discussion page) is a current scientific one and very closely linked with Darwin's.
Excatly, it is A current one. Not THE current one. making that THE definition is WP:NOR.  
  
It confuses because the old definitions are incorrect.  
Kim, I do not see how you can say this unless you agree with Henry Ford that """"history is bunk.""""  Most people are interested in history, and there are even scientists who are interested in the history of their science.  That it confuses you does not mean (as I think is now evident) that it will confuse most readers of this encyclopedia.  They understand that things change.  They also understand that trends have beginnings.  It is simply meaningless to say """"the old definition is incorrect.""""  If you do not understand why, I urge you to read up on the philosophy of science - definitions are more or less useful.  It was that old definition that led to a line of inquiry that has led evolutionary scientists to more precise and more useful understandings of the process.  If anything, as educators we should show readers how scientists start with one formulation of natural selection and then refine it.  
You know, the fact that you reject Darwin's definition of natural selection does not mean natural selection and the theory of evolution are wrong.  On the contrary, it simply means that science has a history, that scientists debate and refine concepts which necessarily change over time.  Do you think this is a trivial point?  In the United States, at least, you are dead wrong.  If you are not from the US let me tell you, there is a huge """"creationist"""" movement which has, on numerous ocassions, had the theory of evolution banned from high schools.  And you should know that one """"argument"""" they make is that Darwin was - well, as you say, """"incorrect.""""  """"See!"""" they exclaim, """"even scientists say Darwin was wrong!  We should no longer teach evolution!""""  Obviously, they misunderstand the way science works.  They do not understand that scientists refine and develop theories without necessarily rejecting them.  I think scientists have an obligation to educate people about this.  Showing how scientists accept an idea, and then change its definition or conceptualization by refining it without repudiating it is the best way to accomplish this.    |  Talk 
You confuse hiding Darwin versus focusses on current usage first and add darwin's definitions in the history section.  
Okay, but with all due respect, you confuse starting with Darwin for focussing on Darwin.  They aren't the same.  There are two reasons for starting with Darwin: one, it is a reasonable starting point, two, whatever differences there are between you, Axel, Marco and others, or among different scientists who have published on natural selection, all can agree that Darwin introduced the idea.  Why not just say @@@Natural selection''', as first introduced by Darwin, refered to ....  Since Darwin, evolutionary scientists have revised his definition based on new findings in genetics and molecular biology...?    |  Talk

The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones:  Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj.  Nasai was also Iranian.  The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars.  The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors.  Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some """"real Arab"""" from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of """"al-Qushayri"""" roots is unverifiable.

The position of the GLBT community is not unlike that of women and minorities in previous eras: that they have rights that are not being recognized or equally protected. I suppose a truly neutral phrasing would acknowledge that some people feel that such rights do not exist and thus do not deserve broad legal protections or social recognition.

Yes, in theory Jimbo is the final """"court of appeal"""" but that is not a route which anyone takes seriously, as far as I can tell. In practical terms the only recourse is to appeal to Arbcom itself, but how likely is it that Arbcom will admit that it's got something wrong? If Arbcom's conduct during a case has thrown due process out of the window, what is the likelihood that it will find itself at fault? Human pride and institutional defensiveness, if nothing else, will count against it. Right now, if Arbcom commits an abuse of process there is no way of correcting it other than voting out the offending arbitrators, which could take years depending in which tranche of elections they're due to come up for a vote. There is no process for anyone other than Arbcom to review cases, nor for egregious mishandling of a case to be tackled. In effect we have a single """"accountability moment"""" once a year and there is no accountability, no recourse and no effective oversight of how they have conducted themselves.

"""Hmm.  Ok so we might be miners digging from opposite sides on this one.  I think there are two separate points to clarify.  
1) I agree that we have two competing systems of measurement, and I don't mind them both being on the same page.  I guess we just have to decide which is the """"default"""" (by which a monarch moves or is placed above/below a near neighbour).  Basically, I feel that if we had two dead monarchs whose reigns were VERY close to each other, but where the absolute days conflicted with years/days, we should have years/days override absolute days and perhaps include a footnote to draw attention to the overlap.  Anything else would appear like a mistake.  I've just checked, and so far, none of our close ties present too much of a conflict for now.

2) What to do when Bhumibol, Elizabeth, and Tuanku approach another monarch in table one.  My feeling is that these problems are unique, momentary events that resolve themselves:  once a monarch """"in motion"""" (alive) passes a monarch """"in stasis"""" (dead!), they move up the list.  The problem at stake (and this happens only a few times a year) is precisely WHEN to move them.  Since they don't move up automatically (one of us does it manually), we are bound to be inaccurate:  I'm in the Central time zone of North America, so WHEN exactly did Bhumibol surpass Victoria - his time zone, hers, mine - and if I change it in the evening versus the morning, what day does that constitute?  To be honest, we usually make changes when we think to check the page and manually move a monarch.  I'm okay with that.

"""Kenneth Tennyson's reckless behavior in other forums==

As far as Kenneth Tennyson bashing other authors, here is an exerpt from a book review on Amazon.com:

Founder of the homemade Mushindo Karate movement, never studied under a legitimate teacher, or any martial art teacher, never set foot in Asia, completely disproven, shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. Of course he claims to have studied under masters in Tibet, and been a disciple of Okinawan Karate teachers - since disproven by such worthy sources as Gorge Mattson, et al. Was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back (""""Sleep with me and I'll enlighten you"""" kinda thing), uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what ex-students say at him, a propaganda liemaster. 

The person he is bashing is none other than Terrence Dukes (or the real Frank Dukes from the movie Bloodsport)

While putting others down, Kenny brags, or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people:

Hmmm... well, kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera, alot of jumping and posturing, and a lot of religious themes to it. I guess it depends on what martial arts you've trained in to determine whether I can kick A$$ or not. let's see... I'm a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. I've got to start learning about grappling though. 

Freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that Kenny is a racist. Here are some excerpts from users from other forums:

(The Armchair Analyst - Asia Times Forum)
I see. However, you sounded like a racist.
No, I have no """"South Asian sensitivities"""". I am no nationalist/jingoist. I consider myself above it all. 

ALL your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of """"greatness"""". It may be in a narrow Anglo-saxon way, but not in a Gandhi-Buddha sort of a way. Get it?

Civilizations such as India (actually even China until today) have NEVER had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.

You have generalized Indians to be bigots etc., I agree that SOME not all are. But the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as """"obnoxious"""", by definition makes you a racist. YES IT DOES! 

(rocky - Asia Times Forum)
What inaccuracy are you referring to? If Brits came to India and got rich, was the wealth Indian or British? Besides looting, what exactly did British accomplish? While your bias is clearly visible with this statement, what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?

Isnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005, it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass, why on earth would anything written by Anglo-Saxon when Europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? Isnt there a vested interest on part of the European to disparage Native Cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? 

That's just a couple of the many others. However, I do not want to clog up this page.

I have also noticed that Kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles, and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  I know that I am not the only one who knows this:'(Brahman - Martial Arts Planet Forum)i really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine, which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion, were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning.

I regret having to tell you this but there are a huge amount of majority views were once minority views.  Its irrelevant.

Parts of my own Talk Page deleted by editors who think they know better

Dear impartial but not disinteresed reader, Coren and I have been having an entertaining and enjoyable """"discussion"""" on the finer points of """"soapboxing"""".  She is of the firm, resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to """"soapboxing"""" and has deleted it.  I recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the """"investment predictions for 2008"""" section at the bottom of the page, but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section.  She has declined the opportunity to amend, leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed ever-so-gently against my back, with Coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is, in her God-like view, """"soap-like"""".  Not the most pleasant position to be in, I can assure you.

To use another example, picked completely at random: Let's say there's been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over, say, fractional reserve banking, and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in.  Then let's say I post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now in-my-humble-view slaughtered version.  Is that """"soapboxing""""??

To use another example, closer to home.  Let's say a guy like Zenwhat says to his co-conspirators, """"What can we do to have OUR version of debt-based monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail?"""", like he clearly said here under the (desperate?) heading """"Heeeeelp"""".  

And then he also (bizarrely?) asks Gregalton help him delete references to Mises.org like he did here, saying to Gregalton: """"Also, in case you're interested, one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to Mises.org""""

As if a reference to the great Ludwig von Mises amounted to VANDALISM? Can you BELIEVE IT?  I have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this.  The guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll.  

He also says to his co-conspirator the following, on the same page: 

""""I looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. It made me realize that we're going around in circles. We improve the articles to the point that they look great. Then they get screwed up again. So, I had an idea: Would you be interested in helping me write an essay on """"Monetary Crankery""""? It could help people who AREN'T educated...The idea is for it to be straightforward, with references, but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.""""

Clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or """"satirizing"""" any positions on monetary theory that don't agree with his.  (The guy is mad.  If the guy had napalm or nukes he'd use them without hesitation.)   

Then, for good measure, he goes back to debt-based monetary system to do more """"editing"""".  

Zenwhat is clearly a piece of work.  Check out the dude's talk page.  In addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with Mises.org, his main interests appear to be something called """"cannabis culture"""" and """"the Buddhist connection with marijuana"""".  So, I gather from this that his main """"interests"""" are monetary theory and dope smoking.  What a combo!

Seeing this, I ponder my options.  I decide to post a note here, ON MY OWN TALK PAGE, asking readers to compare older (better?) versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions.  For good measure I offer my predictions on the financial markets for 2008 as a gift to the (eight?) people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page.  

It immediately gets deleted by all-seeing, all-knowing Coren as """"soapboxing"""".  Is this strict compliance with WP guidelines or a WP-style Fascist Dictatorship where people like Coren delete at will, but don't bother to make CONSTRUCTIVE suggestions as to how what I have written CAN come within the guidelines?    

This is like watching evolution in reverse.  I carefully construct a page with the help of others.  It gets vandalized by those WITH A CLEAR AND OBVIOUS objective to delete or satirize all references to Ludwig von Mises or the Austrian School (who knows what motivates these sickos?).

 Time Magazine Article

If you read the article it states that  """"A half-dozen schools, besides Notre Dame, are outstanding,"""" the half dozen are Georgetown, Holy Cross Fordham, St. Loius, Boston College, and Catholic University.  They listed other schools as """"A number of other Catholic schools fall into the mass-production or good-small categories""""  This is where St. John's was listed.  I will correct the statement """"Time also considered St. John's as one of the best Catholic universities in the nation"""" since the statement is incorrect.  24.239.153.58  
I read the article very carefully before adding the information.

That is using Original Research.  You're implying what the article is saying.  It doesn't say that at all.  I don't even believe it is implying that.

While diglossia as a field of research or even the concept might have flowered long past Caldwell, its quite inconceivable that Caldwell would have been unaware of this diglossia.  Infact, in speaking about the difficulty that the untrained or sometimes even the trained Tamil(and I certainly and strongly feel that he is talking about people who have received their training in Tamil Nadu.  I dont think he would have based his views or book on somebody who learnt or spoke Tamil in say, Germany or France in the mid 19th century) faces, Caldwell is speaking about nothing but diglossia, maybe without putting it down in as many words.

Be that as it may, what studies in diglossia in Tamil over the last several decades would have done is merely deal with the 'problem' in greater detail and throw light on such things as the causes for diglossia, 'evolution', perpetuation etc., of this phenomenon over the centuries and other things of academic interest like that.

What I am trying to say is, while scientific interest and research into diglossia might be a development of the last few decades, 'diglossia'(in tamil) existed nonetheless, even before that.  And like I said, Caldwell has only touched upon it though not gone deeper into it to research the more intricate details of it.

Notwithstanding that, the fact remains that the ordinary Tamil, especially one without formal(or informal) training, is often at a loss to understand Classical tamil enough to fully appreciate its beauty.

so, imo, the lines that are already there should be retained as it is.  But, you should also(before those lines, preferably) make a mention of the diglossia that exists in Tamil, the different levels, the continuum etc., and then conclude that... """"....as a result of the said diglossia, the ordinary Tamil, sometimes even with formal training, is at a loss to understand the language of classical literature(or the other diglossic levels)""""

And, to answer Sundar's question as to whether (I feel) this is limited to just Tamil or is also a feature of other languages -

While I dont a 'professional grade' knowledge of any language, I've had formal schooling in both Kannada and Hindi.  And I've observed this feature in both languages, much more so in Kannada.  In Kannada, in fact, if you were to study the 'Mankutimmana Kagga'(written sometime in the 60s or 70s i guess) by D V Gundappa, the language used is somewhat in haLegannaDa style, though I would say, it doesnt 'sound' as haLe(old) as haLegannada.  I am able to understand this work for the most part except in some places where it gets a little too much for me and I might have to refer to the dictionary.

Any literature, regardless of when it was written, but written in pure haLegannada style, I would say, wouldnt make much sense to the untrained eye or ear.  

With Hindi, probably because the language is much younger than Kannada or Tamil, though I've observed a sort of diglossia, say in the language that Kabir employs, verses that of Munshi or someone,  Kabir is far more discernable to me than say the Kavirajamarga would be to me or probably Kural to you.

In general, I feel some degree of diglossia almost always exists in most languages(atleast Indian languages) in that, the lingo employed by news readers, say,(atleast in the good old 'Doordarshan only' days), is removed from the one you would hear on the street.  Talking of newsreaders and the lingo on street, I just remembered an interesting thing about the Kannada spoken by the people of South Kanara.  It is almost exactly like the one employed in the news or in formal documents, in that, they speak much the same way they and the rest of Karnataka would write.  I am not sure if there's a parallel to this in Tamil or any other language that I have any knowledge of.

IIIspirit, I was not vandalizing your criminal site, I was contributing information within the intent and purpose of the article; informing the public about the new versions based on experience of installing computer programs, uninstalling computer programs, demonstrating programs, and giving instructions on use and maintenance of programs on many people's computers for well over a year, besides personal experience, especially in the recent times involving Mozilla Firefox version 7.0. Also, information given to me by the people whose computer I worked on in the past, who had upgraded to the 7.0 version, they stated the same flaws that I faced.  You were only giving half the information, and I the other half that you are trying to hide from the public to defraud them (this is based on your deleting this vital information that contributed to, and completed the article within the intent and purpose of the article). You were giving only the so called good qualities of the newer versions, but not the serious time consuming flaws (see below that which was listed in your article that you failed to mention, and do not want known).  

If one is working on the internet, on the old Mozilla versions there is tabs on the toolbar of the internet sites you are working on. If you should quit the internet a window appears asking if you want to cancel this action, quit, or quit and save tabs. By saving tabs, any time in the future when you pull up the internet there is the tabs, and you can take up where you left off. On the newer version of 7.0, this action is not available. You lose your work, and have to start all over again from the beginning. This is a severe cost of time. On the old versions, by the search window (http://) is three arrows, one pointing to the left, one to the right, and one pointing down. This last one allows one to see recent sites visited, and one can choose one by looking at the list that is presented. This is time saving. However, on 7.0 version this button is deleted, thus costing one time. Also, 7.0 version is not compatible with Youtube download toolbar, and will disable it. Also, when you upgrade,you will lose any history you have. The important information contained in the history list will be lost forever. 

These flaws not only should be listed giving a complete informing article that informs and stays within the intent and purpose of the article, but, as all ready stated completes the article. 
It would be like stating that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and that's all. My addition would be like giving the underlying causes that led to this act. This portion you would strive with your upmost efforts to hide and keep from the public.
When a person only tells half the story then it is a lie, and if one does this with the intent deceiving the general public into taking a seriously flawed piece of trash, then it becomes fraud. With marketable product such fraud is a criminal act. I strongly feel that such criminals as yourself should be removed from our society by the courts to prevent your harming the innocent public.",0

It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: """"Do no harm."""" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.

 Interaction Ban... not working 

I'm not waiting 8 hours, sorry. I don't know if that even applies to everyone or just to the editors under the ban, but I don't really care to be honest... this is out of hand. It's absolutely ridiculous what I-P is turning into on Wikipedia and it is largely a result of this interaction ban which is broken on a nearly daily basis. It is pitting the two """"sides"""" against each other and it has gotten worse than I have ever seen it. The interaction ban is not working; therefore, I hope that you will do something else that can help this situation before it completely falls apart. Here are the newest violations of the interaction ban:
I know you are already aware of the post that was made at AN/I. It had a direct mention of Mbz1 by Factomancer through diffs. It was not a complaint about an interaction ban violation on Mbz1's part, so there was no reason for Factomancer to be mentioning Mbz1. You responded at that AN/I and didn't do anything about it, so I guess you didn't consider it a violation for some reason. Maybe because she attempted to strike out and delete the request after the fact? Although personally that makes it worse in my eyes, but clearly I'm not the admin. 
Anyway, past AN/I, she put the same violation on her user page here . It is also a clear violation of WP:UP#POLEMIC. Soon after, she also removed this information, replacing the content with this  stating that she is going on a long break. She has done this before when she has gotten herself into big trouble, only to change her mind after a couple of days and come back. As we can see, her temporary break in that case didn't change her behaviour, as here we are once again.
I'm truly tired of dealing with this crap. Last year we actually had some sort of collaboration going on in I-P on Wikipedia, before we had to deal with issues like this (to this severity, at least). A combination of a few """"new"""" users coming into the I-P struggle relatively recently have turned it into a real warzone between the two sides, and I don't like it. I don't think other people like it either. It is having an EXTREMELY detrimental effect on the encyclopedia in the I-P area, because not only is so much of our time wasted fighting and defending each other in constant AE and AN/I reports, or sitting out short bans for minor infractions, but even aside from that, it just isn't rewarding or feasible to try to contribute and collaborate anymore. There is no longer an expectation that posting something constructive on a talk page will lead to discussion from people who disagree. There is no point of making significant edits to articles because they are simply followed up by quick reverts, often with no edit summary.
I was planning on coming up with some conclusion to this complaint to convince you to take action, but you know what, typically as of late I've even lost my motivation to do that. I just don't care; it's a waste of time and probably won't get the atmosphere between editors back to what it used to be anyway. The problem is that all you can do (or are willing to do anyway) is impose bans based strictly upon the word of the rules interpreted specifically based on the individual situation. If you took a minute to look at the big picture and understand the impact that certain users are having on the entire I-P editing community with their constant infractions and battles, maybe you would think of a different solution.

"""

Your talent at invoking """"personal attack"""" seems to exceed your talent at replying intelligently to any of my points.

If you can't take the heat, you shouldn't be editing an encyclopedia.  It's pretty clear that Wikipedia's """"personal attack"""" policy is simply a ploy to ban people with whom the administrators disagree, and prevent them from making contributions to Wikipedia, while at the same time preserving the illusion of some level playing field for intellectual discourse.  

To illustrate this point, we need look no further than the items removed by Jimbo from the Justin Berry talk page, citing """"personal attack"""", which included every mention of the term """"camwhore,"""" which is itself a Wikipedia topic, and the following paragraph.  Please feel free to try and figure out who is the victim of the """"personal attack"""" here.

""""I'm dissapointed that the majority of this page was deleted, most likely because one of the editors is a self-admitted pedophile. Is it fair to declare that a pedophile can't be neutral on a page that involves pedophilia?. I guarantee that wikipedia wouldn't ban a Jew from editing a page on the holocaust, or ban a black person from editing a page on affirmative action. A pedophile is just as capable of editing with a neutral POV on a subject matter dealing with pedophilia, as a Jew or a black would be on an issue that involves Jews or blacks. Wikipedia claims to be a online encyclopedia that anyone can edit. If that doesn't include pedophiles, than how is that fair?. If we allow certain sexual minorities to be silenced, what's next?, allowing certain racial minorities to be silenced as well. As a frequent reader and occasional editor of wikipedia, I only want to read factual, neutral POV articles, and I don't care about the race, nationality, ethnicity, sex, or sexual orientation of the editor. Even if most people have moral objections to pedophilia, surely we can agree that we all have a right to post on wikipedia as long as we abide by the rules.""""  TAB

 TIBIN VARGHESE (CREATED BY) Hypertension  

Hypertension
 
Hypertension is a disorder characterized by consistently high blood pressure. Generally, high blood pressure consists of systolic blood pressure (the """"top"""" number, which represents the pressure generated when the heart beats) higher than 140, or diastolic blood pressure (the """"bottom"""" number, which represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart is at rest) over 90.

Effect on the Eyes
High blood pressure can injure the eyes, causing a condition called retinopathy
Hypertensive retinopathy
 
Damage to the retina from high blood pressure is called hypertensive retinopathy. It occurs as the existing high blood pressure changes the microvasculature of the retina. Some of the first findings in the disease are flame hemorrhages and cotton wool spots. As hypertensive retinopathy progresses, hard exudates can appear around the macula along with swelling of the macula and the optic nerve, causing impairment of vision. In severe cases permanent damage to the optic nerve or macula can occur.
Bone Loss
Hypertension also increases the elimination of calcium in urine, potentially leading to loss of bone mineral density, a significant risk factor for fractures, particularly in elderly women. In one study, women with the highest levels of blood pressure lost bone density at nearly twice the rate of those in the lowest range. It is not clear whether this effect occurs in men or in non-Caucasian women.

Sexual Dysfunction
Sexual dysfunction is more common and more severe in men with hypertension and in smokers than it is in the general population. Many of the drugs that treat hypertension are thought to cause impotence as a side effect. In these cases, it is reversible when the drugs are stopped. More recent evidence suggests, however, that the disease process that causes hypertension is itself the major cause of erectile dysfunction in these men. Newer anti-hypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), are less associated with erectile dysfunction. ARBs, such as losartan (Cozaar), may be particularly effective in restoring erectile function in men with high blood pressure. Sildenafil (Viagra) is successful in achieving erections in almost two-thirds of patients with controlled high blood pressure. Because sildenafil has a shorter half-life and is eliminated more quickly from the body than newer erectile dysfunction drugs, it may be a safer option for men with hypertension. In a 2003 review of safety data, sildenafil did not appear to pose a risk for men who had both high blood pressure and erectile dysfunction.
Pregnancy and Preeclampsia
Severe, sudden high blood pressure in pregnant women is one component of a condition called preeclampsia (commonly called toxemia) that can be very serious for both mother and child. Preeclampsia occurs in up to 10% of all pregnancies, usually in the third trimester of a first pregnancy, and resolves immediately after delivery. Other symptoms and signs of preeclampsia include protein in the urine, severe headaches, and swollen ankles.
This condition may be caused by a failure of the placenta to embed properly in the uterus, which causes it to misconnect with the mother's blood vessels. As a result, the fetus does not receive a sufficient blood supply, and the mother's own blood pressure increases to replace it.

The reduced supply of blood to the placenta can cause low birth weight and eye or brain damage in the fetus. Severe cases of preeclampsia can cause kidney damage, convulsion, and coma in the mother and can be lethal to both mother and child.
Women at risk for preeclampsia (particularly those with existing hypertension) may benefit from having an ultrasound of uterine arteries at 20 to 24 weeks of pregnancy, followed (if abnormal) by 24-hour blood pressure monitoring.
Uterine Fibroids
High blood pressure may increase the risk of developing fibroids, according to data from the Nurses’ Health Study. Tracking women for 10 years, the prospective epidemiologic study found that for every 10 mm/Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure, the risk for developing fibroids increased by 8 - 10%.

Outlook for Children with Hypertension
Children with high blood pressure should first be treated with lifestyle changes, including weight reduction, increased physical activity, and diet modification. If blood pressure is not controlled with lifestyle changes, drug treatment may be required. Although there are few clinical trials conducted in children, a 2005 study found that the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan was safe and effective in children. Results of studies evaluating outcomes of children with hypertension suggest that early abnormalities, including enlarged heart and abnor",0

Another thing to look for is that if the article has been nominated more than once, go back to the previous reviews and make sure suggestions from the other reviews have been addressed.

If the article has any of the above problems, it may be premature to provide a detailed review, in which case you can """"quickfail"""" the nomination in accordance with step two of the GAN guidelines, as long as you explain this clearly on the review page. They most commonly apply when the nominator is inexperienced or is not a regular editor of the article. If you """"quick-fail"""" an article according to the above criteria, leave a short note explaining the major problems and inform the nominator.

Even if an article can be """"quick-failed"""" according to the above criteria, reviewers could also: 

 Leave a short note explaining the major problems, but without officially closing the review until the editors at the article have had a few days to respond to your concerns.  You may find that they are interested in significantly improving the article.
 Provide a detailed review, as more specific information will help future editors improve the article to meet all of the Good article criteria, but close the review as """"not listed"""".
 Withdraw from the review, and let another reviewer decide how to handle it.

Emphasis added by me. So please remember to always actually/carefully read any policies/guidelines before using them (and to not ask other users for opinions, because they might be completely misguided - just always find and read them yourself), like that (source).   """,0

That quote discusses what happens to the penis after circumcision, which is not what the article is about. The sentence may use the word """"foreskin"""" but it is clearly a quote that is directly related to circumcision, rather than the foreskin, thus it is off-topic, and does not belong in the article. The only part of the sentence directly related to the foreskin is """"nerve endings in the foreskin,"""" and that section by itself doesn't add much to the article.

Allowing material that discusses what happens to the penis after the foreskin is removed would allow the entire Sexual effects of circumcision and Medical analysis of circumcision articles to be copied to Foreskin. When taken to this extreme, it's quite evident that discussing what happens to the penis when the foreskin is removed is beyond the scope of this article. If readers wish to learn about what happens to the penis when the foreskin is removed, there are plenty of circumcision-related pages that are directly related to that topic on wikipedia, and we already link to them from the Foreskin article.

It appears that the article is being used as a soapbox for discussing circumcision because of the number of sentences devoted to circumcision in the article. If it was just one or two sentences, I would not have a basis for making this accusation, but as we can see from this diff (your revert conveniently shows all three of my edits, so I'm using that rather than listing them individually), the amount of off-topic text devoted to circumcision is substantial.

By the way, since we're discussing content again, I'm happy to go back to the Foreskin talk page, so that other editors can participate in the conversation. Thanks for continuing our discussion, I think we're getting somewhere again. However, I also note that you have now been reverted by two other editors, indicating a lack of consensus for including the material in question, so I'm not sure if further discussion is necessary, but I'm happy to continue the discussion if you wish.

 re: Israel HaShlema 

Hello,
I did not remove your addition of phrase Hebrew phrase """"Israel HaShlema"""", I merely added back-in the link to the Wikipedia Greater Israel article. That phrase is English, and this is the English edition of Wikipedia. 

Coverage on Wikipedia should not make a subject appear more notable than it actually is. The phrase Greater Israel returns 607,000 pages on Google, and about 16,500 references in Google Books. Eretz Israel Hashlema only returns 361 web pages and 84 references in Google Books.

First of all, I was only pointing out that your use of the term soldier was incorrect, and that it can lead to a general acceptance of the SS as legitmate soldiers, an already dangerously common view.  I was not """"jumping all over you"""" by providing a technical insight which is significant.  And additionally, I never in any way called all rapes supposed crimes; I simply pointed out that German women who viewed themselves as liberated from Nazism or war lived under a regime which would have deported them to concentration camps for having any sexual involvement with anyone considered untermenchlich, could have decided to reward or celebrate with the liberators and then obviously for their own protection claimed that they were raped when Nazis came asking about it.  Additionally, they could have been Nazis, or related to Nazis, and would not have been able to confess Russophilia. Do you realize that I am a racially German girl living in the United States?  The level of emotion in your personal attack demonstrates a level of fanatism that is very strange.  I also never addressed and therefore never condemned you suggestion that women should have a voice.  If that is something that you want, than it is on you to persue it; we are busy with our own research and cannot do yours for you.  However, I will warn you that you should be very cautious about believing anything written by German women, as they may likely be Nazis, and will have a very biased approach to recording the mass rape by the Russians, and would likely outright exaggerate it; many Nazi women openly admit to Western historians that they greatly exaggerated the rape of the Red Army for pro Nazi and anti Communist causes for Gobbels.

 Maba Diakhou Bâ 

I first came across the Maba Diakhou Bâ article when I was looking for articles relating to Senegambia.  Having read the view history section of the article, it was evident that it has been on display for quite a few years now.

The purpose of starting this discussion is to disagree with several aspects of the historical account being presented in the Maba Diakhou Bâ article, based on reliable secondary sources as stated in the notablity policy.  Although I have primary documents about the man Maba Diakhou Bâ, I will stick to secondary sources in line with Wiki's policy.  Before I start to put forward my counter argument, I think a brief history is necessary for those who are not well familiar with the subject.  

Maba was a Senegambian jihadist in the 19th century who spent years launching wars against non-Muslim Kingdoms in order to convert them to Islam.  As it will become clearer , you will find out that converting people to Islam was not his only objective for launching jihad.  In any case, he was partly responsible for the mass conversion of the Senegambian people particularly the Wolof people and other tribes in the 19th century.  This is very significant, because Senegambia which encompasses Senegal and The Gambia are predominantly Muslim countries.  The Muslim population are the descendants of those converted in masses in the 19th century many of whom by Maba Diakhou Bâ.  Islam being very strong in both Senegal and The Gambia especially with the advent of the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, Maba Diakhou Bâ is given a saint like figure in both Senegal and The Gambia.  As such, no one dares to comment on the atrocities of Maba, his back handed dealings with the French and British administration during the colonial era, his enslavement of people whom he viewed as non-Muslims, his pillaging of lands etc.  Instead, the Muslim majority of Senegambia led by the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal have fabricated his historical account and pass it off as facts that some historians have fallen for, but of course there are others who will not be duped and have examined the true facts and written it accordingly.  It is very important to point out here that, not all ordinary Senegambian Muslims feel this way.  Many of them try to go about their daily lives with little thought for these kind of things.  There are of course others who take the words of their religious leaders as scripture that is infallible even if ample evidence is presented to them.  In most cases, when I talk about the Senegambian Muslim masses, I am referring to the Senegambian Muslim establishment, who mingle in politics, control what historical or religious programmes are presented in the media etc.  These are the ones who control information and whose desire to is release the type of information they want others to know and believe.   Having said all that, I now address each of the inaccurate accounts presented in Maba's article.  

Maba was killed on the 18th July 1867 at the Battle of Fandane Thiouthiogne commonly known in Senegambian history as
The Battle of Somb. He was killed by the Serer people led by their King Buur Sine Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof when he thought he could go and launch his jihad against the Serer people as he had done with other non-Muslim tribes and kingdoms.  (Sources: Histoire du Sine-Saloum  by Alioune Sarr, and Essai sur l’histoire du Saloum et du rip by Abdou Bouri Bâ)

The article did not give us the exact date he died and in the """"Death and legacy"""" heading, made a transitional error as to the year he died by putting """"1876"""" instead of """"1867"""". I will also address that section of the article later especially in relation to the first paragraph

In the first paragraph of this article, it says and I quote """"He became leader Almamy in Saloum"""" and under the """"Resistance and Conquest"""" heading,  (in other words resisting French colonialism as noted in the first paragraph of that heading) it states and I quote 
""""While he eventually succeeded in overtaking the dynasty of Saloum, his movement never succeeded in Sine, (Kingdom of Sine) and much of Serer territory remained animist or Christian into the 20th century.""""

First of all, Maba was nothing more than an Almamy in rebellion.  He was not a King with all the powers of a King and him overthrowing the Serer Dynasty of Saloum has not been accurately narrated in this article which I will delve in later.  Note also that in the last paragraph of the first heading, the article talks about how Maba founded Nioro du Rip, but it did not tell us in any part of the article how he founded it, just like in the whole article, important pieces of information has been",0

Oh and how can I post images on my userpage?  

Thank you about that.  

 Why did you revert all 11/27 edits to scouting in oregon? 

Who died an made you the the lord?

All edits were based on information provided by authorative sources.  Your revert was based on your understanding of your opinion and therefore makes Wikipedia a useless effort.

Links to the authorative websites for the councils is appropriate. See Crater Lake link is allowed but Oregon Pacific, Cascade Pacific, Blue Mountain, etc are not?  Oregon Council links are not allowed but California is?

Information by district corrections were removed? . . the correct information was updated from the authorive websites of the Councils.  Do you not check the information before you delete or correct?

Again, the worth of a wiki is it's accuracy. . . by external validated resources. Each link was provided for your review.  Take some time, get off the Code REd and, spend sometime reviewing the information.—The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) .

"""The team was formed in 1977 by three ex-army motor cycle display team riders; Tony, Robin and Alan. Within a few weeks the team started building ramps and preparing motor cycles at Tony's workshop in Catford, S.E London.

New riders were trained for the first show which was at Mallory Park Race Track in Leicestershire. Early in 1978 preparations with George and Elstree Airport (North London) were made for Robin """"Smudger"""" Winter-Smith, to do a jump involving 31 Ford Escort vans. This along with a """"full team"""" stunt display took place on May 14th 1978. The jump was carried out successfully. Later that the team appeared on the ITV network's Saturday Banana Show, hosted by Bill Oddie, in which they performed stunts live on TV.

The team were then called upon to train Michael Crawford for an episode of his TV series """"Some Mothers' Do 'Ave 'Em."""" This episode was titled """"The Dispatch Ride,"""" Tony taught Michael some motor cycle tricks, in which Michael Performed very successfully. Tony also acted as a stunt coordinator while filming the show in 1978.

In 1980 team members worked on a film """"Silver Dream Racer."""" The star of this film was David Essex who was a very well known pop-star of this time. This year also saw two new members; John """"Golly"""" Goddard and Frank Welch, who were both training to jump with cars. 

In January 1982 the team along with """"Tina Roberts' Auto Angels"""" worked together, for """" Not The Nine O'Clock News """" which was a BBC TV programme. Both teams had a tremendous amount of fun whilst filming for the show. Tina now known as """"Firebird International"""" now travels and includes Pythons and singing with a band in her act. 
In May 1982 the team were performing in Brockley (South London). This was where John """"Golly"""" Goddard performed his first spectacular jump. He made a jump over 118 people laid down side by side. Later in the year on July 18th 1982 at the Chester Racecourse, John """"Golly"""" Goddard jumped successfully over 16 double decker buses , clearing a distance of 132ft. 

During the winter of 1982/3, Tony was busy working on a Kawasaki Z900 for a world record for """" 22 men on one motor cycle """". Once the bike was prepared the team and many friends went for the first practice. before the attempt was carried out many modifications were made. Once ready the team performed the event at the Santa Pod Raceway in Bedfordshire. The attempt was successful and placed the team into the Guinness Book of World Records. 
John """"Golly"""" Goddard was also preparing his next big jump, this time over 15 trucks. This successful jump took place on June 12th 1983 at Trentham Gardens, Staffordshire. 

The team took part in the """"Game For A Laugh"""" show hosted by Jeremy Beedle (amongst others) where the team's stunts were shown. John """"Golly"""" Goddard also successfully rode through 25 Walls of Fire for this programme. 

In 1989 Tony met Nikki, Nikki and her son James (9 at the time), they both became actively involved with the team, Nikki acting as a commentator and James began riding motor cycles and learning tricks on his PW 80. Lizzette Daniel and Sue Rees were female members of the team. 

In 1990 the team gained 2 World records. Chris """"Spin"""" Simpson set a new World record for 25 walls of fire; also Lee French jumped over 300 shopping trolleys at the Sussex County Showground, Ardingly, setting another new world record. 

Team members """" Vertical Vince """" and Chris Simpson started forming slow wheelies, Vertical Vince is probably the country's top rider performing wheelies. 

From 1992 Tony started to prepare a Suzuki Jeep for 2 wheel driving. After practicing for several weeks it was ready to perform in early 1993. Also 6 other Suzuki Jeeps were prepared for the team, for formation driving. This made the team unique as it was the only team performing this type of show. The next Jeep to be built was the """" Wheelie Jeep """" in 1995. In 1996 the """" Endo Jeep """" was built and this was driven by Tony for a challenge in the ITV programme """" You Bet"""". 

In 1998 Tony received a call from an agent with an unusual request for a motor cycle rider to promote a film by 20th Century Fox called """"Waking Ned"""". What made the request unusual was that they required a rider to to ride around Oxford Street, Trafalgar Square and Soho promoting the film,wearing nothing but a crash helmet and underpants . This was rather a chilly experience on a mid-September morning and this also received some very strange looks from people. 

Now the team performs 25-30 shows per year up and down the country. Tony and the team are busy with new ideas for the show. Brandon Bailey (Tony's son) just 9 years old already drives a Suzuki Jeep in the show, along with tricks on a motor cycle and a quad.

Excerpt from the book by Grateful Dead Bass Player Phil Lesh:

The unique organicity of our music reflects the fact that each of us consciously personalized his playing: to fit with what others were playing and to fit with who each man was as an individual, allowing us to meld our consciousnesses together in the unity of a group mind.

For us, the philosophical basis of this concept was articulated by the science-fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon in his novel More Than Human, wherein the protagonists each have a single paranormal talent – telepathy, psychokinesis, teleportation – and are joined by a quadruple paraplegic who acts as a central processing unit. The process by which they become one is called bleshing, from a combination of mesh and blend. (Today’s archetype would be the X-Men.)

Discussing The Existence of “repulsion particle” And Its Significance              
Zhuang Yiliong
Shanghai Institute of Science and Technology Management

Abstract:This report has advanced a assume about the existence of  “repellention” by a kind of new idea. Beginning with this, I have explained more successfully some import theory questions in the area of the present physics, cosmology and philosophy ect. At same time a few of new reasons have been raised But this is only rough idea of physical philosophy. many key details need to be answered by the improving science in the future.
Key words: repulsion particle, the velocity of light, red shift, cosmos background.
  
　　　While the researched object of physics are increasingly getting its limit observed through the instrument, the function in the research of academic ideas are more important. In this article, only assumes the existence of a new particle, so it seems possible for many difficulty of physics and cosmology to be resulted. Maybe the key to unlock the door of advancing access of physics lies not in the building of physics, but in the palace of philosophy.

One、Grounds of advancing the existence of  “repulsion particle” 

Philosophic puzzles: gravity and repulsion, this is a pair of antiquated contradiction, theory of physics is a philosophic  lame. Angels said that the true theory  of matter should give the equal status to gravity and repulsion, the theory of matter only based on gravity is wrong, insufficiency and unilateral. Newton needed to find the first driving force for his physics, or else the world can’t act .
There is contradiction between Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Einstein’s mass-velocity expression. In the law universal gravitation, the magnitude of gravitation is direct proportional to mass of the matter, the bigger the mass is, the stronger the gravity is; while in the mass-velocity expression, with the speed of the matter increasing, the mass will add. If the “mass” of the two law is the same, then the speed of matter will increase, and the gravity will be stronger, the matter will be drawn too tighten to move by the gravity. But in fact, it’s just opposition, the shotted cannonball is incline to break loose the gravitation, provided that the speed is high enough, it is able to fly off the orbit of the earth, even the solar system. This shows that the mass of adding with the speed increasing is different with that works on the gravitation, because it manifest obviously a kind of repulsion confronting the gravitation.  So that, the two characteristics (speed increases, gravitation reduces; speed reduces, gravitation increases.) out while the state of moving matter changes .it is right to reflect the invert process between gravity and repulsion inside the moving matter , and indicate the existence of difference idiocratic mass.
Newton believed: falling of an apple is because of the function of gravitation, then, we can question in the opposition, how can the apple get to the top of the tree? If we block out all of the complicated growing process of all tree with black-box theory, and only consider the beginning and the ending state, then, in the opinion of physics, there must be a kind of universal repulsion fighting back the gravitation working on the apple and pushing it to the high place. Therefor, the universal repulsion should exist everywhere, as well as the universal gravitation.
What is the essence of “force”? This question has been disputing for hundreds of years, and it’s still not clear today. Newton said that it is the measurement of the acceleration of moving matter. But this only describes the force, not explains the essential mechanism. So, in Newton mechanics, the mass of  the moving matter is unchangeable. Einstein brought out the character that the mass of matter is changed with the speed. He thought the activity of matter is result from getting energy, while energy can agglomerate matter, and this character of this matter is the same as the original matter, so can be added, resulting that the mass of matter may trend to infinite with the speed increasing. If we can import a kind of repulsion to explain it, and give the energy a carrier of practicality, then, the relation of movement and the “force” will be more clear.
The radiant energy is always multiple of some elementary unit, what on earth is the physical meaning of Plank quantum constants? If it can be seen as a material particle, and indicate the existence of repulsion particle? Ray radiation has the two character of wave and particle itself. As to E=h*v, Plank regarded the radiant energy as constant h multiply frequency v from the site of wave theory; if, from the point of particle theory,  we can regard it as the h combination of v quantu",0

 Blossomland 

Any good references to use for the """"Blossomland"""" name? I thought that the one I provided (http://www.hartfordmichigan.com/hartfordhistory/Precious%20Pearls/Blossom%20Song.htm) didn't use synthesis - selected quotes:

""""That the Michigan Blossom Week song, extolling the beauties of blossom land, which was broadcasted from three Chicago radio stations and from Berrien Springs and was sung at the blossom pageant at Benton Harbor last week, was written by a Hartford woman was not known to many local people who 'listened in.'"""" (Hartford is in Van Buren County, listed as in Michiana; Benton Harbor and Berrien Springs are in Berrien, also listed)

""""Music for the song was written by Mrs. Nate Simpson of Keeler"""" (also in Van Buren County)

[lyrics] """"Oh! it's blossom time in Michigan...I can feel the lake breeze blowing"""" Lake Michigan is not specified, but it's the only logical lake in this context - lake breezes/microclimate is only a characteristic of the largest bodies of water, and the largest in the area is Lake Michigan.

I'm not sure if I can find another source with as much detail (I was hoping that there'd be something in the history section of the Blossomtime Festival website, but no mention), but the term definitely has been perpetuated in the area and is part of its identity (note Google search), so it seems notable.

Don't take this personal!  The life of James has everything to do with a new and unstable, sometimes tyrannical government in power.  It has little veracity with regards to sexual conspiracies, unless one follows the king's involvement in aid to """"favourite"""" Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset in trying to take another man's wife by murdering her legal husband.

Alright, we've witnessed an administrative demonstration of power as with the """"protection"""" of the article; thanks Bundy, for your kind warning. Can we now constructively return to the matter in hand? After all, it is the task of all of us Wikipedians to see to it that articles contained in this Free Encyclopedia adhere to encyclopedical standards and not those of the yellow press, isn't it? 'Free' should not stand for 'free of correct facts', 'free of truth(fulness)' or for that matter 'free of ethical restraints'. One would think we all, at least those of good will among us, agree on that. Now it happens to be the case, if not by willful disruptive tendentious editing then by negligence, that in its current state the article Francesco Carotta is full of errors of all sorts and easily verifiably so, some of which were mentioned in the previous, now """"deleted"""" comment. Especially the section on the """"Dutch media controversy"""" is a complete distortion of the real events, for instance, the review of Peter Veldhuisen was not related at all to the activities and pronouncements of van Hooff. This section needs a thorough revision, or maybe the best thing to do would be to just delete it, since it does not provide any information on the theory and might be of interest only to the yellow press. Furthermore, we the Populares, the People's Front of Rome so to speak, hope that it is not considered a personal attack if we dare to ask the reputable user Rubenstein what exactly he thinks it is that qualifies him to act as the expert for and supervisor over this particular article. If User:Slrubenstein does not deem us worthy of an answer, as has been the case a few times on this page, maybe other editors or just readers could try to help us understand. In any case, we fail to see why Slrubenstein's arbitrary words and deeds should carry any special weight for the decent normal Wikipedians. We also don't understand why there seems to be so little opposition to what appears to be his self-arrogated authority.
So in closing we ask an unbiased and honest administrator—there certainly must be one around here—to remove the editing protection from the article so that some much needed reasonable work can be done by knowledgeable and sincere editors. In order to prevent tedious unfruitful edit wars we suggest to discuss changes to the article on this talk page first. —   """,0

 Hi Busymom101; you can ask any questions about Wikipedia here on my talk, and even if I'm not around, someone will probably answer.  (Questions related to article content can be put on the talk page of the article; if no one sees them or answers, you might put a note here and someone will look in.)  Did your professor give you any of the Wikipedia handouts that explain editing to students?  There are many.

Here is some other information that might help:
 You can sign your talk page entries (not your article edits) by entering four tildes (  (Talk)  ) after them.
 Please have a look at WP:ASSIGN; it was written as an introduction for students doing course work on Wikipedia and is a good starting place.
 See also WP:BRD and WP:3RR; if you have added text that has been removed by another editor, you shouldn't continue to add it without discussing on the article talk page.
 Wikipedia has sourcing guidelines that apply to medical and health topics at WP:MEDRS; there are good sources available for the articles your class has been working on, so there is no need to use sources that aren't compliant.  If you wonder about reliable sources, you can ask on the article talk page.

To Derild4921 and Sadads: If your main dispute is the sourcing with the original article then why did you not contact me, as I could have provided the additional source material - you can see from my contributions I just author Tunnels books on here. As I said above all the content of the original article is completely accurate and can be verified. I have provided a number of source links to justify that. Should I need more, no problem just advise me. As far as I can see I did broadly meet the Notability standards. This may not be in the GA format that you are looking for, but as Wikipedia content relies on volunteers passionate about their article subject, I feel you should be more supportive. As I confirmed above it was me who asked for the reassessment, only at that stage, a few days ago, did you offer to 'help' improve my article. The new article you created in your Sandbox, then only remains there for 1 day before you either lose the content or publish it - hardly enough time for me to discuss my objections about your new proposal to remove my article. To replace my article when you have not even finished reading Tunnels is ridiculous - surely any author on Wikipedia should at least have read the novel first, not sure how that can meet your verifiable Notability standards! That aside I have already correctly embarrassing errors concerning incorrect publishing dates and versions, wrong character and place names like Stynx and Hightail (not a one off). Others that come to mind include: The official publication date for the US Tunnels was January 2008 - it might have been that copies were available on Amazon earlier than that date, but that often happens in the UK and US. Nearly all territories have gone on to publish Deeper, and only a handful haven't yet published Freefall (mainly due to their own financial difficulties, and not because the performance of the series hasn't merited it!) - you can check this on the publishers website http://www.doublecluck.com/rights. The authors changed the title with Barry Cunningham - this article makes it sound as though he did it off his own back! There are two versions of the audiobook in the UK (the Davenport one is abridged), and also the American and German unabridged versions. Chester isn't """"about to killed"""" under SETTING - he is sentenced to go into the Interior! The Plot emphasis is all wrong and does not give a true insight into the overall storyline. The Setting and Plot areas you have changed are so badly written - and I am well aware of my own average writing abilities, but in comparison this new version lacks significant maturity. References to the Highfield Mole are confusing. Barry is now Barry Cunningham OBE, and there's no question that he signed JK Rowling for her first two Harry Potter books whilst he was employed by Bloomsbury. I would like my article reinstated and with your expert help and support I would like to improve and expand my sources, and thus improve my own knowledge of Wikipedia article standards. My priority is not, however, achieving GA status at the expense of diminished quality or informative reading. I do have the support of the UK fansite team on this. The authors have often been kind enough to verify and supply content for my article. Following my notification about your changes, they have emailed me their confirmation that they would also like to see the original version restored. I await your response. Thanks (  )""",0

I understand your point. I simply do not believe it to be valid. During the period in question, the RC Church did not have large armies at its disposal.

The RC Church, at this time, were also opposed to this principle (one that has become so widely accepted in 'western' societies that it is often difficult to imagine a time before). Louis, with the tactic support of leading Churchman, ordered acts of anti-Protestant terror. (Let's be completely honest, without the tactic approval of the Church, would a devout Catholic have been committed to such a course of action?) Some leading Churchman celebrated the outcome - a France almost completely 'cleansed' of Protestants.

 Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri 

I would consider your move from Luis Miguel to Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri as a highly controversial renaming of an article. Please do not take offense, but I am positive that you are not familiar with this topic, or Spanish culture in general. Here are my thoughts on this:

 Luis Miguel is a singer of worldwide fame and much more notable than the other four Luis Miguels that you included in that disambiguation list.
 Luis Miguel is much more of a public figure than any other Luis Miguel, since he is a Grammy winner and is often romantically associated with big stars, such as Mariah Carey, Daisy Fuentes, etc.
 Please also note that """"Luis Miguel"""" is his professional name, and that is why he is notable, he is not a scientist or politician or any other profession where a full name is used. 
 Also only one of the other Luis Miguels has an article, therefore people looking for """"Luis Miguel"""" will be taken to that disambig page while almost all of them will be looking for the singer and not anybody else. 
 In addition, none of the other Luis Miguels go by """"Luis Miguel"""" only the singer. 

I will strongly suggest you moved the page back to Luis Miguel and create another Luis Miguel (disambiguation) page.

 This article is about the original application  it is NOT about a domain name 

I have cleaned up various inaccuracies in the starting paragraph and intent to continue.

The starting paragraph cited http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-indie-music-rights-agency-merlin-adds-tracks-to-p2p-network-imesh/ which states """"Lphant is now relaunched as a legal download P2P site but is still is still compatible with file-sharing networks such as BitTorrent"""" in an effort to phish users to download an application which uses the same name and elephant-like logo to the original one, but is neither created by the original author nor does it connect to BitTorrent.

Considering that no information has been published about the acquisition of the lphant application by anyone, the developments on the domain name are irrelevant to the article, aside from any information that will dissociate the original application to discordia's domains. In other words, Discordia's client does not have a place in this article. Neither does lphant.com anymore. As a result, there is no reason to link to lphant.com and especially not to shareaza.com which is attempted by certain users. Any links to shareaza.com especially under the name Shareaza are used to increase the page rank of the fake site on shareaza Google search queries.

Fortunately the original lphant.com site is still on the Internet Archive, so any request for citations about the original application will be satisfied. Since Discordia will probably try to remove the old information from the Internet Archive, it is suggested that as many editors as possible save them for future reference.""",0

"What Britannica says about the early populations of the area 

Macedonia: History – Encyclopaedia Britannica

Macedonia owes its name to the ancient kingdom of Macedonia (or Macedon). Centred in the southern part of the region, (i.e. present-day Northern Greece) this kingdom seems to have been largely Greek-speaking, with Thracian and Illyrian admixtures. By the 4th century bc, it had extended its rule northward into the Balkan Peninsula and throughout the Mediterranean. In the 2nd century bc, Macedonia was made into a Roman province. When the Roman Empire was divided in the 4th century ad into eastern and western halves, Macedonia became part of the eastern half, which became the Byzantine Empire. By this time the population of Macedonia had been largely Christianized. Macedonia’s Greek ethnic composition was overturned by the invasion of Slavic peoples into the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries AD.

Paionia (historical region) – Encyclopaedia Britannica

Paeonia,  the land of the Paeonians, originally including the whole Axius (Vardar) River valley and the surrounding areas, in what is now northern Greece, (Republic of) Macedonia, and western Bulgaria. The Paeonians, who were probably of mixed Thraco-Illyrian origin, were weakened by the Persian invasion (490 bc), and those tribes living along the Strymon River (in western Bulgaria) fell under Thracian control. The growth of Macedonia forced the remaining Paeonians northward, and in 358 bc they were defeated by Philip II of Macedonia. The native dynasty, however, continued to be highly respected: about 289 bc, King Audoleon received Athenian citizenship, and his daughter married Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. Under the Romans, Paeonia was included in the second and third districts of the province of Macedonia. By ad 400, however, the Paeonians had lost their identity, and Paeonia was merely a geographic term

It is incorrect to citing Britannica in this article biased, i.e. only the article about the history of the are, which is today Northern Greece, ignoring the article, which points to the history of today R. of Macedonia (Paionia).",0

Well that is not correct. If you are unwilling to learn the difference between in-universe and out-universe then I think editing articles dealing with fictional characters is not fair on editors who actually bothered to. The problem is the date of death field is part of the personal profile section of the info box. This means it is an in-universe element of the article; referring exclusively to events within the series. If the episode was set on a different date, to that it aired on - then a death featured within that episode would carry the date within the series. Fictional characters do not die from our viewpoint - they will always exist, they do not cease to exist, so we do not use our date. So maybe you need to have a rethink.

Lordkazan, I am currently looking for suitable citations. But still, I feel my original point was intentionally overlooked. You see, recently, I edited a German article concerning a Neonazi brand name (de:Consdaple). In that article, I inserted totally """"biased"""" ridiculing phrases, because I felt that in Germany, it is always better to decidedly distance yourself from Nazism (and because I am rather convinced of my eloquence in German, although I am certainly not as godlike at it as Avi is with English). Now, with the circumcision article, I have a similar dilemma. But my POV here is, although not more biased than with the Nazi topic, not the Public POV. And that's what I meant in the circumcision discussion: My POV is that there is no NPOV besides the instantaneous total rejection of neonatal genital mutilation, be it in Jewish tradition or whatever. And all that pointing to the respective guidelines by Avi or Jakew won't change that. But the article does not even feature the word """"intact"""", which in itself (the word and its rejection by the pro-biased lobby) is sufficient proof to me that they will never cease to bombard common sense. So alright, I'm Sancho Pansa, but do you really believe in playing the game like this? After all, Jakew doesn't have a problem with the Wikipedia guidelines, because his personal bias is similar to the American/community bias on the topic of circumcision.  """,0

My evening with a Drag queen

Rama Rau

I am meeting Enza Supermodel for a TV show. It's 5.45 pm and I wait
at my friend's office on Queen Street in downtown Toronto. After
waiting a while, my friend tells me: ``I don't know if she's gonna
come in her male persona or her female one. ``Ummm hmmm, I reply.
I'm mildly curious about meeting a Drag Queen myself, having thus far
only seen them on the subway or in downtown clubs.

I try recollecting what little I knew about Enza. Her real name: Enzo
Anderson. In 2000, she ran for mayor of Toronto, Ontario. Although
the eventual winner of that campaign, Mel Lastman, won over 80 per
cent of the vote, Anderson surprised many by garnering 15,000 votes,
placing third! She was one of the few candidates (besides Lastman,
Ben Kerr and Tooker Gomberg) to get any kind of recognition in the
race, even though all she did was stand on downtown street corners
with a handmade placard that read: """"Vote for me - I have the best
legs in town.""""

Having changed her name to """"Enza Supermodel"""", Anderson (whose sense
of irony, I learn later, is razor-sharp), runs in political races
where the major candidate has no serious challenger on the ballot.

At 6.15, fashionably late, she walks in, six feet, three inches tall,
in her beautiful black pointy stilettos; she's wearing a short black
dress, showing off great legs, light black stockings and a chic black
leather jacket. And the first thing I think is - Oh. My. God.

She is beautiful. That particular day I'm wearing scruffy blue jeans
cut-off at the knees, running shoes and a T-shirt I grabbed from my
closet two minutes before I ran out the door. Some lipstick, a dash
of mascara and I was ready in seconds. Now, looking at her, I feel
less like a woman than I've ever felt in my entire life. I never was
one of those `la de da' women, mind you, but right now, I wish I was.
I feel insecure, ugly and yes, jealous.

We get into a taxi and Enza graciously lets me sit in the front seat.
I feel a bit awkward. I don't know where to start, so I stare out the
window. I look back politely and smile now and then as Enza talks to
my friend. Suddenly she says, """"Oh, lovely nails!"""" and I jump. Er ah,
my nails? But she is charming about it.

After that, we settle down to some nice comfortable girl talk and I
ask her the question I've been dying to ask. """"How long does it take
you to do your make-up, Enza?"""" and she replies, """"Three hours."""" After
all, she has to do her legs, her arms, her face, her body. She's
happy to give me the most minute (and unnecessary) details of how she
wanted a breast job but decided to just wear padded bras instead.

That evening, the TV show meeting turns out to be a disaster. The
three men in the room (all heterosexuals, they assure each other)
can't take their eyes of Enza's legs. I get a lot of amusement
watching how their eyes slide down her legs and desperately make an
attempt to meet yours if you address them. She is charming and funny.
She tells the crowd how she got her name, """"Ya know, gurrl friend,
what else would I be, but a Supah model?"""" and how she works in a bar
during the day and takes photographs of celebrities by night.

I must admit I'm fascinated. Enza studied to be an engineer and later
began dressing up in drag, partly to party, and partly because that's
her version of Show Biz.

""""Honey, I put on a good show, I got more shoes and dresses than
Imelda Marcos!"""" I believe that.

I go home that evening, feeling a little strange inside my head. It's
the first time I've felt special to be born a woman. And to think I
had to meet a Drag Queen to make me feel this way.

As someone who speaks Aramaic, you should respect this fact, and not appease muslims who want to call everyone arabs just because they're in the middle east.

Such disruption may include (but is not limited to) changing other users' signed comments, making deliberately misleading edits, harassment, excessive personal attacks, and inserting material that may be defamatory.

Sysops may also block new user accounts that make lots of disruptive edits. Reincarnations of blocked disruptive users are likely to be re-blocked, particularly if they edit in a way that suggests they are likely to continue being disruptive.

You *ARE* indeed clueless. Yes, """"Ariana"""" is a different spelling for """"Aryana"""" which does indeed come from the Avestan's """"Aryanem Vaejo"""" (specifically, in Vandidad, Fargasht-e Yekom).  But the """"Aria"""" that you mention above is Greek for what is in Old Persian """"Haraiva"""" which is modern Herat (Hari-Rud).  Looks like you can't even read and understand a simple text in front of you.  The Greek """"Aria"""" has NOTHING TO DO with """"Arianem Vaejo"""".  Not even a single scholar has ever suggested that Arianem Vaejo is the same as """"Haraivo or the Greek """"Aria"""".  The Greek """"Aria"""" for Avestan/Old Persian """"Haraivo"""" is comparable to how in ancient greek text Hagmatana is written """"Ekbatana"""" or many other examples. The Old Persian satapry Hari-Rud (which was not called Hari-Rud in Old Persian) is clearly mentioned in both Darius I's Behistun Inscription as well as two of Xerxes' inscriptions.  """"Arianem Vaejo"""" on the other hand, is mentioned in the Avesta where I told you above, and numerous scholars have published works on the whereabouts of it (including our own late Dr. Bahram Farahvashi who has a full book by that title, called """"Iran Vij"""").  Nobody (other than our great scholar """"Zereshk"""" of course) thinks it is the same as Hari-Rud/Haraivo/greek """"Aria"""".  

As for """"aberoo"""", I honestly feel sad for you, because your beahviour and edits in Wikipedia clearly reveal that you suffer from an inferiority complex and nearly all your edits are about image and not about contents.  It is obvious that you try to present an image instead of contributing to contents.  I suspect this has to do with the fact that you live in USA (according to your user page) and they have probably called you a camel rider or something along those lines, so this has resulted in the sort of pathetic behaviour that we observe from you here.

"Deletion of AV News page 

Just curious why the AV News page is being deleted while its primary competitor Antelope Valley Press is allowed to have its page here unmolested.

Granted we have only been in business for six years but we are every bit as a legitimate news organization as AV Press and even more so than AV Town Crier, whose page is also allowed to be here I note.

Here is the content:

The AV News began as a weekly print newspaper with emphasis on local news located in Lancaster, California USA. It was the second largest circulating newspaper in the area after it began publishing in 2006. In 2008, the AV News added a website and in March 2010, much like the Seatte Post-Intelligencer, the AV News transitioned to a web-only publication. The AV News covers the Antelope Valley area of Los Angeles County - mainly the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including Acton, Agua Dulce, Edwards AFB, Lake Los Angeles, Mojave, Quartz Hill, Rosamond and Santa Clarita. The newspaper is conservative in its political stance. It is currently the official news publication of the Lancaster JetHawks, a minor league baseball team in Lancaster.

History

The AV News was founded by Fran Paolinelli in 2006. She continues to work at the publication today. It began as a weekly print publication before dropping its print version to become a web only publication at www.avnewsday.com

The paper, conservative leaning, holds strongly held views, which can become controversial at times.

Competitors in its market are the Daily News, Antelope Valley Press and the Los Angeles Times.

External links
AV News Official Website

The format is the same as the AV Press. There is less historical info that the AV Press because we have only been going for six years and they've been up for decades. But still, we are getting e-mails from people who use Wiki to find out about the Lancaster/Palmdale area and are surprised to find out that there are more newspapers in the area than what they find listed.

I also point out that the City of Lancaster is a major advertiser with us as is the local professional baseball team.

Please info me as to what more I need to include so that our page will be left on site or restore the page.",0
"""POV fix ==

I removed text that claimed that most liberals claim the posting of the commandments on a government building violated the """"separation of church and state"""" (and the statement that """"separation of church and state is not part of the constitution"""" or whatever it was) and replaced it with """"liberals oppose the posting of the Ten Commandments on public property, arguing that it violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."""" and I wikified the link to the first amendment.

While posting the ten commandments is not literally """"making a law"""" establishing a state religion, it could create a """"slippery slope"""" situation that eventually entangles government in religion to a degree that the establishment clause is more likely to be violated.  It is a rational position to presume that it is safer for the constitution for the government to """"avoid the appearence"""" of impropriety by not posting religious symbols.  I wonder how many Christian or Jewish groups would like to walk past a Ganesh or Buddha statue whenever they go to court?  Probably they wouldn't.  Religious neutrality is a critical element of American civil society, and reflects the reality of pluralistic religious faith.  By acknowledging none, the government is actually honoring all of them and the beliefs of every American as equal.  

It would also violate the Equal Protection clause for the religious beliefs of any citizen, including a belief that the ten commandments were of divine origin, or that the clearly religious commandments must be upheld to avoid angering a god, to be sponsored by the government by posting them as they commonly are on government buildings.

These positions better reflect the normative liberal view of the establishment clause, and I will see if it is possible to work them into the article as a description of these philosophies, without promoting them.  Understanding positions that are contrary to your own can be an important source of personal intellectual growth.

I also explained the conservative/religious view of the posting a bit better, and deleted the reference to the Dershowitz article because 1) it was totally irrelevant (about same sex marriage, not posting the ten commandments), and 2)the editor who referenced it to support his POV argument that liberals only favor a separation of church and state when it suits their purposes either deliberately or accidently misunderstood Dershowitz's point.  Dershowitz was arguing that government should be less entangled in deciding who could get married than it is now, and leave it to the individual religious to decide what marriages are acceptable.  This would promote the separation of church and state, not undermine it.  Because it was both POV, and reflected confused thinking, not to mention totally irrelevant, I simply removed it rather than trying to fix it.

 AndyTheGrump, Is THE REFERENCED AND PUBLISHED Decision of EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECtHR) not a PUBLISHED RELIABLE Source? Notice that I am giving the ECtHR reference DIRECTLY from OFFICIAL ECtHR website. 212.174.38.3   

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

Radnath Sikdar
Dear Mr.Hike,

Thanks for your notice/warning/intimidation! Since, I could sense an emotional outburst in your message, I thought it would be worth spending a few seconds calming you down )

Please be careful in your edits
Oh sure...Iam always careful. I do not send baseless assumptions as warning shots to anyone ) 

Regarding Radhanath Sikdar: I think you need to realize that Wikipedia is a collaborative work - we develop articles by consensus. 
Thanks for your enlightenment. Unfortunately someone already taught me this fact a long time ago when I first ventured into this wikipedia ) Thanks anyway.

Simply reverting edits is counter-productive and against the etiquette of the Wikipedia.
I think this is your POV! There is a 'revert to previous page' button. May be your highness should dismantle it.

Commonly, we iterate until we can find language and fact statements that are acceptable to everyone. Notice that this iteration isn't a """"reversion war"""" - people discuss and change and adapt the article until consensus is reached.
Another POV again ) By the way - could you please enlighten me about who your 'we' refers to in all the above sentences?

Please explain why you are insisting on """"now called"""" in the Sikdar article, or, for that matter, why you are insisting on the mention of the name """"Sagarmatha"""". There may be a legitimate NPOV reason for the inclusion of both - without explanation, I am assuming that it is motivated by Hindu nationalism.

I must appreciate your exceptional ability to assume things. Fortunately, I am not a religious fanatic. But, I do know that provocative sentences like this fuel hatred and anger in the hearts of those groups you mentioned. Again I may be wrong. You know all ) But, I do feel that there is no 'present day sun' or 'present day moon'. That was the only impetus behind my editing it. Besides I also thought that there is nothing wrong in representing a fact (name 'sagarmatha'). Again you know all. 

My assumption very well may be incorrect, but no explanation of your reversion has been given. Convince me.
I confirm that your assumption is not only untrue but is provocative and preposterous. Sometimes even highly intelligent people like you do mistakes )

Note that the original name of Presidency College (in Calcutta, founded in 1817) was """"Hindoo College"""". Not """"Hindu"""" (as in the religion). Please stop reverting. It seems to me that if you insist on using one of the original names of Mount Everest, for consistency you must also use the original name of the college. Convince me otherwise.
As far as I could remember, I have been taught that the right spelling is Hindu, in India. Could you please let me know the difference between Hindoo and Hindu? By the way, could your highness ) please let me know how you assumed that I am an Hindu? I again appreciate your astrological prowess! Astrology is many a times fake - just fyi your highness )

I do not know why messages like this from people who know everything, makes me a little sad sometimes. I am envious of the brilliant people like you who can assume a boat load of stuff with just a two-line edit! 

We can continue this discussion at Talk:Radhanath Sikdar: that way, many people can participate.

Incidentally I've raised the subject at Wikipedia Talk:Manual of style (dates and numbers) as it seems to me that all it says is to put fractions in """"fractional form"""" without defining what that is, and even in the section WP:MOSNUM#Fractions only says what to do about common fractions, which leaves us high and dry dealing with other fractions – for myself I would not regard  as a common fraction, for example.

 Thanks for your reply. You're right that it's common, but it's still wrong according to the Manual of Style.

 About Einstein 

My search of any document that might bear Einstein's name - in the League of Nations archive - in between 1930 - 1932 returns no results. See http://biblio-archive.unog.ch/archivplan.aspx.  By reviewing five books dealing with Einstein's work and life - not a single one mentioned this Einstein's support to the Ustase cause. Just one, written in German,

Einstein: Sein Leben by Denis Brian, Christine von Samson-Mark, Wiley-VCH, 2005 page 352

Indem er sich den Angelegenheiten seines eigenen Landes zuwandte, empoerte sich Einstein ueber deutsche Studenten, die fuer die Entlassung eines Professors agitierten, weil dieser ein Pazifist gegen politisch motivierte Todesurteile war. """"Es ist entsertzlich zu sehen, wie die unerfahrene Jugend fehlgeleitet wird"""", schrieb er an das Berliner Tageblatt. """"Wenn dies so weitergeht, werden wir 
nach einer Tyrannei der Faschisten bei einer Herrschaft des Rotten Terrors ankommen."""" Er glaubte, dass eine solche Herrschaft bereits in Jugoslawien ausgeloest worden sei und kritisierte die Landesregierung fuer den Mord an dem kroatischen Fuehrer, Professor Milan Sufflay, der Geschichte an der Universitaet von Zagreb gelehrt hatte.

Reading further this book it is clear that the only information available to Einstein was 'The """"inside story"""" of the Šufflay murder was given by the Croat journalist (Ustase propagandist), Slavko Cihlar, in the Berliner Tageblatt, February 26, 1931.'

So, it is apparent that Einstein fell under spell of the Ustase propaganda. About the same propaganda, see:

Appeal of the Croatian Academicians to the World of Civilisation: How the Croatian Savant, Professor of University, Dr. Milan Sufflay was Murdered by the Serbian Royal Dictatorship
by Croatian University clubs association, Zagreb, 1931 32 pages

which was elaborated by 

""""Blood and Homeland"""": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940
by Marius Turda, Paul Weindling, Central European University Press, 2007 page 107

Shortly afterwards, students from the Croatian University Club Association produced an English language pamphlet, How the Croatian Savant, Professor of University Dr. Milan Šufflay, was Murdered by the Serbian Royal Dictatorship, in which they appealed to European public opinion to recognize that the murder of Šufflay was the result of endeavors to build an absolutist South Slav state. In such a state, the """"European culture"""" of Croatia and the Croatian was to be replaced by Serbian suzerainty, in which """"orthodox, byzantine, oriental-asiatic and oldtuc (sic) political and social traditions"""" had been subsumed into a system """"not only contrary but also odious to European culture""""

Turda also says that """"His murder occasioned international condemnation and outrage from, among others, Albert Einstein and Heinrich Mann of the German League for the Rights of Man"""" (no source was given)

About the Sufflay murderer

Thinking about Yugoslavia: Scholarly Debates about the Yugoslav Breakup and the Wars in Bosnia and Kosovo by Sabrina P. Ramet, Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 254

Goldstein (Croatian historian) leaves the question of agency to the side and writes simply that Šufflay, who, as he notes, was an accomplished observer of Albanian culture, 'was killed on the street in Zagreb. The killers were never found"""" see also: Croatia: A History

Conflicts: Studies in Contemporary History by Lewis Bernstein Namier, Macmillan, 1942 page 49

The racial theories of a Croat writer named Šufflay were taken up since Sufflay had held that the Croats were not Slavs like the Serbs, bu were descendants of a settlement of Goths.

War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945: Occupation and Collaboration by Jozo Tomasevich
Published by Stanford University Press, 2001 page 20:
Sufflay was indicted in 1921 for espionage and connections with Croatian emigres and sentenced to athree year prison term

Hey. Excellent work on this article, and I was wandering whether you would be inteterested in a GAC nomination?  
Its easy to nominate, see the instructions at WP:GAC. And of course, continue the article further! Thanks,  

 George Kay 

I have expanded this article to cover his management career esp. at Southampton and Liverpool, but the section on his playing career is rather brief. As you appear to be a West Ham United fan, is there any chance that you could add something to expand this section? It would be great if we could bring an article about someone from the (relatively) distant past up to FA standard.   
Thanks for the work you put it, especially for sorting out the confusion between Belfast Celtic and Distillery. Do you think the article is now ready for Peer Review? If so, how do we go about it? Cheers.   
I've now put the article up for peer review at Wikipedia:Peer review/George Kay. We'll see what response we get. Thanks for your help.

 Samizu Matsuki   documentary link added 

Malcolmxl5 Per your advice, I've located documentation of artist Samizu Matsuki's painting awards of 1970 and 1971 and added an external link to it on her wikipedia biography. It consists of excerpts from the book """"Artists/USA 1972-73 - Guide to Contemporary Art""""; Library of Congress Catalog Number 78134303. ISSN: 0196-6154.

 There is a way to indirectly reflect your source(your Dutch book) to """"Martha Gellhorn"""". First, you need go to the section concerning her attitude to Stalin or Stalin's communism in the article """":nl:Martha Gellhorn"""" and make the sentence sourced as mentioned above, showing the Dutch title(""""Travels with myself and another""""?), the chapter name 'Een blik op Moedertje Rusland', the pages(p. xy or pp. xy - xz) of your source, and so on. ISBN is preferable. Quote is possible and helpful for readers. Basically, English templates are available in any Wikipedia. 
 After editing nl:Martha Gellhorn, see the left side bar, (click """"Hulmpmiddelen"""",) and click """"Permanente Kooppeling"""". You can get the """"oldid=XXXXXXXX"""" of the page from the address bar. 
 Second, you need come to the section concerning her attitude to Stalin or Stalin's communism in the article """"Martha Gellhorn"""" and edit. 
 And before you click """"Save page"""", enter """"From [[:nl:Martha Gellhorn]] as of revision (date,month,year,time,)..."""" into """"Edit summary"""".
 After editing Martha Gellhorn, see the left side bar, (click """"toolbox"""", and click """"Permanent link"""". You can get the """"oldid=YYYYYYYYYY"""" of the page from the address bar. 
 Third, you need announce in the article talk page(Talk:Martha Gellhorn) that you translated from the Dutch Wikipedia. You have to make a new section and place this Template:translated page, that is, {{translated page| nl | Martha Gellhorn | version = XXXXXXXX | insertversion = YYYYYYYYYY | section = ?Political and religious views }}. 
 For more information, see Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia#Translating from other language Wikimedia Projects and Template:translated page.

"I am impressed, Bishonen - the only thing Peterklutz has done is to exercize his right to edit, for whic h he is flipped the finger and told to deliver any complaints he might to someone's dog to chew on (there's an NPA violation if you ever saw one).

Your response?

Ignore everyone and everything but Peterklutz - and ban him. 

When Peterklutz returns from his exile and once again exercizes his right to contribute to wikipedia, in he sees his edits slashed in a matter of minutes in a surprisingly well-coordinted attack by [USer:Askolnick two] [User:Sfacets accounts].  

Seemingly evident to other wikipedia admins, the Modus Operandi witnessed is cause for investigation: two accounts doing reversals two times each against a targeted editor, which gets banned for 3RR violation when protecting his contributions - whilst the two accounts that initiated hostilities gets away scotfree (since they only reverted two times each).

Instead of flying off the handle like some prepub PMS girl, why don't you start acting like an admin and investigate the contribution pattern of the MMY and TM articles in order to determine the frequency of today's MO (as well as what accounts are involved)? When you do this you may also want to investigate the IPs operating the accounts. When you do this, chances are you'll be in for a surprise.

Since you concievably cannot do more to Peterklutz than you already have, he'll now indulge himself by walking the line to a fresh NPA.

Bishonen, you're positively starting to came across as a serious liability and embarrasment for wikipedia. In fact so low is your flaunted level of intelligence that people might actually start to wonder if your account should be part of the investigation regarding ways for single individuals or tight-knit groups of dead-enders to hijack Wikipeda articles indefinitely.

"Misrepresenting administrator scope 

Please take care not to misrepresent how administrators are expected to act, or any other policy in the future - administrators do not make content decisions. What you quoted was particular only to discretionary sanctions which are only applicable in certain arbitration cases. You view has therefore been moved again to the talk page.   

Please take care not to engage in misrepresentation - you are not outside of this dispute, and your quote was particular to discretionary sanctions. Administrators do not make content decisions. See below. Please also do not change my view - I suggest you revert your latest edit - failure to do so will result in administrator intervention for deliberate misrepresentation, misuse of the dispute resolution process and vandalism.   
 

You are welcome to your view, but you are not welcome to misrepresent administrator policy or to change my view.   

You have engaged in misrepresentation, perhaps out of misunderstanding. Administrators are only allowed to make discretionary sanctions in arbitration cases where they are explicitly allowed to - Kirill's comment was in relation to discretionary sanctions only (check the context of his comment; the heading under which he made it). FloNight's comment is in relation to administrator enforcement in general, which is why the SAB remedy has been proposed in the homeopathy case.   

It is only disruptive where there is edit-warring - that is, edit-warring against consensus (separate policy on conduct). NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. Would you like arbitrator clarification?   

Did you read what I said above? NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. See also: . 
Discussing content issues at a conduct Rfc is inappropriate - we have a clear distinction between Article Rfc and Rfc on user conduct for that reason. What is acceptable is pointing editors to an Article RFC so editors can comment on content (and hence address content issues), and that is where discussion of those issues belong in the dispute resolution process.   

So please modify your view so that there is no misrepresentation of policy/norms as it has been sanctioned by the Committee in the past (and admins have been sanctioned when using their position to make a ruling on content). Article RFC is where comment is made on the content policies you have quoted - you are welcome to direct a link to the discussion there in your view so that it is dealt with.   

It seems you don't get the point - it's ok if you think it should be enforceable, but it is completely irresponsible to misrepresent policy by saying that it must be enforcible when it is forbidden. Also, it contributes to the confusion editors have about Wikipedia norms and policies, and it is unacceptable. Therefore, I am referring it directly to the Committee.",0

"""

 your references are still not objective 

I can't believe that in your most recent edit you actually cited Tran Van Ba as your reference (""""recieved confirmation from Chancellor Tran Van Ba, last Colonel-in_chief for Emperor Bao Dai that Coat of Arms is correct""""). Tran Van Ba, according to his own statements, is the person you work for. In fact you have been editing from the same computer as Tran Van Ba. And we have no evidence, other than a large number of computer messages from an E-mail address bearing his name, that Tran Van Ba is who he says he is - and if he is, we have no evidence that what he says is true, except that he says it.

How many times do I have to say this? Tran Van Ba is not an objective source. He is not a book. He is not a newspaper. He is not a historian. He is one of the subjects of the article. He has a conflict of interest. You also have a conflict of interest, since you are (apparently) employed by him and by the family in question. And you expect us to accept your statements as fact simply because you say Tran Van Ba told you so?

This """"confirmation"""" is the same as if I said, """"The moon is made of green cheese because my mother, who has been to the moon, told me so."""" I could provide a million E-mails from my mother and that would still not be evidence.

Your repeated citations of various websites that simply refer to Mr. Nguyen as """"Prince"""" are equally irrelevant. They are simply repeating a claim that he has made, which has nothing to do with proving what Bao Dai said or did, or whether there is a Nguyen coat of arms. What you need is even one book or newspaper or magazine article - NOT a website - that mentions (a) a Nguyen coat of arms, or (b) Bao Dai bestowing an imperial title on anyone, an event that surely would have been recorded by someone at the time.

You say you are a lawyer. If so, you understand the meaning of evidence, citations, and research. If so, you are insulting our intelligence and attempting to deceive people, and I hope you will be banned from Wikipedia soon - if you do not simply give up and leave, since you seem to have no interest in anything other than this propaganda campaign. ← 16:41, 2004 Oct 21 (UTC)""",0

 User_talk:Stpaul#Personal attacks 

I find it absolutely hypocritical that you percieve the French contribution to England as one of oppression and nothing else, whilst including the Irish whom would object to England in respect to the same percieved issue.  You have insulted the Irish by not affording them the same position you afford yourself as regards the French.  You wholly capitalise on your own fantasies and call anybody else's neutrality to be POV-pushing.  You do not believe in seeing that others have equality with your standing, but sure get upset when it is not percieved to have been given you by others.  Oh how democratic and enlightened such attitudes are.  You'd make a """"fine"""" diplomat!  Governmental practices of power delegation vs restriction means nothing in respect to ethnic relations; they exist irrelevantly.  Therefore, your arguments are jingoistic and POV supremacism.   

I am simply supporting the consensus, which is to only include nations of the British Isles. As a matter of fact, I think the Germans are a lot closer to us than the French, but someone else has been trying to argue the opposite and at the same time push all sorts of medievalist, aristocratic fantasies. TharkunColl 

Brittany is not a nation of the British Isles and hasn't been.

You rewrite history to serve your Whig history-revisionist political schemes!  I have no aristocratic fantasies, unlike yourself!  You want the """"Celtic nations"""" to assimilate into the English spectrum and co-opt their identity, the way the French co-opt Roman Gaul as an identity.  Oh, the hypocrisy continues!  You hate the Mediaeval example, but are ardent defender of the New World Order in saying one thing and doing another!  You rewrite history to commit hypocrisy; condemning the actions of one party towards your percieved polity and then adopting such policies towards other ethnic peoples.  Mediaeval my arse; you are guilty of those accusations you level towards the French!  You have no right to talk!  All of these contrivances only serve me satisfaction with the French legacy, because you have rediscovered the wheel and thought it magnificent!  Vive la France et d'Angleterre!

 I'm sorry but you are factually WRONG.  As an Automotive Engineer, with a keen interest in vehicle dynamics, I can assure you that traction control and EDL are operate in two very different methods.  All traction control systems monitor differential axle wheel speeds comparing the driven axle to the non-driven axle - any differences outside the scope of the allowed tollerances will ONLY result in either (a) BOTH driven wheels on the same axle being braked, or (b) the engine ECU reducing engine output, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b).  EDL does NOT compare differences between front and rear axles, it ONLY compares differences between the left and right wheels on the same axle, and brakes just ONE wheel, there is NO engine power intervention.  Whilst they are both """"add-on"""" functions of modern ESP systems, and use the same related hardware and electronics, the software control of the two different systems are distinctly separate, and help moderate/control different aspects of vehicle dynamics.  Don't forget, Wikipedia articles are not considered valid references for other Wikipedia articles, so if you have read something contrary on another Wiki article, it doesn't automatically mean it is correct!

If you think you can do the references better, go ahead. I challenge you. Don't tell me to """"have it my way""""  as though you are doing me a favor; you are not. If you think you can do the article better, go ahead, I would like to see it.

The reason I handled the references that way is that it seems to me to be the most convenient for the reader (and other editors), which is all I care about. If that pisses other editors off (and how many other editors would that be?), it says something about them, not about me. I have no interest in """"owning"""" an article. But I have worked long and hard to do a good job and deserve to have my work treated with respect, which BMK has certainly not done. Just look at the section above titled """"Wallack's Theatre."""" 

Rewrite the article to your heart's content; just make sure you are improving it. The claim that I think I own the article is BMK's complete fiction. If you look at the record, you will see that I have welcomed constructive changes. But Wikipedia has a rule about collegiality and collaboration. Making many and significant changes to someone else's work without discussing it with him is not collaboration, it is contemptuous. Look  how I interacted with him here (under cul-de-sac). Do you think I deserve to be treated the same way? I do.

Just try to change an article that BMK has edited. I have  and have almost always been immediately reverted, even though in most cases it turned out I was right. And these instances do not concern matters of taste; they concern matters of fact. This has happened many times  most recently here (by coincidence, on October 3rd). So BMK has a double standard: one for him, and the opposite for me (and presumably everyone else). I give respect to those who give me respect; most often I have been treated by him with dismissive disdain.

The reason I blanket-reverted his changes (I didn't even look at them) is only that: that his way of going about editing my article was contemptuous. He reminds me of Lucy kicking down Linus' sand castles in Peanuts. I was not objecting to the content of his changes (although I do, to some of them), but to the process. Observe how Moonriddengirl did it: She discussed the issues on the article's Talk Page first  and I had no trouble making the changes. Is it too much to expect BMK to do the same?

As for Footnote 1, that was someone else's contribution, as the record shows (see the history at 26 June 2013); I merely relocated it to where I thought it was more appropriate. And notice how I politely explained to that editor on the Talk Page what I did and why  and said I hoped he agreed. If you think the article is better without it, delete it (you might want to explain the reason for doing so to that contributor, as he deserves an explanation).

And speaking of original research, you might want to have a look at the edit war here (discussed above in the section """"Madison Square depot"""") and explain to me how the note I added constitutes """"original research"""" and is therefore unacceptable. And how about the edit war here. Can you explain BMK's behavior in that case? (And notice that BMK began editing my article again for the first time in two months on October 2nd, right after these three exchanges  Madison Square depot, the map image, and the categories. Could it possibly be spite?)

The problem is not me; for a year I have been a conscientious editor, and carefully sensitive to the feelings of others, including BMK. But although we have occasionally had cordial exchanges, for the most part, I did not receive similar treatment in return. And now he is completely misrepresenting me and our history. And when I say so  to protect myself  your response is, """"Come on.""""   """,0

There are also a myriad of factual errors on topics other than Oxford's wardship and finances in Nelson's book.

In consequence, the only accurate source of factual information on Oxford's wardship and finances and a number of other topics is primary source documents, and an earlier Wikipedia editor approved my citation of them at the time I edited the article some months ago.

Child Porn Charges

It is noteworthy that instead of watching his daughter and protecting her, Mark Lunsford was allegedly busy on the internet viewing child pornography. Ironically, many of the """"Jessica's laws"""" that Lunsford fought so hard to get on the books dealt heavy blows to viewers of child porn, like Mark Lunsford, yet, Lunsford was never prosecuted under the existing federal laws for viewing child porn which would have landed Lunsford in federal prison and required him to register as a sex offender. Contained in the documents released by the State Attorney's office were notes from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement that mention child pornography on Mark Lundsford computer. The images & documents were found Feb. 24 — the day Jessica was reported missing from her South Sonata Avenue home — Assistant State Attorney Pete Magrino said the images were found on Lunsford's computer. However, he said his office is not pursuing charges. [3]

Plastic Surgery

Lunsford surprised many in July 2007 when he appeared in the media having undergone several cosmetic surgeries, including a face lift, dermabrasion, and eye surgery. 4

Father of Child Molester

In 2007, Joshua Lunsford, Mark Lunsford's son was arrested for having molested a 14 year old girl in Ohio. Despite Lunsford's public attack on all sex offenders, he seemed to be ready and willing to defend his own son's sex crimes and in fact may have played a vital role in the unequal treatment of Mark's sexual predator son. Joshua Lunsford was ordered to undergo sex offender evaluation but special treatment was administered and Joshua avoided felony charges and sex offender registration.[5]""",0

Look guys, I just checked with several doctors, three lawyers and a couple of judges and they all say that there are many questions they get which they only have a partial answer for or no information about at all and must therefore use their professional judgment and experience to provide an answer so that the right way to handle either a legal or to a medical question is to include a clear and simple disclaimer whether you are otherwise qualified to provide and answer of not. 

In other words it is far better not to delete a question but rather to answer it to the best of your ability and then add a disclaimer even if you are sure your answer is one hundred percent provable by the facts. Otherwise you should simply leave the question alone and not answer it at all and instead remove the answers which do not include a disclaimer or may be contrary to facts. 

Also, no one can be held responsible for providing an answer to a question, even if a disclaimer is not attached, in any scenario where the answer or """"advice"""" is free of financial charge. In other words, unless you require something of values in exchange for your answer or """"advice"""" you can not be held responsible for what your answer is. 

This is of course not the case when questioned by a police officer or other official or officer of the court who represent the State and are seeking an answer on the State's behalf. If you choose to answer their questions then you are obligated by law to tell them the truth although you are likewise permitted to withhold an answer or to provide a disclaimer if you do not.

"My edits
I rewrote somewhat to avoid a combining of the traditions of different parts of Polynesia. I also tried to change the emphasis in the opening line to Pulotu as 'Polynesian mythology' which gives the mistaken impression that the concept is found all over Polynesia. It is important to maintain the separation of the individual traditions - otherwise we are at risk of rewriting the traditions. The association made with the Māori concepts of Hawaiki and Te Reinga I thought was taking it a little too far - Hawaiki is not always/often conceived of that way by my people. I also took out a reference to 'Purotu' since there was no evidence offered that the word occuring in that form means underworld. I also took out the reference to Pulotu having changed in Tahitian to purotu meaning a girl of marrying age. The word occurs in many Eastern Polynesian languages with the meaning beautiful:

HAW   Puuloku. Comely, tender (Pki)@
MAO   Purotu. Handsome, clear, pleasant (Wms)@
MVA   Porotu. Beauty, handsome person (Bck)@
PEN   Purotu. Beautiful (Rsn)@
PUK   Pulotu. Beautiful (Bge).
RAR   Purotu. Pleasant, pleasing, agreeable (Sve)@
TAH   Purotu. Joli, beau (Mte)@
TUA   Purotu. Slightly handsome, attractive (Stn)@

SAM   @

There is nothing here to suggest that the word changed in Tahitian (or that it is only used of women); nor is there any evidence to suggest which meaning is the older, the eastern Polynesian 'beautiful' or the western Polynesian 'residence of the gods'",0

Hello, Sorry I couldn't attend to your concerns earlier. I semi-protected the page (here) because of the reasons stated there. As it is election season in the United States, articles about prominent political figures such as Mrs. Clinton are particularly vulnerable, hence the protection. There was a dispute over the reliability of sources, and I protected the article to cool the dispute. Protection isn't an endorsement of the current version, I have no ulterior motive.

"""Concerning one point of disagreement concerning policy formulation in the above discussion, I would suggest that the normal approach is:
Yes, knowing something to be untrue, is generally accepted as a reason to tag or remove material. In fact, the extreme argument, which I do not have much sympathy with, is that questioning un-sourced material is always acceptable, no matter what the intention. (But then people generally add some proviso when arguing this extreme version, such as """"except when we are talking about obvious behavior issues"""".)
Trying to formulate what less extreme people think, I would say that believing something to be unlikely to be something that people could come to a consensus about being true is a valid reason for tagging or removing material.
This is perfectly consistent with our real way of working: verifiability, the ability to confirm that something is what rational people could agree to be true, is our threshold for inclusion, but not personal opinions about what is true.

Page Creation
So, I started the page. This is probably going to get heated, some people accusing me of saying the Course is a """"hoax"""" and all that. But I think this is an issue worthy of a page on Wikipedia because this is an important aspect of the Course. This might be interesting and beneficial. 

  

This article needs to be merged with the ACIM article or deleted
It's an issue worthy of a section of the A Course In Miracles page. It definitely isn't worth a separate article. If, as you suggest, Jesus was a source, then it deserves to be part of that article. If He wasn't, then it doesn't deserve to be anywhere. Either way, it doesn't need a separate page. 

-...wha? 

Well, that's completely just an opinion on your part. Another member and I have been discussing this on the main A Course In Miracles page. We both agreed that this deserves its own page as the topic is too expansive to maintain within the already lengthy main ACIM page. Have you taken a look at the other aspects of ACIM that have pages of their own? This certainly deserves its own page as well. And I might add that this page is not about whether I say the Course is channeled/scribed from Jesus literally. It is intended as the beginnings of an article about what is actually said in the Course and the different perspectives among """"students"""" and """"teachers"""" of the Course. Whether I myself believe one way or another has no bearing on this topic or the page itself. 
 

The existing ACIM main article is already quite long, and is intended more to be a summary of ACIM (believe it or not).  This topic is clearly a more in depth treatment of one aspect of the philosophy of ACIM than the main article, and may require its own separate long article in order to treat this subject properly.  My sense is, why not give this article a couple of weeks to settle and develop before making any clear determination about where it belongs (or doesn't belong)?

 I concur. The ACIM page is quite large, and this issue is quite large.

I removed the """"merge"""" notice. So far, it is three to one that this should remain its own article. If someone thinks I should give it more time, then please replace the """"merge"""" notice.   

""""Exposing a hoax""""

(Copied and pasted from discussion on main ACIM page.)

I think there is a huge misunderstanding here. I have never used the word """"hoax."""" It appears to me that you and some others who have discussed this with me, seem to think I am attempting to expose the Course, and now Catholicism, as a hoax. If you understand what I am talking about with regard to symbols, then you understand that there is no intention to """"expose a hoax"""" on my part. 

Is math a hoax to use """"5"""" all the while there are no """"5"""" characters out there in our physical world? I could stand here and go, """"Well, you know, math is all a lie, a hoax, because there really are no 5's. They've lied to you."""" Or I can say, """"The human mind cannot comprehend the principles expressed in math without use of those symbols, such as the symbol '5'."""" 

This is all I'm saying about the Course and Catholicism. 

If, as I believe, there was never literally a man who lived and was known as Jesus (and I'm not passionate about this topic one way or another, actually), then what I am saying is that even for the Catholic Church, Jesus is ultimately just a symbol. If the Catholic Church can be seen as """"math,"""" then Jesus is their """"5"""". Do you get what I mean? The symbol of """"Jesus"""" stands for something that is very real, though the symbol itself might not have actually existed in concrete, physical reality. 

The """"Jesus"""" in Catholicism (and I'm a former Catholic) often stood for persecution, suffering, agony, pain, and there is little argument from most that Catholicism brought exactly this to the world in many ways. Look at the Inquisition, and all the other horrible things the church did. And, for them, they did it in the name of """"Jesus."""" For them, Jesus symbolizes the need to do all these things. The things they did in the name of the symbol are very real; though the symbol might not have actually existed in concrete, physical reality on this planet.

Female masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.
Lubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient—some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.
Women may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and """"hump"""" the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.

A vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.
Some reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.
A few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.
Those who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation. Sometimes sex therapists will recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, especially if they have not masturbated before """,0

"""=Sexism in MGS5, relevant to an encyclopedic entry on the game?===
Came back to this article to see if any progress had been made on cleaning it up. Good to see some progress has been made.
I'm going to make a few points here and well.. hopefully people will be rationale and objective about it.

Misinformation. This article is rife with it. It's incredibly important for an encyclopedia to present accurate information. An encyclopedia should not be an opinion column, it should not overly represent any opinion since they are not based on fact, nor relevant to a topic. I'm going to start with the 'Sexualized Portrayal of Quiet' and sadly I'm going to have to tear it apart. Please put how you feel about it or any emotion you may have about the topic aside when you read the following points;

1 - No other character in any other Metal Gear title pages is given this amount of scrutiny. Quiet has been highlighted by the media as sexist, this is true. However this is not a reason for an encyclopedic entry to focus on a given character. The page is not a study of the media's (or anyone else's) reaction to Quiet as a character. There should be balance in the reception section, giving a whole section to Quiet versus no other characters is not balanced.

2 - Misinformation. """"Michael McWhertor criticized Quiet's portrayal, pointing out that while the game explains that her nakedness derives from a photosynthetic skin condition, several other characters with the same condition — such as Code Talker in The Phantom Pain and The End in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater — appear fully clothed.""""

Regardless of the source of information, if it is incorrect information it should not be in the entry. Quiet is naked because her lungs were burnt to a crisp, the game specifically mentions this and other fans have mentioned it on the page I believe. Code Talker and The End have the same ability correct, but they did not get set on fire and thrown out of a building. I'm really baffled this is in here because McWhertor is not an authority on this whatsoever. Kojima and the game writers are. Source it correctly or remove the information I would have said.

3 - Opinion columns. This baffles me. Why are opinion pieces been taken as reception? They are not professional video game reviewers. By the media's own admission they are just someone writing their opinion about something, it's not objective. They wouldn't even claim to be unbiased as it's an opinion. You are introducing bias here by taking an opinion and presenting it for no reason other than to say """"this person didn't like Quiet's portrayal"""". If tomorrow Donald Trump wrote an opinion piece on Quiet for a media outlet, is that relevant to an encyclopedic entry about something?

4 - Further irrelevant information. There are sources and information here that talk about the PlayArtsKai figurine of Quiet. Are you out of your mind?! What relevance does this have to the RECEPTION OF THE GAME??? The video game this entry is about. To start with PlayArtsKai is a completely separate company that we have no idea or information about how much Hideo Kojima was involved with. One would assume since they are completely different companies ENTIRELY that Konami simply licensed the intellectual property rights of Quiet to PlayArtsKai. It goes without saying but Twitter is not a valid source of information.

5 - Dates. Numerous sources are reactions to the character Quiet and precede the date of release. Thus they are not a reception of the game itself. Hence why are they in a section called """"Reception"""" to start with.

5 - Forbes contributors and Anita Sarkeesian. We seem to have established that Forbes contributors are not valid sources so I expect this will be okay to remove.

Everything else seems to be sourced from valid sources who are professional video game reviewers. Although again I'd suggest that Quiet is getting an amazing amount of spotlight in the article for no other reason than controversy 

To any senior editors, administrators, or anyone with an interest in Wikipedia standards. It should be extremely concerning that this level of bias is present in an article that is supposed to be by and large, factual. 86.40.28.221

Under the basic premise that wikipedia exists for general information; In substance, Wikipedia serves a journalism-type mission, existing to educate people.   A newspaper editor doing an article on somebody who is pictured on a magazine cover, might include a photo of that magazine cover.

You see, Questioning The Report was there for years, and Cliff and I worked to get it a way that it fit. When the book went online, I added another small section in this area. The change alone was not removed, but the entire section, which ticked me off, as I worked to get it there.
So I ask to be unblocked, so I can work with these editors again in a beneficial way in the future.",0
"IC, here is his post and here are my answers too, can anyone object?

The sculpture is a representation of Muhammad - that does not mean that every detail is historically correct. The picture of Jesus at the head of his article is absolutely not correct in terms of mode of dress or physical appearance, but that does not stop it being a representation of Jesus. Art is not photography, and doesn't have to be accurate in a litteral sense. Yes, he is holding a Koran - not because the Koran existed during his lifetime, but because it's a written record of his sayings. In artistic terms it makes perfect sense as a symbolic representation. This is a decent, respectful image, and was created to honour Muhammad as an important figure in world history.  

>>The picture of Jesus at the head of his article is absolutely not correct in terms of mode of dress or physical appearance, but that does not stop it being a representation of Jesus.
My Response: The question is not stoping the represenataion of Jesus, the question is what makes the sculpture/picture of Jesus to represent there? Answer: The General Associate and mindset of people, that people immediately bring that image in their mind when they hear about Jesus. While this is not the case with Muhammad. There is no general association of any picture with Muhammad nor does anybody in Mainstream think about it.

>>In artistic terms it makes perfect sense as a symbolic representation.
My response: In artistic terms it makes perfect sense as NOT representing Muhammad symbolically. Why? Because I mentioned how many differences are there in the statue with the personality of Muhammad and how many commonalities. Neither that sculpture nor that painting match any characteristic of Muhammad except that both have breard, and there are millions of people with beard in the world. Thats it.",0

 my editor review 

Hi István,

Thanks so much for your thoughtful input to my editor review! Firstly, to answer the question you asked: I'm not sure yet if I really want to be an admin. Like I said, I've been toying with the idea, but I keep having these nagging doubts that it wouldn't be right for meI'd get carried away with my newfound powers, or I'd feel pressured by the responsibility that goes along with those powers, or I wouldn't have the time to be an effective admin anyway, or I'd spend so much of my wikitime admin-ing that I'd lose sight of actually writing and editing. So as I think of it now, mulling it over, I suppose I'm leaning against it. There is a certain """"prestige"""" awarded those who are elected admins and that certainly had an attraction for methe satisfaction of earning the respect from my fellow editors, being entrusted with the special toolsbut that's no reason to seek adminship. Yeah...you and the nagging little voice in my head are probably right, adminship isn't my thing.

Regarding your criticisms: I know I'm naive, not to mention emotional to a fault. (as you know all too well!) There are a lot of things that should just slide right off my back but for whatever quirk in my personality, they don't. I've always been like this and probably always will beheightened emotional sensitivity is hardly a detriment to me as a musician/artist, but it definitely can get in the way sometimes in places like this. I'm learning to deal with it better, I think, just by getting more experience, but it's probably always going to be an issue for me to some extent. And to be completely fair to myself, I'm actually quite stable at the """"core of my being"""" (to use a cheesy phrase) and there's very little in everyday life that can really hurt me deeply. (i.e. stuff waaaay more serious than dumb arguments on the wiki.) I haven't totally lost perspective! ;-) 

Your comments about my tendency to try desperately to find common ground with unreasonable editors were also spot-on; I certainly have done that but didn't quite consciously realize it until you pointed it out!! I hate the types who always go around making enemies and assuming the worst, and I always try to avoid being like that, the obvious result being that I often overcompensate and end up gullible and easily pushed-around: """"I'll say whatever you like, just please don't start a fight!!"""" (I've done that most often with a certain Serbian fellow, for some reasonhoping to score brownie points and maybe win civil treatment eventually?!) Lousy foreign-policy strategy really...I'll try to do a better job of standing my ground in the future.   

I must say though, I'm quite touched by the compliments section of your review: I guess my charming and atmosphere-improving qualities could be considered the good side of my diplomatic naivete? ;-) I'm glad to hear that my efforts are appreciatedespecially glad to hear it from you, since you are without a doubt another of those people who makes the Wiki not suck, and I value your opinion quite highly. Köszönöm nagyon szépen once again for such a thorough and thoughtful review, I really appreciate it. Best,  Review me?  """,0

"""::On reflection, I'm not sure this does actually belong in the lead.  I don't know if I would call """"activist"""" a judgmental word, but I see Jmundo's point.  It is a somewhat inflammatory word.  To many (esp. conservatives), """"activist"""" is an insult.  I think """"activist"""" is a fair factual description of some of Sotomayor's activities at Princeton and (to a lesser extent) at Yale, but without the context that is present later in the article, the sentence in the lede sort of leaps out, and suggests something quite different from what it turns out to be (i.e. sit-ins, protests, 60s-style """"activism,"""" militancy, that sort of thing).  That's not what you mean by the word in this context, but the reader won't know that before reading the full article, which is getting pretty long.  Also, it's not clear to me that this activism is important enough to make the lede anyway.  There's a lot of stuff in the article that's arguably more important than these particular episodes in her life (especially at Yale, where any activism really was a very small part of the story of her time there).  What do you think?  If you really wanted to keep this in the lede, perhaps the wording could be changed, e.g. """"She was an advocate for the hiring of Latino faculty at both schools"""" or something like that.  But I'm not sure it belongs.  -

Anyways leaving that side, let me know which editions from the Guinness Book they have made errors in and what they were. I can understand the editors of the Guinness Book can make a mistake, but it's difficult to say they could have made a mistake in reading a statistic that says 100,000,000 and writing it down as 65,000,000 instead.

 anti-Greek collusion occuring? 

I am new to Wikipedia. I've only been here a few days and I already get a strong sense of anti-Macedonian bias. (for the record when I say Macedonian... I'm talking about the ones that identify with Greece)

I've already been threatened with banning and named called on more than one occasion for simply discussing facts on Macedonia. At this point I am loathe to name more names but it always appears to be the same set of people working together as a team. (I'm sure you know who some of them are) 

Anyhow... I have an interesting image that I think this is very relevant to the naming dispute article but I don't know how to upload it. Perhaps you could arrange it? (they should be allowable under fair use) I think the second one down """"Solun will be the capital of Macedonia again""""... perfectly illustrates Greek claims of FYROM irredentist behavior and would be an excellent example to add to the naming dispute page.

http://history-of-macedonia.com/wordpress/category/fyrom-news/

A secondary issue that bothers me is the Wikipedia page entitled """"ethnic Macedonians"""" related to FYROM (as if to say that Macedonians are now non-ethnic.) This of course is really offensive to Macedonians but the FYROM page is locked. I think the best approach around this lockout dismissing the human rights of 2.5 million ethnic Macedonians... it to make a new page called ethnic Macedonians (Greek)... which describes the rich history of the Macedonian identity... from ancient Macedon... to Byzantium... to integration with the new Greek state.... to distinct Pan=Macedonian foreign diasporas dating back decades. Many people only know Macedonians from Alexanders time... I think a page showing the long history of Greek speaking people calling themselves Macedonians would make it much clearer to readers why Macedonians are so sensitive to this name issue.

""""Hyacinth,"""" customarily an English woman's name, is the English spelling of the generic name of the flower – which in German is spelled with a z. 

The subject was a German male. The subject's given and legal name was Hyazinth. German WP therefore uses Hyazinth.

Random Question
Hi.  I am a rather biology noob, hopefully this question doesn't sound strange.  I am curious as to whether it is possible for stem cell creation to one day reach a peak where we can replace animal Slaughterhouse?  Forget about the economic factor for a minute.  Is it theoretically possible to feed a nation with meat that was grown 100% in a lab and not killed from any animal??  I had a thought that animals would benefit greatly from this.   
Um, you could grow either stem cells or non-stem cells in some sort of cell culture system for food, I guess, but it seems like a hideously expensive exercise & you would likely use animal or animal-derived products in their growth. The problem would still be the texture and the flavour''.
Realistically, it would be easier to feed everyone with soya flavoured to taste like meat. I've read that the entire underdeveloped world could be easily fed using the grain the US alone feeds its livestock (not sure if that's true though). Eating meat is costsly, and in vitro meat would be even moreso. The best way to save the animals would be to go vegetarian... but I still like a good steak.  
So you are saying there is never going to be an answer since taste and flavor can never be produced in a lab?  
Not never, just that I suspect that taste and flavour will be greater hurdles than growing cells. I don't see why it has to be stem cells that are grown as """"meat"""" - actually you would be better off growing muscle cells, as it is the muscle (and some fat) that is what is in a typical steak.  

In this line:  """"In the future, medical researchers anticipate being able to use technologies derived from stem cell research to treat a wider variety of diseases including cancer, parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, and muscle damage, amongst a number of other impairments and conditions.""""

The new Centre is working with only two courses and a lot of people especially students those who seeking for admission are very keen to know about the Centre.

Your inability to admit facts in the face of overwhelming evidence

Well if the shoe fits and the logic lacks, then you are laughing at your own lack of logic in your previous and last contributions to the NWPL deletion page.    
   
You refuse to acknowledge overwhelming evidence. No sources say the NWPL was not responsible for having Sparks recognized, contrary to what you said. Conclusion: you are making things up. Stop misleading yourself and Wikipedia readers.   
    
If your research skills are not limited, then your understanding of the facts, or willingness to read what I have provided, is.    
   
Have you not read the study on park origins? What part of it don't you understand? If the NWPL was not responsible for the recognition of Sparks, then I challenge you, honestly with facts to support your argument, to demonstrate who was.    
   
Below are two more articles to convince you of your egregious error, dare I say fabulation?   
   
If you are not serving wikipedia's purpose of informing the public, then whose interest are you serving?   
   
I dare you to continue denying the facts. Go ahead...   

I note that you and other editors of Gatineau Park material are aviation enthusiasts...

     
 
- Sparks was founder of the park, researcher says,    
- By Dave Rogers, Ottawa Citizen, May 9, 2004, p. A9   
- Mackenzie King is often credited with founding the park, but an ex-journalist says Roderick Percy Sparks was the driving force, Dave Rogers reports.   
- The NCC has hired a pair of Outaouais historians to study the origins of Gatineau Park after it received information that contradicts the popular notion that William Lyon Mackenzie King was the father of the park.   
- The evidence, gathered by Chelsea resident and Senate speechwriter Jean-Paul Murray, suggests Roderick Percy Sparks played a far more influential role than the former prime minister in creating the park.   
- Mr. Sparks dedicated 25 years of his life to the creation of a national park in the Gatineau Hills and for 10 years was chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, a lobby group that encouraged the first government purchase of Gatineau Park.   
- During the 1930s, Mr. Sparks and other members of the league argued there should be a national park in the Gatineau Hills because the widespread cutting of trees for firewood endangered the area's scenic beauty. The government created Gatineau Park in 1938, but it is not a national park and has no legal protection as a park.   
- Mr. Sparks wrote the master plan for development of the park in 1952. The plan recommended that all private property in the area, including his home, be expropriated. Mr. Sparks' vacant house on Meech Lake Road in the park burned under mysterious circumstances in 2001 two months after Mr. Murray, the former managing editor of the federalist Cite libre magazine began asking questions about its owner.   
- There was no electricity or combustible material, other than the building itself, to create a fire risk, nor was there evidence of fire starting from the nearby woods.   
- No cause for the fire was ever made public. The police did not release a report and the report from the fire authorities was almost a blank. There was no cause, no suspects and no investigation.   
- An obituary on Mr. Sparks in the Ottawa Journal of March 30, 1959 called him the “father of the Gatineau Park,” adding that as chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, he “brought about the first purchase by the Dominion government of what is now the Gatineau Park.”   
- Born in 1880, where the Supreme Court of Canada stands today, Percy Sparks was the great grandnephew of Ottawa pioneer Nicholas Sparks. He played a leading role in the customs investigation that led to the King-Byng Affair and to the subsequent defeat of the Liberal government. Mr. Sparks' contemporaries generally acknowledged him as the park's founder.   
- “Percy Sparks was a giant who brought down Mackenzie King's government in 1926,” Mr. Murray said. """"He was the man who did more to create Gatineau Park than anybody else from lobbying to writing the first master plans.   
- Mr. Murray said Mr. King was cautious about the creation of the park. “I found an interesting passage in his diary from 1937, a few months before the park was created, that showed he wasn't enthusiastic about the park because people might think he was trying to improve his property.”   
- “The NCC says that he was one of the major architects of the park, but this disproves it.”   
- Mr. Murray said the NCC never mentioned Mr. Sparks' role in creating the park so people wouldn't be tempted to advocate it",0

MPT
Hi it has come to my attention that it is only the english articles that uses """"MRT"""" instead of """"MPT"""" which is used in the rest of other language wiki articles especially the Macedonian one. Debunking the romanized alphabet argument, it could be seen how even the logo has put """"MPT"""" in a romanized alphabet form therefore should be the one to be followed. It is practice here in wikipedia to use the official naming used by the one being described in the article no matter what their translation to english might be such as Volkswagen which in direct romanized translation is """"Folkswagen"""" but the former prevailed due to it being the one used in the official logo of the company albeit being romanized too. I understand your argument on the main article """"Macedonian Radio Television"""" that is why I kept that because its original name would not make sense in an expanded form here in english wiki. But its acronym should not be meddled upon especially it has a logo to prove it and the main article could provide the knowledge why MPT and what is its translation to english.Lastly the MRT 1 and MRT 2 pages should be really up for a disambiguation as the MRT worldwide may refer to Mass Rapid Transit or an equivalent rail term.

The Mithraic branch of Zoroastrianism also heavily influenced Christianity.

wikipedia: Clyde """"Champion"""" Chestnut Barrow was born on March 24, 1909 (perhaps 1910, according to some reputable sources^ ), in Ellis County, Texas, near Telico (just south of Dallas). He was the fifth of seven children in a poor farming family. Clyde was first arrested in late 1926, after running when police confronted him over a rental car he'd failed to return on time. His second arrest, with brother Buck Barrow, came soon after — this time for possession of stolen goods (turkeys). In both of these instances there is the remote possibility that Clyde acted without criminal intent. However, despite holding down """"square"""" jobs during the period 1927 through 1929, he also cracked safes, burgled stores, and stole cars. Known primarily for robbing banks, he preferred smaller jobs, robbing grocery stores and filling stations at a rate far outpacing the ten to fifteen bank robberies attributed to him and the Barrow gang.

"""
Comment.  It's confusing enough that I am not sure what """"disagree"""" means in this conversation.  A quick run through my sources indicates that """"folk costume"""", """"folk dress"""", """"national dress"""", """"ethnic costume"""", """"traditonal dress"""" etc. are all used pretty much interchangeably.  I would support a move to """"folk costume"""" or """"folk dress"""" for the reasons cited above, but """"folk costume"""" should not be a subset of """"national dress"""" since modern political boundaries do not necessarily match either ethnic boundaries or political boundaries as they were at the time that folk dress was ossified (at least in Europe - as mentioned, some folk dress is still evolving).

[For what it's worth, I wouldn't characterize square dance clothes or bolo ties as folk dress - western wear is a modern retro concept based on romanticized notions of 19th century clothing, and bolo ties are a modern invention!  But bolo ties and cowboy shirts are certainly regional dress.]

By the way, the use of narrow use """"costume"""" to mean """"theatrical costume"""" is about as common as the use of """"dress"""" to mean """"a woman's garment with a skirt"""".  Both """"costume"""" and """"dress"""" have these narrow, non-specialist, everyday definitions which make it really difficult to decide what terms will be understood by users of Wikipedia.  """"Clothing"""" is probably the most neutral and inclusive term, but we struggle in choosing """"Medieval clothing"""" vs. """"Medieval costume"""" vs. """"Medieval dress"""".  And """"folk clothing"""" is not used in the specialist literature and sounds really dumb.  In the museum and art-historical worlds, """"costume"""" and """"dress"""" are both preferred terms.

OED definitions are pertinent here: 
COSTUME: The mode or fashion of personal attire and dress (including the way of wearing the hair, style of clothing and personal adornment) belonging to a particular nation, class, or period.
DRESS: Personal attire or apparel: orig. that proper to some special rank or order of person, or to some ceremony or function; but, in later use, often merely: Clothing, costume, garb, esp. that part which is external and serves for adornment as well as for covering.

 is right, in that there isn't a simple solution; we're going to have a ton of redirects and alterate terms whichever way we go.  Gievn the OED definitions, I'd say """"Folk costume"""" is more accurate.  But I personally prefer """"Folk dress"""", and I'd choose that over """"National dress"""". -   """,0

 Copied from Blue Ball 
(The issues of this language are unrelated to disambiguation, but should be consistent with the article Blue balls.)

The following appears on Blue Ball but is more efficient to discuss here:
""""Blue balls"""" is a modern slang term for a minor cramping men may get in the groin after they are sexually stimulated for a prolonged period but do not ejaculate.
(t) 21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)

Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary conforms to common sense usage in saying a cramp is """"a painful spasmodic muscular contraction"""", and the groin does have muscles.  But blue balls is not a cramp, but an ache in the testicles (whose musculature is insignificant at most).  Ellis emphasizes """"congestion"""", which i take to imply that the pain reflects failure to release the eleveated local blood pressure resulting from failure to relieve the engorgement of the genitals that is crucial to erection, i.e., a condition related to the """"pain and tenderness"""" of priapism.  (It may be informative to consult side-effects information of Viagra and its competitors, some of which are effective for 3 days and advise medical care for erections lasting over 4 hours.) (t) 21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)

Further, the term ejaculate, like the earlier """"release semen"""" (that a well-intentioned editor  used to replace simply """"release""""), misleadingly suggests that fluid pressure of seminal fluid is at issue; i think research will show that there is no significant seminal pressure except that imposed in pulses by the prostate during ejaculation.  The real issue is indeed plain """"release"""", or rather release of either sympathetic or parasympathetic (never could remember which is which) nervous-system excitation, which in turn entails destimulation of sphincter-like structures that sustain the engorgement (and that ED-medications work by affecting).

"Hello Ben, 

If you are going to insert a NPOV header on the page, you are supposed to justify all and every point you have in mind, not completely smash up a page, and then rewrite it with no discussion or debate as a Watchtower PR exercise. Many others here have covered these issues over and over and the page has been approved by two administrators in regard to the eschatology section. My edits were reverting, not altering the main text sections. I only edited the last 1995 bit, and you've said nothing about that, except made unfounded claims. All major changes are supposed to be discussed first, and you have not done that, you have just ripped out the factual material and done a whitewash edit in apologist speak to look like it was all a minor dream or something.

A couple of points I will pick up on were where you claimed in regard to 1799, 1914, 1920, and 1925 etc., that they were “suggestive and purely speculative”, but Ben, not one of those dates falls into your apologist descriptions, you are clearly not being reasonable, rational, or honest

You then say “Progressive adjustments of understanding in the face of unfolding events, resulted in a period of changing explanations centered around the years 1914, 1918, 1920, and 1925.” That is also incorrect because those dates were only changed after their humiliating failure, not before. It hardly takes a brain surgeon to change a prediction, where the world is still looking on, long after the end was supposed have arrived! You also are trying to use very deceitful terminologies to try and pacify the facts to more and more insignificance, when they were anything but that at their times of publishing. An example of your gross dishonesty is here where you say “Other dates variously considered being time of God's judgement”. Since when were they “variously considered”? They forcefully stated, “we affirm that, Scripturally, scientifically, and historically, present-truth chronology is correct beyond a doubt. Its reliability has been abundantly confirmed. . .” and “This chronology is not of man, but of God. Being of divine origin and divinely corroborated, present-truth chronology stands in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct.” What you inserted was gross fabrication and deceit Ben. Why? What is your agenda? If you are embarrassed, get over it. You should not destroy, whole pages due to your religious ties to the JWs.

Ben, you said “They do not profess to be inspired”, but they use ever synonym in the book that directly implies that exact same thing, see quotes here 1 and here 2, why are you hiding this balance?

There are a lot more points that you are misleading and censoring for your own agenda, and that is not the purpose of Wikepedia. I get the impression you are possibly a naïve JW who does not know about the real history of your religion (please don’t take offence at this, it is a common thing), and so you edit in good faith that your indoctrinated info from the watchtower org is correct. Please do some detailed research before you vandalise many editors' hard work. Wikepedia is here for accurate information, be it good or bad, but not public relations platform for religious groups and their biases.

"AC power plugs and sockets 

Hi, you recently commented at the talk page of AC power plugs and sockets, regarding my reversions of the completely erroneous edits being made by ZH8000.  I presume that you did not check that editors claims or you could not have failed to observe that their edits to the article (and their comments to me) were nonsense.

I'm happy to believe that the name """"Blackbeard"""" is used to describe a character in an upcoming movie. The issue for this article is why that is sufficiently significant to the modern cultural understanding of Blackbeard, for it to warrant inclusion in the article on the historical figure. Simply stating that Blackbeard is mentioned in a modern-day film/book/comic/play doesn't tell us anything about how the historical figure is interpreted, and risks being indiscriminate information which does little to advance our understanding of the topic. I suspect before we include the fact that Blackbeard wll be mentioned in yet another modern movie, we would need to know how this mention is of enduring cultural significance. I also doubt that the real-life Blackbeard can be presented in a historically accurate context in the otherwise fictional universe of POTC> More likely, and with all respect to Ian McShane, it is likely Blackbeard will simply be a large black-bearded pirate who has matches in his beard and says """"Yarr."""" An entertaining figure no doubt, but not one that advances this article, which is about the real-life Caribbean pirate.

I don't mean this to sound snarky, so my apologies if it comes across that way. It's just that articles like this can quickly amass extensive and fairly trivial lists of mentions, including every time the subject is even referred to in sitcoms and the like. Check out the page history from about a year ago, to see what I mean. I'd prefer not to return to simple lists of mentions, even when Blackbeard is a major character in the film/novel/comic/TV episode. Instead and for what its worth, I support Parrot's suggestion of mentioning it at the film's article, where it has apropriate context.

 Information removed 

I removed the following information that appears to have originated at U2wanderer.org:

Bono supposedly contributes vocals to the track """"Long Black Veil"""" but in a strange twist he is not credited in the album credits.  The information about his involvment comes from various news bits over the years, and mention of this album in discographies published by those who would know, like Niall Stokes.

The lead vocals are by Mick Jagger and The Chieftens.  Originally they were performed by Bono, but were not used.  These had been recorded at Windmill Lane.  Although Bono's vocals were not used, the instrumentals from that session were supposedly used, meaning it may be possible to hear Bono way back in the mix somewhere.

 Sanskrit vs Devanagari 

Hi there,

with regard to your edits, I agree with the edit on a technical level. However, there is an issue with that, in that we put the language instead of the script due to the fact that it helps identify the etymology of the word, which the script does not do. Also, there is a translation after the script, which means that using the language name would be better. Additionally, which Devanagari script is well known, what about names derived from languages like Punjabi or Malayalam. I hope you understand the point of view. Cheers. T/@edits """,0

"""=Where the analogy holds===

In Canadian law, a secure electronic signature can be used (most) everywhere a notarized signature or Minister's signature is required. In other words, this specific form of electronic signature is considered as strong as the strongest form of """"ink-and-paper"""" signature. (The PIPEDA S-E-S regulations can only be satisfied with digital signatures.)

Why do we care? Because there are places where the analogy isn't an analogy, it's a homology: Present a notarized signature on a paper document and a secure electronic signature on the homologous electronic document to a Canadian judge and the judge will likely conclude that for legal purposes they are they same signatures and the same documents. Neither has any greater or lesser standing that the other.

And this needs to be borne in mind when this page is rewritten, especially when the section on legality is rewritten.

Think of it this way: For anyone other than an autograph hound, a signature is of interest for its legal value. Ultimately, the same is true of digital signatures. The technology may be interesting, but, ultimately, the reason we want to get the technology (and procedures and policy) right is so that these things stand up in a court of law.

Perhaps the page needs to be broken into two overall sections: Technology (just the facts) and legality (with no overall content but references to various jurisdictions.

Alternatively, remove any subjective or legal content, and make reference to appropriate pages.

For example, repudiation is not a fact, it is a legal matter.

 Sigüenza y Góngora 

Hi Rockero, thanks for all the work on the Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora article. Interesting material, and I'd never seen it before.

I have one minor question. Was his father really born in America? I knew Carlos was, but I had assumed his father was from Spain, because of the royal tutoring.

 
The oversight can perhaps be attributed to haste. My sources mention nothing abut his birthplace, but a Continental birth is much more likely, given the timeframe and his position. I changed it to peninsular, only to discover the deficiencies in that article.
I presume you are referring to S y G's theories about the origin of the Olmecs and the evangelization of Thomas when you say you found the new material interesting? Such theories were actually quite common, and it appears that SyG was one of the first to come up with them, or maybe just the first to popularize them. The Mormons were way behind. 8)
One final note: I'm guessing that """"book examiner"""" is your translation of """"corregidor general"""". Is this correct? My English-language sources make use of the term """"censor"""", which I can only guess is one and the same as corregidor general. I have added Censor (Catholic Church) to the censor dab page, in hopes of composing an article on the post, but refrained from linking it from the SyG article. If I am in error, please correct me. Thanks for your comments, and the pic looks great,  
Yes, if I remember correctly he was listed as corregidor general, but I'm away from my encylopedias now and can't definitely verify that. I'm sure I can find a copy of Enciclopedia de México in a library here (I'm in Los Angeles now), but it may be a little while before I get to that. """"Book examiner"""" wasn't really my translation. I had no idea what the original term meant, but I found him referred to as """"book examiner"""" on a web page, and I identified the two. I think it's safe to assume all three terms refer to the same office.

Huh ? If they are English by descent, """"indigenous"""" to England, then they ARE English by ethnicity. How do you know how many of them have other English ethnic feautures and how many don't ? If they are of English descent, they will automatically have other things of being ethnically English. They already for sure have many things on that list for being English: English language, religion, descent, and who knows which do or do not have other parts of Englishness.

"""::The purpose of this discussion on the proposed intervening section is to illuminate the controversial conclusions and impression that readers took away from the story, because they conflated the reported claims of the DI as described in the story with independently verifiable facts.  The analysis by  Skip Evans illustrates this confusion and provides a reliable source that the claims of the DI are not necessarily valid.  That's one way to establish the controversial nature of stories about the DI which contrast the published claims of the DI to published remarks by signatories like Salthe and Davidson ridiculing the DI's interpretation.

If you want a reliable source that the article by Chang is controversial in its own right, on multiple points, you can take a look at the article's Ask Science Q&A; page on the NYT wherein Chang responds to commentary and criticisms of his piece, and admits that parts of it are slanted toward highlighting the anti-evolution signers and not the pro-evolution ones.  Chang says, """"This article focused on Discovery's petition and thus I did not interview evolution supporters.""""

Elsewhere, you have good evidence that there are evolution supporters among the 103 initial and subsequent signers, notably including Bob Davidson, whose story came to light and is featured in the main Wikipedia entry on the Darwin Dissent Controversy.

This intentional snubbing of evolution-supporters among those interviewed by Chang for comments misleads readers about the statistical mix of those who signed the petition, giving some people the impression (per the desires of the DI) that all signers are variously """"anti-evolution"""" or """"Darwin dissenters.""""  The contemporaneous analysis by Skip Evans reinforces that element of the controversy.

When one realizes that Chang focused the story on the anti-evolution signers (many of whom joined after DI went public, and when one observes that Chang fails to solicit a quote from Picard (even though he mentions her name), one is left wondering which side of the fence she (and others of the 103) reside on.  The purpose of all this is to cast doubt on the unverified presumption (suggested by the existing section which I am forbidden from touching) that Picard belongs to the anti-evolution dissenters.  In other words, I am saying that some of the Wikipedia editors evidently fell into the trap which the DI set, luring readers into believing that all 103 scientists adhered to DI's dubious characterization of them.  

The length of the intervening piece needs to be longer than the section it precedes, because the current section adopts without proof the thesis that Picard is among those belonging to the anti-evolution dissenters.  The proposed intervening section is designed to examine the evidence for the unproven thesis adopted in the existing section and determine whether the evidence for it is credible or conclusive.  As you well know, a proof is typically longer than the theorem.  What's in the proposed intervening section is an examination of the omitted proof, in which the outcome appears to be that the missing proof does not seem to exist, and in fact there is good evidence at hand that the dubious thesis adopted by the existing section is simply false (and therefore unprovable).  If it is false, then it is also potentially libelous. Therefore, establishing the truth or falsehood of the thesis is crucial in order to protect Wikipedia from inadvertently publishing false and defamatory material that slipped through the filters intended to examine the evidence with a keenly skeptical eye.

What any Wikipedia editor happens to know for a fact about the status of the petition in the intervening years is not evidence that anyone whose name appeared in nationally printed ads back in 2001 had the slightest inkling of what the DI was up to in the meantime.  Perhaps Wikipedia editors found this out by doing painstaking research on the DI.  Stanley N. Salthe said in 2006 in the Times article we are examining that he had never heard of the DI.  That's well-sourced evidence that some of those who signed had no clue that the DI even existed, let alone was maintaining a growing list of names.  Therefore one cannot draw any verifiable conclusions about what most of the 103 original signers knew of the DI prior to the 2006 Times story.  

One of the reasons the story is controversial is because it fails to point out that the DI had reprised and evolved a 2001 petition that predated any of the disputed assertions regarding its inherent meaning or its re-interpretion as a testimonial in favor of DI's political agenda.

The two sources which establish the controversial nature of the story are the above mentioned [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/0",0

"Hello ,

My name is Mrs. Rebecca Song, a Portuguese national .I have been diagnosed with Esophageal  cancer which has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. 

As you read this, you do not have to feel sorry for me as it is a universal truth that we all must die someday. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that
was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just accumulating all the wealth in the world as I lay helplessly on my sick bed.

If I was given a second chance to live again, I'm sure I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it owing to what has befallen me now. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Seventy Five Million United States Dollars ($75, 000, 000.00) that I have with a Finance Vaulting Unit in Europe.

All I am asking of you is to assist me in making the collection of this deposit and dispatching the funds to any
charity of your choice.

N/B: Kindly note that 30% of this funds must go to the tsunami victims, 50% to other Charity Organization and 20% for your effort and time. I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation,as I am using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you.

Please contact me as soon as you get this email if you are capable and sincere to handle this transaction on my behalf so that I can forward to you all relevant documents necessary for the claims and the name of the security firm where the funds are deposited and a picture of my present condition.

what i was upset about was not content but behavior - namely edit-warring.  People disagree about content all the time.

Here, Toby72 asked me to take a look at this. Here is what I saw in a not-so quick look at recent edits.
This 14 April version of the article had an initial paragraph in the Colonia Era section which was largely unsupported.
In this 15 April edit, Toby72 replaced this paragraph with new content, still largely unsupported. The new content changed the focus of the paragraph, removing a heavy weight previously given to rape in a master/slave relationship in favor of heavier emphasis on mulatto offspring.
In this series of three April 15 edits, DD2K reintroduced the emphasis on rape, citing supporting sources.
In this 15 April edit, Tobby72 reverted the DD2K edits, saying """"WP is not a blog"""".
In this 17 April edit, Tobby72 added and rearranged some material.
In this 17 April edit, anon 69.105.28.149 reverted the article back to its state as of the last edit by DD2K, without explanation.
In this edit, apparently not noticing that the article had been anonymously reverted to one of his prevvious edit versions, DD2K made some further edits to the article, saying, """"Undid revision 550678046 by Tobby72 (talk)Not weighted properly. Vast majority of scholars(and obvious common sense) state slave/master 'relationsips' were rape by the very nature"""".
In this May 3 edit, Toby72 added and removed some material in this and other sections of the article. saying, """"readd quotes per WP:NPOV, plus add pics"""".
In this May 3 edit, DD2k reverted the prior edit by Tobby72, saying, """"...  rv- stop- If you want to make these kinds of controversial changes, use the Talk page.""""
In this May 3 edit, Toby72 added a  tag to the section.

I think I've got that straignt. Some of the edits mentioned above were separated from one another by unrelated edits made by other users.

Guys, please re-read WP:BRD. I know that it is an essay and not a policy, but it does describe a workable method for reaching consensus by identifying objections to edits and keeping discussion moving forward and help towards breaking deadlocks. That Bold-Revert-Discuss method is much superior to the Bold-Revert-Unrevert-Edit war method which has been tried here. Regardless of how the section at issue got to be in its current state, can we please have some discussion aimed at establishing a consensus about what it ought to contain?

It looks to me as if the main area of disagreement is how much weight should be given to information about master-slave rapes in colonial America in an article on the topic of Mulatto, which the lead sentence describes as, """"a term commonly used in the United States to refer to a person who is born from one white parent and one black parent, or more broadly, a person of any 'mixed' ancestry."""" Input from editors not involved in the edit-warish exchanges above would probably be useful. I'll mention that this source might be useful.

On this page, EM radiation is distinguished from particle radiation, while it is claimed that particle radiation is made of moving subatomic particles.  Thing is, a photon is such a particle.  In fact, if you follow the link to the article about particle radiation, you'll notice that a photon is, in fact, on the list of particles there!  Therefore, it would appear that EM radiation is, in fact, a sort of particle radiation.
Being no expert on physics myself, I can only assume that it was meant that particle radiation is made of particles other than photons, i.e. ones that don't display particle/wave duality.  If so, I'd say that should be expressed more clearly.  Either way, either this page, or the one on particle radiation, should definitely be changed somehow to deal with this confusion.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 89.138.227.172  00:46, August 30, 2007 (UTC)

 Vacuum 

I have made some changes in wording that I feel more comfortable with. The modern vacuum is not the same as the classical vacuum, even in principle, and it seems to me that some distance should be placed between the various vacuums: the now archaic """"vacuum"""" of classical electrodynamics, the BIPM official """"vacuum"""", the realizable vacuum of interstellar space, and theoretical vacuums like the QCD vacuum. 

Another issue is the introduction by BIPM of the """"defined value"""" of c. This definition is tantamount to a definition of BIPM """"vacuum"""", and is a bit unsatisfactory as there is no theoretical definition of this """"vacuum"""". Rather, it is a moving target that is actually defined in an empirical manner through a library of BIPM corrections that are not completely specified but left up to """"standard best practices"""". About all one can say in its favor is that it is a """"reduction to practice"""" of """"vacuum"""". However, having no theoretical basis outside of this (ever changing) operational definition, it is subject to definition by committee based upon criteria some of which have no physical basis, but are based upon (ultimately) convenience, politics, and economics.

I see you had deleted the page for Jack Harris (broadcaster) for notability being in question and non-encyclopedia standards, as this is a local sports and news broadcast personality. In this day and age Wikipedia has grown to have more content than any print encyclopedia ever could, including content relevant to certain specific audiences (such as local history). You'll notice most major local journalists and media personalities now have entries. Refer to [staff of WPVI in Philadelphia] where every personality has a page. In the case of the Tampa Bay market, figures such as Keith Cate, Dick Crippen and Paul Dellegatto all have pages, though only of significance to one or two media markets. In fact, on the WTVT page, Jack Harris is now the only Notable former on-air staff not to have a Wikipedia entry. 

The previous Jack Harris page was rather long and included a good deal of information that wasn't necessary in its level of detail and failed to provide enough references to back its notability. With restoring this page, I (or another contributor) could create a considerably trimmed down version (a paragraph or two), explaining his significance as a 50+ year sports, radio and television broadcaster, with ample references and citations.

 Olympic 

Formation and early years
The name was chosen by James Edmondson, the club's first treasurer, and is believed to have been inspired by the recent excavation of Olympia, site of the ancient Olympic Games. It's referenced by Phythian, p. 7?
Yes, that's right    
Decline and colapse
In 1886 the club's committee was forced to reduce the players' wages to a quarter of what was being offered by Preston North End. Why it is comparing with the PNE? It's because some players went to play there?
Simply because PNE were the top club in the area.  It shows how much worse Olympic's wages were compared to the top club in the area.  Hope that makes sense    
Rivalries
The rivalry became especially fierce in September 1884, when, amid accusations that the clubs were using underhand tactics in attempts to """"poach"""" each others' star players, the Rovers' secretary sent a telegram to his opposite number stating that his club would play no matches against Olympic in the 1884–85 season.

 Scientific evidences stating Meucci's priority on Bell

1) Anti-sidetone circuit

Meucci began investigating topics related with the telephone """"system"""" in 1858, as shown by a drawing of the same year, reproduced below http://www.chezbasilio.it/immagini/corradi_drw.gif. 
This drawing formed the basis for Meucci's caveat of 1871, but, as Meucci's lawyer did not file it with the caveat, it was later notarized by Meucci himself in his affidavit of 9 October 1885.The drawing shows a two-way, simultaneous, telephone conversation, with a complete separation between the two directions of transmission (indicated by arrows). This contrivance is aimed to counteract the so-called """"side-tone"""" effect, that is, the hearing of the echo of the speaker's own voice (as well as any background noise) in his own receiver. 
This layout is known today as a """"four-wire circuit"""". With it, Meucci anticipated any other inventor, as proved by the following:

No mention of side-tone effects, nor measures to counteract it, are found in Bell's patents, nor in Gray's caveat, both of 1876. In the first Bell's subscriber lines, the four (initially, two) instruments were simply put in series on the same line.
The first anti-sidetone (AST) circuits were introduced by the Bell people in the 1900s, particularly by George A. Campbell, with his nine patents of 1918, many decades after Meucci's solution was shown in this drawing, and over thirty years after the same drawing was notarized.

2) Inductive loading

The drawing reproduced above http://www.chezbasilio.it/immagini/lemmi_drw.gif is taken from a note jotted down by Meucci in his Laboratory notebook on 27 September 1870, and reported in an affidavit by M. Lemmi of 28 September 1885, containing the English translation of said notebook (see also my paper on """"Antenna"""").
It can be seen that diagrams """"No. 2"""" and """"No. 3"""" differ from """"No. 1"""" in the insertion midway along the long-distance line of an inductor (with either a horseshoe or bar iron core). In diagram """"No. 4,"""" the inductor is split into two parts, inserted at both ends of the line. In his notes, Meucci pointed out that, in this way, he could get rid of the battery, and that, by splitting the inductor, he obtained better results.
This technique is known today as the """"inductive loading"""" of long distance telephone lines, allowing to increase the distance and/or the quality of speech. The proof that Meucci came first, can be drawn from the following events, occurred many years after Meucci's discovery (or its notarization):

In June-July, 1887, Oliver Heaviside and Alfred Vaschy predicted, on the basis of mathematical calculations, that telephone signals could be transmitted without distortion by increasing the line's self-induction.
On 19 June 1900, M. I. Pupin obtained the first two patents for said technique. The Bell Telephone Co. acquired both patents and, later on, applied them in its lines

3)Means to counteract the skin effect

Because of the increased bandwidth of the telephone with respect to the telegraph, telephone lines were subjected to increased attenuation, due to the so-called skin effect.
In two notes of 1862 in his Laboratory notebook (notarized in Lemmi's affidavit of 1885), Meucci suggested to treat the surface of the (copper) conductor in various ways (basically with graphite) to increase its surface conductivity.
Moreover, in his caveat of 1871, Meucci stated: “I believe it preferable to have the wire of larger area than that ordinarily employed in the electric telegraph.”
Another note in his notebook, dated 17 August 1870, reads: “To be adopted, for having long distance, bundles of copper wire insulated with cotton or any other kind of wrapper; by this means I have obtained a distance of about one mile.” For this """"bundle"""" of copper wires Meucci filed a US patent application """"Wire for Electrical Purposes"""" on 2 July 1880.

That Meucci was first in said techniques, is proven by the following facts:

Skin effect in telephone lines was neglected by all inventors till 1880, when it began to be investigated by David E. Hughes and Oliver Heaviside.
Following their studies and the development of """"hard drawn"""" copper, the Bell Telephone Co. decided to use copper in place of steel, beginning from the Boston-New York line, which was inaugurated on 27 March 1884.

4) Call signaling

Meucci adopted a telegraphic call signaling, simply effected by a Morse key, attached to each end of the line, momentarily short-circuiting the local transmitter. In this way, strong pulses of current were sent along the line, and the distant receiver would emit intermittent ticks, much louder than the ordinary speech. In his caveat of 1871, Meucci gave a detailed description of his call signaling, consistent w",0

 Your meddling immigrant confusion...

(English, Scottish, Irish, French, Dutch/Orangist, German/Holy Roman coats of arms)

That being said, Rhenish Germans were the sort we had in those days.  Prussians and Austrians, as well as their politics, did not constitute part of the Founding Fathers' vision or hope of the future for America.  You'll have an impossible time convincing educated people that the Habsburg or Hohenzollern (except perhaps Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben) politics in any way were an inspiration for Americans of any or all origins, then and now.  We have had emulation of William van Oranje-Nassau and Prince Rupert of the Rhine including his family such as the Winter King and Queen of Bohemia, but that is because they were Rhenish and any other Palatine (Amish etc., like Herbert Hoover and Dwight Eisenhower) culture we pretty much supported always and for all times.  That's different from the East German culture, which has never, ever been a component of Americana and might never be either.  Try to prove otherwise to any academic historian and they will laugh in your face.  You have to put the German issue in context; Benjamin Franklin was hostile to """"Palatine Boors"""" as he called them, but the Quaker establishment which founded Pennsylvania loved him to death.

"Heaven of God 
For the atheist anarchist, the subject is Heaven, and it is religion, moron> I saw your kind at University, go feed yourself in the mountains.

To understand Heaven, then God must be understood:

 1. God is the all powerful supreme being of the Universe.
 2. Universe is defined as everything that is seen and unseen, and defined as everything known and unknown. Any concept of a multi-universe shall be defined as the mathematical subspace where there can be many subspaces, but only one Universe. A mathematical subspace is a subset of dimensions that does not have to include all other dimensions. The subspace we exist within can be a subspace of a larger subspace. The subspace that includes all dimensions is the Universe itself. The Universe itself is a subspace that includes all dimensions.
 3. God is either above the Universe as the creator, or part of some subspace of the Universe, or both above and part of the Universe. The fourth condition that God is not part of the Universe, and God is not above the Universe negates God's existence; therefore, the fourth condition is not considered a valid condition of God.
 4. God is supreme over the Universe. It is God's creation and obeys God's rules. Each rule can be obvious or non-obvious, and each rule can be hidden or allowed to be known.
 5. God has the ability to create and destroy energy. Without such a thing, then the Universe simply exists and is eternal and everlasting with no known explanation of its ability to exist; there can still be God as a supreme being of the Universe in such a condition, but God's energy ability is changed to the ability to manipulate energy without the ability to create or destroy energy.
 6. God is smart, is intelligent, is wise, has knowledge, is a creator, is good, is benevolent, has mercy, and has understanding. God has these abilities that are significant as the supreme being of the Universe.
 7. God expects God's creation to do well, since as a creator, then the Universe was created for God's purpose and enjoyment; therefore, life elements of God's creation, such as people, are expected to improve their own condition for their benefit and exercise wisdom, understanding, and knowledge when possible to exercise such thingsintelligence is good.
 8. Because God is supreme, then Heaven and its rules of existence are defined by God.
 9. God not only deals with people of Earth of our Sol system of the Milky Way galaxy, God is a supreme being that can interact with the entire Universe in whole, or God can interact with the Universe in part; therefore, God truly understands some of the issues and survival strategies of life, and this implies that God may be truly forgiving and God may expect certain behavior for the improvement of ourselvesto survive and prosper is important.
 10. It is always believed that God likes people, so help from God can be asked by petition for help or intervention using prayer.
 11. God likes to be acknowledged from God's own creation, so it is good to acknowledge God as the benevolent intelligent creator of the Universe.
 12. Love God. Love is a survival strategy of people that helps to define society, family, nation, benevolence, and many good things of life. Be who you are as a person and love God, and God is expected to understand this as love is part of the defining qualities of people.

God has created the Universe and has the ability to define Heaven in any way. Each person can get a personal Heaven, or Heaven may be a interaction for people, or Heaven may be a combination of both personal and interaction of people. Heaven is always defined as a good place; but, a personal Heaven can also be a personal Hell tailored to your life, attitude, and existence where God could give us, by observation, an environment where the individual prospered. The personal Heaven and Hell would be much like an metaphorical ant farm that is designed for ants, but you would not expect things like body building equipment in the ant farm, and the ant farm would function in a way ants survive, and this can be bad news for people who were ruthless where their environment was ruthlessness as a survival strategy (visit a zoo and see how the environmentshowever limitedare tailored to the different animal species).

God can define Heaven in any way, and Heaven is defined as a good place, but as a supreme being God can allow many things, and maybe God might include a body building set for the metaphorical ant farm, so the possibilities of Heaven are expected to be many, if not endless possibilities. God is benevolent in Heaven and the possibilities are many. Love God.",0

Your contributed article, Carlos Vives discography
 Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Carlos Vives discography. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Carlos Vives. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Carlos Vives - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia. Try not to be discouraged. Wikipedia looks forward to your future contributions. ~Talk """,0

 Regarding your edits to Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey 

I have reverted your edits to these two articles.  Please review WP:V to learn about appropriate, reliable sources for the information you keep adding, and also visit WP:LIBEL and WP:BLP to learn about appropriate information in biographical articles of living people.  Insinuating that these two individuals are having an affair or are anything other than faithful to their respective significant others is libelous, and against Wikipedia policy.  You have not provided a reliable source to support the POV suggested by your edits.  WP:NPOV will help you learn about Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.  

The quotes you keep adding are taken out of contexttheir mentions of a """"crush"""" on each other were done in a joking manner, and another cast member followed their comments by saying she had a crush on both of thembut that's not grounds for speculating that the cast member in question is having an affair with both of them, and if I said or insinuated that she were, that would be libel.  These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other, and frankly, good public relations by supporting their on-screen chemistry and by extension, that of the fictional characters they play.  Many other cast members have complimented their co-stars, including PD and EP, but no reliable source has, to my knowledge, ever published information that these two were anything other than co-stars who happen to be friends.  On the contrary, both speak frequently of their significant others in high esteem (in print and on camera), and speak well of each other's partners.  If you have a reliable source for your edits, in accord with WP:Verifiability, then it's a different story, but as it is, your edits are potentially libelous and not in accord with Wikipedia editing policy.""",0

ONIH has not addressed the issue, and he has also not answered my question.  

1. I said small would be more appropriate relative to """"minor"""" - """"""""Minor"""" reflects a point of view. """"Small"""" would be more appropriate.""""  Most appropriate would be to not have any modifier.  If the split was so minor, why are so many people still ticked off about it?  And it's not fair to say that the RSF folks left the movement, they just continued pursuing a direction they had pursued for years.  The """"movement"""" is bigger than PSF and PIRA.

2. I did not state that Peter Taylor is a """"mere journalist.""""  If I did, my apologies to Peter Taylor.  Indeed, please point it out where I used the phrase """"mere journalist."""" 

I did state that he has written some excellent books.  For better or worse, historians are not journalists.  They have different schools for each, in fact.  Provos accompanied a documentary broadcast; it's a great publication, but it's not a detailed history of the Provisional IRA.  The wikiepedia entry for Peter Taylor states, """"Peter Taylor born Scarborough, North Yorkshire is a British journalist and documentary-maker who had covered for many years the political and armed conflict in Northern Ireland, the so-called Troubles. From his experience he has written and produced books and television documentaries on the Northern Irish conflict.""""  The entry for J. Bowyer Bell states, """"The Troubles began in Northern Ireland in 1969, and Bell's The Secret Army: the IRA 1916-1970 was published the following year, and was one of the first detailed histories of the IRA along with The IRA by Tim Pat Coogan which was also published in 1970.""""  Many of the people that Taylor interviewed were also interviewed by Bell; and Bell probably interviewed them first and, in some cases, more than once (though Taylor probably interviewed several people multiple times, too).  

3. One Night In Hackney states above that he """" wasn't using one source over another, I was using what the source actually said.""""  But Bell clearly states, as noted above, """"Ruairi O Bradaigh, Daithi O Conaill, and about one hundred others walked out to form Republican Sinn Fein.""""  So, the sources disagree.  At one point, I believe, the word """"twenty"""" was in there.  It is not in there now, and from my view this is appropriate.  If the sources disagree we should not choose one over the other, but instead we should either acknowledge the differences and quote from each or find a way to be neutral  not quoting from either.

4. Once again there has been a dispute in which One Night in Hackney has chosen one source over another and then when confronted with a direct quotation from an alternate source he has chosen to ask questions, change the subject, and deny the validity of the source.  The reality is that Taylor and Bell are both valid sources, and Bell was clearly talking about people walking out of the Ard-Fheis.  Bell might have been wrong, Taylor might be wrong, but we as Wikipedia editors are not in a position to make that determination.  To do so is to engage in Original Research. WH.

 polyandry in Tibet 

Hi there. On 30 September 2005 you made a number of significant additions to this article, which have survived to this day, or would have, save for my undoing them:
Marcus S. Goldstein, whom you introduced to the text by explicit wiwilink as quoted here, as well as further described with his birth and death years in parentheses that followed, is not the Goldstein in question. The correct anthropologist is Melvyn C. Goldstein, born 1938, current co-director of The Center for Research on Tibet at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.
At least your addition of the characterization of polyandry in Tybet as being """"exceedingly rare"""" presently is, I'm sorry to say, unsupported by literature available already in 2001: See the PhD dissertation linked in its entirety from the Center's web archive of publications and other work on polyandry and family. 
I have corrected some of the above and made significant fixes in the Sources section, and  in the Polish-language version I prepared, the factual content reads correctly. The English-language version is still in need of attention, especially the inclusion of text documenting the revival of polyandry in Tibet de facto, which took place after communes fell by the wayside in China, and is blooming today, despite recent campaigns by the Chinese authorities to implement population control in rural Tibet from 1996 on.

When editing this page, unless the outside source as been completely removed, it is a good idea to leave the outside sources in the page.  I already have some good outside sources already mentioned in the article: City_Year#References. To save you time, you can use some of these existing outside sources in addition to the main CY site stuff for sources.  For example, the first source on this page is something from the Fast Company website. it is titled  (Ctl F to find that).  In order to cite statements with a source that is already inputed into a page, one only needs to add a """"/"""" to the reference tag: """".""""  For example:

Wikipedia does not have a user page with this exact title. In general, this page should be created and edited by User:59.180.173.138.

Nonetheless, it is good to see such fictitious people emerging and these new 'entities' are probably one among the scores of sock-puppets being used for manipulation on wikipedia.  

It is of course pointed out that I have not made any personal attacks but pointed out not just glaring contradictions and discrepancies but also but steadfast refusal of such 'contributors' to realize these points and make corrective action.

I have posted in detail above about my contributions on the Chola dynasty and explanations and justifications for such postings along with not just the sources but also the quality of such sources and information.

I am indeed waiting for detailed discussions in case required. Unless that is done, any deletion of my contributions without assigning reasons is also as improper, as per established Wikipedia norms, as posting or making additions to an article without giving sources and references.

I am sure a neutral admin like Taprobanus and other contributors from the Tamil Nadu group will certainly reason in my trying to better the quality of the article on Chola Dynasty.  

Through the medium of this post, I also request the admins to initiate a debate on the origins of the so-called 'Chalukya Chola dynasty' which according to me never existed... (all the inscriptions right from Kulothunga I to the last Chola king Rajendra III) bear evidence to the fact that these kings either directly or indirectly, NEVER addressed themselves as Chola Chalukya or Chalukya Chola.  It is again the handiwork of manipulators who seek to maintain and continue the title Chalukya Chola.  By the same token kings after Vikramaditya VI in the Chalukya page should be called Chola Chalukya because that king was a son in law of Virarajendra Chola.. and Hoysalas after Veera Ballala II starting with his son Veera Narasimha should be called Hoysala Chola or Chola Hoysala because Ballala II was a son in law of Chola king Kulothunga III.

 Comment intended for Schlafly page 
I received a 7-day block for my previous comments, and now an indefinite block. Here
is a comment that I intended for the Schlafly talk page.

I believe that the Phyllis Schlafly article falsely maligns Schlafly by misinterpreting a NY Times book review.

 The article implies that Schlafly opposed Nixon over """"segregation and discrimination"""",
while the source only says that she was with conservatives who were going to oppose whatever Rockefeller proposed.
 The article relies on a Jewish NY Times columnist raising a Jewish issue,
without mentioning that the columnist is a Jew who writes about Jewish issues, and that no one else raises this Jewish issue.
 The article implies that Schlafly used Jewish code words, while the source
does not explicitly say so. All the source really says is that her opinion is that
the biography should have commented on the matter further.

 As for your substantive proposal, I agree that significant coverage in multiple sources is the GNG standard, but the sources don't have to be presented before an article can be created.

 Romeo and Juliet comparison 

This is the quote I found from the source given (the other source seems to be a dead link):
""""""""Our story line is maybe not the most original or creative, but it's Shakespearean,"""" said Borden, who described the plot as a modern version of Romeo and Juliet. """"We took from the best.""""""""

I see this has been discussed before and there doesn't seem to be a conclusion, so let me give my two cents. The story of a boy and a girl falling in love with each other but not getting their way is probably the most common theme in the world, and that's the only resemblance between those the movie and Romeo and Juliet. There's an enormous difference - Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, for one. Let's just say that this movie is nothing like Romeo and Juliet.

Moreover, if you have a basic knowledge of Shakespeare, you will know that Shakespeare created nothing. His story of Romeo and Juliet comes from an earlier story of the same name, which in turn comes from the Metamorphoses by Ovid, who probably heard the story as a folktale. His other tragedies - Hamlet, King Lear - are the same. The true excellence of Shakespeare is in his ability to transform them masterfully into blank verse. It has nothing to do with creativity, and here Borden is awfully wrong to claim that the best is Shakespeare's plot - which has been around for centuries. It shows a lack of basic knowledge about what he supposedly based his story on.

All this raises doubt to the amount of truth in Borden's claim that he based it on Romeo and Juliet - is it babbling, or is he simply ignorant? We do not know. But we do know that his comparison is, at best, doubtful. Yes, it is a verifiable source, it comes from the writer's own mouth, and it is not my place to judge him wrong, but it is also against the principle of common sense to make the comparison in an encyclopedia based on one sentence out of the writer's mouth - as far as I know, no one yet has made this comparison and no one seems to see the same way. I would suggest moving the sentence below to the plotline as """"The writer of the play claimed that..."""" as it is not exactly a notable claim either (nowhere else in the article is it mentioned, except briefly in what I believe is an OR sentence). Or, better, remove it.   
I think the editor seemed to feel that what Borden said was sufficient. I'd be a little dubious because; besides it being possibly self-promotion, the only thing we can grab without a shadow of a doubt that (like what you said about the Bard) they weren't that creative.    

Ok - I have now posted 5 more references not from the author, but from mainstream critics who easily saw the similar elements. I also fixed the dead link. I also retooled the sentence to say that both the author and numerous critics have made the same (or similar) description.  As to the obvious similarities: meeting at a party, a balcony scene, each has their """"gangs"""", the thwarting of a parents will, rival cliques instead of rival gangs is also referenced by 3 different critics. May this be the end to this conversation now? Thanks for allowing me to post more references.  Please read them all and you might learn something.  
Oh yes - of course their are elements of Grease and West Side Story - They too were based on elements of the R&J; story. I feel silly even having to point this stuff out, but it keeps coming up. Let's see - Grease wasn't a tragedy either (except its message of """"dress and act like a slut and you will be accepted"""".  Shakespeare created nothing? Gee, I guess that is why R&J; is perhaps the most adapted play of all time. See the wiki article on Romeo and Juliet on screen just for a taste of what the play has inspired.  No one has adapted Ovid and few have even read Romeus and Iuliet (I have though - has anyone on this page read it?). I sincerely doubt if Bordon or many critics have. And just so you know - Shakespeare did indeed add to the plot and created characters that hav",0

If this was a legal Wiki, you might have a valid point. It's not, so you don't. Why don't you get a ruling as to whether plain english can be used on this Wiki?
The lede is supposed to encapsulate the rest of the article which is quiet clear that this was a murder - not an accidental, natural or judicially sanctioned death.

I do sympathise and understand that for Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA, the current phase of the conflict is about the definition of the conflict itself. For the self-esteem of the so-called republican movement, and for the political future of Sinn Féin, it is vital that its 30-year campaign of violence be remembered as a just war, a regrettable but necessary method of achieving a legitimate aim. The vile and sordid deeds that run through that campaign may, under pressure, be described as wrong. They may be accepted as """"mistakes"""". PIRA may acknowledge, in the curiously passive language it favours, that these things """"should not have happened"""". But they must never, ever, be called crimes. God forbid!

"""

Just my thoughts on itI doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone, and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail.

In some cases it is probably appropriate, and actually used just like a surname (in a legitimate but different, broader sense than that used by our surname article, and including patronymics in Iceland or elsewhere) by the person.  That's probably especially true of radio personalities with an on-air name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name (I've seen that happen quite often), and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names.  But as a general rule, no. Some like Ann-Margret make it clear by normally using a hyphen. The problem, of course, is that our articles, especially the stubs and sub-stubs, often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on.  If it is """"Mary Lou""""  or something of the sort, common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname, especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself, it should clearly be under M in any category (the redirect which should be there, or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page, could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories, and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful).  But in between, there is a huge variety that you'll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done.

A bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories, and there are lots of them. Even worse are those Easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesn't even appear in the article's own name.  """,0

And what happens to the """"interest factor"""" is the same as what happens to prose and sourcing ... editors learn, indeed are encouraged by reviewers, to pad up their articles so that expansion/length is met, and there is often no regard for whether that padding is a) based on reliable sources, b) relevant to the article, or c) well written.

We have admins whose own DYK hooks are inaccurate, and are passed, based on blog sources. Recently. SO ... yes, interesting hooks might be one part of training new and experienced editors and encouraging responsible and policy-compliant editing, but there's a huge iceberg under that tip at DYK that is not being addressed because the few qualified reviewers who are active there cannot keep up with the volume, and we have several entrenched DYK regulars who either don't care about copyvio and reliable sources or simply and still after many years of editing do not even understand core policies.

I don't think the definition from Webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written (1917) .

"Nuclear Reactor 

Nuclear reactor [1] or a nuclear reactor, a device for performing a set of nuclear reactions under control. The laboratory scale apparatus for the production of specific isotopes, radioactive materials (radioisotopes) Prtvdarvha as well as for medical and laboratory and industrial scale for the production of electricity are made 
History 

The first controlled nuclear fission energy was achieved in December 1942. Construction and operation of a cell led by a form of graphite bricks and uranium and uranium oxide fuel successfully concluded. The cell nuclear football at the University of Chicago was the first nuclear reactor was operating. 

 Reactor Building 

Despite the diversity of the reactors, almost all of them are composed of the same components. These components include the fuel cover fuel to slow neutrons from fission, cool stacks for transporting thermal energy from the fission process is controlled to control the fission rate. 

Fuel for nuclear reactors should be such that undergo fission neutrons can be obtained. Five Fissile Nuclides that are currently used in reactors. 232Th, 233U, 235U, 238U, 239Pu. Some Nuclides from the thermal neutrons for fission and some fast neutrons are also produced by fission. Reactor fuel is a difference between property in Uncategorized. The ability of fission fuel used in nuclear reactors must be able to meet other needs. Fuel must be mechanically strong, chemically stable against the radiation damage resistance, so the reactor does not undergo physical and chemical changes. The thermal conductivity of the material must be high enough so that the heat can move easily. It is also possible to obtain, making a comfortable, relatively low cost and non-hazardous chemicals and other benefits in terms of fuel. 

Pod reactor 

Nuclear fuels are put directly into the reactor, but has always been used as a cover. Covered or sheathed fuel, moderator and coolant it apart. This corrosion protection and fuel the spread of fission products from irradiated fuel to the environment is prevented. The pods could also fuel support structure and heat transfer to help. Materials such as fuel pods have good thermal and mechanical properties and the chemical interaction with the fuel material is stable environment. It is sheathed with a low cross towards nuclear interactions of neutrons and is resistant against radiation. 

 Neutron moderator materials 

A substance that can slow or rapid thermal neutrons are used up. The kernel has a mass close to the mass of the neutron is slow is best. The reactor will be used for the lower neutron absorption cross-section should be. Due to the properties of slow, there are some substances that can be used. Hydrogen, deuterium, beryllium and carbon are some examples moderator. Because beryllium is toxic, it is too low to be used in reactors. The isotopes of hydrogen, heavy water, and the water and carbon, in the form of graphite as a material to be used. 

Heavy water in some types of nuclear reactors as a neutron moderator is used. They can react with uranium to neutrons. Than conventional light water or water can also be used as a moderator, but because light water absorbs the thermal neutrons are light water reactors need enriched uranium to use high purity, But heavy water reactors can not enrich uranium or conventional uses heavy water so the discussion is to prevent the development of nuclear weapons. Heavy water reactors can be built in a way that requires no equipment enriched uranium to make plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. However, conventional uranium for use in nuclear weapons could be used in other ways, too.This material controls. But in non-industrialized countries like America and Canada, it means much gram and kilogram quantities without any specific authorization of the manufacturers or supplier chemicals supplied. The price per kilogram of heavy water with a purity of 9899% in about 600 to 700 dollars. It also can not use enriched uranium and heavy water plutonium production reactor construction. Just as pure carbon, super slow since the Nazis use of impure carbon use, they did not notice the truth of America's first experimental nuclear reactor in 1942 and the Manhattan Project and the Trinity test of the plutonium bomb, known as «FAT MAN »the manufacture of enriched uranium or heavy water is not used. 

Cooler 

Heat from fission in the reactor or fuel must be removed from the heat too high or the fuel rods melt. Heat is the fuel in the reactor power may be used to generate electricity. Characteristics of the coolant should be directed to heat the heat transfer can be effective. Also, chemical stability and lower neutron absorption cross section of two major properties Knndhast cool. Another point that must be noted",0

I am a direct descendant of the Bélanger Family knights that came to Canada From the family castle in France. The """" Chevaliers De Belle Angers """" I.E. (knights of beautiful angels), from the """"Chateau D'Anger"""" next to the town of """"Anger"""" in Normandie of France.

(RECORDED FACT OF HISTORY).

 The Familly from Germany that is related to the Belanger Family and not Bélanger

family, was actually the ancient family of Ingers. This Family also had many dealings, commerce and mixing of families between the Bélanger and Belanger family. This produces Belle Ingers... Belingers, Berengers, and more... Ingers also had a great meaning to the name and you may want to look it up. (Proven to be found in the original family archives.)

 The Bélanger Family also went to Nottingham England in the service of the King to help in the holly Crusades. The name then was pronounced Belanger, and made quite the mix in the family tree. (Found in the original family archives.)

  There is quite the extensive research done in exactly what happened in our family.  For more information on the real origins of the real Bélanger Family... Look for...

"Claims that family of Lazar Kolisevski had Bulgarian ethnicity

When someone claims for a Macedonian person to be a Bulgarian, is an offense to the Macedonians, similar or worse when someone calls Bulgarian a Tatar. Kolisevski has always stated he has a Macedonian ancestry.
He had done a lot to stop the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda, that claims a lot of aspects about Macedonian Nation to be Bulgarian.
These views do not exists in reality. These views are coming from the 19th century Romantic movement of the new Balkan nations, like Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece. After they got independent from the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, and Macedonia being under the Ottoman rule until early 20th century, all of these neighboring nations had assimilation policies towards the people living in Macedonia. The fruit of this policies were the first and second Balkan Wars when the territory of Macedonia was taken over from the Ottoman Empire and divided between these neighboring countries. And according to the new rulers of these territories, they were inhabited by Serbs, Bulgarians and Greeks.
Bulgaria got the smallest part, which was the reason for starting the Second Balkan War.
These policies truly belong to the past and should rest in peace there.

 Article Name Change (PROTECTION OF PAGE AND VOTING) 
Calling the film """"Cloverfield (creature)"""" seems to indicate that the creature is actually named Cloverfield. Seeing that there is no cite that I have seen confirming this, and, just as well, the first sentence of the article notes that the being is """"unidentified,"""" I personally don't see why this article is named such. Shouldn't the article's title be changed? I think it should be called """"Cloverfield Monster,"""" without the parenthesis. Is this fact... 
Don't like """"Cloverfield Monster,"""" but I have been wondering if we shouldn't move it to something like """"Creature (Cloverfield)"""" or """"Monster (Cloverfield)"""".  Nither of those are particularly good, either.  The problem is that given that the thing doesn't appear to have any proper name, there's really no perfect place for the article to go right now.  Using a generic noun with (Cloverfield) after it seems to have the appropriate vagueness.  The producers tend to refer to it as 'creature', but most third-party sources are calling it a 'monster.'  We may as well flip a coin, really.  
I should also add that I don't hate where the article is now, either, though.  Like I said, naming an article on something that doesn't have a name is frustrating.    | Talk 
The movie's opening """"titles"""" say """"US DOD... Multiple sightings of case designate """"Cloverfield"""""""". Best we can go with. '  
I believe that refers to the case itself or the code name of the camera, not the monster.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 65.34.244.213   
This has already be discussed in previous sections of the talk.  It seems the general concensous is, no it isn't an ideal title, but since we have nothing better, there isn't sufficient motivation to move it.  """"Cloverfield monster"""" is certainly a likely candidate, but without an extremely reliable source, such as an official designation from the creative property holder, we may as well leave it where it is until such a source comes into existence.  A sequel looks rather undoubtable, and I should think chances are pretty good it will get a name within the fictional universe then. -  
I think """"Cloverfield (creature)"""" seems fine.  Hello all,
The citation provided in the intro which apparently backs up the (not so fact) fact of Matt Reeves stating it is the name of the creature is not mentioned in the citation at all. He only explains why it is the title of the movie, it was a codename named after a Paramount property which stuck with the project, There were other codenames such as Slusho and Bertha.

However my point is not this, but the fact that the name of the creature is not Cloverfield but in fact the name of the military operation assigned to tackle the creature, as the film stated itself """"Case designated Cloverfield"""", ha, not only this but the director itself has stated it is applied to the military operation, if you would be so kind to read the [2] citation in the intro I have provided. Hows that for an official designation from the creative property holder. Now good day to all, and this is why the article should be The Cloverfield creature. '  

I also question the quality of the source given, but that is discussed below.  I don't feel The Cloverfield creature is an appropriate title for this article either.  For one thing, there are two """"creatures"""" in cloverfield, the main creature, and the parasites, both of which are discussed in this article.  For another thing, it sounds too official.  """"The Cloverfield creature"""" is not it's official name either.  I think it is much better to just leave it as Cloverfield_(creature) and wait for more sources.  Eventually the creature will get a name, and at that point the page will just have to move again, so I'd like to see a stronger argument for why your name choice, or any other, is optimal and signifigantly better than it's original name. -[[Use",0

Regarding the writer at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_salute
    Mr Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is """"covered up"""" by people and also people often refer to it as the """"Nazi-Soviet"""" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as """"Nazis"""" (they did not refer to themselves as """"Nazis"""").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as """"It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!""""  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word """"Nazi"""" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the Nazi-Soviet pact page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase """"National Socialist."""" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment """"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!""""   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name """"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"""" and also used the term """"Communist"""" instead of using the term """"Socialist.""""  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether the salutes dictated particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide including in Germany. 

    Yes, the """"Roman salute"""" page did once contain innaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to start going on with his use of the term """"conspiracy."""" It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.  

    The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who """"became wiser"""", by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.  Dr. Curry has also publicly challenged Martin Winkler to debate these issues.  Professor Curry's discovery that the swastika/hakenkreuz, although an ancient symbol, was sometimes used by the National Socialist German Workers' Party as """"S"""" shapes standing for its """"Socialism"""" is also his own original work. And he is right that other writers have deliberately covered up the discovery (as the writer above admits) and have excluded it from the Swa",0
"""::::::""""Forthcoming book

A trio of LDS scholars have been funded by the LDS church to write a book, Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, to be published by the Oxford University Press:

Ronald W. Walker (BYU Professor of History), 
Richard E. Turley Jr. (managing director of the Family and Church History Department of the Church), and Glen M. Leonard (director of the Church's Museum of Church History and Art). 

The three were granted access to documents in the LDS Church archives. According to Turley, a file in the archives confirms that Lee was acting on his own. The file included the notes of a Mormon historian who, at the request of Church leaders, conducted a confidential investigation of the massacre in 1892. Turley said, """"There are very candid statements on the part of participants to a Church official under the agreement of confidentiality.""""

While the trio found additional evidence of church leaders' culpability, Turley stated that """"Utahns elsewhere in the territory acted to preserve the lives of other troublesome immigrants . . . Unfortunately, the militia and church leaders of Iron County made different decisions, and their acts demand the strongest condemnation . . . Circumstance may explain their acts; nothing can justify them.""""

The new sources the co-authors are using will be made public once their book is published. Turley said although the church is cooperating and is funding the research, the work is """"not a Church commission""""; """"The idea to do the book was ours, not theirs."""" Publication apparently has been delayed as the co-authors have tried to be as thorough in their research as possible. According to Turley, LDS leaders share the authors' desire to bring all available evidence out in the open. First drafts of the book will be circulated for comment among LDS and non-LDS parties, including historians and descendants of the perpetrators and victims. """"Open, candid evaluation of that tragedy can produce catharsis, a cleansing spiritual renewal and healing,"""" Turley said, adding that the authors will """"present the evidence as we find it - honestly, openly and candidly.""""

Whatever one calls it ...

ALL energy available to man other than nuclear (fission or fusion, fission includes geothermal) ultimately derives from the sun, currently or in the (distant) past.  Solar energy from the distant past became stored in fossil fuels and is utilized by man via one or another technique of mining followed usually by combustion.  

That energy which is NOT so stored and which can be obtained without mining its source  that is, in more or less real time, used roughly at the same rate as it becomes available  is the subject of this article.

This page needs to be edited down to a handful of sentences and then merged with Nose, if not altogether deleted, due to the fact that it is merely a slang term with denotions of eugenics and discredited pseudosciences such as phrenology.  The author(s) included a long paragraph by a discredited 19th century scientist named Samual George Morton, of which only five words (""""the nose large and aquiline"""") pertain to the article itself. As Wikipedia's own article on Morton says, and as most medical/science students are taught, Samuel George Morton is often thought of as the originator of """"American School"""" ethnography, a school of thought in antebellum American science that claimed the difference between humans was one of species rather than variety and is generally seen as the origin of scientific racism.
The paragraphs in this article are drawn out to unnecessary lengths so as to provide the appearance of substance; particularly the Buddhism one, which uses 53 words to say that statues of Buddha should have long noses. No reference is given.
So-called hooknose snakes have upturned """"noses,"""" not downturned """"noses"""" as raptors do, thus meaning they don't even have hooknoses as the author of this article describes, thus making their inclusion truly puzzling.  I use quotation marks because neither snakes nor birds even have noses in the sense of the ones humans/primates have. Snakes """"smell"""" by using their tongues and the Vomeronasal organ inside their mouths; a snake's """"nostril"""" holes are used only for breathing. Some venomous types use their additional larger """"nostrils"""" (actually glands called pits) to sense heat, not odors.
The fact that such noteworthy intellectuals as Ashlee Simpson and Paris Hilton have recently had rhinoplasties does not even mean that they had, or have, so-called """"hooknoses."""" Nor does the fact that a fictitious half-man/half-ungulate creature living under a bridge in Kentucky supposedly has one, though Wiki's article on it makes no mention of a hooknose, nor has it of course ever been photographed. It bears pointing out that factors allowing the genetic merging of ungulate and human DNA apparently intrigue the pseudoscience-oriented author(s) of this hooknose article. 
Overall, no tangible factors make the term """"hooknose"""" worthy of its own entry in a fact-based 21st century encyclopedia, other than as a disambiguation page redirecting to an entry such as Pseudoscience.  This is a textbook example of an unneccessary article manufactured out of several disparate and unrelated sources by using a smoke and mirrors technique.  Why not just merge it into Nose and let real scientists/doctors hash it out, rather than secluding it in its own peripheral entry based on pop culture/hearsay/non-science?  Hooknoses are an """"I know it when I see it"""" type of thing, with no set way of being measured.  If it were quantifiable by a certain mathematical formula, then it would possibly qualify for inclusion here.  (For example, if a nose is downturned by an angle of precicely x degrees or more in relation to its main slope.)  But no such formula exists.  It is a purely arbitrary, colloquial term, with a different definition to everyone.  For example, everyone has a different definition of """"fat,"""" but there is a medical definition of obesity, calculated using a Body mass index formula.   There is no such formula for noses.  Additionally, the link given to www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620b.htm does not count as a reliable source, as it is a religious, non-scientific organization making dubious and unreferenced claims.

First, trying to pull """"rank"""" with me, is not an effective way to be persusive with me or to appear as an ally or friendly. Second, you have misread my statement and missed my major point about vagina and penis. The point is that the article itself explans that a vaginoplasty is surgery to create a vagina. It is therefore obvious that any photographs of surgery in and around a penis or vagina will contain such things in the photograph. I believe that is is entirely appropriate to set the example that photographs of genitalia in medical and educational contexts are appropriate for all audiences. I believe that the precedent should be set that the penis and the vagina or more accurately in most cases the vulva should not be given special attention in medical contexts. To do so, gives the misimpression that there is something """"wrong"""" with human genitalia, which is a falsehood, and an antedeluvian cultural bias whose primitive nature should be abolished. In this century and millenium, is it time for such puritanical prudishness to end. One of the best ironies of discussions about such """"warnings"""" around medical photos is that they primarily serve to heighten the existence and nature of the photographs, and probably invite more study of them than might otherwise occur. In other words, they have the opposite of their intended purpose. The tend to draw more attention to such material, than might otherwise occur, while the tacit intention of people who want to put similarly silly warnings about such material is to """"hide"""" them and be bashful around them. It is high time that humans grow up and get over this silly aversions to the site of human genitalia. The wikipedia should be a place that sets an appropriate standard that medical information should be free from the psuedo censorship that such """"warnings"""" represent. On another note, on the basis of WP:V, a large portion of the wikipedia would be candidate for deletion. I believe such mention constitutes evidence that this article is being given unfair over-attention by a tacit faction whose true purpose is to censor subjects like the sort to which Toby Meltzer and its """"Good Article"""" subject matter relates.

 Pullback of Sections vs. Pullback of Bundles 

Actually, there is a subtle point that this article gets wrong, and in fact many books get wrong (or fail to emphasize, although I believe it's because everyone learns it this way). Yes, I know that if it is wrong, I could just update it myself; but it looks like this will require a bit of rearrangement which I'm not quite in the mood to sort out now, and so it is best for me to give a brief statement of the issue here. It's also way past my bedtime, so, if anyone wants to help out while I'm sleeping, be my guest.

The problem is a terminological confusion which arises from using the term pullback for different (but related) things. For f  M → N a smooth map, there is usually not a smooth bundle map from T*N to T*M (unless f is a diffeomorphism). There is a pointwise map of individual cotangent spaces f*p  Tf(p) N → Tp M for every p, defined by operation with the pushforward of a vector in the corresponding tangent space (it is the transpose of the pushfoward on individual tangent spaces). But for the general point q in N we can't pull back to M unless we have a way of choosing a point in f-1(q) (which is especially problematic if f is not onto...). However, we can pull back sections of the cotangent bundle (i.e. covector field, and this applies in general to covariant tensor fields). The """"pullback"""" everyone talks about is a map from covector fields on N to covector fields on M, that is, given ω: N → T*N a section, we define f*ω  M → T*M  by

where f*p is just the pointwise pullback defined before. This is always well-defined. Note that this is just the opposite of the problem with vectors and their fields (and in general, contravariant tensor fields): in that case, there is a pushforward which is a smooth bundle map of the tangent bundles, but in general vector field does not push forward unless the map is a diffeomorphism. It has been remarked in several books that the co-objects seem to have this wonderful extra structure, of being able to pull back sections. What really happened is that it gave up the capability to induce a smooth bundle map of the bundles in the process, thus restoring one aspect of """"duality"""" that seems to have been broken when dealing with this subject.""",0

It isn't a theory. A theory is a scientifically acceptable body of principles that explain phenomena in a reasonable manner. People can read alternative views in thousands of blogs, pseudoscience pieces (books, movies, internet). They have no place in an encyclopedia that relies on reliable, verifiable sources. Cheers   

Your definition is incorrect. Einsteins theory of relativity wasn't accepted at all when he presented it, but it was still a quite valid theory. History is full of people rejected by people with your attitude...   

To be quite honest, were not as stupid as people back in the 15th century. We can actually prove these things with exploration and tests. They couldn't. The world CANNOT explode as a result of Global Warming. Its alot tougher than all these enviromentalists give it credit for, however we can't. It would take some extreme heat to cause any harm to the planet. Just because CO2 levels are at there highest in 20 odd million years doesn't mean the earths getting hotter. It means that we're making CO2. Before, there was nothing to add more CO2 to the atmosphere. Now theres us, and the increase is small but its still the highest in 20 million years. Unless we find a way to turn the air into a thick layer of greenhouse gases, the earth will never heat up more than 10 or so degrees, no matter how long you wait.

"""Well, I am not trying to pick a fight ) but I have NPOV issues with this article.  It reads  at the moment  like a celebration of scientific progress.  I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project.  Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.

One way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.  I'd hope a good article on """"the history of science"""" would inform me of these issues, and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.

I am no expert on this but I really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of, say, Thomas Kuhn and Bruno Latour, could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously, as well as the claims of those with opposing views.

I have reverted your edits to these two articles. Please review WP:V to learn about appropriate, reliable sources for the information you keep adding, and also visit WP:LIBEL and WP:BLP to learn about appropriate information in biographical articles of living people. Insinuating that these two individuals are having an affair or are anything other than faithful to their respective significant others is libelous, and against Wikipedia policy. You have not provided a reliable source to support the POV suggested by your edits. WP:NPOV will help you learn about Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.

The quotes you have added are taken out of contexttheir mentions of a """"crush"""" on each other were done in a joking manner, and another cast member followed their comments by saying she had a crush on both of thembut that's not grounds for speculating that the cast member in question is having an affair with both of them, and if I said or insinuated that she were, that would be libel. These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other, and frankly, good public relations by supporting their on-screen chemistry and by extension, that of the fictional characters they play. Many other cast members have complimented their co-stars, including PD and EP, but no reliable source has, to my knowledge, ever published information that these two (or any other cast members) were anything other than co-stars who happen to be friends. On the contrary, both speak frequently of their significant others in high esteem (in print and on camera), and speak well of each other's partners. There's also a question of whether such compliments are even relevant in the grand scheme of the article, but that's a moot point because your edits are unsourced, and against the WP:LIBEL policy.  If you have a reliable source for your edits, in accord with WP:Verifiability, then it's a different story, but as it is, your edits are potentially libelous and not in accord with Wikipedia editing policy.

""""BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) — Moammar Gadhafi loyalists seized control of a Libyan city and raised the ousted regime's green flag, an official and military commanders said Tuesday, in the most serious revolt yet against the country's government.

The retaking of Bani Walid highlights the vulnerability of Libya's new leaders, who have faced mounting criticism as they struggle to unify the oil-rich North African nations and build state institutions from scratch three months after Gadhafi was captured and killed.

The seizure also appeared to be the first major, organized operation by armed remnants of Gadhafi's regime, adding to the security woes of the ruling National Transitional Council. The council has so far made little progress in unifying armed forces. Instead it is left reliant on multiple """"revolutionary brigades,"""" militias made up of citizens-turned-fighters, usually all from a specific city or even neighborhood.

The militias were created during the months of civil war against Gadhafi's forces last year and when the war ended in October, the various brigades remain in control of security affairs of each city they liberated. Though loyal to the NTC, they have also feuded among themselves and acted on their own initiative, and the council has been unable to control them.

Hundreds of well-equipped and highly trained remnants of Gadhafi's forces battled for eight hours in Bani Walid with the local revolutionary brigade, known as the May 28 Brigade, which was eventually driven out, said Mubarak al-Fatmani, the head of Bani Walid local council. The Gadhafi loyalists then raised the green flag over buildings in the western city.

On Monday's attack, he said four revolutionary fighters were killed and 25 others were wounded.

The revolutionary brigade had kept only a superficial control over the mountain city, a longtime Gadhafi stronghold which was one of the last to fall to NTC rule late last year.""""The only link between Bani Walid and the revolution was May 28, now it is gone and 99 percent of Bani Walid people are Gadhafi loyalists,"""" said the head of Bani Walid's military council, Abdullah al-Khazmi, confirming the fall of the city. He spoke to The Associated Press at a position on the eastern outskirts of Bani Walid, where hundreds of pro-NTC reinforcements from Benghazi were deployed, with convoys of cars mounted with machine guns.

A top commander of a revolutionary brigade in Bani Walid, Ali al-Fatmani, who was present in Benghazi during the attack, says he has lost contact with other fighters in the town.The three officials said the attackers belong to Brigade 93, a militia newly created by Gadhafi loyalists who reassembled after the fall of the regime. The fighters, flush with cash and heavy weaponry including incendiary bombs, have been increasing in power in the city, they said.

'''A month ago, Gadhafi loyalists attacked another revolutionary brigade from Tripoli that entered Bani Walid, killing 13, said al-Fatmani.""""

Nothing to do with exotic physics, everything to do with experimental error due to unforeseen effect of evaporation, i.e. ablation (though some moisture might play an effect, especially if there are parts other than metal; this is, in my opinion, the most likely explanation - EM radiation cannot cause such effect at these power/force ratios (that part was also removed from the article, though all was sourced). So, if there is no some weird effect (and QED effects, virtual plasma included, boil down to EM radiation reaction, there is no violation of impulse conservation there, so that is excluded too), it should be reaction from some loss of mass - and evaporation is an obvious source. However, they did not check for that. Also, some of experiments were done in atmosphere (at atmospheric pressure, even in chamber?! according to brief paper), so other possibility is interaction with heated air. However, in vacuum, ablation seems to be most likely explanation. Why all this sourced material and all criticism was removed, beats me. 213.198.221.171",0

I rechecked the source, and see that the Saxony section is definitely separate from the Austria section.

 Terminology for this article 

Reading various Wikipedia articles, it's apparent that Wikipedia is as about as muddled in terminology as the literature is. I am clear on a concept, which Chandrasekhar calls """"specific intensity"""", which fully characterizes the radiation field in a medium, without physical surfaces.  is the energy passing thru an area element dA into a small solid angle  about the normal to the area element in a small frequency band  in a small time interval dt. It has SI units of watts/meter^2/sr/hz. Apparently many people refer to this as """"radiance"""". Can we please settle on a term for this concept, and use it consistently? 

Next is the question of a physical surface. What is the term that fully characterizes the radiation coming out of a physical surface element that corresponds to """"specific intensity"""", but is only specified for radiation out of the surface, and is undefined into the surface? It cannot have the same name, because its only like, half of the specific intensity. How do we describe the fact that this radiation is independent of direction, as long as that direction is out of the physical surface?

These are questions that need to be settled on before we can write a decent article. In my mind, I use the terms """"specific intensity"""" or """"spectral intensity"""" for the first paragraph above, and """"radiance"""" for the second, but I don't care what names are used, as long as they are precisely defined and a case can be made that it is a common definition.

Band members
I removed the list of band members from the main text as the information appears twice in other parts of the article, firstly in the Infobox and then in a table of """"Rocket from the Crypt lineups"""". I now see that my edit has been undone with the explanation that """"the members list is useful as it provides more information about real names and instruments, etc. than the other sections. the purpose of the lineups table is to show a chronology of change & releases"""". I dispute this.

If you want to include real names then put them in the Infobox, and the instruments played already appear in the lineups table. I think having the same information in the article in various different places is clumsy and adds nothing to our knowledge of the band. Plus, having the table justified to the right and the band listing justified to the left in the same section just looks plain awful and makes the whole article so much harder to read. 

I'm inclined to revert to my original edit but that seems a little petty. I'd much rather see what other users think before taking further action. So does anyone else have an opinion...?    """,0

Well, I left for two days anyway, and I see no reason to dredge up a closed thread.  

I will say that the whole point of the thread (as Calton indicated) was to not have to get involved in it myself, and there was also really no need for an IP which displayed disruptive behavior in the past to get involved.  IPs are nice to hide behind, and I will bet money on the fact that it's been the same person all along (which is where my remarks came from).  I'm happy to admit a mistake when I make one, but this was not a mistake.  I will stand behind everything I said, based on the following line of reasoning:  a static IP is often tied to the same computer in an office (MHEC, the IP location, is not a school, it's a governing authority for the state schools in Massachusetts, so it has an office and an .edu address, but not a campus of 50 million people using a computer in the library).  The chances of two different people on the same IP (meaning at the same computer) knowing enough of Wiki internals to: go poking around ANI, try to run for ArbCom, request a block for an admin, and then have troll unblock requests (""""hello"""" is not a spurious unblock request, really?), is just too small for my liking.  I'm sorry if I'm not going to AGF that, but I cannot suspend my disbelief that far, and I got hammered for it.  

I neither expect nor require an apology, but I do want it to be known that something important was missed in that thread, and that IP's going to be a problem until someone takes care of it.   """,0
"""== Macedonians/Macedonian Slavs ==

I was under impression that the name of the article would change to a compromising variant: Macedonians (nation), Macedonians (nationality), Macedonians (people) or whatever since the resources shown clearly point that Macedonian Slavs is rather inappropriate. I'm glad the whole poll thing is over, but what is the overall conclusion: 

1. the naming committee will discuss on the matter of Macedonians/Macedonian Slavs name
2. Macedonian Slavs stays until another poll is organized or
3. a status quo for an indefinite period of time?

Since you seem to be the only neutral admin actively engaged in this debate, it seem to me that you are the right person to ask these questions....  02:49, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

If a poll doesn't reach a decision, the poll is treated as moot and the status quo is continued. I agree that the name """"Macedonian Slavs"""" is inappropriate (and many of the arguments made against using it were blatantly POV). The problem is that right now we don't have a mechanism for ensuring that the name is decided objectively. I'll have a chat with the other admins to see if anything can be done in the short term (bear in mind that the naming committee is just a proposal, it's not been endorsed yet).   11:43, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)
 I would like you to know that I appreciate your active involvement in the Macedonians/Macedonian Slavs issue, because if it is left to polls to decide such delicate matters, Wikipedia would soon degenerate. The English Wikipedia, and its mirror sites are the most important generators of the Macedonian Slavs term on the net - , which is much unfortunate, because it makes the term more """"common"""" than it actually is. There was a brief period of some """"Macedonian Slavs"""" references in BBC or CNN's news articles (the first half of 2001), but they have withdrawn the term very soon. The naming committee is a good idea to resolve matters of this type, since the naming of the article itself is a specific NPOV question - the different POV's can hardly be """"described"""" in it. I don't want to leave the impression that I'm trying to put a pressure on you, but please resolve this dispute in a reasonable period of time (that is, don't forget about it -)). Thanks again for your contributions.  17:04, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Just remember that we need to figure out what is neutral, not what is objectively correct. A committee which """"votes"""" on what is """"objectively correct"""" will not get """"endorsed"""". This is the kind of thing which probably cannot be decided by a committee. See Wikipedia:naming conflict.  (talk) 10:41, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)

I didn't say we should decide what is correct, merely what the common usage is. What I'm arguing against is the use of arguments such as """"they don't have a right to use this name"""", which is what's been happening so far. BTW, the link you provided doesn't work - could you point me to the right place?   10:45, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

"It is interesting to ponder where this transition occurs between a siphon that relies on cohesion and one that has only repulsion. To a first approximation, ignoring drag effects, if you take a siphon that is operating in vacuum and start lowering it into the atmosphere, the liquid in the tube above the lower reservoir will be in compression and without tension if its height above the surface of its reservoir is less than the barometric height at that ambient pressure. The liquid above the barometric height will be in tension. Thus a siphon at low pressures or an extremely tall siphon, could be operating with BOTH the chain model AND the atmospheric model at the same time! But as the barometric height exceeds the crest of the siphon, as is typical in practical siphons, there would be no more tension, and the chain model would no longer apply.",0

There is a reference to the main website which backs up what the article is about. What other references would you suggest? There has been no books on the subject, as of yet no media coverage, although that will be coming in the next show season. I am now at a loss as to what other reference apart from the website can be used.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Please review the  guidelines for notability of websites help page.  You will note that your article, unfortunately, could have been declined for more than one reason - I chose to refer to the lack of independent references which also means the subject is not """"notable"""" as that term is defined by Wikipedia.  I have no doubt the webcite is helpful to its users but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a web directory.  At the help page you will read that if, as you have indicated, there has been no significant media or other independent coverage related to the cite then the cite is not """"notable"""" as defined by Wikipedia and cannot be the subject of a Wikipedia article.  

The guideline reads (in part): 

In the dictionary, notable means """"worthy of being noted"""" or """"attracting notice."""" Wikipedia bases its decision about whether web content is notable enough to justify a separate article on the verifiable evidence that the web content has attracted the notice of reliable sources unrelated to the web content, its authors, or its owners. Notability requires only that these necessary sources exist, not that the sources have already been named in the article.

""""Notable"""" is not synonymous with """"fame"""" or """"importance,"""" and even web content that editors personally believe are """"important"""" or """"famous"""" are only accepted as notable if they can be shown to have attracted notice. No web content is exempt from this requirement, no matter what kind of content it is. If the individual web content has received no or very little notice from independent sources, then it is not notable simply because other web content of its type are commonly notable or merely because it exists (see """"If it's not notable"""", below).

I hope, after reviewing this guide, you will understand why I was unable to accept your article. However, if you feel I was wrong and your article meets the criteria for notability of a website, you may wish to access the Dispute Resolution Notice Board to discuss the issue or seek a  Third Party Opinion from another experienced reviewer who may well take a different view.

 More on changes made to """"Early Soviet Rule and World War II section"""" 

I will not respond to the personal attack directed at """"the person who simply reverted this passage..."""". As for the substance of the issue:

1. Reasons of Capital move to Kharkov. ProhibitOnions introduced to the article an idea that one of the reasons of the capital move was the fact Kharkov's was more dominated by ethnic Russians than Kiev. This claim has some logic in the context of the events, but I have not seen this claim made in any serious source. If this is due to my ignorance, I suggest ProhibitOnions provides at least some references, or, if he can't find them off hand, at least gives some hints where he saw this info, so that it can be checked. His statement on the talk page that """"many historians concede"""" on this is too vague of a reference. If this is indeed his own speculation based on his interpretation of the logic of events, this qualifies as original research, whose place is current scholary or popular publications, personal web-sites, etc., but not an encyclopedia, which should reflect an established knowledge.

2. Possible role of famine in the capital return to Kiev.  PO agrees, that the discussion of the issue belongs to other articles but thinks, it is also relevant here. My point is that this info is factually accurate, but its relevance is too remote. Deliberate killing milions of people was a horrible crime, but Kiev itself, unlike the vast regions of Ukrainian countryside, was not ravaged by famine. Should the info on the deliberate famine caused by the actions of the Bolshevik government be introduced into every article related to any Ukrainian topic? If PO helps me understand why famine should be in Kiev article, I am open to ideas. 

3. Finally, PO removed from the article the statement that Kiev growth was mostly caused by migration from other parts of Ukraine which indeed re-established Ukrainian spirit in the city, which is confirmed, for example, by a relative rise of Ukrainian theater and literature in Kiev at the time. He substituted it by the statement about """"the migration from other parts of the Soviet Union."""" Where does he get this info?

The changes he introduced seem ideological rather that relevant and I reverted them once. Now, I laid out my reasons and will wait for some days for comments rather than reverting this changes right now. Please, no flames.  19:00, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)""",0

Bias
I was about to remove the last 5 paragraphs of the section """"2005"""" and replace it with the paragraph by Mark83 in his last edit. Those paragraphs look more than a little biased, and what's more, some facts are inaccurate, as well. But then, looking at other parts of the article, I find that it has been modified in other places too, recently, and the writing style makes it look like something written by a fan. So I haven't deleted the last paragraphs as I was about to, and am instead awaiting a discussion on the whole article.

Below are factual inaccuracies (apart from the general bias) I've noticed in the last 5 paragraphs of the section """"2005.""""

""""In comparison to Räikkönen, Alonso had made significantly fewer driving errors than his rival (just one in Canada) and has been a model of consistency finishing in the top three more times than Räikkönen.""""

My memory isn't the best, but of the races in just the latter half, I distinctly remember Alonso making mistakes in qualifying in Hungary and Hockenheim. Raikkonen wasn't prone to many mistakes, either.

""""Alonso was not only the fastest driver in qualifying but also matched the McLaren MP4-20’s speed, running with relatively the same amounts of fuel on board.""""

This is just speculation, isn't it? Since the Safety Car came on before the frontrunners had made their pitstops (not to forget Montoya retiring due to the drain cover incident), there is no way of verifying such a claim, other than believing press releases by the teams concerned, which are not exactly models of unbiased reporting - especially given that throughout most of the season, McLaren were shown to be qualifying with much more fuel on board than Renault.

"""Actually, I became interested in editing this very short article (amid Wikipedia's invitation for us to participate in the survey, ending November 3), when all newspapers were flooded with Burlesque King. Nograles was forced to run naked in the hotel. Now, I was not a Wikipedian then, but, when, the landmark acquittal suit was published, I took time to edit this tersely. Nograles placed 2nd to my 1975 counsel in civil case, Atty. Henry R. Villarica, 92.35% higher than Ferdinand Marcos' 92.35% trimmed from 99% due to Marcos blunder in political law subject, in an En Banc review of his test results, 1939. Villarica owns more than 100 pawnshops, and is a very close friend-business assoc. of my brother, in gold and (they have 41/2 ha. Sta. Maria, Bulacan) fighting cock farm. I don't know Ateneo Law School Nograles, but due to the bar rating 2nd place, he is so brilliant. Now, in my 6,500 edits, I happened to have seen and edited like this controversy in bios of USA Senators, etc. So, I just follow the Wikipedia pattern. The difference between Dante Tinga and Nograles, is that, the former was cleared by the Court, but, the Nograles issue of censoring publication by libel lawsuit vs. the naked running, was condemned after Court acquittal for lack of evidence. In Nograles, the acquittal is best Wikipedia evidence to go forth with the edit on Nograles bio-naked thing. Remember the Beatrix of the Netherlands IP address fiasco caught by Wiki scanner? On August 31, 2007, Queen Beatrix’s royal family affirmed that Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau, 38, and his wife Princess Mabel Wisse Smit edited the entry on Wikipedia which described Mabel’s relationship with slain drug baron Klaas Bruinsma (using the queen's palaces’ computer). The changes were found by Dutch media using Wiki Scanner - the entry which states Mabel provided """"incomplete and false information"""" about Bruinsma was changed to just """"incomplete information"""" in January 2006. My point is, in Tinga and Nograles, irrespective of Court acquittal or clearance, the publication of the bribe and Nog's U.P. Oblation run, respectively, with reliable sources, licenses us, editors, to add """"the thing."""" On short edits, I respect IT and other editors, since, it is a matter of style. If I were not a judge or lawyer, or if I were not an A.B. communication, editor, then, like IT and math editors, I would edit with a sentence or 2. But I keep my edits to 3 sentences for this reason: links die in time due to pay per view, and, scholars or readers of Wiki must be provided with a choice, to read more meats or essential ingredients. Also, the libel suit was filed by Nograles, et al. and the subject is the naked run. Now Nograles withdrew due to affidavit of desistance, but, the other complainant did not, and the Court decided based on trial's evidence. So, with more reasons must the edit be there and at the very least, even a sentence, but the essentials of the naked run ought to be there.
Final point. I do not personally know Tinga, but in 1978, I hired a lawyer of Santiago, Tinga, Fornier Law Office, to handle my simple Malolos case. Tinga became congressman and had been well known for this controversy, it is of judicial notice in IBP. Personally, I ignored these, until Douglas Anama, my text mate, the husband of Felipa Borlongan Anama, our Assistant Clerk of the Supreme Court (with the equivalent salary and rank of CA Justice) repeatedly approached me to consult dwarves, due to their case which Tinga decided against him, that's his family home. Tinga is not the only one who had these bribery things; Ynares-Santiago and M. Nazario (remember the Ramos notable contempt fine) shared the pie. My point is - the Court would instead put to rest the issue by fine or contempt. But for us editors, we just follow the pattern in USA bio of senators and public figures. Hence, my edit is well copy pasted from Wikipedia good articles on sub-section controversies. But of course, with all due respect to your edits. Sorry, for my TLDR, but it is so informative. Cheers.

 Legal Action 
Wikipedia has a policy. WP:NLT and I agree with it completely. However, they do add the following: 

If you must take legal action, we cannot prevent you from doing so. However, it is required that you do not edit Wikipedia until the legal matter has been resolved to ensure that all legal processes happen via proper legal channels. You should instead contact the person or people involved directly, by email or through any other contact methods the user provides.

That makes a lot of sense. So, please provide me with some contact so that I can contact you directly in order to iron this out. For me, you can contact me at john@johnclarkprose.com.

"""

Fair enough, mistakes happen. no problem ☺.
I am attempting to move this discussion to the talk page for the article in question, however, I will respond to the specific issues you seem to be having here.
You seem to be mincing terms (“view such fonts as Unicode” — reality is actually closer to the reverse of this statement), and (understandably) confusing very different subjects (characters, glyphs, fonts). I will try my best to address/explain what I assume to be the underlying issues (rather than just the symptoms).

The change I made to the article was nothing to do with fonts (that was only apparent to you specifically, the character exsited, and was likely downloaded sucessfully, but the font in use didn’t have a glyph to display it — the solution is simple: use a better font if you wish to see the glyph for the character). All I did was use the correct character (further discussion on the article talk page once I finish typing it).

Unicode is the standard character encoding these days, all others are now considered legacy. US-ASCII and ISO 8859-1 can both be treated/processed as UTF-8 (a character encoding for Unicode). Notable operating systems, and major applications in their entirity now use Unicode as their character encoding of choice, adding/allowing backwards-compatibility where needed (at least in good quality products/packages). This includes the majority of Microsoft products.
U+XXXX numbers are Unicode code points, an easy way to referrence specific characters without ambiguity, and need not concern the average person browsing the web.
Wikipedia pages are sent to you as UTF-8 (Unicode), so you’re ‘viewing them as Unicode’ anyway.
Fonts for US-ASCII/ISO 8859-1 are inter-changable in modern operating systems. The software with which you’re viewing this page is very likely written using Unicode character encoding (operating system & web browser).

Part of the reason for using the actual character natively in headings (on talk pages at least) was so that others could easily determine if their default system/browser configuration supported a more suitable range of characters, in order to be able to provide feedback about said character. It’s not like a missing glyph is causing an application failure (in which case I could understand your concerns).

Your claim that “My point is … about everybody else who can’t see the font correctly.” is seemingly baseless. Where is your evidence that anyone beyond yourself is having trouble seeing the glyph for this character? What about the people for whom the use of correct characters will help (those using speech-synthisis software)? If you can provide citation/evidence for this rather wild claim, I’d like to read it, otherwise I can’t help but feel you’re merely expressing your own wishes/preferrences/desires, dispite the other issues. What, beyond the issues you’ve encountered personally, are the reasons behind your disagreement with my changes? It seems that perhaps these articles are a little too close to your heart based on the nature and speed of your response(es) to the change.

“Article names here should be as simple as possible.” [emphasis; mine.]
No, article names should be as clear as possible, or as simple to comprehend/understand as possible, or provide for simplest readability. I suggest it may be worthwhile to read about the subject of usability (which is the dicipline concerned with making things easy to use).
Taking your argument further; should punctuation be removed too, as that would make titles much simpler, although less clear. Removing punctuation would mitigate the need to use percent-encoding in URLs, making MediaWiki itself simpler (although less flexible). I realise my example is counter-intuitive, but it was to emphasise the point that clarity, above all else is actually what’s important, not simplicity. A parallel example is user-interfaces; the most usable are not those which are simplest, but those which display the right information at the right time (clarity).

I’m familiar with how screen-readers function/operate. Not all ‘ride’ on top of the user’s browser. Blind people are not the only users of speech-synthisis software. 
Besides, you’re confusing the visual rendering of a charater (a glyph) with the character itself, and other representatinos/renderings of it (such as audio/speech). Modern screen-readers access the source-code of the page (the browser itself is just a vehicle to get to the desired page and/or aquire the source-code itself, along with the character encoding). So they’re given",0

(edit conflict).  I am very exasperated by the rant above.  I have really tried to respond to all of your points, Jugi, but I don't think you will be satisfied by any reply other than complete agreement.  I am sorry if I accused you of anything you have not done; I apologize.  

Let's go back to your sentence about the accuracy of MEMRI's translations.  I asked you to reproduce your refs on the talk page for the sake of clarity of discussion, but instead of helping me out by doing that you spend screen after screen berating me for not answering you.  OK, here they are:  

 ^ a b Mayor of London Press Release
 ^ a b c d Yigal Carmon Osama Bin Laden Tape Threatens U.S. States memri.org, 1 November 2004
 ^ a b Ramona Smith, """"Did Osama send election threat?,"""" Philadelphia Daily News (2 November 2004).
Carmon Whitaker email debate.  

OK, Let's discuss these refs: 
Livingston press release is unacceptable as a RS on this.  Livingston does not have any translation expertise in Arabic.  He is therefore not an acceptable cite on the accuracy of translation. 
You are using CArmon's own translation to say that MEMRI's translations are inaccurate?  That is quite bizarre.  
Ramona Smith-I don't know what more I can sy about this. She is talking about the binLaden tape.  I believe the only person she quote with any translation expertise is Cole.    Al-Jazeera, the most prominent Arabic news source iin the world translated the same way MEMRI did.  Juan Cole disputed the translation after the fact saying that binLaden was not using standard Arabic and also disputed their interpretation.  No one in the world excpet for binLaden knows what he meant to say in that tape.   This is not enough of an example to generalize from.  
Could you consider reproducing the part of the Whitaker piece that refers to the accuracy of translation here for discussion?  I have read those articles a fewtimes, and believe that Whitaker came up with one minor example.  

I also note that you keep inserting a Cole quote and his blog is not an acceptable source for this article.  

Finally, You want to use headings """"selectivity"""" and """"bias"""" and then place quotes under one or the other that contain sentences which contain both types of crits.  I split up some of the quotes so that the ideas of the critics would come under the appropriate headings.  You object to this and say your version is more """"well written"""".  I disagree.  I'm not sure what more to say about this.  

Elizmr, it does not help our conversation for you to refer to my statement to you as a """"rant"""". And it does not help our conversation for you to falsely accuse me of doing things I have not done (as you apologized for above), NOR to falsely accuse me of NOT doing things that I HAVE done (as you just did above). I DID provide references to my citations above in this talk page more than a week ago, but you never responded: See Here. I even made the links easy to use: simply click on them in the text I added.
Elizmr, lets discuss them in the order you cited. The first is a """"Mayor of London Press Release"""", published by the Greater London Authority City Hall and available on the london.gov.uk website. Do you claim that this is not a RS? Your objection that the Mayor of London (Livingstone) is not personally a certified translator is absurd: this press release is available from the City Hall in Arabic and other languages, so clearly he did not prepare this document personally, but with the help of a staff that spoke Arabic. Would you try to deny a statement by George Bush about Iran in a WP article because he is not personally trained to translate Persian? Your argument is just plain silly.
I am using Carmon's statement to prove to you that the Cole dispute was about translation, since you were questioning that above. MEMRI's president makes this statement: """"the U.S. media in general mistranslated the words"""". So clearly he considered this dispute to be about TRANSLATION.
Ramona Smith published her article about the Cole dispute in the Philadelphia Inquirer. Do you claim that this newspaper is not a RS? In her article she writes: """"That supposed warning to 'red states' was lost in muddled American translations released with the video last week, the Middle East Media Research Institute claimed. But translation problems or no, experts at a variety of prominent think tanks disagreed with the idea that bin Laden was preparing to sort out safe states from target states.""""

Dawkins mentioned """"the Jewish lobby"""". A few people have predictably seized upon the opportunity to call him anti-semitic, regardless of the evidence. Sure, it's a news story for a few days. But we are dealing with an encyclopedia article here. Does this little incident add anything meaningful to an understanding of the subject of the article?

The vote was on the Campbell Case but the primary reason was the Russian Treaties:

""""Baldwin was careful to emphasise that the Treaties were the substance of his objections.

He sees no alternative to a dissolution; it has always been expected, some wished for it before now, though he is opposed to hastening the Government's fall. ...' ... And it is true that only in the House of Commons were Baldwin's strictures based on the Campbell case – at Newcastle on 2 October he congratulated MacDonald on the agreement, achieved at a conference in London, on the Dawes Plan for reparations, and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the Labour party's subservience to its extremists, and tearing to pieces the Russian agreement. But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes, p. 273.

No, being an """"American film critic"""" is her defining characteristic, at least in terms of an encyclopedic entry.  If she had repeatedly proclaimed her Jewishness in her reviews, and had become famous as being a """"Jewish American film critic"""", then that would be important to note in the opening paragraph.  My point about the other critics was not that they are Jewish, but that whether or not they are Christian, Jewish, or otherwise is not even mentioned in the lead paragraphs of their articles.  Why should the Kael entry be any different?  Again, it is already mentioned in the article that her parents were Jewish, so its not like I'm attempting to keep something important from """"public display"""".- 

Of what relevance, is it then, that she is an """"American film critic""""? Since she doesn't deal only with American filims. This refers to her being an American. Why is that there? The plain and simple fact is that she is a Jew, religiously and ethnically. If it is so important that she not be labelled as such then we can just leave it out but let's make your rationale quite clear. -  

Well, the relevance of Kael being described as an """"American film critic"""" is because that is exactly why she is/was famous.  It is standard to discuss somebody's nationality in the lead paragraph of an encyclopedic entry, not their religious beliefs unless that was one of the defining characteristics of their fame.  And Kael was NOT famous for being a Jew, she was famous for being a film critic.  If she was a practicing Jew (and I have no idea if she was or not), she never discussed it in print (as far as I can recall) or in any interviews, and it didn't seem to be reflected in her critical POV.  Now, if she had repeatedly brought up her ethnicity/religion in her reviews as some kind of critical barometer, I could easily understand why somebody would feel compelled to describe Kael as a """"Jewish film critic"""".  But she didn't do that.  And again I direct your attention to any of the other film critic articles on wikipedia.  Is Roger Ebert a """"Christian film critic""""?  Andrew Sarris an """"atheist film critic""""?  Not according to wikipedia they're not.  (I'm using those two as examples...I don't know or care what, if any, religious background they may have).  And as I've previously pointed out, it  is already noted in the """"Biography"""" section of the article that her parents were Jewish.

Hey Koreans, who the fuck do you think you're dealing with. Guess what, Gaogouli was a Chinese vassal you stupid fucks.

Most Gaogouli descendants are Chinese.

With the sole exception of Ansi fort itself, Tang troops destroyed Gaogouli soldiers on the battlefield, despite being a significantly smaller force. If anything, Gaogouli only DEFENDED itself from assaults from Sui and Tang. Gaogouli was a mere Chinese vassal, nothing more. The greatest threat came from the TuBo, TuJue and HuiHe from the west.

"Where is the data for your claims on accidents?  It's hard to imagine that head-on crashes of stage coaches were common occurrences. Accidents in competitions involving horses are fairly common, but bad outcomes on simple trips to town from the herders' camp to town for grub would most likely have involved bandits and other such hazards. And another thing, at the time when horses were in common use for transportation, traffic density was much lower than at the present time.  Riding through a deserted Fairmont Park in Philadelphia, a rider on a horse going at a walking pace and a rider in a car doing the speed limit would both be quite safe. Riders galloping would at most risk falling off going at about 25 mph. Drivers speeding with an equal degree of recklessness might spin out on a curve at 75 mpg. Riders can wear helmets that protect against brain damage but not broken necks. Drivers can use seat belts, and racing drivers can use other protections, so it is a little difficult to know what is being compared to what.  Even so, the deadly injuries among non-competition horse accidents are almost all head injuries suffered by riders whose horses spook for some reason. (See Jessica Jahiel's website.) The commonest injuries would most likely be broken arms from riders who fall.  A car crash at even relatively low speeds can produce the same head injuries (which is why cars now have padded dash boards), and as speeds increase the probability of serious injuries to the head and trunk becomes much higher.

As for feces, true, horse manure is not too appealing to walk through with bare feet, and somebody needs to remove it from the road. On the other hand, it is not toxic the way lead is. Once removed from the road, it can be used to produce good compost.  Even if people just leave it on a country road, it soon packs down into a uniform brown soft and well-compacted mass. Leave a clump of horse manure on your front yard and it become fertilizer. Dump a cup of used engine oil on your yard and you have long-term contamination.",0

 Re: Discussions on fair use 
I wish I could point you to where these discussions are taking place. Except for WP:AN & it's mate WP:AN/I, & intermittently on the WikiEN-l mailling list, I don't know where this is being discussed. Maybe also at Wikipedia:Village Pump. And, IMHO, those fora appear to be full of people who are against fair use entirely, so they may not listen to an opposing voice. 

I find this whole campaign against any fair use materials discouraging  although sometimes I am too pessimistic about things, both related to Wikipedia or not. The rule  as long as I've contributed to Wikipedia  is that non-free materials may be used specifically to help identify its subjects. Examples would include the flag logo with Microsoft Windows, or the """"death star"""" logo with AT&T; (to name 2 US-centric ones). How else would one identify the Led Zeppelin album with the weird runes that some people label """"ZOZO""""? Beyond that, the rules become fuzzy very quickly (e.g., can one use a screencap to help identify significant commercials?), & I simply feel that those cases are not worth the effort to del with. (To give another example, I have a book or two that were published in the mid-1960s in Ethiopia  at which time, from what I've been able to determine, the country had no functional copyright law. We could have weeks & weeks of fun deciding those cases.)  Despite all of these qualifications (& rambling ;), I believe that there ought not to be such intolerance towards obviously justifiable fair-use cases.   """,0

I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles.

As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia.

The three-revert rule[edit]
Shortcut:
WP:3RR
Editors who engage in edit warring are liable to be BLOCKED from editing to prevent further disruption. While any edit warring may lead to sanctions, there is a bright-line rule called the three-revert rule (3RR), the violation of which often leads to a BLOCK.
The three-revert rule states:
An editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page—whether involving the same or different material—within a 24-hour period. An edit or a series of consecutive edits that undoes other editors' actions—whether in whole or in part—counts as a revert. Violations of the rule normally attract BLOCKS of at least 24 hours. Any appearance of gaming the system by reverting a fourth time just outside the 24-hour slot is likely to be treated as an edit-warring violation. See below for exemptions.
A """"page"""" means any page on Wikipedia, including talk and project space. A """"revert"""" means any edit (or administrative action) that reverses the actions of other editors, in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material. A series of consecutive saved revert edits by one user with no intervening edits by another user counts as one revert.
The three-revert rule applies per person, not per account; reverts made by multiple accounts operated by one editor count together. Editors violating 3RR will usually be BLOCKED for 24 hours for a first incident. Even without a 3RR violation, an administrator may still act if they believe a user's behavior constitutes edit warring, and any user may report edit warring with or without 3RR being breached. The rule is not an entitlement to revert a page a specific number of times.
If an editor violates 3RR by mistake, they should reverse their own most recent reversion. Administrators may take this into account and decide not to BLOCK in such cases—for example if the user is not a habitual edit warrior and is genuinely trying to rectify their own mistake.""""

Now, let's see, politically, who would be a closer match to Maryland and Delaware? Why, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island...

 Move to Marie Leczinska? 

Since English language obviously doesn't have its own name for this woman (Mary Leszczyńska?), Anglophone historians have to choose between Polish spelling - Maria Leszczyńska - and French spelling - Marie Leczinska. French language was, and still is, naturally closer to English than Polish, which is probably why most Anglophone historians choose Marie Leczinska. A quick Google Book Search confirms this: Maria Leszczyńska gets 96 """"English-language"""" results (though all I've seen are Polish books), while Marie Leczinska gets 808 English-langauge results.

Besides being closer to an Anglophone (for whom the article is written), the proposed title has another benefit: the lack of diacritics. """"Diacritics, especially Polish diacritics, make articles much more difficult to link to (it takes me about a minute to track down the proper letter and then copy/paste it), they interfere with proper alphabetization in category listings, are visually very intimidating to many English-speakers, cause confusion for pronounciation, and do not always display correctly on all web browsers.""""

Another posibility is Marie Leszczyńska; it is significantly more popular than Maria Leszczyńska (c. 400 hits), but Marie Leczinska is twice as popular as Marie Leszczyńska. Moreover, Marie Leszczyńska lacks the aforesaid benefit: it contains diacritics.

That being said, I informally propose moving the article to Marie Leczinska.   """,0

Filter 405
I have disabled it, sorry. The trigger was blocking edits of  (e.g. ). I have only briefly looked into the coding, and apparently the filter is simply blocking wikilinking by given IPs/users, i.e., it works accidentally, simply because the vandal happens to use a certain IP range and add wikilinks. I haven't thought about a better algorithm (particularly how to detect wlinking of common terms). A spontaneous idea is to target edits that add two wikilinks into one word, like [[pea]][[cock]], i.e. just filter addition of ]][[ - this should have a nearly 100% hit rate, but might be insufficient. Cheers.   
Do note that it is intended as a replacement for a rangeblock on a pretty active range, and the vandal's actions in the past have reached a level warranting a long-term rangeblock.

 When asked """"Are you an agnostic or an atheist?"""", Russell replied:
Agnostic, of course. Atheists are like Christians: That is, both dogmatically mantain that we can know whether or not there is a God. The Christian holds that God does exist; the atheist holds that God does not. But the agnostic knows that we simply do not possess sufficient grounds either to affirm or deny the existennce of a supreme being. So I believe that although the existence of God is not impossible, it is improbable. Quite improbable.

A more clarifying answer, as mentioned above, can be found in Am I An Atheist Or An Agnostic? (1947), where Russell states:


As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think that I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because, when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.

The text written here will appear on the Recent changes page, in the page revision history, on the diff page, and in the watchlists of users who are watching that article. See m:Help:Edit summary for full information on this feature.

When you leave the edit summary blank, some of your edits could be mistaken for vandalism and may be reverted, so please always briefly summarize your edits, especially when you are making subtle but important changes, like changing dates or numbers. Thank you.  

I do, when I'm doing anything more than grammar. The only exception to this would be on Clan Fraser of Lovat, of which I'm the only editor at present, and I didn't think to add edit summaries. Otherwise, I believe that I have done so. If you have any particular situations in which I have failed to do so, I'd be happy to explain myself; I'd much appreciate it.  
See it for yourself: Green bars are for edit summaries, red bars are for edits with no summaries.  
That's quite a nifty tool there. I'm fully aware of edit summaries. I don't provide edit summaries on my own talk page, or my User Page. I also don't usually provide them on other users' talk pages. In earlier editing, I didn't take the summary seriously; if you're referring to anything from several months ago or more, I do apologize. Like I said: if you have any particular situations where you believe I missed one, please bring them up to me. I would sincerely like to know. Otherwise, I don't see what you're trying to accomplish here.  
I think the link speaks for itself.  As for what I'm trying to accomplish, I think my original comment explained just that.  
If you were trying to just helpfully remind me, I thank you, though I don't think it was needed. I saw the page; it didn't say anything to me, except that I finally know my edit count. If you really want to get a point across to me, I suggest you do so blatantly. If your original comment explained your motives, then we are done here.  

 Your """"nonsense"""" page 

If you are interested in archiving your old talk, you may want to review Wikipedia:How to archive a talk page.  Accusing other editors of """"defacing"""" your talk page for politely reminding you of Wikipedia policies against personal attacks does not demonstrate good faith on your part, and will only make you look bad.  I suggest you move the archive to a more appropriate name like User talk:Canaen/archive1.  Furthermore, making negative comments about discussion by other editors, and claiming that their edits """"are not worth reading"""" shows that you aren't interested in abiding by  WP:NPA, WP:CIV, nor WP:EQ.  If you want to improve your working relationship with other editors, it might help to avoid incivility.  
I'm not interested in archiving my old talk as of yet, but thank you for the suggestion. I use """"nonsense"""" in a lot of ways other people do not, because I find a lot of other words to be boring at present. Likewise,  instead of """"cool,"""" or """"awesome,"""" or """"that's interesting,"""" I'm currently in the habit of referring to things as """"nifty."""" It's something I do. I know how to archive a talk page, I've done it before. I still do not consider suggesting ignorance to be a personal attack, because I've grown up in a rather intellectual atmosphere. I'm not going to change just because a few people are offended at my words. I thought that this was resolved by now. I have quite decent relationships with other working editors; it seems that a particular user and myself simply do not get along. It is regretful, but something which seems to be. If someone takes offence to my creation of a Nonsense page, they can bring it up to me personally, as you",0

 Bioresonance therapy and Scientology 

Hi there

Casting my mind back to January 2010, as evidenced in the diff. I think I wanted to make more precise a previous editor's mention of """"the E-Meter used by Scientology"""" in the Bioresonance therapy article - and so I found the citation which I added, and which as it stands appears to link Franz Morell (rather than bioresonance therapy itself) with Scientology. That """"factoid"""" might live more comfortably on a Wikipedia entry for Franz Morell, but no such article exists... though the article referenced: http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf does provide more detail. (The reference you gave to https://tools.wmflabs.org/cluebot/?page=View&id;=1909882 brings up only a blank page in my browser. If the referenced article http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf does indeed have methodological deficiencies, we can change our article to state that """"Franz Morell allegedly had links with Scientology'...)

A very rough translation of the cited article http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf - based loosely on the translation provided in Google Chrome, looks something like this:

November 14, 2003 III / Dr.HL-se 

Scientology and Bioresonance Therapy

Bioresonance Therapy includes the """"alternative"""" treatment of diseases such as allergies, eczema and asthma and in  """"alternative"""" dental treatment an ever broader space. 
Bioresonance therapy goes back to  an alleged discovery of the in the Year 1990 deceased Frankfurt Doctor and senior Scientologist Dr. Franz Morell. 
Dr. Morell had in the 70s of the 20th century the allegedly """"genius idea"""" of eliminating patients' harmful mood-swings by reflecting them .

[Footnote 1:  Dr. Eva Rasche in a """"MORA Patient information"""" document published by the F. Dermatological  health center Wadern Elvi Foss -  http://www.degezet.de/leistung.htm
] 

Together with his Stepson Erich Rasche, Morell developed in the year 1977 the so-called MORA-therapy and MORA gear necessary for the therapy. 
In just this period of time Dr. Franz Morell was a Scientology activist. 
So founded Dr. Franz Morell on the 12th June 1970 together with six other like-minded people in Frankfurt the Club """"College for Applied Philosophy e.V."""". 
According to the at-the-time built Statute, the Club should exclusively serve """"scientific and research-supporting ends"""" and organize 'Courses for the enhancement of consciousness by practical application of the philosophy of L. Ron Hubbard, known under the name Scientology"""". 
Appart from that,  Dr. Franz Morell co-operated in the year 1975 on the foundation of the Scientology Tranorganisation """"Narconon"""" in Frankfurt. 
Likewise in the Year 1975 was Dr. Franz Morell in the by the Stuttgart Scientology branch issued Magazine College No. 11 referred to as """"for years highly trained Scientologist"""". 
Dr. Franz Morell was, when he made public his method of treatment, since many years an active Scientologist, who openly held L. Ron Hubbard teaching and techniques as an appropriate basis for scientific and educational activity. 
Under the given conditions it appears not surprising that the idea of bioresonance therapy shows parallels to Scientology practices including: While supporters of  Bioresonance therapy believe appropriate equipment can catch harmful moodswings of people and by the generation of corresponding counter-vibrations can weaken or delete them, Scientologists see in so-called engrams a type of spiritual disruption fields, which with Scientology auditing with the help of the bioresonance devices - quite similar to the so-called E-Meter (electric meter) - can be tracked and deleted. 
The MORA-Gerät is still distributed by the Company Med-Tronic Trading Ltd. 
in  Friesenheim. 
Erich Rasche is Managing Director of the Company Med-Tronic. 
In view of the social and family Relations between Dr. Morell and Mr. Rasche one can hardly assume that the activities of the late Franz Morell for Scientology remained hidden to Mr. Rasche.  
The Term """"Bioresonanztherapie"""" was according to the Company Regumed Regulatory Medizintechnik GmbH in Gräfelfing coined by its own executive director Hans Brügemann. The firm Regumed Ltd. markets a therapeutic device comparable to the MORA-gear, called the BICOM-Gerät, which in the words of Hans Brügemann originated """"in collaboration with Dr. Morell"""". 
The two Managing Directors of the Company Regumed Ltd. - Hermione and Hans Brügemann - have been Scientologists for many",0

Leaving aside baseless, extremely speculative ACU/Army procurement bashing (given the amount of idiotically high-speed gear American soldiers have carried into combat over the last century you'd think people would stop bitching) and adressing your specific point about Multicam, you are basically saying that the only people in the military who ever use the pattern do not have photographs taken of them and never have been photographed wearing it.  This is a dubious assertion in the first place and serves as an excuse to insert uncited information into the article based on nothing more than internet scuttlebutt.  

Based on the photographs, """"sources"""" and so on provided, I can at this point conclude that SOCOM does not use Multicam in any substantive way.  Given the amount of fanboyism out there for the pattern I am confident that if real, non-airsoft special forces used it there would be a large number of photos out there.   """,0

Please sign posts, folks.  I'm sure the Jones link will be scrubbed.  That said, if you're looking for humor, I'd say it was hilarious when Rothschild claimed Jupiter was closer to the sun than earth.  It was also hilarious when Jones said """"Take me lord Rothschild, take me!"""" in immitation of a woman being impressed at Rothschilds self-given title of """"adventurer"""".  Also, Jones never accused David Mayer de Rothschild personally of being the head of a neo-feudal empire, he did however infer that his family was involved with such.  Rothschild repeatedly accused Jones of being an oil baron, which is absurd and ironic considering the Rothschild investments in big oil.  Anyway, if we're to believe David de Rothschild's book, then the solution to global warming is to wear sweaters, ride in electric geo metros packed like clown cars, and build straw houses.  If anyone can show me a Rothschild (of the actual European banking line) that doesn't live in a castle and instead lives in a straw house, I will actually waste money on this chap's silly, insulting book.  I wonder how many beautiful trees are now dead because David de Rothschild wanted to publish this book.  As for Rothschild's demeanor, of course he was somewhat calm, it's part of the training.  The best liars are always calm because they have gone to schools where that selling point technique is taught.  It's called public relations, and it only works on dullards in my opinion.

You really don't seem to have got the hang of WP:NPOV/FAQ policy, and are advised to follow it carefully. Oh, and blanking your talk page is your right but it isn't impressive. . , talk 

I blanked the page because there was a lot of unnecessary old stuff on it.  

I know the NPOV extremely well and I'm always fighting against the EXTREME POV of Evolutionists.  The stuff I changed on Flood Geology is an example of extreme evolutionary POV.  I changed it to reflect reality.  Problem is, most Eovlutionists are completely unable to see their own POV.  And most of the editors of Flood Geology are not geologists.  I am an undergrad paleontologist.

Stop edit warring please
Stop edit warring on Flood geology to insert fringe claims, or you will be blocked. Please read WP:3RR, too.  | talk .

This topic is about a fringe belief so it ought to accurately reflect what flood geologists actually say.  But it is nonsense and full of misinformation and outright lies.  Not one of the editors defending the Evolutionary faith are geologists.  They just keep repeating the same nonsense debunked by creationists ages ago.     
The topic is about a fringe belief, so it ought to be written from a fringe point of view..? No, that's a mistake. For the amount of attention, and kind of attention, that is appropriate to what creationists have or have not """"debunked"""", see WP:UNDUE. Try to take Wikipedia policies on board, or you will find yourself blocked.  | talk .
I didn't say """"written from a fringe POV"""" I said it should reflect what flood geologists actually say, not what enemies says they say.  There is a big difference.  If critics wish to comment on what flood geologists actually say, fine.  But at least the actual position of flood geologists should be accurately presented.  As written, the page is deeply flawed and pushes a single POV.  The problem is that most evolutionists are totally ignorant of and blind to their POV pushing.  They actually think that they have no bias!! I am very familiar with WP policies, which I why I'm trying to get fair hearing instead of the deeply biased presentations currently on WP.     
You're misrepresenting your edits.The reason I warn you against edit warring is that you have recently reverted three times, within a short period of time, to insert one and the same change to the article: from """"This was interpreted as being the result of massive flooding, though it is now known that they are the product of ice age glaciations (an unknown phenomenon at that time)"""" to """"This was interpreted as being the result of massive flooding, though it is now interpreted as the product of ice age glaciations (an unknown phenomenon at that time)."""" And you say that change is about """"the actual position of flood geologists""""? No it isn't. You're changing, over and over, the description of the position of mainstream science. That's the exact opposite of what you claim to be doing. If you're """"very familiar with WP policies"""", I have to suppose you simply don't like them. I'm afraid I'm going to enforce them just the same: don't edit war any more, on this or any other article, or I will block you.  | talk .
And you honestly don't see the POV in """"known"""" versus """"interpreted""""?  Good grief.  You could say """"generally interpreted"""", """"almost always interepreted"""" or possibly someting like """"the current consensus is that it is"""" and they would all probably be acceptable.  Consensus is an opinion.  Present it as fact and you are pushing POV.  Unfortunately majority POV is generally accepted as no POV on WP.  That is a serious flaw, and a significant hit to WP's credibility.  Also, it take at least two to edit war.  It does no good to cry """"foul"""" when another editor is as determined as you are over a differnce.

 A philosophical story to embrace ones mind. 

The ancient Indian mathematicians were the first to discover the digit zero """"0"""" and implement it in the formation of digits. The whole world revolves like a cycle in the form of the digit zero. The Britishers dicovered an ancient egg of Dinosaures in India. What I mean to convey is that: India is the land where Lord Rama or Lord Krishna were born. Lord Rama was an example of a perfect ideal man on earth. His life story is an example for an ideal man to follow. Lord Rama, Lord Lakshmana, Lord Bharata and Lord Shatrughana were four sons of King Dhasratha of Ayodhya. He was cursed to die from the pain of separation from his son by the blind parents of Shrawan Kumar. Kaikeyi the mother of Bharata wishes to send Lord Rama on an exile for a period of 14 years and wishes her son Bharata to be the King of Ayodhya. Lord Rama and his wife Sita and his brother Lord Lakshmana leave for forests outside the kingdom of Ayodhya. Lord Rama's brother Lord Bharata persuades lord Rama to return back but lord Rama refuses to return to Ayodhya against the wishes of his step mother Kaikeyi. But Lord Bharata returns to Ayodhya along with the sandals of lord Rama and places the sandals of his brother Lord Rama on the throne and rules the kingdom of Ayodhaya in the name of Rama. This shows the example of love between an elder brother and his younger brother. In the forest once a demon shurpanaka sister of King Ravana disuades Lord Rama to marry her, but Lord Rama tells her that he is already married and points towards his brother Lord Lakshmana who cuts off her nose and ears to show her ugly nature and character. Shurphanaka runs off and complains about Lord Rama and Lord Lakshamana to King Ravana of Lanka. King Ravana somehow manages to kidnap Goddess Sita the wife of Lord Rama in revenge to Lanka. Lord Rama grieves for his separation from his beloved wife Goddess Sita. Here the feelings of an ideal person in the form of lord grieving from separation from his beloved wife are beautifully described by Sage Valmiki who wrote the whole Ramayana. Sage Valmiki was a thief named Ratnakar who by the japam of Lord Sri Rama became a great sage named Valmiki and wrote a great epic called Ramanaya the story of King Rama and Sita. Lord Rama and Lord Lakshamana move towards southern India where they meet the lord Hanuman, (the great son of Anjani and Kesari; Lord Hanumanji is also known as Pavanputra or the great celibate bachelor) and Lord Sugriva and with the help of vanara sena or Army of Monkeys they move into the kingdom of Lanka and kill the demon king Ravana. Lord Rama rescues Goddesses Sita and with the help of Lord Hanuman they return back to Ayodhya. A fourteen years had lapsed when lord Rama had left the kingdom of Ayodhya. When lord Rama, Goddesses Sita, Lord Lakshmana and lord Hanuman return to Ayodhya, the people of Ayodhya cheer up and lit up the whole Ayodhya with Diyas in order to celebrate the victory and return of their king Lord Rama. The festival Dusherra is celebrated every year as a victory of good over evil as the demon Meghanad {the son of King Ravana},the demon Kumbhakarna {the brother of king Ravana} and the demon King Ravana of Lanka were killed by Lord Rama and Lord Lakshmana in order to rescue Goddesses Sita from her captivity in Lanka. And on the occassion of their return to Ayodhya the festival Diwali is celebrated throughout India every year with  great pomp and show of lights and crackers. Whenever some troubled minds read this story of Ramayana their minds gain peace and the self confidence is restored as their spirits become calm, pacified and brave in the troubled periods of time. The Epic Ramayana denotes the greatness of Supreme God Lord Rama as an ideal human being on earth.  """,0

CorpseFucking Art (C.F.A.) are an Brutal Death Metal/ deathgrind band, from  Italy formed in 1993. Their lyrics focuses mainly on gore and Humor.

Biography

The band was formed in Rome in 1993. With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitars, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first demo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation.

Cryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7"""" Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal oriented. As the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal riffing with techno and industrial parts, splatter movies - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene.

Though, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.

In 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split CD with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new artwork.

After being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi. Between the recording and the long wait to the new cd to be out, the band takes part in a lot of live performances including festival in Frankfurt with Lividity, Gorerotted, Inhumate, Pigstry, Nunwhore Commando 666, Mastic Scum, Master and Damnable and the rest of Europe in places like Sweden, France and Italy. The band is currently, in 2008, recording a new studio album and is aspected to come out early 2009.

"""""""List of United States cities by area"""" says Sitka, Alaska, has 4,812 square miles, of which 2,874 are land; Juneau, Alaska, has 3,255 square miles, of which 2,717 are land; Anchorage, Alaska, has 1,961 square miles, of which 1,697 are land; and Jacksonville, Florida, has 874 square miles, of which 758 are land.

""""List of cities by surface area"""" matches that, except that it mentions """"Juneau City and Borough"""".

The pages about those four individual cities today have figures that match, too. Yet, when I posted in this section several days ago, the article on Jacksonville said 1,962.4 square miles.

Jacksonville's own government website says it has 841 square miles, not 874 or 758.

I'm not sure whether some people or governments are rightly or wrongly putting all of a county's land into the city's listed area. I can say that, in the case of Jacksonville, although the governments of the (a) City of Jacksonville and (b) Duval County are unified, there is (or ought to be) separate reckoning of the city's and county's area, because Duval County also contains three other cities (Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, and Neptune Beach), which are not part of the City of Jacksonville (they have their own, separate police departments, for example—even though the Jacksonville Public Library is county-wide).

The government website of the City and Borough of Juneau says it has 2,593.6 square miles of land and 487.6 square miles of water, for a total of 3,081.2 square miles. Neither the total nor the land area there matches what Wikipedia gives.

At the government website of the City and Borough of Sitka, I haven't found the area.

Same for the government website of Anchorage. But it does link to anchorage.net, which says the city has 1,955 square miles—which, like the government figures for Jacksonville and Juneau, doesn't match Wikipedia's figure.

As to The Church of Jesus Christ, they are big enough, I think, with about 15,000 members, to merit an article in their own right. I think there's verifiable material on the group's current practices and doctrines, although I'm not familiar enough with it. As to the much smaller groups like the Cutlerites and the Strangites, I think their notability comes from their history. There used to be a lot more members, and they had significant interactions with early Mormons. For the FLDS Church, there's not much verifiable information about their current practices, but they are in the news so much that they should definitely have an article. Basically, though, I see no problem with allowing an article for any distinct religious denomination. There may not be much verifiable information, but as long as they are either in the news, or have some historical significance, or have published things, that seems notable enough for me. As to particular church buildings or single congregations of a denomination, that's probably where I'd draw the line, unless that particular church building or congregation has some special significance.

"""

Sad that some editors jumped to conclusions without reading or analyzing the article or using the proper AfD process, but I recognize that there is a lot of emotion these days. It took over an hour to build the article but seconds were spent to kill it.

First I carefully reviewed (again) the BLP policies so I could carefully follow them. Than I used the Article Creation Template (or whatever its called) with it's step by step questions. The result of those questions was to create the article. I also check that there are no conflicting articles.  The less than ideal article name is because there is a completely unrelated http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misha (an Russian Olympic mascot, not a person). When a last name is known, obviously the article would be renamed.

Next I did not just paste in some news report. I stitched together various reports in a logical topical arrangement using unique language plus direct quotes from involved people. 

I created it from a variety of sources (over 7 different ones anyway) and ref'd the heck out every statement per BPL which says """"We must get the article right. Be very firm about the use of high-quality sources. All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be explicitly attributed to a reliable, published source, which is usually done with an inline citation. Contentious material about living persons (or in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced – whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable – should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion."""". Before saying this is a BLP violation please show which statements were not reliably sourced to published sources with inline citations.

I did ref the Daily Mail (admit not the very best source at times) sometimes because they were pulling info from various places and some of it was a little different than other sources so I wanted to reflect both versions where info seemed to conflict. However, the most comprehensive source I've found so far is an AP article. http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bomb-suspect-influenced-mysterious-radical There are more than 1.1 million hits on Google for """"Boston Marathon Misha"""" as I write so an argument that this person is not WELLKNOWN is debatable. 

The article is not strictly negative. It states reported bio info (granted there is limited info to report). Mostly it summarizes a real debate through the media between various family members (mainly the Maryland uncle and a former husband of a sister) who cite Misha as the driving force behind Tam's radicalization and the mother who says he was just a nice guy. The various interviews are easy to find and widely quoted, though I believe the refs were mostly to the original media sources or multiple sources.  

There is some wild speculation about this guy by the media out there. I specifically excluded any of that from the article. My goal was to write an over referenced, comprehensive, neutral, informative article that accurately pulls together the various media reports so far.  Like many articles, there is room for improvement. The article was redirected (as a sub for a deletion nomination) before anyone even had a chance to properly review it and improve it. 

BLPCRIME may not apply as no one, and certianly not the article, is accusing Misha of a crime.

The absence of a known complete name does not disqualify a person from having a Wikipedia article. Consider DB Copper and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeholder_name 
Anyway, considering how many people are searching this guy I expect he will be found and a page will get created or restored.  Cheers,   """,0

More on math markup
I saw your table at Flue gas emissions and it looks nice.  That led to your discussion of Wiki's less than perfect math markup.  You pointed out that your PNG generated at Wikicities was more compact:

I believe placing a message on a userpage is the only way to create the message notice.  Many users do put responses directly under the message for continuity, but they would still need to place a notice on the other userpage to get a quick response.  

The smaller font is achieved with the  \begin{matrix} \end{matrix} tags .  (Note braces not parens - they are hard to distinguish on my monitor). This is noted in Help:Formula#Fractions, matrices, multilines section under """"Small Fractions"""", where it adds that the tag forces """"\textstyle"""".

 Usurpation 

Request for Usurpation

Hello, Ryan Taylor. A request has been made at Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations to usurp, or """"take over"""", your username because you have not used it to edit, and another user would like to use it to edit. Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations says that any unused username may be usurped if the user is given seven days notice to object and does not do so. 

If you have an email set in your preferences, you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process. 

If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to utilize the name you currently have, please log in and post a reply here saying so (you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to, or we will provide you with a generic one). 

If you do nothing: the request will be filled after seven days, and your account will be moved to a generic username. You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time.

If you object to being renamed: please log in and make an edit. You may make an edit here saying """"No,"""" you may make an edit to blank this page, or any other edit you like; making any edit at all prevents your username from being usurped, because users with edits cannot have their usernames usurped. 

Please note that even if your current username is usurped, you can still edit and your data will not be lost; your preferences, watchlist, and other user settings will be transferred to a new username.

"Well, Arthur, I have printed the paper, and the condition is in fact what Ultra.Power says it is, not your correction. It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless.

You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.

We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.

To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).

And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)

Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! 

Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).

Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0.",0

 Advice on Portal:Jurassic Park: 

Hi Firs. I recently found the mentioned portal after it was placed in the related portals section of the dino portal. I checked it out & saw it had a number of problems which were in violation of the fair use policy among others. Firstly, none of the pictures on the portal (all of which are fair use) have fair use rationale. I expressed this to the user (User:Cuddly Panda) who has been the sole contributor of the portal with no reply. On closer inspection, it seems the user has been uploading & adding fair use images to wikipedia for some time now, possibly upwards of a year, & despite numerous warning from automated bots etc, has now seemed to learn from this or the links provided or ceased their image infringements. Just check out the user's talk page - nearly every message is a message about the misuse of uploads. In addition to this, the portal is very poor in quality, unmaintained and relies heavily on unfree images and poor portal sections (some of which have already been nominated for deletion). So I wanted to ask you what action I could take next. There's a few options:

1) Obviously the user is not listening to warnings & my messages, so could I possibly bring this up at the administrator's noticeboard? They could then decide what to do next.
2) Since sections of the JP Portal are being nomianted for deletion already, I could potentially nominate the whole portal at MfD with a vote of """"no opinion"""". This would see what other editors think of the portal & even if it is kept, the portal's fair use pictures problem would still be sorted out by the end of the nomiantion.
3) I'll probably do this anyway, but the user is on Editor Review & I could also place a note there explaining what the user is doing wrong & how to remedy this.

So, I'd personally like to do all three, but if you can think of something else & help me decide which of those, if any, to carry out, it would be appreciated. I'll post this to another admin just to get a second opinion as well. Cheers,  """,0

 My Two Cents 

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level. It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior. This is sad. We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech. This is next. Truly sad. Truly sad, indeed. 

 Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's. We have made """"those people"""" rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling. Open your eyes!

And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct.

It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the """"controversial"""" word """"niggardly"""", that stupid people and words do not mix.

As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination.

What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments. I must of hit a nerve with some """"idiots"""" who don't have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage. LOL!""",1

 Comparing bronze apples to fresh sprouts 
Ah, so now you spring your little argument youve been itching for a while to do. In otherwords, 'How can Wikipedia support the supernatural claims in the Bible, and not those in my particular brand new religion.' 

First of all, Wikipedia doesnt support anything. Articles are to be written NPOV - that doesnt mean that articles dont ever use Biblespeak, rather when it is used, its used in proper context: """"In the Bible, etc. etc."""" 
This is not the Schucmanism Encyclopedia. Even if the claim that Jesus wrote the thing was universal among Christians, this is not the Christian Encyclopedia.  

Im not particularly attached to the term ghostwriting, but your wording - that [whatever it was called] is like channeling, etc - was not neutral, and placed too much emphasis on a trivial matter - trivial, because supernatural claims, despite our understanding of them in faith, are not encyclopedically substantive. 
This is of course the problem with religion - a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and a lot of knowledge of just one thing is just plain dogma. You seem to be asserting that there is a dogmatic bias in wikipedia regarding the Bible. Its interesting, but you need to poing out specific examples, and then you need to deal with them on a case by case basis. Maybe you have a point here - I cant tell ATP. Dont forget """"the log in your own"""" BTW.

Its obviously a very touchy subject, but we deal from time to time with people seeking to push a POV in their writing, and after a while they realize that theyve already added all the information necessary to the article, but leave the writing to others. Its an important distinction - I myself have a couple times had to defer to others sometimes in cases where a conflict arose between two different POV writing styles. The question is: are yours and mine different enought to require outside help in resolving any dispute. Finally, """"Ill let you..."""" doesnt work here - its not your article, though you have had more part than anyone in developing it. And I was simply rewriting it for sake of neutral tone - something which you should welcome, not reject - as it legitimizes and adds to your work, just as your work adds to the project.

SMOS """"More"""" template
Hi Art, the problem with the extra linefeed with the More template was due to a misplaced  tag on the line after the last part of the template code, which allowed the carriage return at the end of the template code to be included. Shifting the noinclude tag to the end of the previous line cured that problem. The box itself was too big and overlapped with other boxes and with text in sentences above the box. (And it was a bit overbearing and distracting to the reader.) I did a re-design to make it smaller, and wrapped the box formatting only around the word """"More"""" in the template, so it would be the same color as the link text.   TALK

"This is the armeniapedia version about the battle

In violation of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty with soviet Russia, Turkish troops crossed the border in 1918 and attacked Alexandropol (Leninakan). The aggressor intended to crush Eastern Armenia and seize Transccaucasia. When Alexandropol fell, the Turkish Army poured into the Ararat Valley – the heart of Armenia. There was a major engagement at Sardarabad on May 22-26, where the Turkish Army was defeated and retreated.  

First of all I do not know how to revert. I just make changes. Second as I am trying to put this version, a very good guy, named roob323 reverts to an older Turkish version of the site. Moreover, now it sounds even ridiculous.The same thing they wrote twice. Just by cutting and pasting from the history of the article. These kids who never went to school in Armenia, whose knowledge about Armenian history comes from church sunday schools write things that can couse laugh even in Turkish readers. For example, in early May recently becamed independent Armenia was attacked by Ottoman forces ( Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan decalred their independence only in the end of May). Or, after losing the battle of Sardarapat, Armenia declared its independence (second time as a matter of fact). But we all know that the second time Armenia declared its Sovetization (occupation by bolsheviks) on November 29,1920 and not independence. It is very well known that the commander in the battle of Sardarapat was Daniel Bek Pirumov from the village of Nakhichevanik in Nagorno Karabakh. SO fat these 2 imbeciles named Nareklm and roob keep pushing the name Slkuni or Silician.  And finall,y who needs the aftermath of the battle in Sardarapat if it concludes information about what Georgia did, who it asked for help etc etc etc. I am surprized to find out from the article edited by roob and narek that Turkish army occupied the whole Armenia(including Russian part which is todays Armenia). Probably Nagorno Karabakh or Zangezur or Sevan they do not consider a part of Armenia anymore. Moreover, in the history of this article also edited by some turks and Narek you can find out that Armenia was forced to sign treaty of Batumi!!!!!You can see how come 3 not literate (angraget in Armenian) imbeciles can come and do things in wikipedia that Turkish and Azeri propagandists could not even see in their dreams. Because these 3 imbeciles have got a right to revert edit or even block others, the real Armenian history specialists can get heart attacks if they read this article.

 Hoover's murder investigation re Kennedy 

The information about Hoover's role in the murder investigation of President Kennedy is well documented.

Hoover personally directed the investigation into the murder of President John F. Kennedy which is often called the """"Crime of the Century."""" The first citation in the Kennedy murder section of the article refers to a report by a congressional committee called the House Select Committee on Assassinations. It issued its report in 1979 after a three year investigation into the assassination of John Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy.   The report by the Congressional Committee was critical of the performance by the FBI as well as other agencies. 

The second citation in the section on the Kennedy murder is to the PBS Frontline news show. It was reviewing the official government records that “electrified” top Washington insiders and have been kept secret for over 40 years. These secret documents were obtained by the Assassination Records Review Board many years after they were sealed away from public disclosure. The once secret documents are fascinating, especially as reviewed by PBS.  

Hoover conferred with Nicholas Katzenbach of the Justice Department about how to approach an investigation of Kennedy’s murder. The former Attorney General was grilled by the HSCA 15 years later on why he was intent on convincing the public that neither a left wing conspiracy or a right wing conspiracy was involved in Kennedy's assassination. The copy of his memo is carried by Lancer.  If the reader wants the full version of the testimony by Katzenbach the reader should go to the House Committee Report. 
President Johnson, along with Hoover, also knew about the Oswald impersonator right away  that certainly tends to show a right wing conspiracy with an impersonator pretending to be Oswald trying to contact a """"hit man.""""   Maybe there would be another motive for impersonating Oswald trying to contact a hit man other than to frame him. I don't know what it would be. 

There is no question the FBI, under Hoover, acted as the primary investigative arm of the Warren Commission, and Hoover testified to the Commission as seen from these once secret transcripts of the Warren Commission hearing:
 I have been unable to find any scintilla of evidence showing any foreign conspiracy or any domestic conspiracy that culminated in the assassination of President Kennedy   The testimony is unsealed now.

There is no secret anymore about the FBI destruction of evidence. They were caught and its now public knowledge. There is a full pulic record. The agent involved even wrote a book about it.    

The American public does not believe the conclusions reached by the Warren Commission and believes the government has something to hide.  This is what the Assassination Records Review Board believes. 

 Conclusion

Therefore, any editors that think there are other reputable sources that have information please put it in. One should not simply delete well known and documented information just because one doesn't like it. If that were the criteria for deleting information, then Wikipedia would be at the mercy of every public relations firm in the country. Nothing """"negative"""" can be written about a public figure because his or her publicist may find it unpleasant and delete it claiming the information is a """"theory."""" No, the information is documented by reputable sources.

What I can't figure out is why Mr. Hoover's sexual life gets so much space, and yet someone doesn't want information on Hoover's job performance on the biggest case of Hoover's career.

As these are completely unofficial and unverifiable, I am thinking to remove them altogether or at least add a note that all figures are unofficial and estimated.

 If I had seen your concerns I would have noted first of all that unambiguous definition of terms is not common in discourses and in any case I began the article with a clear description of what was meant by  'abuse' in the context of the article. Even in the drafting of legislation where great care is taken to be unambiguous there is nevertheless a need to leave some terms undefined: for example 'nation' in EU leglislation, 'indecent' in UK criminal legislation (in the context of child protection) - the examples are legion. In any case it is perfectly well understood what abusive sexual behaviour amounts to and abusive behaviour need not be criminal. In particular teacher-student sexual relationships are universally regarded as abusive on the part of the teacher. The selection criteria was mentioned in the article - that the individuals involved had founded Buddhist groups at the forefront of the emerging Western Buddhist movement.

"Since consensus was to keep, and I still felt strongly that the lack of web accessibility was a problem, I added spans into the List of R-phrases, then converted the R-phrase template to include a #link into the list, only to discover that the link target shadows the title attribute for tooltip purposes. To resolve this, I created redirects into the list with verbose titles like R1: Explosive when dry. Template:R-phrase now links to the list via these redirects, and the redirect titles come up on the tooltip. That way, you get your tooltip, and I get web-accessibility. I hope this makes sense to you.
If ever you chem guys get around to creating separate articles on each R-phrase (and I think you could, with expanded information on the nature of the hazard, standards for storage, transport and use, and a list of chemicals to which the R-phrase applies), then you can either overwrite the redirect with the article, or retarget the redirect at the article.

No doubt footnote no.1 correctly ascribes the information on the map to the WHO but clearly the WHO is not the appropriate authority given that the UN as we all know deals with countries' self-reporting. May I point out that Malaysia and Indonesia, which are described as Muslim countries (as they officially indeed are), contain very substantial Christian, Buddhist and Hindu minorities. (See the CIA World Fact Book .) Moreover, many such minorities are considerably to be identified by region. North Borneo and New Guinea, for example, are very large geographical areas in Malaysia and Indonesia which only have a marginal Muslim presence; the Moluccas in Indonesia are at least 50% Christian; Bali is famously Hindu. Overall, Malaysia is some 60% Muslim and clearly does not belong in the plus-80% circumcised category as it appears on the map. But given the geographical spread of these countries and vast disparity of cultures and religions across the Indonesian Archipelago, it is surely meaningless to describe these countries in such a way.

"Personal dissapointment

This article will never be a FA nor a good article. It also had been the victim of some wikipedia rules that don't apply to other articles on this encyclopedia. When I first started to edit on wiki I was quite enthusiastic but later this feeling faded. For example the artcle had been moved to a name that is not used in the world of football. Steaua had always been known for its official name: FC Steaua Bucureşti. This name is used worldwide to refer to Steaua. I personally found this situation annoying and I suggest that a move should take place. I mean, the other Romanian football clubs with Bucureşti in their naming were not moved and those awkward wikipedia rules applied only to this article. 

Here are some examples about football clubs that have articles based on their official club names:

 Sporting Clube de Portugal
 Associação Académica de Coimbra - O.A.F.
 F.C. Internazionale Milano
 Olympique Lyonnais
 Deportivo de La Coruña
 Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata

and the list can go on.

If there is a rule on this issue let this rule be applied to all articles. If not, this article should be moved to its rightfull name.",0

 Response 

1. Photo selection: On 3/15/07, I trimmed his four photos down to what I felt was the most representative one, even though trimming them to zero makes more common sense.  What did I do to balance out this trimming?  In the external links section, I added a link to Shankbone's gallery in Wiki Commons, which features all four pics.  Hence anyone can see all four photos with the click of a button.  """"Chivalry is truly not dead,"""" you say to yourselves.  (I even left the gallery/centered HTML around it, so that it'd be positioned right in the center for all to see, not off to one side.)  What does Shankbone then do?  He adds his other three photos back, and slyly keeps the link which I had added to his pics at the Commons.  His reasoning is that """"One photograph in a gallery looks odd.""""  He could have simply reverted to the prior version, but he looked over my changes and then only kept the one change that benefited him. He keeps talking about how he wants to compromise and work with other users, but every chance he gets, he puts himself above all other considerations and still refuses to cooperate. Why would he have even made the Commons gallery unless he understood that his photos were not main-article-worthy?  He made the Commons gallery in the first place since he correctly reasoned that that was a better location for them.  Now he has told me he will do his best to have me blocked from editing this article any further.

Back to what I previously brought up about him using this article for careerist purposes.  Why did he put his full name in the title of each of the .jpg files he uploaded?  (Roll your mouse over the photos, or attempt to download them to your hard drive, if you don't know what I'm talking about.)  That's unheard-of.  Unless, that is, he wants a lot of people to download them, and have his name conveniently attached in the file name, in case said downloaders ever want to contact the photographer and offer him $ to reprint them... 

How can he get as many people as possible to download them?  By making them as racy as possible, of course.  The point is: He could have posted clothed pictures without his name in them.  Or racy pictures without his name in them.  Or clothed ones with his name in them.  None of those possibilities would have raised the serious ethical questions that have been voiced here by multiple users.

2. Slant of article: Tara Subkoff is a professional actress. She designs (or designed, since IOC is apparently defunct) clothes on the side, though actually all she does is modify existing ones with the help of a partner.  Her entire varied, and usually quite daring, 13-year film career is reduced to this line of text: """"She has acted in over a dozen movies."""" (Technically, that counts as zero descriptive lines of her actual roles or of accolades she has received.)  However, one fashion show of hers, which took place over maybe a 2-hour span at most, is represented by around two thirds of the descriptive text in this article.  Does that seem right to anyone?  I'd like for even one Wikipedia user to lay out for me how this is correct.  Someone who had never previously heard of Subkoff would think that the U.S. media had some sort of frenzy over this one show she put on, and that her acting is so subpar as to deserve approximately 0.0 to 0.5 words per film role.  (And 100% of the two """"references"""" that he hastily added to this article are about this one-time event.)  Shankbone has consistently and subtly altered the emphasis of this article towards proving his point of view, at the expense of doing Subkoff's career justice.  In science, an experiment is never undertaken with the intent of molding the results towards proving one pre-desired hypothesis.  Any scientist who does so is branded as a sham and generally stripped of his tenure/degree/etc.  This is known as the scientific method, and has been followed for centuries.  Wikipedia was designed to be laid out in a very cold and scientific manner, to dispense nothing other than actual facts about certain objects and entities.  It's not an arena for positing one's own spin on objects and entities.  If you don't like cold and non-biased data, then Wikipedia isn't the place for you.  I often go to entries on my favorite bands/movies/etc. (and I'm even talking about ones that have drastically changed my life, or bands that I like enough to have interviewed them in the past) and delete anything with even the tiniest whiff of favoritism.

3. Style.com link: I went to the style.com link that Shankbone provided.  This link simply reinforces my position.  What it shows is 36 pictures of this event.  The models are topless in 6 of the pictures.  The models are fully clothed in 30 of the pictures.  Tell me how Shankbone's four topless pics provide an accurate overview of",0

@Drmies: First of all I want to appoligy for my too hasty re-inclusion of the content into the article, which I by the way only did because of the presumption of having satisfied all fellow editors call for adding a direct reference for the """"Reference values in the table"""", which previously indeed lacked a reference. In the back-mirror, I was a little too hasty to re-instate and should of course instead first have uploaded the content to my sandbox, and then asked for the talkpage approval before uploading it again. Please however consider, that all my actions were only excecuted in good faith. Subsequently I was surprised to find a continued resistance about the content from fellow editors here at the talkpage. Based on those grounds, I of course accept your removal of the content from the article, and have just created a  for the subsequent debate we shall now still continue to have, about the appropriateness (which I still claim) to include a monthly data table in the article.

In regards of your claim that my most recent version of the uploaded disputed material is still WP:OR, I will request you to return with a reply why you think this is so, and what we in your opinion need to do in order for the content to satisfy the policy. As far as I know, we are allowed at Wikipedia to create our own wikitables to display fully referenced data, which it indeed was in my latest version of the data table. I admit at first to have uploaded unsourced """"Monthly reference value data"""" that strived against WP:OR, which was something I only did as part of a process, in the hope for other editors (or myself) at a later stage being able to find direct sources for those values. Yesterday, I indeed managed to find a direct source for these monthly values published by the Polish Ministry of Finance. Please take into consideration, that we do not have 2 equal WP:PS for the same data but only have 1 (The Polish source), as I have managed to proof here at the talkpage that the Latvian source do not qualify for the purpose, as it did not strictly follow the published official """"ECB evaluation method"""" (which it by the way funny enough also never claimed it did) - but instead has adopted its own data approach. Please also consider, that my uploaded data table with monthly data in principle can stand alone, even without that we mention the debated report by the """"Latvian Central Bank"""", as I have prooved here at the talkpage they utilised another data approach than the official """"ECB method"""". After I now have ellaborated on the details, do you then have a different opinion whether or not my most recent version of the uploaded material still shall be classified as WP:OR?

The reason why I think it is so important that we in the Latvian article display monthly convergence values for each month for the past year, and why inclusion of this material shall not be disquallified as per WP:NOTSTATS, is because the uploaded monthly data (for the most recent 12 months) reflect how the official """"ECB method"""" works, as a graphical illustration which help casual readers to grasp that all candidate countrys have been granted the right by EU to apply ECB for conducting a monthly convergence check at each month during the year (if they belief to have met all criteria). Unfortunately ECB do not automatically publish monthly convergency reports during the year (because in that case we would obviously have used their direct data for the table instead). But as I already provided evidense for, the Polish Ministry are publishing monthly reports where they check for monthly convergence and calculate the ECB reference value limits based on the official """"ECB method"""" (which proofs this is notable stuff), and their findings in the Polish context has also been covered over at the Polish wikipedia (although by a much lower quality than my attempt). Taking this into consideration, will you then still argue it is inappropriate we do the same here at the English wikipedia for the Latvian article (in the version showcased by my )?   

Personal reply to TDL (not related to the article itself)
@TDL: In the past four months there have now been a few times, where you and I clashed about the WP:OR policy. In those cases where we have clashed, I admit to have applied a backwords approach, where I started out to state the facts as I knew it was the WP:TRUTH. I have always seen such uploads as part of a process, where we were continously working to find sources and improve the articles.

"""== plants ==

I find the first sentences of this article very strange. I don't think vegetarians primarily eat plants or that it's synonymous with herbivore. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, honey, and yogurt, are not plants. Even plant parts is a bit of a stretch. Is flour a plant? My understanding is that vegetarians do not eat meat.   
It looks like an accurate description to me. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, beans, and flour all come from plants - I don't think it's necessary to eat the whole plant to be considered to be eating plants. Plants aren't even mentioned in the first sentences of the article.  
I see that mention of plants has recently been removed. The word vegetarian obviously indicates a plant-based diet.  
A nut may come from a tree, but it is not a plant. See dictionary. Yogurt is not a plant. Honey is not a plant. Fruit is not a plant. You seem to be confusing the meaning of words, which is problematic for someone working on an encyclopedia.   
I think you'll find that trees are plants. Foods that come from plants are plant-based foods. It isn't rocket science.  
The article seems have been clarified which is helpful. Clearly there is a difference between a herbivore (a moose or cow for example) and a vegetarian that eats plant based foods like nuts, fruit and sometimes non-plant based foods dairy. Cheers.   
I removed a newly-added sentence in the intro saying """"Some vegetarians eat eggs and fish"""" because the very next sentence says exactly the same thing.   

I removed """"focusing on plant-based foods"""", since a diet of solely dairy products and eggs, while unhealthy, would technically be vegetarian. Simply put, not all vegetarian diets """"focus"""" on plant-based foods. As per the citations, vegetarianism is really just defined by what it excludes, not what it includes. -  
It would only be true of certain forms of vegetarianism, so the plant-based nature of the diet needs to be included.  
What about fungi? They aren't plants are they?   
Fungi are fungi, not plants. Sigh... vegetarians... '' (T↔C) 
Correct, they are not plants. Just in case anyone is still confused: nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, and flour are all plant-based foods; they come from plants. Honey, yogurt, other dairy products, and eggs are animal-based foods; mushrooms and yeast are fungus-based foods; and algae (including edible seaweed like kelp) are none of the above. Also for the record, I'm vegetarian. -  
(response to Michig) I don't understand your logic here. If some vegetarian diets do not focus on plant-based foods, then would it not be inaccurate to make the blanket statement """"vegetarian diets focus on plant-based foods""""? -  
Can you seriously imagine a vegetarian diet without plant-based foods? The lede should summarize the article, and if you read the article it discusses plant-based foods all the way through it. The Vegetarian Society's definition: """"We define a vegetarian as someone living on a diet of grains, pulses, nuts, seeds, vegetables and fruits, with or without the use of dairy products and eggs. A vegetarian does not eat any meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish or crustacea, or slaughter by-products."""" Doesn't that sound very plant-based to you? The plant-based foods are the fundamental part of the diet, with some'' types of vegetarians also adding dairy and eggs.

 Why do you keep deleting a link to the most informative site about Middle Bass Island??? 

Norman,

you have removed the link to the main Middle Bass Island web site several times. That means you don't even look at the contents of the items you remove, which is rather petty and incredibly arrogant.

The site started as a non-commercial site and contains a great deal of island history as well as many, many island pictures. It's one of the most popular sites in the Lake Erie Islands.

Please take a look at """"Site Map Page 1"""" and """"Site Map Page 2"""" before removing the link again. Saying that the hundreds of pages listed there have only commercial value is idiotic.

The site was started out of love for the Lake Erie Islands and Middle Bass Island and the fact that it now carries a number of ads for island businesses does not change the fact that it is mainly a site with island information not available anywhere else.

So what is your real rationale for deleting it again and again and again???

"Hazel Eye Myth==

The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some instances can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. 

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America aswell as areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.

As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown.

Here are some examples of what true hazel eyes are;

The picture on the right hand side of the hazel eye section does not match the description of hazel eyes, as it is blue with central heterochromia (brown around the pupil).

"Proposed move would benefit the wider community (a copy in my talk page). 

Wikipedia is not a dictionary but an encyclopedia, therefore, the content and title name of an article there, necessarily needs to be encyclopedic, not as in the case of dictionaries. The naming of the sweet cannot straightforwardly choose as Rasgulla. However, the naming in Wikipedia appears to be followed only the Oxford dictionaries, as an anglicize name loaned from a foreign country. But the name obviously misspelled there, as the dictionary mentions rasgullā originates in Hindi – so the name to be disambiguated to avoid confusion with Rosogolla for the reasons many reliable English-language sources mentions the sweet name Rosogolla, The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets describes Rosogolla is primarily associated with West Bengal, then Bengal in British India. The fact establishes the origin of the sweet is in Bengal - a part of greater India, not Hindi, in Bengal the sweet is called Rosogolla since its initial usage.  
 
Nevertheless, here rises a question, whether Wikipedia must stick to its current naming when the naming is misleading or inaccurate. 

As per description of Wikipedia, the naming the sweet should be seen as goals, not as rules. Whereas, considering the deleted article Rosogolla's naturalness, consistency, prevalence in many reliable English-language sources, as well as its usage around 250 million Bengali people in Bangladesh, West Bengal, other states in India and world over, the name Rosogolla has come into majority use. The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets highlights Rosogolla, and describes often-spelled Rasgulla, it is a very new edition published in the United Kingdom and the US. The name Rosogolla has been preferred in several publications in United Kingdom and the US. Some of these books are (1) Milk - Beyond the Dairy: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food... by Harlan Walke, Page 58. (2) Strategic Management: Formulation, Implementation and Control, by PEARCE, Page 179. (3) Food Culture in India, by Colleen Taylor Sen. There are too many reliable English sources in United Kingdom and the US those mention the sweet as Rosogolla. A confusing entry in the Oxford dictionaries cannot really overlook Rosogolla’s merit as a title name from the reliable English-language sources.

Therefore, my goal is to move the article [Rasgulla]] to Rosogolla and the move would benefit a wider community.",0

"""proposal by Coulliard 

I'm going on the soapbox for awhile, an uncomfortable position in a baseball game (sliding runners tend to knock it out from under you).  I want to explain my position without us getting personal.  If you take offense, apologies in advance.  And apologies for being so wordy.  Genetic defect.

I am a baseball researcher by hobby (computer programmer by trade), and I take everything about baseball's history seriously, especially the Negro Leagues, which have become my area of expertise.  Segregation in Baseball remains the absolute worst scar on its face.

In my opinion (emphasis on it being my opinion), Josh Gibson, Pete Hill, Satchel Paige, Bullet Rogan, Oscar Charleston, Andy Cooper, José Méndez, Cristobal Torrienté, and many others men would have easily been Hall of Famers long, long ago had it not been for segregation.  It's my belief that given current evidence Gibson wouldn't have hit much more than 500 or so home runs playing a full schedule, given the HR rates of the 30s and 40s (not nearly as high as today), given his truncated career (he died after his 17th season), and given the position he played (catchers just don't play full schedules because of the extreme wear and tear; on the other hand, he might have been converted into an outfielder or first baseman in an integrated Majors, and 600+ would have been a possibility.

Babe Ruth hit 714 Major League HRs; had he had to face Bullet Rogan, Andy Cooper, Satchel Paige, and other pitchers of color, his totals might have tailed down toward 650 or so, and that in a 22-year career compared to Gibson's 17.

What we know is that Gibson is credited with 115 verifiable HR in Negro League play, plus 44 in Mexican League play, which was a bit lower level competition than MLB.  Gibson hit .359 against Negro League competition, which would be second highest of all time (behind Cobb) had he done so in an integrated majors, and Cobb's .366 might have lost a few points as well had he had to face Negro pitchers like Lefty Cooper and Willie Foster.

The raw numbers are still small.  We can't do anything about that.  115 compares very badly to 714, much less 762.  But it's still important to know those numbers, because it's what he did against major league-level competition.  What he did against amateur and semi-pro competition in exhibition games is fun to know (if we truly did know), but it is not the true measure of his worth, and (IMO) it insults the man's memory to artificially pad his numbers.  Understanding that Babe Ruth hit HIS home runs in a league that played 154 games per season, that homers were easier to hit in Ruth's league than Gibson's (livelier baseballs in the AL), the relative numbers make Gibson look like Ruth's peer.

With few exceptions, there are no researchers who do not believe that Josh Gibson was one of the two or three best pure power hitters in the game, and no exceptions among serious Negro League researchers.  We can (and in fact should) report that there have been various reports of his accomplishments in earlier days, but these numbers, taken without any context present a superman as unbelievable as that X-Files episode (""""The Unnatural"""").

You have to trust that the reason for putting up Gibson's reduced stats has a noble purpose.  Telling people that Gibson hit 800+ HR and batted .384 against all levels of competition tells nothing really, because he could have in reality hit .200 with no HR against top-level Negro League teams, but fattened up by counting 1,000 games against Little League comptetition.  Telling them he hit .359 and had a home run every sixteen at bats in a career that included many games in Griffith Stadium tells them something of importance  it gives us an excellent clue as to how he would have hit in the Majors, had he been allowed to play.

The """"nearly 800"""" and """"962"""" numbers give us no way of being able to separate them and understand their meaning.  An official scorer counted every one of Babe Ruth's HR in his major league career, and we can go back to sources from that day and find it.  In Gibson's case, someone reported (sometimes months later) numbers that no one even at that time could verify, because a lot of the numbers were based on hearsay, and some were just plain made-up.  We can't tell how many he hit over a 150-foot fence against a 17-year-old kid with a 60 MPH fastball, because we can't separate them.

There's plenty of space on the internet for repeating urban legend as fact.  Wikipedia should not be one of them.

My proposal is that we rewrite the article to include the latest official numbers, and make sure it is understood why Gibson only managed to play 510 Negro League games in his career.  It will inclu",0

"Mirv, I don't think anyone here has made that claim.  On the other hand, they do insist that POV edits not be made, or at least brought to the Talk: page first for discussion.  And you seem to ignore Wikipedia:Be bold, which states 
But please note: be bold in updating pages does not mean that you should make deletions to long articles on complex, controversial subjects with long histories, such as Israeli-Palestinian conflict or Abortion. In many such cases, the text as you find it has come into being after long and arduous negotiations between Wikipedians of diverse backgrounds and points of view. An incautious edit to such an article can be akin to stirring up a hornet's nest, and other users who are involved in the page may react angrily.

If you encounter an article on a controversial subject that you would like to edit, first read the comments on the talk page and view the Page history to get a sense of how the article came into being and what its current status is.

If you are an experienced wiki-ist, you will probably have a good sense what will be accepted edits, and which edits should be discussed first.

If you are new to wikipedia, or unsure how others will view your proposals, and you want to change or delete anything substantial in the text, you should either:

   1. If the material in question is a sentence or so in length, copy it to the Talk page and list your objections there.
   2. If the material is longer than a sentence, list your objections on the Talk page but leave the main article as it is.

Then, wait a bit for responses. If no one objects, proceed. But always move large deletions to Talk and list your objections to the text so that other people will understand your changes and will be able to follow the history of the page.

Also, show respect for consensus. Avoid making major changes to an article if a vote (or poll) is currently in progress about whether those changes should be made, especially if there is no clear consensus shown by the vote.
By the way, I like your new sig.  15:49, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)",0

I wasn't speaking of the Hebrew spellings of Samael verses Samuel but the way the Hebrew name Shemuwel was """"transliterated"""" by the Latin speaking people of Rome to Samuel which is almost the same as Samael. Obviously because the Jews did say that Samael was the patron of Rome so they must have took it to heart and decided to venerate him instead of choosing a true translieration of Shemuwel.

 Merging Red Hand of Doom and Reliability issue 

Given that there's not alot of information regarding RHoD I'm not sure I agree that it deserves it's own article. Given that I do think it belongs in Wikipedia, and suggest merging and redirecting it with a new article on other similarly-themed D&D; modules. This would have the advantage of 1) allying yourself with other editors with articles in this category, and 2) being able to gather all the secondary sources in one place to address notability concerns. I was thinking about this last night and had the idea that it could fit with 3rd edition modules with a generic setting. That would be a pretty good list of modules; take a look at List of Dungeons & Dragons adventures, and we should be able to gather a good number of secondary sources. I'd be happy to put in work on this. 

Also I'd like to get the issue of whether or not some of the secondary sources being used by D&D; editors that the deletionists view as """"fansites"""" are indeed reliable sources. I'll be happy to put in the work or collaborate on this if you would gather up a list of the disputed sources you have been using. I think other people, such as user:webwarlock, might be interested also. We could submit the case to wp:Reliable sources/Noticeboard and then notify Jack and Gavin so they can see what's going on and make their own arguments. If it can't be resolved there then we can kick it up to informal mediation by the mediation cabal. I believe this action alone can go a long way toward settling many of these issues for a number of D&D; and other rpg editors. What do you think?   """,0

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!

One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.

I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.

The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.

Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a """"Mutt and Jeff"""" in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1"""" but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.

Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.

We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.

""""There were some really desperate people here tonight,"""" she said. """"Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?""""

""""I can't say I really blame him,"""" I answered with a grin. """"Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!"""" That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.

Sue chimed in, """"Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?""""

""""Now that's a stupid question,"""" Keith answered.

""""And why is that?"""" Linda asked, pointedly.

""""Isn't it obvious?"""" Keith replied.

""""No."""" Linda and Sue answered in unison.

""""Do you want to tell them?"""" Keith asked me with a nod.

So I explained the obvious. """"Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.""""

""""Oh please!"""" Karen said.

Keith was a real instigator. """"You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?""""

The girls looked at each other. """"Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year."""" Linda finally answered.

""""And how about Truth or Dare?"""" Keith continued egging them on.

""""Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,"""" Karen answered this time.

""""Usually."""" Keith echoed with a grin. """"And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.""""

The girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.

""""Oh come on,"""" I teased, """"Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.""""

""""Not really. I watched part of a game, but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room. Why? I suppose you've played it?"""" She asked with a dangerous tone in her voice.

""""Sort of. In camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere."""" I confessed, drawing a laugh from the guys. """"L",1

 Made in the USA? http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic.

"My 2c to get beyond the stalemale is to let skeptics raise all controversies surrounding chiropractic, find the best sources to neutrally present the material and roll into into a Criticisms section.  Then those who really care about intricacies and details of the chiropractic story can get on with the show and make the article interesting and not some big stats/research battleground.  For the record, I completely agree 100% that effectiveness of chiropractic care is well established for low back disorders (just as good if not better) that manual therapy is effectiveness in neck pain (Task Force 2008) that the results seem favourable for certain types of headaches (TTH, migraine, cervicogenic/headache of cervical origin) and inconclusive and controversial for non-musculoskeletal disorders.  Part of effectiveness too is patient satisfaction scores which patients routinely display a far greater preference for chiropractic care than medical care for LBP.  This is the most succint and precise summary there is.  We can toss the reference in and call it a day.  A majority of editors agree that the current and past evidence, both in research and 3rd parties (governments) favours chiropractic care.

As best as I can determine, the issues are 1) use of code share in lead & 2) changing tense """"is"""" to """"was"""" (based on this edit). In regards to Wikipedia:AVINAME, the guideline is the following (abridged for clarity): 
""""Where an aviation incident article...begins with the opening sentence: Airline Flight XYZ...., it should go on to immediately describe the notability of the incident in as few as words as possible. For this reason, it is not necessary in the opening line to clarify that the flight number may still be in use, or where it is normally scheduled to fly - this is because the normal flight or flight number is not the subject of the article...For example: Madeup Airway Flight 123 was a passenger flight from Somewhere to Somewhere Else, that on such and such a day, failed/crashed/blew up/was hijacked.

I think the important part of the guideline is what I italicized. I think the code share is important, especially given the media coverage focusing on the men traveling on stolen passports. Whether or not that belongs in the lead doesn't matter to me...it could be a separate sentence or mentioned in the """"incident"""" section. Take a look at the example given in the guideline—Air Florida Flight 90—and the recent high-profile, highly-edited article Air France flight 447. Both use two sentences, first being to state the origin/destination and the second stating the aircraft & what happened. I don't think there needs to be a reference to the men using stolen passports, as officials do not believe they have links to terrorism. It's also difficult to write about the significance of the flight without referencing it as """"crashed"""", per Wikipedia policies. Taking into account what I said, here is a proposal for the lead:

If an official would just refer to the plane as """"presumed crashed"""", then the following could be added as a second paragraph in the lead:

"Glosbe does translate ezman as “heaven” (******) or “sky” (*****) and it back-translates “heaven” as ezman.

 Some definitions from Merriam-Webster Unabridged:

 Heaven. 1. a. … especially, the expanse [of space] that seems to be over the earth like a great … dome — usually used in plural. 2. a. … the place … of the blessed dead.
 Earth. 1. a.  … soil, ground. 2. the sphere of mortal life comprising the world with its lands and seas as distinguished from spheres of spirit life — compare heaven, hell.
 Sky. 1. b. the expanse [of space] appearing as a great vault … over the earth. 2. heaven (def. 2) — often used in plural.
 Tremble. 1. to shake involuntarily (as with fear, cold, excitement, fatigue).

 These two expressions are good idiomatic English:
 “If his wrath is aroused, the skies will tremble [in fear].”
 “If his wrath is aroused, the heavens will tremble [in fear].”
 Here the singular “sky” and “heaven” would not be used in good spoken English, only in mediocre written English.

 So we have a choice of eight ‘very good’ literal translations:
 “YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] skies tremble.”
 “YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] heavens tremble.”

 If you try speaking them aloud, you may find that this one sounds best:
 A. “YPG goes walking, and the earth and heavens tremble.” Something about the meter (the cadence) just makes it sound liks a military motto.

 The present-progressive clause “YPG is walking” would naturally correlate with the present-progressive clause “the earth and skies are trembling.” But we want to use simple present tense in the second clause.  (See above.)

 To do so, a native English speaker would begin with “YPG goes walking …”, because it combines both tenses: simple present and present progressive.

 But see whether you can come up with a better-sounding combination!",0

By trying to """"wipe out"""" Islamic extremists by using force we are only supplying the ISI with more excuses to brainwash Indian Muslims.The mullahs see India's tough stance against terrorism as proof that it is the Indian Government's intention to target Muslims in India.Before we shoot these extremist youth,we need to figure out why educated,young Kashmiri men turn themselves into suicide bombers overnight.The recent case where a Kashmiri man who was employed at an MNC {Johnson&Johnson;} chose to throw his life away and join the mujhahideen shows us how thouroughly the ISI backed mullahs have brainwashed Indian Muslims.Though the concept of suicide bombing is despicable,just take a moment and think how you would feel if you were a mujahideen.You would know exactly when you were going to die,you would know that you were going to be ripped apart by an explosion.Scary thought isn't it?Then what makes these mujahideen so desperate that they would endure this?This is what we need to figure out.The more the VHP tries to deny Muslims the right to live in peace,the more desperate they {the Muslims} will become.The VHP accuses Indian Muslims of being antinational,conveniently forgetting people like APJ Abdul Kalam or Abdul Hamid.""",0

I appreciate your concern (and your humor).

I found this very cruel. So I was forced to upload these images as 'public domain'. The origin of these images is Prof. Svela Protich, whom I know well in person. These are rare photographs of Prof. Protich's teachers- 'one of a kind'- and Prof. Protich determined it's necessary to add them to Wikipedia, for educational and non-profit purposes. However they are NOT to be used for any commercial purposes.

Since you have kindly critiqued my work, which I appreciate greatly, perhaps you can also support me to place the images into the right category (for fair non-profit use) without them getting deleted by the system... I would really appreciate it. MikiMilano  18:31, 4 January 2007 (Kyoto, Japan)",0

Recently the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee has declared that significant global warming is an indisputable fact, and has begun banning people from editing this, and other articles, if they insert sources which question the magnitude or severity of anthropogenic climate change.

However, emotions are high on the issue of global warming, and the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee has decided that it is more important for the climate change articles at Wikipedia to reflect their views on climate change, than it is for the climate change articles to be neutral and impartial in their presentation and content.  Because of this, the reader is strongly cautioned regarding the neutrality of this article's content until this situation is remedied.   —  | Talk 9 July 2005 07:41 (UTC)",0

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of: 1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality). 2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree. 3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs. 4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on. 5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times. 6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to list",1

 criticism of jesus/plucking eyeballs out/slavery

In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, """"but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery,” and argues that Jesus must have then condoned it.

Friedrich Nietsche argued that “a war was declared on passion” in the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says of sexual temptation: """"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out.""""

Chip Berlet's intentional holding back of article progress
Far-left Hoxharian propagandist Chip Berlet is intentionally holding back the progress of the article, and recently removed information and work which took a very long time to build after going through numerous books which I own on the topic, he removed over 50 independent citations in a huge violation of WP:CENSOR, WP:EDIT, WP:OWN and WP:CITE to hold back information from the general public. Especially look at his vandalism of the """"Italian Fascism"""" section. If Chip Berlet in a conflict of interest removes this information again I WILL report his intentional destruction as vandalism. 

I placed th {{underconstruction}} tag at the top of the page for a reason, he should embrace the progressing of the article and respect the concept of the tag instead of trollishly reverting hours and hours of work just because he, in this communist agenda """"doesn't like it"""". Nobody has to ask the permission of Chip Berlet before working on the article and adding vertified information, you do not WP:OWN it or control who can contribute to it and you are not god. Here is what Chip Berlet would like to hold back from the general public who wish to learn about fascism (ie - the people who type """"fascism"""" into wikipedia);

A) what fascism is outside of boogieman cartoon depictions. Devotion to such anti-educational, anti-scholary stances on the part of Cberlet has already made this article decidedly inferior to every other encyclopedias coverage.
B) that Fascism considered itself a Third Position on the political scale, not """"far right"""", with its roots actually in defected members of the Italian Socialist Party (such as Mussolini himself) and anarchists such as the anarcho-syndicalists; not as berlet claims """"far rightists"""". This is a particularly inconvient truth for Chip Barlet who depends on the presenation of fascism as right wing, so that in the United States he can attack followers of the Republican Party. Concepts irrelevent to the entire rest of the world. If fascism is not rightist, Berlet's world crumbles to dust. 
C) the history of fascism, how and why it came about after WWI (Treaty of Versailles, Italy's transition from regionalism to nationalism), what happened in practice, who its intellectuals were, what the Philosopher of Fascism Giovanni Gentile's reason and idea for opposing liberalism and democracy was; the latter is perhaps the most striking by modern considerations and the reader will be wanting to know """"why would these intellectuals think this?"""".
D) Berlet would like to build a collection of names of what fascism """"opposes"""" and stack them all up in the intro. but he refuses to allow what it stands in support of and why; for example he removed the references to national syndicalism and corporativsm from the intro, absoutely essential pieces of this political system. He removed the reference to The Doctrine of Fascism and he removed the section which presents that it is hotlt disputed exactly which movements are and are not fascist apart from the National Fascist Party of Mussolini which is always called Fascist.
E) once again, despite the discussion above with R-41 and myself. Berlet has, against consensus and against WP:CITE entered into the article that fascism is """"race"""" and """"racial"""" orientated, when it has been presented that it specifically is NOT the case and the majority of scholars do not take that line. As racialism belongs to Adolf Hitler's national socialism not all of fascism in general; some scholars such as Jewish writer A.F.K. Organski dispute whether National Socialism is Fascist at all. So to type that fascism is """"racially orientated"""" in the intro is a complete and intentional deception, Berlet is well aware of this and his game is boooooring. That belongs in the intro of Nazism's article, as it already is there.
F) Berlet would like to cover up the fact that the Fascist government under Benito Mussolini waged war on the Mafia, shattering the criminals into little pieces with Cesare Mori leading the way. This is again, an incredibly inconvenient truth for Barlet, because his democratic nation the United States openly collaborated with Lucky Luciano to invade Italy in the first place and then made previously jailed Mafiosi mayors of Sicilian towns after the conquest. 

G) maybe unrelated to Berlet (unless its his other name), but Bobisbob with his IP rather than username, has several times attempted to cover up that Adolf Hitler's movement is called """"National Socialism"""" that is its full and correct title. I presume this editor is a socialist, who wants to distance the use of the word """"socialism"""" from what Hitler called his movement. Well tough luck son you can't go back and rewrite",0

 Hie DVdm. I was writing what follows while you made your edit. I can't right now, but I will coming to review in detail your example.
Thanks Johnuniq for your advice and input. Concerning the actual statement, I had already thought that after clearing things up with DVdm, I would rephrase it into something in the lines of """"He is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s, early 1980s."""" Adding """"to some of the generation"""" should clear your objection about the absence of stats. But that's not the really important issue here. The fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from Wikipedia to declare that the (you call it blog) site is not a reliable source here, but then find that the links and statements in """"Inertia Coupling"""" or """"Alexander Abian"""" are significant enriching contributions to the users of Wikipedia, and the sourced site is reliable there. BTW, in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned, the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. It would be highly objectionable from Wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being, and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts, the links will be trashed out. At this point 1) The sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. 2) It seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote, in most cases some synthesis is involved. 3) There is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. It seems to me that the Wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay, is leading editors to substitute verifiability, intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. This would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to Wikipedia, once lauded as the place """"to come as you are,"""" becoming stiff, purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. This in turn carries into a discussion about public education, and the work that Carl Sagan is known to the general public for. Cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. To me the posts in the disputed site I linked to are interesting (but that maybe just my own personal opinion) and Wikipedia users having them available is positive, constructive and enriching for Wikipedia, and that's the reason I linked to them in the first place. Throwing them out, all of them, seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things, the baby with the bath water, because a Wikipedia directive says so, just because it does, not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening, it would seem to me, not to exclude good things by statute. So the reliable source rules are something I would like to discuss a bit more at length.   """,0

Your rationale for my having removed El Arsenal is misguided - although understandable.

 FAGS 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it had been over a year since",0

 More description of location please? 

Hello, I wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence, maybe in the description section, to explain where this bridge is? I do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things X and Y but if you don't already know Stockton well (or recently!) this is not necessarily all that helpful. I was wondering if you could write a more bottom-up description which says something like """"the bridge crosses the Tees at blah (or near Blah Street etc); it is A hundred metres downstream from the Foo Bridge and B hundred metres upstream from the Bar Barrage"""" or whatever, which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. What do you think? Any yes, of course the maps link does nail it (assuming the co-ordinates are right!) but something in the text which helps in this way would, I think, be very useful. I may be being unusually thick  (happens all the time, actually) but on my first reading - and I was last in Stockton in 2007, you see - I was not at all sure where it was, wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. I cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps, yes, but the sentence I'm asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg.

PMK, first something personal - I think that I am familiar with a part of the problem. I have been in Gora (and I don't agree that they are Macedonians, Gora even is outside of the region of Macedonia), I have been in Reka, in Plasnica and Lisichani in Kichevo region (where the Turkish influence is very high) etc.
I can not accept your POV, that Pomak or other names are offensive. You should provide sources about this claim. However, let us imagine that these names are offensive - look the text in the article after Torbeš: (the latter name is slightly pejorative). What exactly is the problem to make such formulation for the other alternative names?
The term """"Pomak"""" is exonim for more of these communities. Pomak was accepted only from some Slavspeaking Muslims in Tikvesh and in Aegean Macedonoia, but now the biggest part these communities are displaced from the region of Macedonia. This was one of the reasons for my proposal for a compromise, when I added """"in historical context"""". However, I'll repeat that for all of three alternative names we have a serious scholar reference.
I think that it is good idea to add """"Apovci"""" as a regional name of one of this community.
If you have a relevant reference, that the term """"Tatars"""" has such status for Bulgarians (as Pomaks, Bulgarian Pomaks and Bulgarian Muslims for the object of this article), we can discuss it. We both know that the term """"Tatars"""" for Bulgarians is only propaganda, but if you'll find reliable sources for other uses of this term, we can examine them. Until then, the alternative name of the Macedonian Muslims and your analogy will remain incomparable.  """,0

 Scarborough Nicknames 

While I don't really want to expand on this section, there are in fact some web references to Scompton:

You know you're from Scarborugh when...
Busta Rules

There is also a wikipedia page called Canadian slang which references Scompton as well as a couple of other nicknames not mentioned in the Scarborough article. I used Clusty search engine to find these references. Up to you whether you want to put this reference back. I don't care one way or the other.

Regards,  

You're absolutely correct.  Serves me right for editing before my first cup of coffee in the morning.  I found nothing relevant for Scompton, but when I redid the search later, I did get results thru a search for Scompton AND Scarborough. I ought not to have deleted the entry based on a Google search turning up nothing.Personally, I generally don't see any value in having a section for nicknames for the municipality.  But there is obviously precedent for having it (e.g. Toronto).  The problem I have with these sections is that they end up including obvious entries (like """"Hogtown"""" for Toronto), but then also up end up including nicknames that may be used in some circles but don't have particularly wide usage.  The particular problem here in the Scarborough article is that so many of the nicknames have such a negative connotation  perhaps that's just a reflection of public perception, but I do believe that it does, to a degree, give the reader the wrong impression of the place.  Frankly, I am just waiting for someone to add """"Scandahar"""" to the list. I'm not from Scarborough, so I will leave the list in the hands of folks who have a better sense of whether its inclusion is justified.  Given your edits to the article, you are probably better placed to make that call than I. Cheers,  """,0

"Another point to be examined, regarding the controversial interpretations of the NY Times story is the interpretation of this key paragraph, where Picard's name is mentioned, along with two other scientists:

The unspoken and unexamined implication or assumption in the disputed section of this biography is that scientists such as Tour, Picard, and Skell are accurately described by the DI's claim that they are anti-evolution dissenters from Darwin and also supporters of the DI's political agenda, deserving negative publicity for taking such a laughable position.  Did Chang intentionally put that paragraph into his story to affirm the DI's characterization of those three scientists?  Or did Chang put that paragragraph into the story to cast doubt in the reader's mind on the DI's incredulous claim that all signers adhered to the DI's characterization of the signers?

Given that Chang reported both the DI's claims and the string of quotes revealing a mix of support and disdain among the petition signers, a neutral point of view requires that anyone reading Chang's article with a critical eye would ask the obvious question:  Is the reader supposed to take at face value the DI's naked claim that scientists such as those three are anti-evolution dissenters from Darwin who support the DI's political agenda?  Or is the reader supposed to take that paragragh as startling evidence that the claims of the DI stretch credulity.

The way the article is written, a casual reader could draw either conclusion.  A skeptical or fair-minded reader could also draw the conclusion that no firm conclusion can be drawn as to whether any of the signers fit the DI's characterization of them as anti-evolution dissenters from Darwin who support the DI's political agenda.

What conclusion did the various Wikipedia editors draw, and how do they justify treating any such conclusion as an established fact for the purpose of crafting authentic biographies of figures such as Tour, Picard, or Skell?",0

 Context  
To fully understand the nature of Limbaugh's comments, full context of the entire conversation must be included in the article. On the September 26, 2007, radio broadcast of The Rush Limbaugh Show, Limbaugh received telephone calls from two listeners regarding the Iraq War. The first caller, """"Mike in Chicago"""", who identified himself as a Republican and former service member, told Limbaugh, """"I do believe that we should pull out of Iraq."""" Limbaugh argued with the caller and ended up treating him dismissively.  After that call, Limbaugh next spoke to a listener who wanted to """"retort to Mike in Chicago"""" (the original caller).  This second caller, who identified himself as a soldier,  complained that the media never talked to """"real soldiers"""" like himself.  He was clearly responding directly to the first caller, who had told Limbaugh he felt the Iraq War was a mistake.  The current version of the article only contains the conversation with the second caller.  It doesn't make it clear that the second caller's remarks are in response to """"Mike in Chicago""""'s anti-war comments.  This second caller never mentioned Jesse Macbeth at all.  With the addition of the first conversation, the New York Times response that Limbaugh's """"phony soldiers"""" comment was """"referring to Iraq war veterans critical of the war"""" makes sense.  As is, this article is heavily skewed in favor of Limbaugh.  Both sides of the controversy need to be presented.  Right now, this article is simply a Limbaugh-fanatic's wet dream.- """,0

Impacts the 2010 Midterm Congressional Elections has on the 
Presidential Election in 2012
TABIn the 2010 midterm congressional elections, the Republican party took control of the House while the Senate remains a Democrat majority. With the House being in control by the the Republicans, it is going to be difficult, if not impossible to pass legislation without some sort of compromise. With the economy at a low and the unemployment rate still high, the people of The United States are looking for government help to strengthen the economy. President Obama has tried to strengthen the economy with the $800 million dollar stimulus bill. Matt Bai, a New York Times reporter, states in his article about the President, Debt-Busting Issue May Force Obama Off Fence, “And in virtually every case, he has satisfied pretty much no one.” With the 2012 presidential election in two years, both parties will need to gain the approval of the American people to succeed in the election.
TABThe outcome of the 2010 midterm congressional election shows that the 2012 presidential election will be based upon which party can demonstrate that they are going to help the economy grow and act upon the self-interests of the people.
TABMany are attempting to draw upon historical context to predict the outcome of the next presidential election. Some people believe that Obama will be a one term President. Marc Pascal, a writer for The Moderate Voice in: economy, law, politics, and society, states in his opinion piece, Obama will be a one-term President, “2010 is not a parallel to 1994, 1894, or to any other noteworthy year identified by various pundits across the political spectrum. What worked sufficiently well in the 1980’s and the 1990’s for Presidents Reagan and Clinton will not be appropriate for the myriad of challenges facing our nation in 2010 and beyond.” Pascal relates Obama to be more like Presidents Hoover and Carter who were “one-term” Presidents. Pascal compares President Obama with Hoover by stating, “The start of the Great Recession began before the presidential elections.” Pascal looks back with President Hoover and relates his presidency with Obama's, “Contrarily President Hoover was elected before the 1929 collapse and his efforts, over the next 3 years were wholly unsuccessful in extricating the U.S. from a deep and structural Depression. This huge failure naturally resulted in the 1932 election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Democrats running things for the next 16 years.”  
TABIn Pascal's analysis, he concluded that looking back to President Hoover's presidency as well with President Carter's presidency, Obama would suffer the same fate as they did by only serving one term as president. However, not everyone agrees with Pascal's conclusion. Historical analysis shows that this can swing in Obama's favor.
TABUsing the opposite argument, you could say that President Clinton took a huge blow in the 1994 midterm elections of his presidency with a loss of 52 House seats along with eight Senate seats, thus putting Clinton's Presidential agenda in jeopardy. With President Clinton's popularity down in the 1994 midterm elections, President Clinton was able to meet halfway with the Republican legislature allowing him to win the 1996 presidential election. Also in 1938, the biggest loss in midterm election history, President Franklin D. Roosevelt lost 71 House seats and six Senate seats. With Roosevelt suffering tremendous losses in his 1938 midterm election, he was still able to run and continue in office for his third and fourth terms. Another President  who won re-election after a huge blow in the midterm election is Harry Truman. President Truman lost 45 House seats and 12 Senate seats during the 1946 midterm election but still won re-election in 1948. With President Obama loosing a historical 63 House seats and six Senate seats in the 2010 midterm elections, history shows it does not mean President Obama will loose re-election in 2012 due to losses in the last midterms.
TABThe economy in the United States is currently at a standstill. With President Obama signing the stimulus bill, the free-falling economy was saved from further peril. People in The United States are not satisfied with the way that Obama is handling the economy. Updated on December 1, 2010 Obama has approval ratings of 25 percent strong support, but he still faces a high 42 percent disapproval (Rasmussum Reports). With Obama having such a high percentage of those against his policies, he will need to attempt to meet with the Republicans halfway on upcoming legislation. At this moment in time Obama is having little luck compromising with the Republicans. Tamara Lytle quotes President Obama in an AARP bulletin, “We're going to need to work together — Democrats and Republicans and independents — to get it all done. But, you know what,",0

Wikipedias sanctioned trolls: stop vandalizing and spreading your anti-Christian and anti-theism propaganda

Why are you hiding this edit?:

Criticisms of macroevolution

The term """"macroevolution"""" frequently arises within the context of the evolution/creation debate, usually used by creationists alleging a significant difference between the evolutionary changes observed in field and laboratory studies and the larger scale macroevolutionary changes that scientists believe to have taken thousands or millions of years to occur. They may accept that evolutionary change is possible within animal kinds, which change is referred to as """"microevolution"""", but deny that one animal kind can evolve into another, which change is called """"macroevolution"""".

The terms macroevolution and microevolution as used in mainstream science relate to the same processes operating at different scales, but creationist claims misuse the terms in a vaguely defined way which does not accurately reflect scientific usage, acknowledging well observed evolution as """"microevolution"""" and denying that """"macroevolution"""" takes place.CB902: Microevolution is distinct from macroevolution.

The Darwinists Nicholas Matzke and Paul R. Gross have accused creationists of using """"strategically elastic"""" definitions of micro- and macroevolution when discussing the topic. The actual definition of macroevolution accepted by scientists is """"any change at the species level or above"""" (phyla, group, etc.) and microevolution is """"any change below the level of species."""" Matzke and Gross state that many creationist critics define macroevolution as something that cannot be attained, as these critics describe any observed evolutionary change as """"just microevolution"""".

Arguments often arise between creationists and so called evolutionists over evolutionists' failure to recognize the word """"kind"""" in Genesis as not being equivalent to the word """"species"""",http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/feedback/2006/0908.asphttp://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/am/v2/n2/two-of-every-kind

God makes the animals (Genesis 2:18) and parades them before Adam to see if any would strike his fancy.  But none seem to have what it takes to please him.  After making the animals, God has Adam name them all.  The naming of several million species must have kept Adam busy for a while, why Adam would still have to be living for we haven’t even discovered nor named all the species.  Also consider the idea of every living creature being brought to the Middle East, that would have killed many animals due to climatic changes.http://www.evilbible.com/absurd%20torah%20science.",0

thanks for being helpfull with a witty parody, closing my nomination because i didn't put enough effort into it. i understand that contributing to wikipedia is supposed to be a chore, and that it is MY duty as a wikipedian to understnad the full letter of wikipedia policy, regardless of how utterly unclear and dispersed the information is presented in the wikipedia: articals.

it seems only obvious that wikipedia is a unpayed job, and anyone that gets frustrated over the amount of work wikipedia demands from it's users that create it's contend deserves to be made such a satire of. obviously such efforts need to be made in vain, rather then helping out if one does know the ropes, because what wikipedia needs above all is elitism of the lifeless that did manage to get through and understand all the policies and rules involved in such actions as nominating categories for deletion.

There is no good hand / bad hand here, that's a total misuse of that concept, another attempt to smear me with no grounds whatsoever. This is not an """"alternate persona"""", this is me talking the way I talk, trying to resolve an issue with another user the way I would do normally, a user I have no prior conflict with or any intention of alarming or harassing. In this case however, for sound common sense reasons that you two would do well not to feign ignorance of given neither of you are new admins, I just don't happen to want to make my other contributions available to all and sundry just because I happened to have decided to try and do that. ErrantX, if you want to continue to smear my actions in the most despicable way, by trying to paint what were civil, polite queries, as a """"pursuit"""", and you want to continue to insult me by insinuating I'm a coward, then I guess there's nothing I can do stop you given you've been entrusted with the power to do so. But I'll take the fact that neither of you are prepared to detail what part of WP:SOCK I have actually violated, or indeed identify which part of WP:HARASS I am supposedly guilty of, as evidence that you can't. Not to mention neither of you seem prepared to present any evidence that Malleus himself felt threatened or alarmed by the conversation, or had asked me to leave and I had refused to do so. I guess you two can live with that I suppose, but mark my words, if or when there's an arbitration case concerning Malleus' conduct, then I'll be entering this experience into evidence, and adding User:ErrantX and User:Bwilkins as admin parties to it, with questions to answer as to why they chose to block off an attempt at civil discourse with the user, who neither requested the communication to stop, or said he felt threatened or harassed by it in any way. I did have half a mind to try and continue the conversation here if Malleus was willing, given that there's some simple concluding statements that arise from it that I'd have liked to have seen whether he was happy to sign off on or not, but I get the sense that you two would probably block talk page access for some spurious reason, whether he was interested in doing so or not. I sincerely hope there's nothing deeper than simple admin over-reaching going on here, but precedent says otherwise with these types of disputes. I'm sadly reminded by your actions of several other cases which ended up at arbitration simply because people were unwilling to follow some basic steps like AGF, indeed the steps outlined in policy. So, you just content yourselves that you've done something good here, and I'll just get back to my main account and do my thing there, and we'll see what the future holds for all of us.

The vicious attacks on Ward Churchill

Ward Churchill appears to be the latest author attacked by a strikling super-conservative country. I have been reading a lot about American sociology lately, as it relates to the violent suppresion of the left*.  

I knew little about Churchill, and had a negative view of him because of his 9/11 article and infamous """"little eichman"""" quote.  I then stumbled upon one of his articles:

It was absolutly incredible.  Ward Churchill is an incredible historian. What do these attacks on Ward Churchill do?  They cause Americans to shy away from reading Churchill's work, and they send a clear message to others who may want to attack American foreign policy: that you can lose your job if you criticize America, that you will be attacked viciously if you criticize America.  It is the latest form of American suppression of the Left.

I am just interested if there is a list of authors, or a book or article about those who have been """"Swift Boated"""" like Churchill.  If so, I would like to add this to the article.  I think Americans need to know how America's sophisticated Propoganda system** operates. 

*Including such books as , which asks such questions as why has America had more people killed in labor disputes than any other country?  Why doesn't America have a labor party like other industrialized countries?  Why are union numbers so low in America compared to other industrialized countries?

You tend to believe yours ... and we tend to disbelieve ours.""""
Soviet correspondent based five years in the U.S.

When I first visited Russia, in 1986, I made friends with a musician whose father had been Brezhnev's personal doctor. One day we were talking about life during 'the period of stagnation' - the Brezhnev era. 'It must have been strange being so completely immersed in propaganda,' I said.

'Ah, but there is the difference. We knew it was propaganda,' replied Sacha. 

That is the difference. Russian propaganda was so obvious that most Russians were able to ignore it. They took it for granted that the government operated in its own interests and any message coming from it was probably slanted - and they discounted it.

In the West the calculated manipulation of public opinion to serve political and ideological interests is much more covert and therefore much more effective. Its greatest triumph is that we generally don't notice it - or laugh at the notion it even exists.

"""==MTA==
Technically, the MBTA replaced the MTA; it is legally not a descendant, but a new agency to which all of the assets of the old agency were transferred.  The MTA was financed under the authority of the Boston Metropolitan District (no relation to the Metropolitan District Commission), which persisted until all its bonds were retired in the late 1980s or early 1990s (check US Census Bureau's census of governments for details), long after the MBTA took over from the MTA.  (Many parts of what we now think of as the MBTA system were actually started under MTA jurisdiction.)

Track connections between subway lines
As far as I know, there are no connections, direct OR indirect between the lines. The Red Line MAY have a connection to the Commuter Rail at the Cabot Yard or at a track near Neponset (just north of the Neponset River), but I doubt it. The Blue Line has no connections to any other rail lines. I think the Orange Line has a connection at Wellington, and the Green Line has only Riverside. So there MAY very indirect connections between the Red, Orange and Green, but they are never used except in emergencies (like when the Green Line flooded and Commuter Rail trains served Riverside).   

Just checked a few sources. A June 2000 track map shows no connection at Wellington or anywhere else on the Orange Line. Same for the Red Line. Of course it also shows no Green Line connection at Riverside, and I know that exists (but is usually fenced off). The track I remember at Neponset is a dead end (Java). At Cabot Yard (Red Line) and South Bay Yard (Commuter Rail) the two systems are totally separated, lookign at aerials on that same site. So the only one remaining to check is Wellington.   

Now the Orange Line USED to connect via Everett Shops, as did the Green Line (via surface tracks under the El). And the Blue and Red connected over the Longfellow Bridge, and there may have been a connection at Eliot Street Yard in Harvard connecting the Red Line to the streetcar line to Watertown and thus the Green Line, but I'm not sure about that. But at one point the Longfellow Bridge track did connect to other streetcar tracks. And I think I found a connection north of Wellington on aerials at http://www.globexplorer.com/ , but I'm not sure - shouldn't be too hard to spot from the Commuter Rail (harder from the Orange Line because of the unused east track) if it exists. But even if there is an Orange-Green connection via Commuter Rail (and fairly direct at that, using the Grand Junction Line), I would very much doubt it gets any use.   

So how do you figure all those nice new Red Line cars were delivered from Barre, Vermont?

 

Ah, here we go. Blue has none. Red has one at JFK/UMass, Orange has one at Wellington (last used ca. 1981), and Green has one at Riverside. None appear to be used at the present time. It would be rather misleading to suggest that there are in fact connections. How's this?

And I have the autographed documents to prove it. So, Andrew, if you have something constructive (some actual knowledge) to contibute, then please do so. But this is nothing more than a personal vendetta against me for speaking out against individuals who have been publishing misinformation.

"Delhi as Primary Hub 
Air India recently made Delhi as its Primary Hub. This is very much true because Delhi has more Air India Flights than Mumbai. The reason for doing this was that Mumbai is over saturated and over-crowded compared to Delhi. Each and every new aircraft lands at Delhi during its delivery flight.
Paris and Tokyo now originate from Delhi and not from Mumbai. No new destinations are being launched from Mumbai compared to Delhi which has seen Washington,D.C. and Toronto flights. This is enough proof that Delhi is Air India's new Primary hub.

I have come to the conclusion that Wikipedia is no different than any other source of misinformation.

At the end of a talk page post about the green text, Bishonen suddenly decides to refer to it as """"dye"""":  FoF Not at all forced or contrived. Lots of people refer to text as dye. Or if they don't, they should do.
Bishonen ends her post with  """"Green dye!"""" which reads as """"Green die!"""": Fof Pure coincidence. Nina Green couldn't have been further from Bishonen's mind when she wrote """"Green dye!"""". Bishonen hadn't though of Nina Green for at least 30 seconds.

FOF: This entire sequence events: Bishonen wants Nina banned, gets what she wants, posts in green text, decides to call text """"dye"""", and ends her post for no apparent reason with """"Green dye!"""" is just a random bubble of billion-to-one-coincidence.

Biography and creativity
 
[edit] Early years
 
Viktoria Daynekos born on 12 May 1987 in village in the Kirov Taldy-Kurgan area. Her childhood was spent in the Yakut city Mirny (Yakutia). Since her childhood, she dreamed of becoming a variety singer, but her parents did not take her desire seriously. In school, Victoria (Vika) started to sing various Mirny (Yakutia) musical genres, mainly covering the hits of others. As she was in a small town, without any special educational institutions, Vika educated herself.  Vika seriously engaged the English language.
 
[edit] Star Factory
 
Alla Pugacheva is DOUBTLESS a link here... should be looked up and added

In 2004 Victoria was the participant of the Channel One’s teleproject Star Factory Series 5 under the direction of Alla Pugacheva, which she won. Within the limits of the teleproject, Victoria sang two solo songs — «I will be better» and """"Leila"""".  Vika also sang a duet with Alexander Marshal «Dreamed me». ((I Dreamed?!  Dreamed of me,?!)) The duet was so pleasant to the public, that it has been decided to make a joint clip — Victoria's first video.
 
[edit] """"Post-factory"""" life
 
[edit] 2005—2006
 
After the termination of the teleproject, Victoria began serious work Igor Matvienko. The debut clip of singer for the song """"Leila"""" was shot in 2005 in Thailand. New songs with which, Vika acted on the various platforms, new further clips have followed. In parallel with this development, Victoria's life was often discussed in press—in 2006, the singer dated the member of the group «Korni» Pavel Artemyev. Although the affair did not last long, it has left a trace — a clip plot on a song of Dayneko «I will simply leave from you at once» (""""Я просто сразу от тебя уйду"""") based on the idea of director Victor Priduvalov and a hit has been closely connected with the Korni’s clip «You want I will sing to you» (""""Хочешь, я тебе спою"""")
 
[edit] 2007
 
In the beginning of 2007, Victoria wrote a soundtrack to the film «In expectation of a miracle» — «Film not about love».  A videoclip on this song was made in parallel with filming.
 
She was nominated in the autumn of 2007 as «Best performer» in the MTV Russia Music Awards. ((Fragment, as a result of having conceded to the singer MakSim.)) Also she was the winner channel Fashion TV award «fashion-singer of 2007».
 
In the beginning of the same year, Victoria took part in photos for April issue of magazine Playboy, which she has regretted.
 
In 2007 she also participated in the project Glacial Age. In this project she was """"star"""", being trained and supported by Alexei Yagudin — the first class figure skater. Victoria and Alexei reached the project ending, but did not reach prize-winning places.
 
With Alexei, Vika wrote a song """"Needle"""", of which there has been made a videoclip. There are rumours about a novel.  To date, theya re only rumours.
 
Also in 2007 Victoria tried out in film. She appeared in a a small, bit part, in a teleserial «Happy Together», where Vika has played herself; She has also has voiced the main heroine Panti in an animation «Noev an ark» with the Russian version of a Gloria Gaynor’s song «I Will Survive».
 
[edit] 2008— present

The band, hungover, boarded a plane at London Heathrow Airport early on 4 January; a few hours later, the Evening News was reporting that the band had """"vomited and spat their way"""" to the flight. Despite categorical denials by the EMI representative who accompanied the group, the label, which was under political pressure, released the band from their contract.

Narayana Guru and Atheism

I disagree with the text in this section. Associating Narayana Guru with atheism clearly shows the lack of knowledge of the originating author on the Guru's philosophical and metaphysical works and perspective and reasoning of the Universe. Proclaimed atheists being associated with an individual in social reform initiatives does not by itself make the individual an atheist.

Also there is a clear distinction between rationalists and atheists.

Narayana Guru and Sahodran Ayyappan

Narayana Guru had disagreed with Sahodaran Ayyappan when the latter tried to corrupt Guru's teachings with Atheism.In fact Ayyappan requested Guru's permission to modify the slogan  'Oru Jati , Oru Matham, Oru Daivam Manushyanu' as 'Jati Venda, Matham Venda, Daivam Venda'. However, Guru ridiculed him by asking """" If Ayyappan wants to collect Rs.1 from each person to set up a library,  you will ask ' Give One Rupee,Give One Rupee,Give One Rupee'. Does that mean ' No Rupee,No Rupee,No Rupee """" ?

This 'Sahodaran' kept quiet at that time.However, he renewed his Atheist activities after the samadhi of Guru, thereby corrupting Guru's ideology. Vested interests fully exploited this confusion to corrupt Guru's teachings by projecting this 'Sahodaran' even above Guru.

Clarification on Atheism

No where in the article did I say that Naryanaguru was an atheist. What I wrote was “his attitude towards the existence of a personal god is considered quite ambivalent” and that many of his followers had considered him an atheist.  Can somebody point out which sentence of the article gives such an impression that he was an atheist?  It goes to the credit of Sri Narayanaguru that in spite of being a theist, he openly accepted even atheists as his core desciples. The importance of this can be guaged only if one consideres the period in which he lived.

One also has to be clear about the kind of thiesm Narayana Guru adovocated. It definitely was not the one associated with the brahaminical/casteist Hiduism.

I find it bit difficult to comprehend why this section on atheism and atheist followers of Narayanaguru should be edited out.  A discussion/debate on the philosophy of Narayanaguru is thoroughly understandable but I find it puzzling that the followers of Narayanaguru are getting overly agitated on hearing the word atheism. Pity indeed! 

And I agree with Aaroamal that there is a distintion between rationalist and atheist. That is precisely why I assert in my user page of wikipedia that I am both an atheist and rationalist.

 Clarification on Atheism 

Manoj, True, you did not explicitly write that Narayana Guru was an atheist. However, you implicitly structured a (misinformed and incomplete) statement as follows:

 “When Sahodaran Ayyappan modified Narayana Guru's famous catchphrase, Oru Jati, Oru Matham, Oru Daivam Manushyanu (One Caste, One Religion, One God for Humanbeing) and re-written it as Jati Venda, Matham Venda, Daivam Venda Manushyanu…the latter did not protest”. 

Obviously by stating that “…the latter did not protest”, here you are clearly implying that Narayana Guru accepted Sahodaran Ayyappan’s atheistic view as amendment to the famous catchphrase. I am sorry to say that this is absolutely false!

Everybody appreciates that Narayana Guru was tolerant of atheists because he respected an individual’s fundamental right and freedom to belief, or disbelief, in the exitence of God. That tolerant attitude however should not be misinterpreted to imply otherwise.

On a serious note, will it get deleted if I list myself as a key mod on the GS staff? I really am a mod, and one of the mods you listed isn't even a mod anymore. I would consider taking off the mod who's not even a mod anymore and adding myself to be a legit update. 

I remember they locked the IGN topic once, and it was there for several days. 

Once this page is fully open, would anyone mind a total rewrite that would cover everything about GameSpot ever?

Read some reviews, the people at Gamespot are pretty tough.

That's purely anecdotal evidence, which is useless. Go pick up a game box sometime. The developers love quoting positive reviews from Gamespot and IGN  

While it may be POV, me and everybody I know certainly believes it to be true.  

I actually don't see as many gamers trumpeting Gamespot's reviews on thier boxes as you would have us believe. I believe your opinion is just that.

I agree, it should be reworded as 'Many people see gamespot as the most brutally honest... etc... etc.. etc..', this article is full of POV information, a definite rewrite should be in order.

 First project for Wikipedia 

As of April 2, 2008, edited this page as first project.  Any comments appreciated.  Did the following:
 From previous posts, learned that page direction was for terminology, not necessarily biology. But added more succinct genetic information citation to definition, making the body of the text heavier.  Added short biology section because of this.
 Found more usage of the term """"black sheep."""" Depending on the group culture using the phrase, it was either positive or negative, so further clarified usage by splitting the term into two groupings with citations and examples for each.  I know Baa Baa Black Sheep was removed once.  However, it is an example of the use of the term.  The other examples should be obvious.  If not how do I clarify.
 Did not find a standard template for citation on this page.  Would anyone let me know what the standard for this page is and how it was chosen, and I will go back and change.  Thanks.   """,0

If there is a genus under anther code with the same name, then we do indeed use different disambiguators, but where there is only one, """" (genus)"""" is by far the best disambiguator.

Albania Veneta

Dear Jimbo, 

I appreciate very much what you are doing with your Wikipedia. It is a great gift to all of us. But there are some """"points"""" that need to be improved, as you know. 

One is the presence of nationalistic groups that in a coordinate way want to impose their points of view without regard of what write serious historians. They usually proceed to ask for help from """"friendly to them"""" administrators and so obtain what they want. In Eastern Europe there are many of these groups (mainly ex-communists) and often are associated with hackers. 

What do we have to do with these nationalistic groups? In my case I can pinpoint what is going on with the articles """"Albania Veneta"""", """"Zadar"""", """"Istrian exodus"""", etc., where a group of known nationalistic fanatics (like one nicknamed in the english wikipedia as """"Direktor"""") are erasing and damaging what write others with serious and proven references. They use the typical misinformation with """"political pressure"""" of the Soviets in Eastern Europe. 

May be you have a serious and impartial administrator, who can help? 
Regards. 

This seems to be a dispute about naming conventions and reliable sources. Naming convention disputes should be solved by determining the names most often used by English speakers and using them without regard to ethnic sympathies. Disputes concerning reliable sources should be raised on WP:RSN. When different reliable sources disagree, they should both be represented in the article with a description of the differences in order to satisfy WP:NPOV. It seems likely that both sides of this dispute have relatively equally reliably sources which conflict.  Welcome to the Balkans. ←BenB4 """,0

""""He stayed with the Yankees for two months, getting several chances to play as a pinch hitter."""" - who stayed? I'm getting the impression that it's Gehrig, and we don't need all this detail about him in an article about Krichell. The focus is straying.
""""On August 1, Huggins decided to send Gehrig to the Hartford Senators, where the team instructed the manager of the club to play him every day at first base, regardless of circumstances.[24]  After a hot start in Hartford, Gehrig went though a long slump and depression, leading him to consider quitting baseball."""" - more about Gehrig; there's some important stuff here but it needs to be reduced to just enough to provide context for Krichell's trip.
""""Krichell was emergency deployed"""" - something's not right with that wording, because """"emergency"""" is not an adjective. I don't know if """"deployed"""" is the right word either, as he's not a military unit. Maybe """"dispatched""""?

OK, Obi-wan. You're starting to make me suspicious. What do you always ask exactly what I think are the right questions? Own up. Either way, you did not answer my question directly, and I also suspect you know it. """"Does this mean that WPO is not useful to you?"""" But you did answer it indirectly. So you get an even more direct question in return: Why make it obvious that you know a lot about Wikipedia, without telling us that you find it useful when you are a very direct person otherwise? For one, you are calling them out on the most inconvenient of all questions for them. If you don't mind, I'm going to take this straight to the source: WPO peeps, what the dealio? I've asked people on WP to put up or shut up. I've asked the WMF to walk their talk. In fact, I've staked my rep several times now, and I'm not done yet. Now I'm asking you, why don't you stop whining for once and show people you can actually do better? On-wiki or off-, Obi-wan certainly isn't the first to question your self-righteous assertions on how to build an online encyclopedia better than Wikipedia. I, for one, have been wondering for a while now. So, let's see what you can do besides making snarky, personal comments. Here's a pot, and here's a kettle. Need I mention what color they are?
Onwards with Obi-wan's points. I don't believe in nasty people. Deciding anyone is bad, nasty, etc. has only one purpose; one can feel better about being bad, nasty, etc. to people they've so judged. I don't think this is particularly productive. In fact, IMO it is unbelievably destructive once someone decides- or, more often, others have convinced them- that they themselves are bad people. We could talk about this more in another thread, but we've got to get back on topic here, so. . . You know that the Wikipediocrats are smart. You have spent more time there than you're willing to admit directly. I immediately wonder if it's just in reading or in writing, too. ) They are indeed among the smartest in the WP community reasoning-wise that I've met so far. But emotionally. . . less than average. How do you think many of these smart m'er f'ers ended up getting indef blocked or banned? A lot of them fell from grace, not because they weren't an asset to the community, but because they didn't seem to know when- or they were completely unwilling- to stop fighting for what they saw as justice. That's one part of the answer; many of them are banned or blocked- whether rightly so or not- from editing on Wikipedia. Also, it's normal for someone who has been banished to tell themselves they wish harm on their homeland, while still keeping a great emotional investment in it. You'll hear the same people spout their disdain for Wikipedia almost in the same breath as suggestion to improve it. Frankly, we could speculate about these people's motives and methods til the sun goes down. Let's be more practical about what is best for Wikipedia here. What we, as a Wikipedia community, can't do is ignore them away. And, even if we could, we're doing a piss-poor job of it, because I almost always hear about what's been said on Wikipediocracy from a Wikipedian before I go to the actual site. Ultimately, I go back to my old standard: I don't give a shit where these people come from or what their motives are; all's I know is that they are saying something interesting, and I appreciate the fact that I don't have to gloss over a bunch of posts that are trying to get them to shut up as I read it. Obi-wan, no use playing coy. You know exactly what I'm talking about. D   """,0

I doubt anyone would want you to quit (I know I don't!), but it is very important that you respect copyrights.  IMHO, nothing is a bigger threat to the continued success of Wikipedia than copyvios.  The potential for the foundation to get sued is far bigger than it is for libel by far.  I have been screamed at, told off and generally put in my place dozens of time since I have been here and fully expect that I will again, many times.  It would be really nice if everyone here was kind and respectful, but, just like society in general, that just isn't the case.  My suggestion to you is to ask questions, get help when you need it, make friends and continue to work on articles you like.  The best thing I did after I got here was to get adopted.  There is no textbook for this, and adoption provides you with a teacher that will walk you through the ropes, and be around after you graduate to mentor you.  Another great thing here is the Teahouse.  It is a place especially for newer users to ask questions and get answers without attitude.  My dad always used to say that the only stupid question was the one you didn't ask, and the Teahouse definitively follows that credo.  I will leave you an invite after this message.

There isn't really a need for the tag to be on the article itself. As was successfully argued regarding the """"dispute tag"""" previously, the tag itself doesn't help the article, and it being on the talk page achieves the same end.  

Having a warning on the front page shows that the article is in a state of flux.  Anyone who isn't particularly wiki-savvy wouldn't realize that there is an ongoing dispute and that the current version may well change in the near future.  The """"non-endorsement"""" of the current name of the article is a reasonable point to make.  I don't particularly care for either name, but making it look stable when it's unclear is kind of misleading to the reader.  

You're not making a lot of sense. The first sentence of the article notes the naming of the country. I believe you were involved with the discussion regarding the """"Dispute"""" tag, and it came to the point where the only sensible solution was to have it on the talk page. The same applies with this tag. It has nothing to do with honesty and I'd be insulted if I didn't assume good faith.

Look at the discussion on this page regarding the name dispute tag.  I wouldn't say that there was a consensus that removing the tag was the only """"sensible solution"""".
The statement is true and not misleading.  Neither staying nor moving are WP:SNOWBALL.
Protection tags are usually on the front page of the article.  See WP:PROTECT#Other_notes for talk page templates.
The tag deflects mastodons: Having the tag on the article itself sends a clear message to people who might just assume that the name is wrong and move it.
The tag shows that the current name of the article is not a consensus statement: Not having the tag implies to a casual reader that the current name is appropriate (not the current consensus because there is no consensus).
It seems kind of redundant to you or me since we've been staring at it for the last couple of weeks, but to someone who is not already involved it shows that the article is not stable.  I mean, I really don't care that much, but why is it so critical to take it off?

Well it has been changed, also it may have been recorded in 1976 but no singles were released and the album wasn't released then so no one could hear it or buy it. The references are in the inlay booklets provided with CD's so don't delete it. Also it clearly states her hit singles career was very much gone by the 1980's after several changes in musical styles, many of which finished off bands that were in when Suzi Quatro was at her peak. It was new wave that finally finished Suzi's recording career, that and motherhood. Also what is this rubbish about her being a major rock star? I could perhaps agree she was in the 1970's but certainly not now! Infact most young people below about 25 have probably never even heard of her. She had her last U.K top 75 hit in 1982 and her last hit in America in 1981 for crying out loud!

"Disruptive Editing to Ryanair article

The Ryanair Ciampino meets notability guidelines in WP:AIRCRASH, specificially It is the first or worst accident for a particular airline or airliner.

I have no desire to belong to bin Laden's group, only to create factually correct articles. If we created an article incorporating the World Islamic Front (WIF) with the larger organization created by the WIF through their Jihad Against Zionists and Crusaders fatwa, it would incorrectly identify members of the larger organization as being strictly Islamic.

I find the remarks here of great interest, and indeed raise both issues I have considered at length and those which I have never considered before.

a) Discrimination:: clear this list maybe hetergenous, but is clearly not indiscriminate. On the contrary, groups of Masons have discussed together and made certain decisions about their relations of amity with one another This is clear discriminate behaviour. As regards notability, clear the discussion about whether UGLE recognised the Rite of Memphis-Misraim in the 1850's clearly involved political decisions taking place in consequence of the Revolutions of 1848. Involving such key figures at Louis Blanc and Guiseppe Garibaldi, this is clearly highly notable people and events. And there has yet to be any serious discussion of the role of revolutionary freemasonry in the International Workingmen's Association, which will also of couse link us into the very contraversial figure of Mihail Bakunin. Onfortunately these issues are all far too notable.

b) verifiability Well, this also relates to falsifiability and what is considered to be the truth. I have found the writings of Charles Peirce very helpful in this respect.

c) Likewise  raises the issue of original research. This means that Wikipedia is immedtiately functioning at the level of intertextuality - i.e. the information contained on a wikipedia pagelinks other pieces of text, from which peopel may infer facts or events existing outside language. I would further argue that teh distinction between original research are the difference between relying on publisjed sources and unpublished ones, institutional denioted by the separate organisation of archives and libraries. I agree with [User:ALR|ALR]] that the task is a bit daunting, however if we can entice the anarcho-capitalists who produced such wonders on teh anacrhism talk pages a while ago I am sure we can create a suitable masters carpet of information from which Mason and Cowan can freely, fairly and friendly learn from and inform their fellow sentient creatures who have access to the internet.

"Iranian Commanders
Lets Get something straight here; I will tell you who was really a commander on the Iranian Side. 

Ayatollah Khomeini- The Supreme leader controls the Army and the Pasdaran, so Khomeini is without a doubt a commander.

Ayatollah Khamenei- The president maintains some control over the army and while he reports to the Supreme Leader, he still welds significant control over their day to day operations, therefore Khamenei is Also a Commander

Mostafa Chamran- he was the Minister of Defense and a General under the Early stages of the war. He was killed in Action late in 1981. So he would have been sincerely a comander.

Ali Sayad Shirazi- Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces during the War, no question about his classification as a Commander.

Mohsen Rezaee- Commander of the Pasdaran, Heavily involved in the fighting, again, no question.

Now here are people who should not be classified as commander. 

Abdolhassan Banisadr- President but He was impeached in the first days of the war, so he never commandered anything during the War.

Mohammad Ali Rajai- President only for less than three weeks after Banisadr, so he never commandered anything. 

Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani- Throught his career as a cleric during the War, Rafsanjani never went into affairs regarding the military (exception being the Iran-Contra Affair) and simply worked with business within the country.

Mir Hossein Mousavi- The Prime Minister did not wield any power over the military, he simply worked exclusively on affairs within the country.

 Replaceable fair use Image:George_fenton_composer.jpg 

Thanks for uploading Image:George_fenton_composer.jpg.

Hi Werdna,someone correctly noted at WP:Requests for comment/May 2010 skin change/Bug reports#Widen the edit box to fill the entire screen that the preferences option """"Widen the edit box to fill the entire screen"""" doesn't actually do that. I notice that you changed the wording of that option one year ago, in rev:49553. Two questions:
 Was that requested or discussed anywhere, or more an ad-hoc wording and we can just tweak it to something like """"Widen the edit box to fill the available space""""?
 Why is that option in there in the first place? Seems to me that width:100% would be a good default for all installations, and site admins can just tweak it in their installations' CSS if they want.

Meetup

You may well have seen a site notice about the next Cambridge meetup, this Saturday 29 May. I thought those who have been in the past should have a personal invite, too.   

 What the hell? 

What the hell is """"It is my polite recommendation that you continue to contribute in areas in which you can make constructive contributions (like RfA) instead of making provocative comments in lieu of contributing to others"""" supposed to mean? I have virtually no involvement with RFA, and AFAIK am the single highest contributor of FAs to WP:LONDON; have you confused me with someone else?

As per my initial comments when the BM scheme was announced, I have serious reservations about creating formal ties between Wikipedia—whose prime selling point is editorial independence and a neutral point of view—and with any one museum, university or other institution. Quite aside from the glaring COI issue of an organisation paying people to promote their exhibits, nobody has even touched on the tax issues of paid editing being channelled (directly or indirectly) through the WMF. As you may know, I'm generally supportive of the idea of paid editing—I don't see how someone paid to promote an organisation differs from a fan of a band writing about said band, provided the COI is declared and the writer adheres to NPOV—but the talkpage of an almost moribund WikiProject is certainly not the place to unilaterally overturn what was a pretty overwhelming consensus at WP:Requests for comment/Paid editing. – scent 

 So you had serious and substantial reservations, and you decided to express them by making provocative comparisons? It's like the Wikipedia version of Godwin's Law.
 I've already made my own arguments about the importance of intent and outcome in """"paid editing"""", on the discussion page itself.  Saying that the British Museum is """"paying people to promote their exhibits"""", is at odds with the facts of this situation (as Liam has explained). I have no comment on """"tax issues"""", and consider that outside of the community's remit in any case — it can be dealt with by the Foundation, if indeed money is being """"channeled through"""" the latter. Your comments on circumventing community consensus have no relevance to me; if you'd like to make a big drama-fest out of somebody offering incentives to write featured-quality articles about notable historical artifacts, then I invite you to do so and see what response you get. —  • talk 

No, I had serious and substantial reservations, as did David Cane, and we listed them in great detail at the time the proposal was announced; to his extreme credit and unlike you, Liam paid the courtesy of answering them in detail rather than posting a rambling personal attack. (Still waiting for that explanation of what """"It is my polite recommendation that you continue to contribute in areas in which you can make constructive contributions (like RfA) instead of making provocative comments in lieu of contributing to others"""" is supposed to mean.)

On Croats
.........

But the Croats at that time were dwelling beyond Bavaria, where the Belocroats are now. From them split off a family of five brothers, Kloukas and Lobelos and Kosentzis and Mouchlo and Chrobatos, and two sisters, Touga and Bouga, who came with their folk to Dalmatia and found the Avars in possession of that land. After they had fought one another for some vears, the Croats prevailed and killed some of the Avars and the remainder they compelled to be subject to them. And so from that time this land was possessed by the Croats, and there are still in Croatia some who are of Avar descent and are recognized as Avars. The rest of the Croats stayed over against Francia, and are now called Belocroats, that is, white Croats, and have their own prince ; they are subject to Otto, the great king of Francia, or Saxony, and are unbaptized, and intermarry and are friendly with the Turks. From the Croats who came to Dalmatia a part split off and possessed themselves of Illyricum and Pannonia ; they too had a sovereign prince, who used to maintain friendly contact, though through envoys only, with the prince of Croatia. For a number of years the Croats of Dalmatia also were subject to the Franks, as they had formerly been in their own country ; but the Franks treated them with such brutality that they used to murder Croat infants at the breast and cast them to the dogs. The Croats, unable to endure such treatment from the Franks, revolted from them, and slew those of them whom they had for princes. On this, a large army from Francia marched against them, and after they had fought one another for seven years, at last the Croats managed to prevail and destroyed all the Franks with their leader, who was called Kotzilis. From that time they remained independent and autonomous,....
..................
These baptized Croats will not fight foreign countries outside the borders of their own ; for they received a kind of oracular response and promise from the pope of Rome who in the time of Heraclius, emperor of the Romans, sent priests and baptized them. For after their baptism the Croats made a covenant, confirmed with their own hands and by oaths sure and binding in the name of St. Peter the apostle, that never would they go upon a foreign country and make war on it, but rather would live at peace with all who were willing to do so ; and they received from the same pope of Rome a benediction to this effect, that if any of the pagans should come against the country of these same Croats and bring war upon it, then might the God of the Croats fight for the Croats and protect them, and Peter the disciple of Christ give them victories.
...............
Again, Symeon sent another army against prince Zacharias, under Kninos and Himnikos and Itzboklias, and together with them he sent also Tzeeslav. Then Zacharias took fright and fled to Croatia, and the Bulgarians sent a message to the 'zupans' that they should come to them and should receive Tzeeslav for their prince ; and, having tricked them by an oath and brought them out as far as the first village, they instantly bound them, and entered Serbia and took away with them the entire folk, both old and young, and carried them into Bulgaria, though a few escaped away and entered Croatia ; and the country was left deserted. Now, at that time these same Bulgarians under Alogobotour entered Croatia to make war, and there they were all slain by the Croats.

On Serbs
........

But when two brothers succeeded their father in the rule of Serbia, one of them, taking a moiety of the folk, claimed the protection of Heraclius, the emperor of the Romans, and the same emperor Heraclius received him and gave him a place in the province of Thessalonica to settle in, namely Serbia, which from that time has acquired this denomination. 'Serbs' in the tongue of the Romans is the word for 'slaves', whence the colloquial 'serbula' for menial shoes, and 'tzerboulianoi' for those who wear cheap, shoddy footgear. This name the Serbs acquired from their being slaves of the emperor of the Romans. Now, after some time these same Serbs decided to depart to their own homes, and the emperor sent them off. But when they had crossed the river Danube, they changed their minds and sent a request to the emperor Heraclius, through the military governor then governing Belgrade, that he would grant them other land to settle in. And since what is now Serbia and Pagania and the so-called country of the Zachlumi and Terbounia and the country of the Kanalites were under the dominion of the emperor of the Romans, and since these countries had been made desolate by the Avars (for they had expelle",0

Many of the issues pointed out here are worthy of discussion. As a work in progress like the rest of Wikipedia, this article will be improved with time. A big problem for articles about religion in China (and popular or folk religion in particular) is that this (extremely vast and varied) field of research has received little attention in the West until recent times and most of its literary heritage has not been translated in Western languages (or has been mistranslated). There are also discrepancies in the Western and Chinese understanding of what is and what is not """"religious"""". Only recently Western and Chinese scholars are cooperating for a clearer analysis of Chinese folk (or popular) religion.
Regarding the style I have used in writing this article (for example the use of many notes, quotations, and the explanation of the different names of this religion or complex of religions), it is due to the complexity of the topic itself. I have partially taken inspiration from the article about """"Hinduism"""".

Proposal for a revised introduction

Okay, I have a proposal for a new intro which needs to be worked on more, but I wanted to put what I have so far out there (I'm not at all wild about the specific wording at points, but I think you'll get the drift).  The intro has been the victim of a lot of reversions, and I think it would be good for us to get that straight.  Right now there is no criticism of Chomsky's position on Nicaragua v. United States in the intro (actually Ultramarine appears to have added it back, but I have a different version) and I think there obviously should be.  I've also added some new stuff.  Here it is, and I'll try to explain what I was trying to do and what I think is missing after the proposed text. The first two sentences are the same (including sources) though I have removed some italics which seemed unnecessary.

The United States of America has been accused of funding, training, and harboring individuals and groups who engage in terrorism by some legal scholars, other governments, and human rights organizations, among others. Linguist and U.S. foreign policy critic Noam Chomsky argues that the U.S. has been legally found guilty of international terrorism based on the verdict by the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua v. United States, which condemned the United States federal government not for terrorism per se, but for its """"unlawful use of force"""".{{cite web

Ah, I (and the person who reported the problem with the Tamil/Khmer character) thought that all the characters should represent """"w"""". But that is obviously not the case.

 acousmatic 

Hi there, you suggested a merger, but you did not start a discussion, I think there may be a case for this but moving acousmatic music to acousmatic would be the wrong way to approach it. Instead, I would suggest changing the title of the acousmatic article to 'acousmatic sound' so that the page can function as a sub-secion of 'acousmatic music'; which is a particular form of electroacoustic music, one which specifically uses acousmatic sound sources. The acousmatic sound article might focus more on Schaefers' and Chions' theories while the acousmatic music page could deal with the artistic practice of using sound in an acousmatic context.   """,0

 It's amazing the amount of ignorance concerning Martin Luther. Early in his life he was a stalwart defender of the Jews, saying 

""""We ought...not to treat the Jews in so unkindly a spirit,""""-Luther, Magnificat, 21:354f. 

and 

""""Absurd theologians defend hatred for the Jews. ... What Jew would consent to enter our ranks when he sees the cruelty and enmity we wreak on them—that in our behavior towards them we less resemble Christians than beasts?""""-Luther quoted in Elliot Rosenberg, But Were They Good for the Jews? (New York: Birch Lane Press, 1997), p.65.

What people fail to put together is that Luther suffered a tremendous decline in health in his old age (Iversen OH (1996). """"[Martin Luther's somatic diseases. A short life-history 450 years after his death]"""" (in Norwegian). Tidsskr. Nor. Laegeforen. 116 (30): 3643–46.) and decayed into senility. It was in this state that he challenged the canonicity of the Book of James and even recanted his faith on his death-bed. He lost his mind in his old age. Medicine had simply failed to progress to the point where they could diagnose it at that point in history. His later comments should not be privileged any more than the average institutionalized individual. It's very sad that people who wish to defame Luther take such a narrow-minded view of his illness and comments in order to discredit him. Truly it was a tragedy that such a great man was so utterly destroyed by illness. I have experienced this personally as I have watched relatives descend into incoherency and, in some cases, vicious hate. It is a very sad reality. 98.114.89.231  """,0

 History does not start with XP 

Continuous integration has a longer history than this article indicates.  Integration has been performed on software projects for a long time.  A number of the elements that are now seen as continuous integration were described by Booch. 

In the context of continuously integrating a system's architecture, establish a projects rhythm by driving to closure certain artifacts at regular intervals

He then goes on to say there are three parts to this:

First, the macro process of object-oriented development is one of """"continuous integration."""". Rather than set aside a period of formal testing at the end of the life-cycle, the object-orientated life cycle tends to integrate the parts of software (and possibly hardware) at more regular intervals...

Second, at regular intervals, the process of continuous integration yields executable releases that grow in functionality each release...

His final part is that by having integration more frequently quality can be assessed by management, risks can be identified and acted-upon early.

Biography

Offenbach's father, Isaac Juda Eberst, born 26 October 1779 in Offenbach am Main, took the name Offenbach in 1808 when he was already in Deutz where he had moved in 1802.Yon, Jean-Claude. Jacques Offenbach. Editions Gallimard, Paris, 2000.

The alternative would appear to be a long explanation of the Napoleonic edict.

  
Thank you, that sounds good, although I would prefer a link to an explanatory article or some footnote, but maybe that's just me. One more thing: the italics around his father's name and the bolding of Offenbach ought to be dropped.    

 Play titles 
Confusingly, in 'other stage works', three of the play titles with a Wikipedia link are no longer spelled the same (case) as given in the articles about the plays...   
Can you clarify? There are no red links in that section. zach 
There aren't any red links because the three plays in question are piped links to their English titles. Cg2p0B0u8m's observation that the French titles in these articles uses different capitalisation is correct. We know that the most widely used style of French title capitalisation, which is a bit idosyncratic and not cosnsistently applied in French writing, is not used in the opera or classical music projects on Wikipedia where a strict but easily understood system is used. Other projects are not so strict; that's why those articles on the plays use a different spelling.    
Ah. Missed that. Shouldn't we be using the English titles? After all The Tales of Hoffmann appears just below. zach 
Wouldn't that make for an awkward list as we don't have English titles for all these plays?    
Perhaps, but then what is the least bad solution? My primary editing instinct tells me that consistency should come first — at least within the article. zach 
But at the cost of consistency within the paragraph. — (shrug) Whatever, no biggie. The list itself is a useful improvement to the article, in whichever language the titles are listed.    

Yes, it's not a major thing. From Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(France_%26_French-related)#Works_of_art it seemed that only classical music and opera had opted out of l’Académie française / into 'Grove'; no problem.    
Also visual arts, but as we have often remarked, this is a classic 'no-win' situation. zach """,0

""":and like  said earlier, SoaD has a lot in common with Nu metal:
Generally speaking, the emphasis in the music is on either communicating feelings of angst and hostility, or motivating a crowd to move with the beat. - Yes, SoaD does not have teen angst, but it definitely does have emphasis on motivating the crowd to move with the beat. I must say, both in the music and lyrics. On """"BYOB,"""" the chorus is extremely pop-like (from an alternative rock POV) and says """"Everybody's going to the party have a real good time, Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine"""" which is an incitation to dance and """"move with the beat"""". On """"Lost in Hollywood"""", one part says """"All you bitches put your hands in the air"""" which is another incitation to """"moving with the beat"""" and is sounds like something a rapper would say (that's my opinion).
Nu metal guitarists generally make liberal use of palm muting. - SoaD uses a lot of palm muting. First examples that pop up to my mind are """"BYOB"""", """"Radio/Video"""", and """"Old School Hollywood"""".
Another common technique with nu metal guitarists is the use of de-tuned strings whose lower pitch creates a thicker, more resonant sound. - A technique that SoaD uses. """"BYOB"""" is in Dropped C (I believe), but anyone with the slightest guitar knowledge would notice that SoaD are tuned down.
This is typical of nu metal bands in that guitar solos are rare in nu metal songs in general, and when they do appear they are often short. - SoaD have very few guitar solos, and if they do they are extremely short or do not emphasize on technicality (which, in general, is what most metal bands do in a guitar solo).
Nu metal bands often feature aggressive vocals that range from melodic singing akin to pop and rock, guttural screaming and shouting from various forms of metal, hardcore punk, and rapping. - SoaD uses (most of the time) melodic singing and shouting, and in some occasions uses some rap-like vocals (most notably in their """"Chop Suey"""" intro and verses). Although it is not, properly speaking, rap, the link must be considered. I would still like to remind you that rapping does not necessarily make you a nu metal band, and that being a nu metal band does not necessarily means you rap. There are nu metal bands who don't rap, and they are still nu metal.
Normally, nu metal songs have a song structure of instrumental introduction, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, sometimes another verse but almost always ending with a chorus. - This is characteristic of SoaD. Most of their songs (I'm not saying all of them) have a very simple """"verse-chorus-verse"""" structure (as well as the slight variants).
It is generally louder in the instrumental parts and the choruses than in the verses. - Listen to """"Attack"""" on their last album.
Another thing I'd like to mention is that Serj Tankian worked with Limp Bizkit (a well known nu metal band), Saul Williams (a hip-hop artist), M.I.A. (a rapper), and The Notorious B.I.G. (another rapper & hip-hop artist). The link to hip-hop and rapping with System of a Down's lead singer is therefore established. I don't have the material that Tankian produced with those artists, but seeing how those artists are predominantly hip-hop and nu metal (in Link Bizkit's case), it is probable that the material is similar to hip-hop and nu metal in style. the 'introduction, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge' is used by every genre of music: rock, country, punk, so that doesnt make them nu metal either

SoaD is nu metal. Cheers Emmaneul (Talk) 

I feel that the only reason they were labeled as Nu Metal is because all of the hard/metal music that was popping up around that time was following Korn and adding the Hip Hop element. Because they happened to play music that was more hard or agressive than a rock band, they were considered Nu Metal.
As for the things that  said, I can easily say how they are wrong. When he gives the reference about BYOB, and how that line """"everybody's going to the party have a real good time, dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine."""" That line is metaphorical. BYOB stands for bring your own bombs, going to the party is metaphorical for going to war, blowing up the sunshine in the desert is like dropping bombs in Iraq. So those lines dont have anything to do woth the crowd moving to the beat. The detuned guitar doesnt make nu metal either. metallica did their st anger album in drop c. and almost every hard rock/metal band today uses drop d or lower. the 'introduction, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge' is used by every genre of music: rock, country,",0

If nothing comes up, the page will end up merged eventually. Right now, no one has really attempted to clean up the articles, but they are not in really bad shape compared to others. Bella Swan has a nice sized concept/creation section and a large reception section. Edward Cullen (Twilight), though lacking concept/creation and reception notes, has a large Film Portrayal secrtion. Jacob Black really needs work, though. Personally, I'd like people to work on the actual list. It needs reception and concept/creation notes, not to mention referencing from books and dialogue.   

Nah, I don't think so. Stephenie Meyer realistically spends too much time writing about how gorgeous Edward looks (seriously), and even if she had described her characters in more detail, all the character articles would be classified as stubs. There's really no need for so many stubs when we can condense them all into fewer pages.

A while ago, I made some edits that Johntex didn't like, and so instead of trying to resolve it on the article discussion page, he posted a wildly dishonest complaint in which he resorted to outright lying about me to get me blocked from editing the page for a month (his initial goal being to get me completely banned). I continued to be outraged at his behavior and the fact that he remains completely unpunished for his behavior, and posted complaints on his talk page. Once again, rather than trying to resolve it, he went here to lie about me in his continued belief that anyone who annoys him should be banned. And yet again, he posted numerous lies:

5 days ago, with no provocation whatsoever, Heqwm made a personal attack against me on my talk page. As explained above, the claim that there was no provocation whatsoever is an outright lie.

I have never posted lies about him. Another lie.

I left him a message on his talk page asking him to provide diffs to back up his allegations. He declined to do so. Another lie. I pointed out that I had provided him with the diffs over and OVER again, and each time he simply lied and said that they don't say what he said they clearly said.

Wizardman warned Heqwm that this was a personal attack. Heqwm repeated his personal attack on his own talk page. I removed the """"anti-barnstar"""" and personal attack from my talk page, but Heqwm re-added it. I discussed the charge on my talk page. And Johntes's recounting is dishonest, as it implies that my reposting the attack happened after Wizardman's warning, when in fact it happened before.

Heqwm has been at this mischief for a long time. Mischief? Insisting that liars be punished is """"miscief""""? What kind of world do we live in?

He has been warned by other users as well, and has been placed on a form of community probation. Yes, on the basis of the very lies that are the issue here.

I don't think I have any any interaction with him since then, so I can only assume he is still upset about being put on probation, or about the related mediation case which he filed and then abandoned. Abandoned after several weeks went by without any mediator stepping forward (and after Johntex engaged in behavior in blatant violation of WP:CIVIL and WP:AGF).

His talk page history is littered with controversy and conflict with many other editors on many topics. After several years, with me not deleting anything, there are now several instances of people disagreeing with me. And...?

I ask whether Heqwm has exhausted the community's patience? I ask whether this is not a clear threat and an instance of Johntex's bullying.

To top it off, another admin came along and blocked me only a few hours after Johtex's request, meaning that I had no opportunity to address the charges.

Jonhtex responded """"I request that Heqwm again be blocked for posting unsubstantiated personal attacks where he accuses me of lying.""""  So... Johntex is allowed to attack me on ANI, but if I respond to his charges, I should be blocked?  Yet another example of his bullying.

Do you mean you can read about those work conditions & not see that it's slavery?  Prepare yourself for earthshaking news: the wage system is slavery but most people didn't think so.  Slavery means """"someone who is controlled by someone or something.""""   A boss controls a slave, but a slave also enslaves a boss.   Being offered a wage you can't live on is slavery.   All jobs are being eliminated by machine-slaves,  which makes it more obvious than ever before that all people must have a Guaranteed Minimum Income, although I prefer the word 'residual' to 'minimum'.  Read child labour & try to see it was child slavery into the 20th century, & it still is today since many children work in their parents' business.  When they """"ended child labour"""" that didn't set the children free; they were """"free to starve"""" because what they need/ed is a GMI.  Having children is a form of slavery too: parents become slaves to their children (when they need to eat, bathe, etc) but the children are also slaves to their parents.  So """"no control"""" also means we'll always be slaves to needing food, & we can find ways to eliminate all the work with machines which again means all people need a GMI.  (Actually all people should own all things, because when a few rich people own everything it's obviously slavery; how did every person not know that?  America refused to let any attempts at Socialism & Communism succeed; instead they forced it to fail by starting many wars, teaching torture, & you must read Wm Blum's """"Rogue State"""".  Fidel Castro was right & America was wrong.)  And the BLS is wrong; they always underestimate, because most of those people are probably illegal immigrants from many generations back.  They say every year 50,000 people are smuggled into the US to work as prostitutes (that's slavery), so can you imagine how many illegals there must be in America hidden behind walls, & all supporting a few rich slave masters who travel the world & raise their families on the backs of SLAVES in America.  How can you read about multinational corporations & not see they cause poverty in those other countries, as well as in America?

 In my opinion, the three lists you just mentioned need improvement to reach the standards of the Oregon and Washington lists (that is completely independent of the fact that I promoted those two lists to FL statusthey simply contain more facts, stronger leads, more references, etc).  I think that a single table is more appropriate as it can be sorted and the order of sections seem somewhat arbitrary by making some symbols more important than others. Also, I believe it is crucial to separate official and unofficial symbols. I have no problem with having a table for the """"Unofficial symbols"""" sectionit just happens that the Oregon and Washington lists only have a couple so it was easier to construct prose than tables. I know nothing about Governors lists, but I believe some have been promoted to FL status so it is probably worth examining those. Hopefully I will get around to improving the Maryland, Kentucky and Indiana symbols lists. In the meantime (just to make the FLC nomination process easier and for the sake of consistency) I would mimic the Oregon and Washington symbols lists since they have been promoted much more recently than the other three.

Responses:
I have made no """"legal threat"""" to anyone. It is a matter of an apparent breach  of a moral obligation by Sven Manguard to me. I worked hard with Wikimedia Australia over a three-month period to develop an idea in great detail, which is complex and has many original elements. I conveyed some of the details to Manguard after he assured me he had no intention of developing anything remotely similar. I was then told by a third party that """"Sven grabbed me on IRC to tell me he is planning a similar project"""" and that Sven had said """"well, I'm going ahead with it"""". Manguard has since said on my talk page, """"you missed your chance, your partnership fell through, and if there is even the slightest chance of it coming to fruition, it's not going to be for several more months. I'm not going to drop my efforts, and I'm not going to wait indefinitely for something that at this point I'm pretty sure is never going to happen ..."""". Actually, the partnering institution had already agreed in principle, and there has simply been a delay in implementation. I have been led to believe that others in the WMF have been apprised of the idea; but I'm in the dark as to what level of detail he has divulged, and whether clearly identifiable details of my scheme have been or will be duplicated without attribution. If distinctive and original details are being conveyed contrary to his undertaking to me, it is a moral breach; and if they are implemented without attribution to me, that is also a moral breach; if this occurs, I believe I have a moral right to inform people of it. This is the gist of what I said to Manguard, but now I'm been accused of making """"legal threats""""; this is based on a complete misunderstanding. In fact, I don't have a legal foot to stand on in that respect, and he knows it. Why is this being construed as anything """"legal""""? For all we know, Manguard's ideas might be quite different; but he needs to communicate them as a courtesy as much as a practicality.I was the person who suggested publicly that Manguard and Adam be """"directors"""" at FSC, only a few weeks ago. I believe Manguard has done good work there, so I don't understand why this spin-out is happening. It has quickly morphed into accusations of """"gross incivility, threats of off-wiki harassment, and personal attacks"""". I see no evidence of gross incivility by me (aside from an unkind thing I said on his talk page yesterday—""""not mature enough""""—which I'm willing to withdraw), nor of personal attacks. Instead, I have endured major and repeated personal attacks on his and my talk pages. No one has mentioned those.This seems to have been mixed up with complaints about my reviewing at FSC: they are surely two different issues. If people are troubled by professional reviews of soundfiles, I think there's a big problem for features sounds. I have presented factual evidence and what I believe are balanced opinions, and have supported a few WP-produced files, too.

(2) The brothers used the same catapult, the same extra boost, as in 1905 in all their witnessed flights performed in 1908. In conclusion more powerful engines were logically not needed.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138   

Correct, they didn't """"need"""" more powerful engines in 1908, but were probably glad to have them. However, your conclusion that therefore their statements about their previous flights are """"their own fiction"""" is merely your own fanciful opinion, to which you're entitled, but which flies in the face of more than 100 years of published information and, yes, the WB own documentary proof, undisputed by all reputable historians. The 1-minute 45-second flight you mentioned was Wilbur's very first in France; about a month later he flew 90 minutes (after Orville had made hour-long flights in the U.S.).   
 I base all my affirmations on primary sources and not latter judgements. The so called reputed historians are just pro Wright Brothers propagandists who simply selected what they liked from primary sources and made up a nice story for the public, disregarding all evidence that throws serious doubts regarding the claimed 1903-1905 flights.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138   

Interestingly, the primary sources of which you're fond include voluminous amounts of documentation by the WB themselves of their work and their success. Try some affirmation based on that. You're right, though: propaganda does existnot in the writings of respected historians, but in misguided scribblings that sometimes show up on these pages.   

There is mention of the seven """"French"""" engines of 1908 here:  http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6550620m/f260.image.r=wright.langEN. They are intended to be delivered as  """"seven perfect copies"""" of the model brought by the american aviator.   

 Strange picture - On Dec. 14, 1903, W. Wright flew with the two propellers on the left side of the plane, one of them not connected to the engine! 

The picture labeled LC-W86- 20, (see http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/wri/item/2001696254/ ) from the Library of Congress, shows W. Wright just after he landed the plane on Dec. 14, 1903, damaging the front-rudder (the canard double wing). The flight was powered but the airplane landed below the altitude where it had taken off. The strange thing about this picture is that the plane (see one of the large size versions of the image) has both propellers on its left side, the leftmost propeller being not connected to the engine. There is simply no logical explanation about this oddity. 

""""There is simply no logical explanation about this oddity."""" Indeed, a perfect description of the posts above and below. I recommend an optometrist.   
Ok. It was my mistake. I was mislead by the optical illusion the image contains. I should have studied the photography more carefully.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138

 Modern mainstream economics 

The modern mainstream economics section repeats itself a lot.

It opens with """"Mainstream economics begins with the premise that resources are scarce and that it is necessary to choose between competing alternatives.""""  this is a reiteration of something found in the opening of the article - """"the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.""""  Someone must really like repeating that though because later on in this section we see 

""""Economics studies how individuals and societies seek to satisfy needs and wants through incentives, choices, and allocation of scarce resources.""""

Then later in this section we see

""""neoclassical economics, which began to develop in the late 1800s and models choices made in the allocation of scarce resources.""""

Then later in this section

""""It is sometimes referred to as the study of choice under conditions of scarcity.""""

Then later in this section

""""Economics is a broad term given to the social science of how choices are made in face of limited resources.""""

Then later in this section a word for word repetition of what was said in the opening -

""""the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between given ends and scarce means which have alternative uses""""

Reading all of this I conclude that mainstream economics studies the relationship between given ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.

 Newly Discovered Documentary Evidence That Affects this Article's Accuracy

I have recently found a 1979 booklet of questions and answers with Rawat printed and distributed by Divine Light Mission, Inc. which bears heavily on some of the issues central to this article.  This document was published at least five years after the family split, seven or eight years after Rawat came to the west and when he was either 21 or 22 years old.  In other words, at the time he uttered these statements, he was an adult who was long familiar with western culture, spoke good English and was very much his own man.  Here are a few of the questions and answers:

Some people say you are a divine incarnation, and some people say other things about you.  What's the truth?

You yourself must realize what is the truth.

So God cannot teach anything, except through a Master?

What is God?  You don't know what God is.  God cannot be a human being.  God is Light.  God is Power.  God cannot talk.  Electricity cannot give light, only the bulb gives light, but electricity has to be put through the wire for the bulb to give light.  It's power.  Power cannto do anything.  It has to be put through a medium.

Why does a Perfect Master have to have a living body to give Knowledge?  Why is he necesssary?

Are you feeling thirsty?  Can you see that photo of Lord Shiva?  You see the water coming out from the top of his head?  Drink that water.  Drink, drink.  Can you?  You can't drink that water.  It is a picture.  You need everything living.  If you have doubts, you cannot ask Lord Krishna questions.  What's why you need a living Master for the circumstances of this world today.  When Jesus was here there were no nuclear bombs.  But now there are nuclear bombs, and the Perfect Master, the Perfect Savior [sic], has come to save you from nuclear bombs.

Is the living Master able to reveal Knowledge?

Yes, that's why you call him a living Master. 

Guru Maharaj Ji, Jesus Christ performed many cures.  Can you do the same?

At His time there were not so many doctors, that's why he did that.  But I am curing mental sickness.  If you have got mental sickness, come to me.  And when you do meditation, you become so natural that any other diseases you have are automatically cured.  That's why I tell you this Knowledge is very practical.  It makes people natural.  They stop being plastic.  They become natural and the best way of ending disease is by nature.

What happens to a person's karma when they receive Knowledge?

It starts choking up. It starts finishing up, because when you realize Knowledge, you've got to go and be one with God.

Will this Knowledge save us from rebirth?

Yes.  Once we have this Knowledge we reach the heaven from where we cannot return.  

Guru Maharaj Ji, are you permanently in God consciousness?

......[torn page] ...permanently in God consciousness.  

The lower part of the last page in the book is intact and it's a quote that reads:

""""I have found that missing link.  As soon as I found that missing link, I became one with everything.  And therefore I became everything.  Not as an individual but by merging into that infinite thing which has no beginning, which has no end, which cannot be destroyed.  And I have that for you to experience.""""

He signs this last quote:

""""Guru Maharaj Ji""""

I maintain that there are several aspects of the article that need to be corrected or, at minimum, balanced by this evidence.  For instance, it flies in the face of the 1999 quotation from Rawat's then-website wherein he said:

People through the years have tried to place me in a mold, and from the very early years I have not been able to oblige them. When I was very young, people were looking for the """"old silver-haired Guru with flowing white robes."""" I was only eight. When people were flocking to India for their search, I was in the West.

"History of K.M.F. (Kill-Marry-Fuck):

The concept and game of K.M.F. was first commissioned by Courtney Porcella—resident of the City of Sin, Lynn, MA—in the early twenty first century in the United States of America, more specifically Massachusetts.  Spreading initially as “Kill-Marry-Fuck” between her and her close friends, this game quickly spread throughout the fourth floor of Donahue at Suffolk University, the school she currently attends.  Although this game quickly manifested itself into a game of pastime, it has never reached its full potential as an ice breaker due to the lingering question of its social acceptability.

Prior to the spring of 2010, K.M.F. was referred to as its founding name, “Kill-Marry-Fuck.”  The cause of the name change was brought on by a Senator from Suffolk University’s Student Government Association.  The main reason behind the move for the change was to reflect the professionalism of the student leaders occupying the offices on the fourth floor of Donahue.  Although K.M.F. was never targeted specifically, people got the message from the Senator and changed its name respectively.

Regardless of the name change, K.M.F. never lost it original essence, Donahue’s pastime.  And the name change now allows players to play K.M.F. in all types of atmosphere, ranging from weddings to preschool school.  Less than a year after the publicizing of K.M.F., this game has expanded to Boston’s neighboring cities.

At the time, Ms. Porcella has no disclosed plans to spread K.M.F. statewide or nationally.

"Response 
I think the issue of whether someone is extremely famous or not will invoke investigation of two issues. One is the issue of perspective and who makes the judgement call and the second issue is one of values and how we, as impartial observers, value different aspects of life in general. Third, and very likely the most important issue, is how society values them? Peale is currently in the Alumni section and I think it is only fair to keep it that way. It might be interesting to pose for discussion whether his contributions in the spiritual world are more important than other people's contributions in the worlds of science, politics, education and so on. This, without a doubt, will generate an unambigously political discussion and a very controversial one as well. If you are a deeply religious person, you might say that religion is very important. On the other hand, if you are a humanist, you very likely will disagree. Most people will opt for the middle ground on placing a judgement call. I think focusing on his work without redundant characterizations will reduce debate on the controversial topic of religion and its importance of life.",0

 Randroide Answers to """"Next Step"""" 

Guys, I do not see you taking steps to Wikipedia:Requests for mediation.

I can not do this job because I always connect from """"filtered"""" institutional net-access, and following those steps could result in new, undesired, controversial """"truncation"""" of words by the software. I do not want that happenning.

Could you please follow the instructions in the link I provided?. Thank you. 

 Randroide answers to New reference by Burgas00 

  At last we agree on something!...of course that the new section is a good idea: The false """"suicidal"""" terrorists from PRISA will also be included there. 

Come oooooon, boys, start writing that section. I do not want all the kudos for myself: The new proposed article is, by now, an effort made only by me. 

But remember: NPOV and sources, all the sources. Just like me citing """"El País"""" in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb. Cheers  

 

Indeed, a good point. And all the remarks in COPE too. And the """"moral certitudes"""" of Mariano Rajoy published in El Mundo.

  I agree with you 100%, Larean.

  What Randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when I insisted that he do so, the original version he created was entirely POV, as is much of the rest of the proposed article. Also, all the sources that he added from El Pais are only available to subscribers - NPOV it is not. 

  You are right, Southofwatford, in your """"Randroide omits..."""" section.

If you have not subscription to """"El País"""", I am sorry but that´s your problem. My """"institutional"""" access also has some advantages, like paid access to """"El País"""" (and many, many other publications and books). That´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of """"filtered"""" Internet accesss: It´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources.

Do you see?. The truncation of words is offsett (I think) by better sources.

BTW, if you write under a """"Randroide answers"""" section you are:
Invading """"my"""" space. I do not mind, really. But you are doing it.
Risking new truncations on your messages. To avoid this, please write OUTSIDE """"Randroide answers"""" sections.

If you think that the proposed article is POV, work in it to make it NPOV. The article is not """"mine"""".

  I'll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here, it's very short. The issue is not whether I subscribe to El País, its whether the people who read an article in the English Wikipedia subscribe to it. All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article, putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is NPOV is, to my mind, completely unreasonable.

  

All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article

Very funny, Southofwatford. 

I am going to follow this joke of yours.

Please propose also the deletion of all books as sources, because, did you know?, there is always someone without this or that book.
Delete all references to TV or radio stations, because that user in Brazil has no TV and no radio at home.
Delete all the references in spanish, because, did you know?, there are users who know no spanish.

It´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes, really. I had a good laugh.

User:Southofwatford  How strange that you should find it so funny, after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced, so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny, it's simply bizarre. Equally, in the English Wikipedia I would argue that choosing a Spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in English does not make sense, except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing - your cynicism is evident in your response.

That same article indicates that the fire limits were expanded in 1874 (after a second major fire) to cover the whole city. That may contradict the Humboldt Park article, but I'm not sure.  In any case, the fire limits survive on as chapter 13-116 of the current Chicago Municipal Code: they cover """"all zoning districts within the corporate limits classified B1-1 through B7-7 and C1-1 through C-4, as defined in the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance of May 29, 1957, as amended, together with an additional 200 feet in all directions from the outer limits of each area or areas so classified."""" This appears to mean that most business and commercial districts in Chicago are governed by the fire limits regulations, but it's hard to tell.

Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology. I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance.

 Anglo-Israelism  Never claimed to be Jews, they claim that the English are the descendents of the lost tribes of Israelites.  Nowhere on their site do they claim to be Jewish or practicing Judaism. I do not think there is a good argument that these people are Jews in any way.  They can and are identified in the Ten Lost Tribes article.
 Christian Identity  Weird choice.  They hate Jews, look at the text of the article, where they explicitly condemn Judaism as evil. Certainly not an alternative form of Judaism, nor are they Jews.
 Talmidaism  A subset of Christianity, or possibly Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article.
 Nazarene A subset of Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article
 Messianic Judaism  Already in the article that you edited
 Judaizing teachers  Refers to a movement of early Christians, not a current group.  This is like including Jews Harp in the list - it is a reference to a historical label, not a religion.

"""==King George County, VA==

There seems to be some a contridiction of the status of King George County. The King George County page indicates that King George County is NOT a part of the Washington-Baltimore Metropolitan Area. Yet, according to the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area page, it is.

This also brings to light a local controversey regarding King George County and whether or not it is part of the Northern Neck of Virginia. Historically, King George County has been included as part of the Northern Neck. The Northern Neck Tourism Council website lists locations in King George County amongst its historical sites and museums, and the King George County Homepage labels the county as the """"Gateway to the Historic Northern Neck"""". I was educated in Northumberland County, Virginia, and this is what we were taught during our segment on local history for 11th grade US History, that there are FIVE counties in the Northern Neck, including King George County.

However, until 11th grade, I had always grown up under the assumption that the Northern Neck consisted of only four counties: Northumberland, Lancaster, Westmoreland, and Richmond counties. Locals think of the Northern Neck more as a community with similar  values and interests, rather than a geographical area. King George county is considered to be """"suburban"""", part of the Washington DC urban sprawl and therefore doesn't share the same community interests as the rest of the Northern Neck.

This article from the Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star highlights both sides of the King George debate.

The inclusion of King George County as part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area stems from three facts: King George's proximity to Fredericksburg, its inclusion in the Washington DC media market, and the presence of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren. However, the historical connections between King George County and the Northern Neck shouldn't be dismissed. It wouldn't be inappropriate to consider King George County as part of both, as Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area seems to be a statistical category, while the Northern Neck is a historical/geographical region.

I have also added this discussion to the pages on both the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and the King George County pages. If there is no further discussion or objection, I will edit the Northern Neck page to include mention of the local debate on the status of King George County.  """,0

Hi Mr. Ettlinger,

your thanks notification regarding my edit to the Adrian Ettlinger article (whom I believe is about your late father) is appreciated. I'm not quite sure what is how a notification is better than an edit to the user talk page, but I still appreciate it. I tried to reach you on Twitter (see my tweets in this conversation) but I don't appear to have got a reply. I'm glad to see you're on the Wikipedia as well. I'm sorry for the loss of your father.

In any case, my name is Shlomi Fish (User:Shlomif) and I'm an Israeli software developer and writer (born in 1977) who was introduced to your father when I initiated a (successful) attempt to integrate my solver for Freecell into the Freecell Pro program that he originated and still maintained back then, and we ended up exchanging several hundreds of E-mails and became friends, and later continued discussing various topics after the technical goal was achieved. I still kept most of the E-mail messages from him (although I'm not sure I have all of my own replies), and was sorry to have learned about him passing away (which I did after doing a web search by accident).

Anyway, I'd like to post some of the E-mails he sent me (or at least selected parts thereof) as a way to commemorate him, but they may need to be filtered to avoid speaking against him and other people (he also told me about his family (children, grandchildren, etc.) and friends. I also want to translate (from Hebrew to English) a story I originally wrote about my Internet relationship with Adrian (see this link - not sure what Google Translate and similar services can make of it for now) for an online Israeli story contest for the Software Freedom Day, which had a focus on open source software development (I don't think I hoped to win, but I wanted to do my share for the event). The story was written back when Adrian was still alive, and we exchanged E-mails for several years after that.

I'll appreciate it if you can return to me, and sorry for this being so long (you may be quite busy). I'm sorry again for your loss.",0

 Well, hope the floor didn't hurt. But your characterization of my attitude and what I respect and don't is to say the least dubious. Did it occur to you that I didn't attend your schools, have different experiences, different parents, and can think for myself? There is plenty of room for differences in interpretation, as anyone that has mediated flame wars here, as I have can tell you. One cranky old editor spouting off does NOT make for a battle. OTOH, similar frank opinions have almost universally in the past resulted in a good working relationship, a clear communication, and about 3/4ths of the time, resulted in a new Wikifriend. So piffle to WP:CIVyou're not looking at the context, nor the intent of the context for that guideline. Being polite can in fact be counterproductive and a time waste, a matter of judgmentmine, as the observer. Take Quiddity (who signed up at page top for example) who once demonstrated a unbelievable tendency to pro-offer unwarranted judgments and unsolicited advice. Ultimately, I had to get firm with him and sent this, which he threatened to post, SO I DID. Nothing there to be ashamed of, you see. Bottom line... there are some people in this world that need rapped along side the ear to get their attention. There are others that need to have their toes stepped on, UNTIL THEY APOLOGIZE. Both those types benefit some by being jerked up by the shorthairs. Failing all else, it makes me feel better, and communicates at least one person, however crazy they may think me, has less than steller appreciation for their actions as they impact othersnormally others time. I really don't get excised much here about anything else. Endless editing and all that, after all.Sooooo, Thanks for the appeal to my vanity, but I suggest in the future you counsel people to examine whether a situation is ongoing, escalating, or one time episode of venting. I spent 2-1/2 years here acting as a mediator myself, and would never have considered involving myself in an isolated message based case. Not sensible. Call it justifiable road rage if you like—a real world situation here in cyber space, and  at least I cleaned up the vulgarity of what I had written in the first three drafts, to make my loathing judgment of his lazy rape of hundreds of pages plain. THAT is where I put my loyalty and focus. NOT on one of thousands of arguable interpretation of various guidelines and policies. If your INTERPRETATION of WP:CIV prohibits any colorful idiom or addressing a dumbshit-thing-to-do as a dumbshit act, I'm definitely done here. I'm floored that you haven't the imagination to understand that— save for the hyperbole about kicking ass, a deliberate attempt to indicate how poorly I viewed the 5-6 hours a day of well over six weeks of effort fixing his rape pogrom allegedly following guidelines — nor the fact that you were all being busy-bodies making much ado about nothing. One of the most reprehensible facts about contributing here is that there is a total insensitivity to the leisure time our contributors make, particularly by 'blithely accepting actions', one way or another, deleting their hard work and effort, which is about as personal an attack as one can make... Show me where NPA THE LEAST SENSITIVE to that VERY REAL, VERY PERSONAL virtual 'slap in the face'.  And fools wonder why we have editor retention rate problems! Wake the fuck up. THAT IS A REAL WORLD PROBLEM, not my slight episode of 'hitting' to administer a lesson in courtesy to others. (Call me twisted, but a single discourtesy to me  administered to make the point is properly due those who exercise the ultimate discourtesies, really without due process. Making 180 article pages into redirects without involving the community at large in the decision is to me, WP:BOLD applied way over the top. AFD or MFD should have been invoked, at the least. Not one talk page and three or four editors without a direct attempt to re-involve the originator of same articles, or their major contributors. BOTH THOSE badly need a quorum count provision, but I digress, the digression.) Those articles nearly 200 some were something apparently dozens put up... involving hundreds of man-hours and were well crafted. Oh, they needed some cites for a few fannish statements of cause and effect, but the necessity of that is itself doubtful in cultural articles about recently produced intellectual efforts.

There’s a well collaborated (London based) group of GREEK Wikipedia sysops/users that  has been spotted to  work systematically in full daily basis propagandazing ultra natioanalistic Greek POV, and distorting related articles. They intervene in any Balkan history and politics related  article, pushing Greek POV, launch edit wars,  and repeated reverts of  vandalized by them versions, permanent deletions, block users, merges and redirects to deletetion of undesired new articles. Their main target is to distort all articles lelated to  ISLAM, TURKEY, REBUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, BULGARIA, ALBANIA (CHAMERIA), THEIR MINORITIES IN GREECE AND THEIR HISTORY. They attack  every article criticizing Greece transforming it  to Greekish propaganda POV. They became maniacs in optimizing dark side of Greek history.They communicate each other by secret e-mails avoiding messages through their talk pages to avoid publicity. This group acting in a systematic way to revert articles, when one of member makes the limit of 3 reverts, one another continues with 4th revert to avoid punishment for violating 3rv rule.

Furthermore they are suspected agents of Greek National Intelligence Service (E.Y.Π. Κυπατζήδες) and  believers of ultra nationalistic organizations of Greek “national interests”, as L.A.O.S. and Chrissi Avgi. They are also multiple sockpuppets and impersonators of their group members. They are all schizophrenics web vandals unacceptible to wikipedian community.

First Use of the Word

Re:Al-Shabaab
You have reverted to the following extract regarding foreign involvement in Al-Shabaab:

Of the foreign members, Jonathan Evans, head of the British MI5, indicated in 2010 that around 100 British nationals of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and West African backgrounds had traveled to Somalia to train under the group, and that their presence there could inspire terrorist incidents in the UK.[57] Their travel costs were allegedly funded by sympathizers in Britain.[58]

This is incorrect because: (1) Evans is no longer head of MI5; (2) the speech that Evans gave - which was linked to in the text that you removed - made no mention of the numbers of British nationals or their ethnicity; that was a bit of hyperbole added by the reporter; (3) the numbers are, in any case, disputed, with The Sunday Times estimating the number at 50 and another report from The Daily Telegraph suggesting 60; (4) The citation [58] (which, incidentally, suggests the figure of 60) does not support the assertion that travel costs are 'allegedly funded'. It does, however, point out the criminal conviction (i.e. 'beyond reasonable doubt') of an Al-Shabaab financier.

The removal of the link to the actual speech seems particularly obtuse. 86.183.79.59  

Hi. Here's what you wrote:

Jonathan Evans, the former head of MI5, addressing a London security conference in 2010  , advised that a significant number of UK residents were training with al-Shabaab. It is only a matter of time before we see terrorism on our streets inspired by those who are today fighting alongside al-Shabaab. The actual number has been estimated at between 50  and 100  persons; there is also evidence of funding of the group by British citizens.

First, the italicization of what Evans stated back in 2010 (when, incidentally, Al-Shabaab was much stronger than it is now) is both undue and unencylopedic. A simple """"predicted that their presence there could inspire terrorist incidents in the UK"""" will suffice.

In Evans' speech link, he indicates the following  """"The percentage of the priority plots and leads we see in the UK linked to Al Qaida in the tribal areas of Pakistan, where Al Qaida senior leadership is still based, has dropped from around 75% two or three years ago to around 50% now. This does not mean that the overall threat has reduced but that it has diversified. The reduction in cases linked to the Tribal areas of Pakistan is partly attributable to the pressure exerted on the Al Qaida leadership there. But the reduction is also partly a result of increased activity elsewhere. In Somalia, for example, there are a significant number of UK residents training in Al Shabaab camps to fight in the insurgency there."""" In other words, the same multinational network of would-be Al-Qaida fighters that traveled to Pakistan were also starting to travel to other areas back in 2010, including the Al-Shabaab-controlled parts of Somalia. Also note that Evans specifically attributes this growth in Al-Shabaab to the fact that Somalia, like Afghanistan, at the time had """"no effective government"""". It does no",0

 one word 

I want the article to be accurate and to be without grammatical errors. 

I tried to change """"forced into sexual slavery involved in prostitution """" to """"forced into sexual slavery or involved in prostitution """"  As the article has many references to the fact that there were also Japanese prostitutes acting as comfort women ie. involved in prostitution, not sex slaves, it seems accurate to state that some were forced into slavery while others were involved in prostitution. 

We seem to have had this discussion before, and considering that it is a minor change, this should be easy to change. The article makes it clear that the comfort women were made up of both groups, if someone wants to give some figures relating to the numbers in each group, then it would be great.

As it stands the article is highly flawed.

Anyone care to make a suggestion as to how it can be changed in a manner that everyone will approve of?

 The American Agenda to Homosexualize the World

""" North Korea actually gained approximately 230 km² from China in the 1962 treaty. 

And here's a 19th century book by Chong Yagyong, titled """"Korea's Northern Border Reigion"""" (in a Korean sourcebook compilation translated by Peter Hacksoo Lee): 
A long time ago, the area north of the Tumen River was the land of the Su-shen people. It has not been under our control since the time of the Three Han. The ''southern slopes of Mount Changbaek, where both the Tumen and Yalu rivers have their headwaters, lay within our territory, but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear. However, Emperor K'ang-hsi, in the final years of his reign [1662-1722], ordered Area Commander Wu-la (Wu-la ts'ung-kuan) Muk'eteng to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker. As a result, the border between those two rivers is clear as well. [emphasis mine]

Here's another study of the US-North Korea border in 1962, by the US Dept of State, which makes no mention of North Korea owning the entire mountain.  And another, which says that China actually made concessions to NK on the border in 1962 . 

The only sources that seem to claim that Korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest China conducting activities on its own side of the border, and of course, a few ultranationalist sites, but please, enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well.

Requested move
Chonji → Tianchi – The name was unilaterally moved from Tianchi to Chonji without concensus, for POV reasons (cited in move and talk page), such as that it should be Korean (it's on the border between China and Korea). Another reason cited was that the name of the Baekdu Mountain page is Korean as well. However, a Google search shows nearly 30,000 hits for Tianchi, and and less than 1,000 each for Chonji and Cheonji. That's two orders of magnitude in difference. (the preceding was quoted by Yuje)  
Survey
Add """"* Support"""" or """"* Oppose"""" followed by a brief explanation, then sign your opinion with ~~~~
 Support for the most common name. Searches for """"Chonji"""" for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits. Search on Google scholar shows only 2 uses of the name """"Chonji"""" for the lake. The use of Chonji as a clear common name doesn't apply because it's not common. 
 Support — per Yuje.  Naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name. 
Oppose per Visviva and my previous comments. Like I said before, we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because """"Tianchi"""" is a name for many other places in China.  
As shown, Chonji is nowhere near common. Chonji barely shows up any hits, therefore isn't a viable alternative for a clear alternative name.  
Oppose Look at my reason below.  
Comment:  The proposition seems to be flawed...  Given that Tianchi is now an article on the lake in Urumqi, if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else; perhaps Tianchi (Changbaishan) or even (heh heh) Tianchi (Paektusan), but then again maybe Tianchi (Jilin)... if we must'' have a straw poll, it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is.

 Whole Lotta Darwin?

Here is the discussion on the timing of today's featured article. Algebraist

It's also Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday and he gets shafted.    
He's mentioned once in OTD and twice in DYK. If you had a relevant TFA choice, you should've posted it to Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests at the appropriate time (weeks ago). Algebraist 
I stand corrected, but it is still 5:3 in favor of Darwin.  
Is your suggestion to put licoln's name twice randomly on main page to make it even? The way i see it both were given importance and there is no reason for them to appear exactly the same number of times. there were featured items available for Darwin, hence they were used. if u have suggestion to improve current items then please provide them rather than complaining about ratio.

I originally would have agreed with Haldraper but I think it's not quite so cut-and-dried as """"liberal land reformers"""" against oligarchical private landowners and the Church as a landowner.  Sometimes, the regimes targeted all the land owners, secular and clerical.  Other times, they targeted just the Church.  The Church was not only targeted because it owned land but because they controlled all aspects of society (i.e. from marriage to baptism to last rites and burial on church grounds).  Secular reformers saw this as a stranglehold whereby the Church could get anything it wanted not just from owning land but by controlling who could marry, have a legitimate child or even """"die within the Church"""".  The Church was also targeted because it tended to support the landowners in a conservative alliance.  Finally, the Church was targeted by a number of revolutionary regimes because it had supported the Spanish monarchy against the rebels.

I therefore appreciate your placing the information on the talk page, for you never know, a serious researcher rather than just a casual visitor who takes a general interest in primary legislation may derive genuine satisfaction in finding it there; the very distinction, I hope you will agree, that marks an encyclopaedia (which should be an extensive knowledge resource) apart from a penny guide-book.

You have left some external links (Blair, Kelly) which had relevance to the detailed former footnote but not to the article.
There is a balance between referencing all statements and introducing clutter.  
The bullet-point statements are accurate (and, in point of fact can be verified easily enough by looking at the linked pages).  And as to technology, if you have a way to put a reference on a footnote using the edit pages, then you are a lot cleverer than I am.

Hi, Mike: I noticed your message to my talk page. I nominated this for deletion not because I doubted the accuracy or verifiability of the information contained but because I doubted the subject's notability. Wikipedia has strict guidelines with respect to whether a living person is notable enough to pass our notability requirements, and one of those guidelines requires in-depth coverage of the person in multiple reliable sources that are completely independent of the subject. So for instance, in your case if you could find in-depth reviews of you or your work in newspapers, magazines, reliable websites (not blogs, unless they're affiliated with a newspaper or magazine) or some other media that isn't related to or created by you and has editorial supervision, that would satisfy the requirements. Unfortunately, nothing that you have created yourself - your Twitter feed, your Facebook or Myspace pages, your website - is considered either a reliable or an independent source for Wikipedia's purposes.

Please note that this is a discussion for deletion, not a speedy deletion. I chose this option because this type of discussion takes seven days to grind its way toward completion, so that gives you seven days to find the independent, reliable third-party sources that Wikipedia requires.

Wikipedia also strongly discourages autobiographies: I invite you to read our guidelines on autobiography to find out why.

There's no need to compromise an article to placate cranks on the Talk page; respond to them on the Talk page.  
There are separate questions:
Why is it called the """"World Series""""? 
Is it justifiable to call it """"World Series""""? 
Is """"World Series"""" meant literally or just a label preserved for historic/traditional reasons?
Regarding the answers:
The answer would appear to be: 1880s hype + 120 years of tradition/inertia.  
The first bit should be in the history section. The reference says In 1884, the Providence Grays of the National League outplayed the New York Metropolitan Club of the American Association in a three game series for what was originally called """"The Championship of the United States."""" Several newspapers penned the Grays as """"World Champions"""" and the new title stuck. 
It would be nice to cite an 1884 newspaper saying something like """"The Grays are now the Champions of the United States; indeed one might well call them the Champions of the World."""" 
""""the new title stuck"""" is rather vague: did it stick instantly and unanimously? Looking at the contemporary match programs on baseball alamanac, 1911 is World's Championship Games, 1912 is World's Series, 1930 is for the Championship of the World, 1940 is World's Series, 1941 is World Series. It's worth distinguishing """"World Series"""" the series of matches from """"World Championship"""" the title at stake in the series.
The """"New York World"""" urban myth is widespread enough to be mentioned and debunked. 
 """"The title of this championship may seem odd to some readers"""" is not a justification for answering this question, since it relates to the previous question. The justification would be something like """"Some people have (jocularly or otherwise) questioned the appropriateness or accuracy of the name World Series""""  
I speculate that there should be some juicy examples of such questioning from U.S. journalists in the 1880s, or Latin Americans in the 1960s.  There is the quote attributed to John Cleese: """"When we [the UK] hold a World Championship for a particular sport, we invite teams from other countries to play, as well.""""  
There are various arguments pro and contra that might be made. But only those that have actually been made by noteworthy sources should be given. 
The relevant information seems to be present in the article.

I completely agree with your red pill explanation of the problem, and I think you have a good handle on the problem.  But just like in The Matrix, few people could handle going down the rabbit hole. I think Trypto felt like you were attacking him for his arbcom opinion, and he's pretty sensitive about such things.  I think you're correct about Kudpung, but there are several differert ways to make your point without directly attacking Trypto. For example, you could have informed him that according to Kudpung's absurd recall criteria, Trypto is no longer allowed to participate in the recall process. Of course, criticizing Kudpung is like shooting fish in a barrel, so it's not very sporting. This is a guy who claimed, quite unbelievably, that the Wifione case was a good reason to keep the tools bundled and adminship as high a bar as possible in the very face of evidence that showed otherwise.  Wifione was able to get away with mischief for five years precisely because adminship is an elite process that protects and rallies around its own.  If the tools had been debundled, Wifione would have been desysopped at the first sign of trouble.  Trypto probably isn't aware of any of this or Kudpung's hilarious recall page, which is literally designed to prevent anyone from recalling him!  Go read it if you don't believe me.",0

___________________________
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
OF THE 
IRISH REPUBLIC 
TO THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND 

IRISHMEN AND IRISHWOMEN: In the name of God and of the dead generations from which she receives her old tradition of nationhood, Ireland, through us, summons her children to her flag and strikes for her freedom.

Having organised and trained her manhood through her secret revolutionary organisation, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and through her open military organisations, the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, having patiently perfected her discipline, having resolutely waited for the right moment to reveal itself, she now seizes that moment, and, supported by her exiled children in America and by gallant allies in Europe, but relying in the first on her own strength, she strikes in full confidence of victory.

We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible. The long usurpation of that right by a foreign people and government has not extinguished the right, nor can it ever be extinguished except by the destruction of the Irish people. In every generation the Irish people have asserted their right to national freedom and sovereignty; six times during the last three hundred years they have asserted it to arms. Standing on that fundamental right and again asserting it in arms in the face of the world, we hereby proclaim the Irish Republic as a Sovereign Independent State, and we pledge our lives and the lives of our comrades-in-arms to the cause of its freedom, of its welfare, and of its exaltation among the nations.

The Irish Republic is entitled to, and hereby claims, the allegiance of every Irishman and Irishwoman. The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and all of its parts, cherishing all of the children of the nation equally and oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past.

Until our arms have brought the opportune moment for the establishment of a permanent National, representative of the whole people of Ireland and elected by the suffrages of all her men and women, the Provisional Government, hereby constituted, will administer the civil and military affairs of the Republic in trust for the people.

We place the cause of the Irish Republic under the protection of the Most High God. Whose blessing we invoke upon our arms, and we pray that no one who serves that cause will dishonour it by cowardice, in humanity, or rapine. In this supreme hour the Irish nation must, by its valour and discipline and by the readiness of its children to sacrifice themselves for the common good, prove itself worthy of the august destiny to which it is called.

Signed on Behalf of the Provisional Government.

I’m relatively a new user and for that reason maybe I did some mistakes handling this dispute.

However, everything I did was done in order to have more appropriate article that will thoroughly describe Kumanovo.
As I can see, the page is unprotected now and FSF returned the most of my new additions to the page (and I’m thankful for that). For now I’m not going to make any corrections on the current text and I will leave FSF to do it if he feels the necessity for that in order to finally shape the appropriate look of the article.  I would like to propose to FSF several minor changes on the current version which I think should be done in order to achieve further improvement of the article:
 1. I think the following geographical info should be moved from the Economy into the Overview section: Although Kumanovo lies 340 kilometers above the sea, it is surrounded by the Karadag part of Skopska Crna Gora mountain on its western side, Gradishtanska planina mountain on its southern side and Mangovica and German mountain on the eastern side. Kumanovo has a temperate climate.
 2. I still have doubt about the presence of private practice “Otodent” in the Culture section
 3. By my opinion, the last three sentences in the Culture section would be more appropriate in the History section.

I move to strike  from the Lead.   

I also move to strike the entire last paragraph of the lead {{Genealogical researchers have documented that ancestors of many Lumbee families were part of a tri-racial isolate group of predominantly African and European ethnicity, originating among individuals free in colonial Virginia. Most such free African Americans were descended from unions between white women, servant or free, and African men, servant, free or enslaved. Although relationships across racial lines were tolerated among the servant class in early colonial days, Virginia officials later moved to outlaw them. In the mid-1700s, the free colored families of Virginia migrated together, with other European colonists, into the interior of North Carolina. Researcher Paul Heinegg noted numerous families identified as mulattos, many with characteristically Lumbee names, in the 1768-1770 tax lists for Bladen County, from which Robeson County was formed. Heinegg found no nuclear families listed as Indian. In the 1790-1800 censuses, all free people of color were listed under """"other free"""".[3]}}

"As far as the deletion of the Orion Project article is concerned, that is very easily explained.  Wikipedia is almost entirely dominated by scientistic, atheistic, pseudorationalist defenders of the establishment.  I admit that Greer's article is surprisingly good, and is about as close to objectivity as Wikipedia gets; there are no blanket, euphemistic statements about how he isn't endorsed by the mainstream scientific circle jerk, and is therefore, in the article editor's opinion, simply a crank.

You will not find decent information on this site, however, about anything which challenges the atheistic/scientistic/pseudorationalist worldview, so don't bother wasting your time.

Its Wikipedia article says that some people accuse it of being pro-Beijing, but then again similar accusations appear on the article about the South China Morning Post, which we seem to regard as reliable; the New York Times, which in related discussions Wikipedians seem to regard as reliable, is often accused of having a liberal bias; few newspapers can claim that their coverage is not controversial to some group of people. I contend that Wen Wei Po is a reliable source, and if you maintain—as you asserted above—that Wen Wei Po is a """"well known propaganda arm of the Chinese government"""", then prove it.   """,0

I will be happy to see you make the same statement about that website on the Exodus Decoded discussion board. 

 Second: I will try to find the exact references for the Babylonian seige/loot of Jerusalem, although I cannot devote all my time for this.

"I'm Back!!!!

Well at last I'm back to being able to use Wikipedia, and this time I ain't going NOWHERE D Now for my first action I will address many of the fighter pages that I created that were deleted within the two weeks I was away. Now there were only really four pages that I was really shocked about seeing deleted, which were Tim Newman, Reagan Penn, Jamaine Facey and Jake Bostwick, as they all match Wikipedia's MMA notability criteria. 
Tim Newman has already fought for BAMMA to two occasions, which were BAMMA 4 and BAMMA 5, and he is scheduled to fight on the BAMMA 8 card, all of which have links supporting this. So even thought he has only technically fought for BAMMA twice, because he is clearly a true member of the BAMMA roster, and unless something happens to him which means he cannot compete at BAMMA 8, I find that deleting his Wikipedia page was a massive error for everyone who participated in that debate. 
With Reagan Penn, he doesn't necessary need the sympathy factor for being BJ Penn, as he is currently competing for ProElite, which as we know is a second tier MMA organisation, as they were the same people who have created EliteXC, and everyone agrees that with the attention ProElite are getting now that they are a second tier organisation, so that means that the only thing Penn is missing is a thrid fight under them, and telling by how excited ProElite are having a Penn fighting for them I'd imagine that he will get another fight for them, possibly for the next card, so that means that deleting his Wikipedia card can be seen as being premature, as if he decided to retire after his second bout then fair enough, but he hasn't so far so once again another blunder for those who participated in that debate. 
Finally we have Jamaine Facey and Jake Bostwick. Now these two guys have competed for Cage Rage and Cage Rage UK, both second tier organisations. They both fought on the main cards of Cage Rage on one or two occasions, and competed for the contender cards at least three times each, which means they were already deserving of their positions on here. They are always competing on the main cards of Cage Rage UK which, again, means that the still deserve their spots on here. So for another blunder I would like to see all FOUR men have their pages reinstated as soon as possible, as I'm beginning to suspect that something is not right with the legitimacy of the user/s (who I will keep anonymous so I don't get accused of personal attacks again) who are calling for many pages of mine to be deleted, which also includes the deleting of the Cage Rage UK/UCMMA Wikipedia page, as this orgainisation is one of the big three in the United Kingdom, along side BAMMA and Cage Warriors. So if anyone would like to help me, I want to have these problems to be fully investigated and would like to see a real result on here. Thank you for reading",0

"Point one: The anomalous status of Palestinian refugees and of UNRWA is a result of historical contingency, not some imagined antisemitic double standard. The original intention of UNRWA was to abate the immediate humanitarian situation, then help Palestinians integrate into their new host countries. Palestinian refugees generally refused integration, as did host countries and donors, which is why UNRWA eventually gave up on integrating them. It is correct to call this a political decision rather than a strictly humanitarian one, but the alternative - pressing for integration - would also be a political decision rather than a strictly humanitarian one, so cries of UNRWA's politicization are fairly silly.
What this means for the article: The anomalous situation of Palestinian refugees should be mentioned, but not at every turn, not in the second paragraph of the lede, and not in a fashion which boosts the Israeli government's view of UNRWA over other views.",0

 About .  

I already e-mailed this report on . I hope that someone of serious Wikipedia administrators will read this report and take serious steps in protecting the Wikipedia dignity

Hello,

I do understand that Wikipedia is a free encyclopaedia - but still some kind of very basic ethicalrules shall be applicable and obliging to all editors.I noticed that you have a person whose nick name is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Spylab and whose number of edits goes over 60 per day very often spanning 5-11 hours dayly. This person is extremely agressive and intolerant and his/her edits are causing a lot of damage and irritated many people.

The best way to describe his/her behaviour and 'contributions' are given by a few people which can be summarised/quoted this way:

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Spylab&oldid;=65026476

'I am probably from the USA and like to scrap others' contributions due to what I call """"factual correctness"""" - instead of knowing the facts and reporting them!'

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Spylab/User_talk:Spylab/archive3#What.27s_is_the_problem.3F.3F.3F

'I've noticed that you are editing someone's contribution by altering the text under pretext of grammar corrections - not reading references at all. Moreover, not reading the references nor providing your own - you are demanding new references.

Also, on January 12th you've made 65 edits on various articles in the span of more than 11 hours(merge, clean, copy, revert, etc). Don't you think that it might be seen as something wrong with you if you are spending day after day, hours and hours - practically not contributing anything serious to Wikipedia, only irritating many people this way???'

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#About_Basic_Editorial_Ethics_Here

'When seeing that the existing edition of the Croatia section here, was reduced by User:Spylab to just 6 sentences out of which four were marked by the [citation needed] tag . Moreover, User:Spylab 'completed' his own 'editorial' work by adding {unreferenced|date=November 2006} and {weasel} tags on the top of this page!!! How a serious editor could tag/mark his own edits this way??? I reverted the section demanding explanation for this almost complete section destruction. Ultimately, the existing edits cannot be re-written or destroyed by just throwing claim 'replaced content with info from Neo-Nazism in Croatia because old version didn't focus on neo-Nazism' as he did.

All my attempts to bring the editorial work on the same start and support any further editorial work with facts and serious observations - failed. Instead even willing to discuss the issue seriously, User:Spylab started throwing accusations 'last edit brok 3RR rule', 'you may be blocked' , 'sock-puppetry' etc. and selfpraising (User:Spylab) work as superior and claiming that I do not know what Neo-Nazism is. My attempt (questions) to ask him why he deleted what he deleted already - are removed from the talk page and when I've put back the deleted questions - User:Spylab ignored them completely.

I had impression that I have to deal with an extremely cheeky and primitive personality and wondered how this person could have any access to the editirial work here. Then, I went further and examined the whole User:Spylab editorial work and noticed that User:Spylab commited more than 500 changes within 10 days i.e. more than fifty edits per day - (November 28 - December 7 2006). In that period of time [User:Spylab] was busy by the Wikipedia editing on: November 29 - 9 hours, November 30 - 16 hours (63 edits!!!) , December 1 - 18 hours, December 2 - 7 hours, December 3 - 8 hours, December 4 - 21 hours, December 5 - 12 hours, December 6 - 17 hours, and December 7 - 8 hours.

The content of User:Spylab edits were - spelling check, version reverts, removal of links, copy-paste etc. So it is quite clearly that I had to deal with a mentally challenged person!!!

I just wonder how it is possible that a serious publisher could allow such access to the articles to a person like User:Spylab.' As per his/her own words, as an Neo-Nazism in Croatia section editor, Spylab publicly claims

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#Page_protection_sought

'Actually, it's not complicated at all. The revert war has nothing to do with point of view, and I am not an expert on Croatia at all.'

My note - how then this person should edit some subject (s)he is not familirar with? Also, all references written in Croatian and given here in the Neo-Nazism in Croatia were removed. As per Spylab question here

"""==GA Reassessment==
:This discussion is transcluded from Talk:University College London/GA1. The edit link for this section can be used to add comments to the reassessment.

{{#ifeq:|Talk||}}
 To uphold the quality of Wikipedia:Good articles, all articles listed as Good articles are being reviewed against the GA criteria as part of the GA project quality task force. While all the hard work that has gone into this article is appreciated, unfortunately, as of August 17, 2009, this article fails to satisfy the criteria, as detailed below. For that reason, the article has been delisted from WP:GA. However, if improvements are made bringing the article up to standards, the article may be nominated at WP:GAN. If you feel this decision has been made in error, you may seek remediation at WP:GAR. 

There are at least 5 broken links.

I'm concerned that some sections of this article look like a personal essay. For instance, from Student accommodation: """"Most students in college or university accommodation are first-year undergraduates. The majority of second and third-year students and postgraduates find their own accommodation in the private sector. This is partly due to the fact that accommodation in and around Central London is often cheaper than university accommodation when shared with friends or flat-mates."""" Thay may well be true, but personal reminiscences are not suitable material for an encyclopedia article. Whose opinion is this? It needs to be either cited or removed.

I'm also concerned that almost the entire Alumni and academics section is uncited, and neither are sources provided in the main article to which this one links.

The present order of sections makes no sense, starting as it does with Academic reputation. Take a look at other university GAs such as University College, Durham or University of Bristol to get some ideas for a more logical presentation sequence.

The Notable buildings section needs to be converted to prose, and to focus on the notable buildings, not just list every building. It ought to be telling us something about these notable buildings, not just listing them.

The Student accommodation section is similarly largely just a list. This article is not supposed to be a brochure for University College.

The relevant pictures from the Gallery ought to be incorporated into the text at the appropriate places and the rest transferred to Commons with a link from this article.

The last three sections—Ethical investment policy, Filming at UCL, and University crest—do not contain enough material to warrant standalone sections.

Ref #85 is marked """"Suspended Domain"""", which makes me suspicious at the current status of UCL Biomedica.

You said right there that you weren't going to answer me, I asked again at 01:01 for some clarification; you started editing again at 02:09 and didn't answer. I figured it was reasonable to believe that you weren't going to answer, since that's what you said. I asked again and just said if there wasn't any answer I wouldn't know any other route except deletion, and I waited further for your response, which you gave now. At no point did I actually nominate them for deletion, but rather I gave you notice of my intention. I don't think this was rude. 
As to the actual matter of the title overrides, you are going around telling people that """"per WP:StS"""" they need to do something, when in fact that redirect goes to your userspace which looks like a Wikiproject.

  Southofwatford: The claim that everything that appears in a newspaper is a sourced fact is just absurd. The word """"fact"""" in such a context no longer has any useful meaning because every rumour or piece of speculation that gets reported has to be treated as factual information. So if newspaper 1 reports something that is directly contradicted by newspaper 2 then both are reporting """"facts"""" - the mind boggles!

Of course we could all do this, but you know as well as I do that the result would be a chaotic mess - more or less what we are getting with this article. It was made clear when protection was turned down that the discussion page was to be used before making changes - you only like to discuss after the event because you know your changes are going to be challenged. Given that your methodology means working by imposition rather than consensus on changes, it is inevitable that it will lead to deteriorationin the quality of the article

PS As for Grove, do you have another source which has corroborated Grove's statement.  His is the only paper on the Doji bara famine.  The Doji bara famine, moreover, predates any censuses of British India (which began in 1871).  His mortality statistics are based on methods that are conjectural and not rigorous.  Moreover, Grove is an environmental historian, not a historian of colonial India, and consequently, not able to assign political blame.  Is there any reference in the paper to the administration of British India?  Is there any evidence (by way of political culpability) in the paper to back up this one isolated sentence?  Cherry picking isolated sentences in the one and only paper on a topic (involving less than rigorous methods) is WP:UNDUE.  As Jimbo Wales himself says, """"If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia regardless of whether it is true or not and regardless of whether you can prove it or not, except perhaps in some ancillary article.""""  In this case, Grove is the only author that has blamed the British, and that too only for not providing relief from the famine, not for causing the famine.

_______________________________________________________________________

I have no problem with the Boeing report, but its conclusion is for tether lengths that are much longer than the ones that are being discussed in this article.  This is where your lack of knowledge about engineering is a problem.
The mass of a space tether goes up with length.  Assuming it could take the thermal environment, you can build a space tether out of kite string.  But there is a limit on how long this space tether could be made based on the strength to weight ratio of the string.  This is where designers start making tapered lines that have more cross sectional area in the middle than at the ends.  Even with this there are still limits on the length based on cost and total mass.  You can make an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator using kite string but it will be larger than the Earth, hence not practical.  That doesn't mean that you still can't use that kite string to fly a kite, obviously you can.  The difference is in the length.  The space elevator is 100,000 km long.  Your kite string is only a few hundred feet at most.  The same applies to skyhooks.  You could build a 100,000 km long space elevator out of T1000GB carbon fibers but it would have near planetary mass and as a result isn't practical.  But like the much shorter kite string for flying a kite, a skyhook made of carbon fibers in the 200 km to 4,000 km range is possible.
As to the references not all being open source on the internet there is not much I can do about that.  You will need to either pay for them or go to a university library that pays for access to them and have them downloaded.  References 7, 18, and 19 are open source.  Reference 19 is only for the part of that paper that covers non-rotating skyhooks and does not include the entire paper.  If you want to see the entire paper do a search using the title on google, it is open source.  
Quite simply the information is out there but you will have to do a little digging or pay for it.  You will also need a basic understanding of engineering and orbital mechanics in regards to space tethers.  For that I recommend the """"Tether in Space Handbook"""", it is also open source on the internet, see reference 7.
You could also just read the abstracts for the non-open source papers and you will get an idea that this is a workable concept.  Or you could just notice who is writing these reports; NASA, reference 19, Lockheed Martin, references 5, 8, 9, and 10, and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, reference 7.  Do you really think these organizations would be wasting their time and money on a lie?

To conclude with the Boeing report.  The Boeing report says 
1) """"His analysis showed that because a hanging tether must be tapered to support its lower end in the gravitational field of the Earth, achieving a HyperSkyhook tether tip rendezvous with a 5.0 km/s (16 kft/s or Mach 16) airplane would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass of 25 times the payload mass.""""

5.0 km/s is 64% of low Earth orbit velocity.  A tether mass of 25 times payload mass can be built.  I have no argument with this.

2) """"Trying to lower the tether tip speed to 4.0 km/s (13 kft/s or Mach 13) would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass greater than 200 times the payload mass.""""

4.0 km/s is 51% of low Earth orbit velocity.  A tether mass of 200 times payload mass sounds about right and it is highly unlikely that such a tether length would be economic.  Again no disagreement.

The tether tip speeds for the non-rotating skyhook examples in this article, and in all the references I have listed, start at 96% of low Earth orbit velocity and go to approximately 70% of low Earth orbit velocity.  There is no reason to go any lower.
As a result, the final line of the Boeing quote, """"In general, the non-spinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts. """" does not apply for two reasons.  1) It doesn't apply to the skyhook lengths in the article, and 2) it is an unfounded over generalization that falls under the category of sales BS that is promoting rotating skyhooks.

Do you now understand how the Boeing quote that you are so fond of does not apply to the non-rotating skyhooks in this article?

PS  The reference numbers are for the article as I have written it.  Since you keep deleting references with your changes, the reference numbers keep changing, hence you will need to use the article as I have written it if you want the reference numbers quoted here to mean anything.

So please, read this until you understand it and do your research to confirm what I and many others are saying.
If you run into any problems that you cannot resolve easily, write me here and I will do what I can to assist you.""",0

 Judy has some experience in that field, but it's not her specialty. From her bio (on her tripod page): B.S. (Civil Engineering, 1981) (Structural Engineering), M.S (Engineering Mechanics, 1983), and, Ph.D. (Materials Engineering Science, 1992) Virginia Polytechnic. """"Her dissertation involved the development of an experimental method to measure thermal stresses in bimaterial joints. She has taught courses including Experimental Stress Analysis, Engineering Mechanics, Mechanics of Materials (Strength of Materials), Strength of Materials Testing. From 1999 to 2006 Dr. Wood has been an assistant professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina. Before moving to Clemson she spent three years as a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Virginia Tech. Dr. Wood is currently writing a book with Morgan Reynolds on the physical evidence explaining the events on 9/11. One of Dr. Wood’s research interests is biomimicry, or applying the mechanical structures of biological materials to engineering design using engineering materials. Other recent research has investigated the deformation behavior of materials and structures with complex geometries and complex material properties, such as fiber-reinforced composite materials and biological materials. Dr. Wood is an expert in the use of moiré interferometry, a full-field optical method that is used in stress analysis. Dr. Wood has over 60 technical publications in refereed journals, conference proceedings, and edited monographs and special technical reports. Dr. Wood started to question the events of 9/11 on that same day when what she saw and heard on television was contradictory and appeared to violate the laws of physics. Since that day she has used her knowledge of engineering mechanics to prove that the collapse of the World Trade Center twin towers could not have happened as the American public was told.

 The Jayways 

The Jayways. A 5 piece band from the depths of essex. With all five members collaborating with writing songs something new arises repeatedly from the practice studio creating fresh indie songs in a contemporary style with a strong 60's back bone. This comes from the strong influences from bands such as the Beatles and the doors. Their sound has been compared to bands such as the strokes, with elements of the kooks, but the unique soulful voice of the front man (Gerry) gives them a distinctive edge. The band formed in January 2007 and begun recording together at their home based studio almost immediatley. A strong response through myspace rapidly built up and in no time at all there was a buzz around their area and the band. As a result they packed out the grand hotel in leigh-on-sea on there first ever gig. This has snow balled into many of the other southeast venues in which the band play in and have seen them repeatidly asked back to perform again as a result. They have not just played venues all over Essex but also London and Liverpool. The band have recently been recording professionally in a music studio called Sensible Music owned by Jeff Alan. They have been produced by the renound producer Jon Moon who has worked with the likes of Amy Winehouse and The Kooks. This has inspired the band to create a record which is desting for the ears of indie inthusiasts. The first single to be released from The Jayways debut album will be """"Until we get it right.""""""",0

Both are organisations which form part of the wider 'EU' which is what we have written about in this article, not simply the definition in the treaty on european union. My primary consideration is to what extent any of these organisations are independent of the member states, not of each other.

 The Treaty of Limerick 

It is sometimes forgotten, that with Sarsfield and the other """"Wild Geese"""" gone,and with the Treaty of Limerick broken, one of Western Europe's most savage bodies of legislation (with the possible exception of laws designed to persecute the Jews)collectively known as """"The Penal Laws,"""" was introduced, designed to reduce the Catholic Irish to a stte of abject misery.

The repeal of the last of the Penal lawswas only completed in 1829, when the Catholic, Kerry barrister, Daniel O'Connell took his seat in the House of Commons (Catholic Liberation).

 E pluribus unum = 13 letters 

Symbolically, the phrase E pluribus unum has 13 letters (as does annuit coeptis). This example of gematria (isopsephy) then represents the 13 colonies becoming the United States. The back of the US 2010 penny features E pluribus unum and a shield with 13 vertical stripes. The back of the US dollar includes these 13 letters among 13 symbolic references to the number 13. - p. 121, The Secret Symbols of the Dollar Bill by David Ovason (Harper Collins, 2004)

The ancient practice of Hebrew gematria/Greek isopsephy/Arabic gematria (and modern Simple[6,74] English[7,74] Gematria[8,74]) appears to primarily concentrate on the gematric sums of words/names, i.e. Sargon=74 (S19+a1+r18g7+o15+n14). But this is actually 'Step 2' of gematria(74). 'Step 1' of gematria(8) is simply counting the number of letters in a word/name/phrase. Because of Latin Numerals not coinciding with their place in the Latin Alphabet, i.e. I does not = 1, Latin Gematria never gave much importance to Step 2 of gematric sum. But the learned Romans and other learned practioners of Latin did recognize Step 1 of counting the Latin letters and giving significance to it. This example of counting the number of letters and giving it importance and can be traced back to Plato's use of """"God is ever a geometer"""", which in Greek - equals 3,1,4,1,5,9 or 3.14159 pi. - Brad Watson, Miami, FL 64.136.26.22  """,0

There is no any reason why delete the total number of recognitions. It is a logical first information in the intro. On the contrary, there is no reason why the number of UN members in acknowledging the intro article placed twice.

...the Nixon administration decided to try to ensure that international financial relations should be taken out of the control of state Central Banks and should be increasingly centred upon private financial operators. It sought to achieve this goal through exploiting US control over  international oil supplies. 

It is still widely believed that the sharp and steep increase in oil prices  in 1973 was carried out by the Gulf states as part of an anti-Israel and anti-US policy connected to the Yom Kippur war.  

Yet as we now know, the oil price rises were the result of US influence on the oil states and they were arranged in part as an exercise in economic statecraft directed against America’s ‘allies’ in Western Europe and Japan. And another dimension of the Nixon administration’s policy on oil price rises was to give a new role, through them, to the US private banks in international financial relations.

The Nixon administration was planning to get OPEC to greatly increase its oil prices a full two years before OPEC did so and as early as 1972 the Nixon administration planned for the US private banks to recycle the petrodollars when OPEC finally did take US advice and jack up oil prices.  

The Nixon administration understood the way in which the US state could use  expanding private financial markets as a political multiplier of the impact of US Treasury moves with the dollar. But according to the Nixon’s Ambassador in Saudi Arabia at the time, the principal political objective behind Nixon’s drive for the OPEC oil price rise was to deal a crippling blow to the Japanese and European economies, both overwhelmingly dependent on Middle East Oil, rather than to decisively transform international financial affairs. 

Nevertheless , Nixon’s officials  showed far more strategic insight into the consequences of what they were attempting than most political scientists would credit any government with. Its capacity for deception both over the oil price rise and in the way in which it manipulated discussions with its ‘allies’ in the IMF over so-called ‘international monetary reform’ was brilliant.

The US government realised that the oil price rises would produce an enormous increase in the dollar earnings of oil states that could not absorb such funds into their own productive sectors.

At the same time, the oil price rises would plunge very many states into serious trade deficits as the costs of their oil imports soared. So the so-called petrodollars would have to be recycled from the Gulf through the Western banking systems to non-oil-producing states.

Other governments had wanted the petrodollars to be recycled through the  IMF.  But the US rejected this, insisting  the Atlantic world’s private banks (at that time led by American banks) should be the recycling vehicles. And because the US was politically dominant in the Gulf, it could get its way...

Why did you delete the one source that we've been talking the most about? Why do you want to hide the truth from readers? The concepts of qi and meridians are very contentious, because they don't exist from a reductionist, disectionist, Western medical science point of view. 

Do you want to know what meridians are? Every type of tissue, muscle fiber, etc, is wrapped up and enclosed in fascia. Meridians are the spaces in between these fascia, you are never going to """"find"""" them by cutting bodies apart and looking at them in a microscope. They are the nothingness that provides function, as in verse 11 of the Tao Te Ching 
""""Thirty spokes converge
In the hub of a wheel;
But the use of the cart

On the hub that is void.

2nd No, you saw pretty wrong - the 2nd quote of the version I propose is not present in the current version. 

3rd Again... One more time... the present version has a serious flaw, as I put above in the section Spurious Quotations, by using a book citation in a spurious way doubly, not only by stating a different thing from the original citation, but mainly acting so, leaving a implicit meaning totally different from the original quote (To refresh your memory:) """" The original book citation states that in certain historical moment, a military revolt sparked a cycle of instability, while the present version using the 1st one in a partial way as reference (to give a veneer of respectability), states that the rise to power of the civilians, a year later, would have been responsible for the beginning of the overall instability.""""
""""Thus, spurious quotation aside, also a spurious correlation.""""

So, if to one:
a) eliminate such spuriousness and
b) put the appropriate initial causes of the instability of this period with proper references
is not an improvement... Well, it would become not just hard, but impossible to believe in this one's good faith, as well as it would be the confirmation of this one's selective double standard behavior... 

4th Concerning to the civilians' rising to power in the end of 1894, it was implied in some of my previous versions... 
which also, after more than a year... were not improved neither discussed, but disruptively reverted...
Anyway... for now, how about(?):
 """"The early Brazilian republican period was nothing more than a military dictatorship.* Following the bubble of encilhamento** and the 1st naval revolt, the country entered into a prolonged cycle of general instability marked by rebellions, both civilian*** as military,*** that even with the ascension to power of civilians at the end of 1894, did not stop. Little by little these rebellions undermined the regime in a such extent that by 1930, in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most of the military, to lead a revolt.* """"
Oooor...
""""The early Brazilian republican period was nothing more than a military dictatorship,* and pretty before the civilians rise to power in 1894, following 2 severe crisis, an economic and a military,** the country has entered into a prolonged cycle of general instability marked by rebellions, both civilian*** as military.***' Little by little these rebellions undermined the regime in a such extent that by 1930, in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most of the military, to lead a revolt.* """"

Circumcision   
 
Quote from Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem: Keter publishers limited, 1972)   
   
""""In 1843, the clerical leaders of the Reform movement in Frankfort sought to abolish circumcision among their adherents; the controversy concerning its necessity in Judaism lasted 20 years and eventually spread to America. They based their objections to circumcision on five reasons (among which two directly refer to the Ten Commandments): (1) It was commanded to Abraham and not to Moses... (2) It is only mentioned only once in the Mosaic law; it is not repeated in Deuteronomy... All (their) reasons were answered by Orthodox rabbinical authorities. To counter this agitation, Leopold Zunz wrote his essay on circumcision (Gutachten ueber did Beschneidung, Frankfort, 1843). Today, most Reform Jews have their children circumcised. It is, however, often done by a surgeon with a rabbi in attendance to say the prayers, or without any ceremony at all."""" (see discussion for more information)

 I've got a question about theropod height, and another about Dromaeosaurids... 

Well, 2 years ago, you gave me a hand with a school project I was working in by making this size chart.

Well, I managed to get the highest possible mark in that subject, so that compensated for some weaker marks, and I managed to enter University without much pressure, so thanks again. Anyway, I was recently surfing the web and I came across this image: http://kronosaurus82.deviantart.com/art/Biggest-Ugliest-Baddest-140881861 As you can see, the animals that appear in it are the same as in the size chart you made, however, we can see some discrepances in their height. So, my question is, is this reconstruction correct in this regard? Tyrannosaurids having longer leg bones that Allosauroids and Spinosaurids (and the latter having a lower profile that other theropods) is pretty common knowledge, and longer leg bones mean more height, but, still, the mounted skeleton of Sue is not that much taller that mounted Giganotosaurus, if I recall correctly, and the mount of Spinosaurus is quite massive...

Anyway, about Dromaeosaurs, do you have any idea about the environment Deinonychus and Utahraptor lived in? I ask, mainly, because of the whole feather density (or oven presence, in some cases, it seems), and, after seeing how you reconstructed Achillobator, and the reasoning behind the ratite feathering you gave it, I've been pondering how that could affect medium-large dromaeosaurs in less arid climates.

In any case, could I ask you a favour, if you have the time and the inmediate means? If yes, remember the giant bird size chart?  
Could you add a Velociraptor mongoliensis silouette to it, if you can? I mainly need it to driving a point straight home (not like it is that needed, the paper that describes the quill knobs on that genus is pretty good evidence for wings, but, still...). Again, if you have time. In any case, Deinonychus' height would be slighty higher if it adopted a more natural position that the crouching (or as so I see it, correct me if needed) one it is displaying in the chart. Also, do you think Aepyornis would be heavier that Utahraptor? Seeing that the model for estimating weights was deemed somewhat flawed, and that, at least in the chart, Aepyornis has a larger body, well, yeah...

By the way, I like how you classified Oviraptorosaurs as an order of Aves, and Deinonychosaurs as part of Archaeopterygiformes. It, well, makes sense, that classification should get more standariced. One tends to forget about those things when thinking in a cladistic way, but, that update would be something needed to change the overall image of those animals. I may start writting them in that way, well, when I get my licenciature and start doing actual work and research in place of preparing exams. Well, better that """"when"""", """"if"""", but I hope I do.

Anyway, keep up your good work, I've been following your blog, and I like what I read over there!

No... we only categorize """"standard biographical information"""" (year of birth/death, religious affiliation, national identity, etc.) and those things that are related to what """"makes the subject notable"""".  In Graham's case his masonic credentials are not what """"make him notable"""". It does not really matter what Graham may have valued or what he was proud of... What matters is what sources (such as historians) think is of value.  If there are sources that discuss his Masonic credentials, and talk about how they affected Graham's life and his achievements, then he would be Categorized. 
The truth is, being a 32nd degree Mason is not that noteworthy... any 3rd degree Mason can become one... all it takes is paying an initiation fee, and spending one afternoon watching the degree ceremony being performed as a play.  In fact, you don't even have to take the 4th - 31st degrees as a prerequisite (you can jump right from being a 3rd degree to being 32nd).  Now, if Graham had been a 33rd degree things would be a bit different... that degree is somewhat rare and is a special award given for service.  
As for being elected Master of a lodge, even that is not that notable... most lodges elect a new Master every year, and since there are tens of thousands of lodges in the US alone, this means that there are literally hundreds of thousands of Past Masters in the US.  In smaller lodges, it is not uncommon for every member of the lodge to have a turn as Master.  Now... if Graham had been elected Grand Master of an entire Masonic jurisdiction things would be different... state or national level Masonic office is somewhat notable (there are only hundreds and not thousands each year), and that is the level of notability that deserves categorization.

I'm not sure if the reference to open source as an example of innovation outside the 'traditional' IP model is as strong as it could be. As far as I can see, the 'standard' argument for IP protection is not that it's the only way that people can innovate, but that the overall level of innovation will be much higher with it. 

The fact that 'works of authorship can be written without direct financial incentives' does not in itself contradict the standard IP model. For such criticism to be very strong, you would have to show not only that 'direct financial incentives' are not always required, but also that 'direct financial incentives' do not act as a meaningful incentive to innovate in significant cases.

In other words, the standard IP model does not say that counterexamples cannot exist. It just says that you will get more overall innovation with IP protection that you would without it. Listing counterexamples, without also discussing their wider significance, does not in itself invalidate the 'incentives to innovate' argument. It would perhaps be better to cite studies of the effects of patent reform or something like that.",0

 Politecnico di studi aziendali legal status 

The Federal Administrative Court (TAF) decided that exist in Switzerland - national - basically two forms of recognition for colleges. This is, on the one hand, the recognition of a university as a person entitled to benefits under the Federal Law of 8 October 1999 on support for universities and cooperation in higher education (Law on Assistance to universities, LAU, RS 414.20), on the other accreditation in accordance with Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Federal Government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector (RS 414 205). Both the recognition according to the LAU is accreditation are awarded solely as a result of an examination of the quality (art. 11 cpv.3 letter. at LAU; Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Confederation and the University Cantons on support for universities and cooperation in higher education). The recognition according to the LAU is aimed at the provision of federal subsidies and is the responsibility of the Federal Council (Art. 12 para. 1 LAU), accreditation, by contrast, is conferred by the Conference Swiss University (art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the federal government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector) and is a mark of quality, which does not confer on its holder the right to a federal financial aid (see. FF 1999 243, 355), (judgment of TAF of August 13, 2013 B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 10 et seq.). Accordingly, the mere exercise of a university is not subject to authorization and is based on the freedom of science and economic freedom, as stated in the preamble of the now decayed authorization of the State Council on 14 February 2006. ISSEA sa is then free to confer titles, without that this requires an estimate accreditation or recognition subsidies and must be considered as recognized by national law (judgment of the TAF of 13 August 2013, B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 11).

The edits made by multiple IP addresses on this page, as you know,  have been (not always but  by and large) at best unhelpful but much more often downright offensive and I see absolutely no reason why that should be allowed to continue.  Again, you know I am not talking about the juvenile HI MOMs - they are also annoying, but that is not what plagues this page.  We are plagued by targeted vandalism - changing """"Obama"""" to """"Osama"""", for example, and the regular changing of text that has hidden text clearly requesting that it not be changed right there, plus blatant POV pushing, trolling, etc.  Classic case for permanent sprot. The result, when sprot is in place, is the ability to conscientiously edit and improve the article (which has a changing base of facts so needs constant attention).  But rather than being able to easily evaluate substantive changes that responsible editors make, we are bogged down in having to go through screen after screen of pure and often vicious vandalism. For what positive reason, may I ask?

IP edits also can be used, I suppose, by regular editors who don't want to reveal that they are making sub rosa changes, but I would hope that is not going on here.  

And IP addresses have quite rarely reverted vandalism here - in fact I just looked at the last 500 edits and didn't see a single case of an IP address reverting vandalism. Maybe I missed one, but that claim was not really reflective of what goes on on this page - it is a very small group of actual editors who do the vast majority of the reverting.  

Your comment above about there being only one vandalism on Dec 21 was just one day after sprot was lifted the last time. I said then that I hoped to be wrong, but predicted that vandalism would be back up and it is.  That's why I requested extended protection.

If what  you were unhappy about is the tag itself, I also thought all along that we should have {{sprotect2}} and had thought to change it last time but the block was lifted before I had a chance to.   I have changed it to that less obtrusive tag.  The question of the duration  of the lock is what I am interested in. Two-three weeks is much better than what we had a few weeks ago, and may coincide with any announcement that Senator Obama makes which is also good timing for sprot, but  I'd like to understand why you would want it not to be an extended one, because I can't make any sense out of your position on this, as a person (you, I mean) who clearly is interested in having this remain a high quality page, as evidenced by the excellent work you do here, and the fact that this page has been by far your main area of Wikipedia editing.    | talk

 A tag has been placed on Igero bus, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia per CSD g1. 

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not meet basic Wikipedia criteria may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as an appropriate article, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is appropriate, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add  on the top of the article and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag) and leave a note on the page's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself. —talkcontribs """,0

Atlanterhavsveien
Sorry I forgot to log in when editing that page. I'd stick with both points of my edits though - Wikipedia definitely doesn't use """","""" as the decimal separator, even on Continental European articles, or when working in kilometres. Secondly, it's a road, not a bridge. However, it is a road that has a lot of bridges on it - a good analogy is the Overseas Highway in the Florida Keys. For now I'd be happy to leave it in the bridge section. I don't understand why you reverted the inclusion of Category:Roads in Norway - I mean, it is a road, and it's in Norway, right?  
No worries, apology appreciated ) It looks like you do a lot of good work here, thanks!

I do not know how far you up to date with the conflict that is keeping editors from editing the page. If not, I suggest you have a look at the arbitration case that is currently pending.  

To facilitate, this was the version most people (except Marcosantezana) could live with:

Natural selection is the process in which individual organisms that possess favourable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.  Natural selection works on the phenotype, the outward form determined by genes (the genotype), the environment and the interaction between them. Only heritable variations in a trait will be passed on to the next generation and the frequency of favourable heritable traits will increase in subsequent generations. The underlying genetic variation in traits is the result of genetic processes, such as mutations and recombinations, and can undo the effect of natural selection if strong enough relative to the effect of natural selection. Natural selection, together with other mechanisms such as genetic drift and mutations, is an important component of evolution, a cornerstone of modern biological and medical research.

The term was introduced by Charles Darwin in 1859 in his book """"The Origin of Species"""", as an analogy with a farmer choosing individuals that possess desired characteristics for his breeding stock, which Darwin called artificial selection.

Maybe you find it not god, and in that case, I am curious what you think of that.  

I made a lits of aspects here: User_talk:KimvdLinde/Natural_selection#Natural_selection_aspects

"I think the issue here has to do just with overwriting existing data.  There's four things you might want to do to your storage (whether disk, tape, or SSD): 
A) initialize it, B) read from some area; C) Write data to a previously unused area, and D) write data to a previously used area.  Bubble memory can't treat C and D equivalently.  With bubble memory you can't change a one into a zero like you can change a zero to a one  the former requires special processing, the latter does not  and that special processing is several times more time consuming than B or C.  It's such an exceptionally slow process with high overhead, that your perception of your SSD would probably be unfavorable if the manufacturer allowed you to perform it on small chunks of data.  An analogy  if you're going to drive a long way to the store, get everything in one trip  even if you don't need it immediately  because if you have to make two (or three or four) trips you won't be pleased with the result.",0

Blackie Lstreet: Why do you keep posting the same thing over and over again, and ignoring what has already been stated? You accuse us of ignoring the advice (yeah, that's right ADVICE) of outside editors, and yet you ignore that consensus at this article is to remove the POV tag because we don't see what you see! You ignore the very fact that """"What little, so-called BLP issues were there have been removed.

 A blog post I think is important 
First, I appreciate the notes that were left recently, and the ones left during the February drama.  I will probably be back, but not like I was before.  I love Wikimedia and everything it is trying to do.  I wanted to be a part of it.  More, I wanted to show its potential.  The worst misconception about me is that I am arrogant about my work.  I most want people to realize that everything I did, they can do too.  You don't even need to do what I did; your own secret hopes and ambitions on here have the potential to succeed.  

It's not self-promotion.  If you are contributing work of such high quality that you could actually make a career for yourself, then Wikipedia is damn lucky to have you.  If what you give is crap, face it:  your stuff will be removed, nobody will stick up for you and you'll have zero hopes of ever branching beyond Wikipedia.  This is important:  you should strive to contribute material that is of such high quality people actually think you could be a professional (but the ridiculous argument that you are using Wikipedia to doing that is stupid beyond belief).  

I outlined on my blog how I went about doing what I did on here, how you could replicate it if you wanted, and general advice.  I don't care if anyone follows it.  But I certainly hope it explains how unexceptional my contributions were; that is, if only other people attempted what I did.  

I'm an artist - I wanted to work on here and give something back.  But I never wish to be a professional photographer or journalist/reporter.  I realize that's a shock for many to believe.  Wikipedia is a great public space to attempt art, whether it be journalism and information as art, or photography that is encyclopedic before it is artistic.  

Here's the blog post where I try to explain how I succeeded to gain access, improved my photography and made a reputation for myself simply for doing what I believed in on Wikipedia:  blog.shankbone.org/2008/07/19/david-shankbone-finally-tells-you-how-to-replicate-his-success.aspx

If contributing high quality work that is recognized on and off Wikipedia is self-promotion, then we need more self-promoters who try to create such high quality.

Right, right.. When you provide a source for the autonomy of the NOViPOS, then we can take that into consideration. They were geographically seperated from the Partisan Main Operational Group in Bosnia and Montenegro, but they were not autonomous. Moving on.   (talk) 

As I was saying, the article was created as a WP:POVFORK:
It represents the nationalist POV that Partisan movement in Slovenia were somehow separate or exceptionally autonomous from the rest of the Partisan movement. Which is incorrect.
It creates a non-existant organization, the """"Slovene Partisans"""". There were Slovene Partisans, but there was no organization defined by ethnicity within the Partisan movement.
It basically covers Slovene WWII history instead of the Partisans themselves.
Even so, it overlaps completely with the scope of the Yugoslav Partisans article.
This article, in its current organization serves only to perpetuate the nationalist notions of one user. Its extreme language is a testament to this (among other things). It should either be restructured as a Slovene WWII history article, or it should be merged. As it stands, its a violation of policy (WP:POVFORK).   (talk) """,0

Although it does help to greatly increase the speed and efficiency of ones edits it also is just one of many tools, like twinkle, Hotcat and a variety of others whose edits are counted. I would also note that I question the data somewhat because Rich Farmbrough did a lot of edits himself prior to being banned from automation so I find it hard to believe that there was only a modest drop. I doubt that the remaining editors did enough edits to offset that loss and certainly counting bot edits we are missing out on a lot. With that said, the corps Wikipedia site seems to be operating progressively slower with each new release so that IMO is at least part of the reason for the decline. Also, the tabs tend to jump around a lot on slow connections so editors not familiar with the site get turned off rather quickly by have to play chase the wild button around.

 Hi David, thanks for your answer. However, I could not find any place on this page where I have """"distorted, selected, or combined evidence to suit my own view"""". I am a scientist in the field of metrology and if you make such a serious accusation you should back it up. I am pretty sure that everything I wrote (in the article) was based on sources.

I know that it is used frequently, but I did not find a definition so far. This lack of definition is the reason why I was against the renaming my article to Kendrick mass and this became the basis of this dispute. Thanks for your help.

Another scenario could be that a friend or relative has seen how the account user writes and has decided to hack into their account and perform some very inappropriate edits under that person's username ... meanwhile the owner of the account is completely oblivious to this and only when they log in or just take a look at their user talk page find that they have been either issued a warning (s) or have been BLOCKED for something they did NOT do as a result of the nastiness caused by the vandal (hacker), the person that has USED their account to create problems with other users and to ultimately get them in a lot of trouble with the Wikipedia Community.",0
"""POV ==

The comments at the end of the article violate the Wikipedia policies on NPOV and verifiability.  In particular:

""""But the party never succeeded in persuading many people that Communism was the answer to these problems."""" -
This statement implies that the CPA was trying to persuade people that Communism was the answer to issues of civil rights, etc.  I doubt that this is the case, and it is not supported by any source that I know of.

""""Against these achievements must be set the party's long history as an apologist for the Soviet Union."""" -
The word """"apologist"""" is highly pejorative, and has no place in an encyclopedia article.  For example, the article on the Liberal Party does not describe them as an apologist for the United States.  In addition, the CPA appears to have been critical of the Soviet Union starting in 1968 (23 years before its dissolution).  It would be reasonable to state that the CPA long supported the Soviet Union, but this would be misleading without mentioning that the party was later critical of the Soviet Union.

""""Disenchantment with the Soviet Union led most of the party's members to leave over time."""" -
There were many factors leading to declining membership, and some people even left due to the CPA's criticism of the Soviet Union.  Although it is likely that disenchantment with the Soviet Union was the primary cause, this statement should be more specific and supported by a source.

Giving positive and negative POV is different to NPOV.  The article should present facts without passing moral judgement.  On its own, listing the issues that the CPA campaigned on is not POV, because it does not pass moral judgement on whether these were good or bad (although the wording does tend to present these campaigns as positive).  However, using the wording """"Against these achievements must be set"""" turns the paragraph into an argument on the merits of the CPA, with the campaigns presented as something positive and support for the Soviet Union presented as something negative.
TABIf this material is included, it should be given in a separate paragraph and give a factual account of the CPA's history of support and criticism of the Soviet Union.

When it comes to characterizing living persons, that paradigm is demonstrably fraught with errors that are nigh impossible to fix.

There are famous cases in history when the vast majority of people held laughable misconceptions.  But science is an arduous process, and many dedicated scientists have suffered grievously for having the temerity to displace a popular misconception with a superior theory grounded in evidence and reasoning.

Getting people to honestly question their assumptions and conscientiously examine both their assumptions and the evidence for them is one of the recurring challenges in science education.

This is ludicrous.  20:15, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I agree entirely.  However, it is no more ludicrous than splitting Walsall or Dudley.   20:26, Mar 3, 2004 (UTC)

There are some good reasons to split district articles from their town.  They include (a) if the district is much larger than the town, and covers a lot of countryside (b) if the district includes town which have a strong identity.  That the borough/district is a city is not a good reason, because city status is a mere honorific and doesn't change facts on the ground.  If we split Dudley and Walsall we have to split Birmingham, Coventry, and Wolverhampton.  Note I am opposed to all splits of articles about metropolitan boroughs.   20:32, Mar 3, 2004 (UTC)

Nice to see this one's been reunified. It seems (seemed) a bit more ludicrous than spliiting Walsall (town) form Walsal (Borough) because there was nothing to indicate that Wolverhampton (city) contained more than Wolverhampton (town). I guess you were just making a point, and it doesn't.

I think the articles should be split on the basis of how much we've got to say about the two definitions. If we've only got a few lines about one it can live with the other.

I was indeed making a point, though it seems to have been missed.  If we look at Birmingham, say, the city includes Sutton Coldfield but the 'town' does not!   This, however, does not mean to say we should split the article.  I know that someone from Bradford said that Bradford shouldn't be split, even though Bradford is a far far clearer case for splitting than Dudley.   20:53, Mar 3, 2004 (UTC)

Wiki on Wolverhampton is 100x better than it was a year ago...

 Sport 

Wolverhampton Wanderers have never been in the current UEFA Champions League competition.  Wolves have only been in the English F.A. Premiership for one season (2002/03) since the Champions League began, and in that season they were relegated back to the lower-division Coca-Cola Championship.

The current Champions League competition only started in the 1992/93 season, the premier European club tournament before the Champions League was the European Champions Club Cup in which Wolves did compete in.

 

In fact, the UEFA Champions' League was a simple rebrand of the previous competition - which was created due to the European success of Wolverhampton Wanderers, and the reaction of the British press to the results. 

To quote from European_Cup_and_Champions_League_History: """"Before we declare that Wolverhampton are invincible, let them go to Moscow and Budapest. And there are other internationally renowned clubs: A.C. Milan and Real Madrid to name but two. A club world championship, or at least a European one - larger, more meaningful and more prestigious than the Mitropa Cup and more original than a competition for national teams - should be launched."""" - Gabriel Hanot  

 Remit of this article 
This is a thought of mine that's been prompted by the recent addition and removal of Perton and Bilbrook from the article.

What exactly is the remit of the article?  After all, there are several definitions of what Wolverhampton is.

The Local Authority area administered by Wolverhampton City Council.
The Wolverhampton Urban Sub-Area as defined by the ONS (or the """"city proper"""", perhaps?)  This include the LA area, plus the areas within South Staffordshire district that are physically attached (within 50m) to the urban area.  These would include Lower Penn, Perton, Coven Heath, Westcroft and Essington.
The above, plus areas that are within a few hundred metres of the Urban Area - such as Wombourne, Codsall, Bilbrook, Coven, Featherstone.  Most of these areas were recommended for inclusion in the Borough by the",0

"This article confuses several different types of anti-personnel ammunition - originally called 'shrapnel' (after its inventor), 'grape' and 'cannister'.  Shrapnel and cannister seem to have been mainly land service ammunition while 'grape' seems to have been mainly naval.

Shrapnel was invented circa 1800, but later that century it was used with more modern shaped shells.  A shrapnel shell is like a flying shotgun, the bullets are ejected while the shell is in flight by a small charge and they fly forwards in a cone.  The charge is initiated by a time fuze (igniferious at this period)in the shell's nose, which is blown clear as the bullets leave.  Bullet sizes varied, but by WW1 they were usually lead antimony alloy with a few hundred bullets per pound weight.

Cannister, in contrast, is bullets in a can and the can bursts as it is fired.  This means cannister is short range.  While shrapnel was little used in WW2, cannister was developed for various weapons including tanks.  Australian Centurion tanks in Vietnam had 20-pdr cannister.

Cannister was always carried by British artillery in its 19th century campaigns and quite widely used. Sometimes it had to be locally assembled from old bully-beef cans. Shrapnel remained their primary anti personnel weapon into WW1, and always the ammunition of choice against 'troops in the open'. In 1945 they successfully trialled 95mm shrapnel fuzed VT.

Beehive, correctly called Splintex, was developed by the US in the Vietnam period.  It is a shrapnel type shell - it is fitted with a mechanical time fuze and the flechettes are fired forward from the shell in flight. It was available for 105mm arty, 106mm RCL, 90mm RCL, and probably others.  US policy was for splintex to be only fired at direct fire, ie for arty it was local defence only, presumably for fear of blinds being re-cycled by the enemy into IEDs.  However, the USSR appears to have subsequently developed 122mm and 152mm shells of this type and used them for indirect fire.",0

Nice Try

The Idea of wikipedia is to present facts, not your opinions about the incumbant Mayor or the attempted highjacking of the Democratic Party. Granted you have a problem with Mayor Longo, as you make this clear every time you open your mouth at the Council Meetings (which provide for great entertainment as you seem to enjoy making a fool of yourself). Your opinions on red light cameras are off base as your candidate has yet to come up with a better solution to raise funds to get us out of fiscal emergency. In fact, Mr Wagner has no plan at all except to claim he will stop forclosures in the city- this is a national problem that the federal government cant stop let alone the would be Mayor of Garfield Hts. Mr Wagner goes around telling people whatever they want to hear in order to get their votes. Including but not limited to offering political patronage jobs to anyone willing to support him. Mr Wagner has been long known for playing dirty tricks as well as insulting his peers and the Mayor himself. The recent theft of the name of the Democratic Party orchestrated by his stooges such as yourself and """"Mr Lamoron"""" can only serve to harm his popularity and candidacy. Your candidate refers to his opponent as an """"uneducated union thug"""" while he proves himself to be an overeducated fool. At a recent Council meeting you were heard uttering """"its on"""", what is? more foolish self serving antics directed at slandering the name of the official democratic candidate? While you do not have the courage to run for office you can only hope Wagner wins this election so he can offer your wife the position of Economic Development Director, as this has to be the only reason you would campaign for someone of his calibre. It doesnt take much to open a user page, unless your afraid of the response you will get by offering your support to a self serving looser  """,0

 Restructuring 

Okay, let me explain some of my restructing:
I removed the history section because I don't think it will ever be expanded. The records of achievement is pretty much the history of the team. 
I adjusted the lead paragraph. """"Excluded"""" is rather POV-leaning, even though it was the truth. I changed that to """"the withdrawal"""", which is the official usage. 
I grouped all the participated competitions together so that it looks organized.
Removed the statistics; the Taiwanese team is not even in any of those tables. 
Reformatted the Roster section. Since it's the national team, it's really unnecessary to include the flag when they are obviously all from the same country.

Relevance of True Believers Syndrome
Andries, what is the relevance of adding a section about """"True Believers Syndrome""""? It appears you are pushing your POV by adding this section. Explain why you insist on adding this section and how it does not violate a NPOV.  talk-email 
It is relevant for the article: SSB is mentioned in the article True believer syndrome.  
You are pushing your Anti-Sai bias by including an empty reference to """"True Believers Syndrome"""". If you attempt to include it, I am going to remove it. I guess it is only coincidence that you happened to create the page for """"True Believers Syndrome""""? Ref  talk-email 
Well, the inclusion of this article in the see also section seems to be yet another subject for mediation, otherwise we'll keep reverting each other until one of us dies.  
Andries, the  Wikipedia policy WP:NOT states that Wikipedia is not a soapbox.  I suspect that we have differing views regarding what this means.  From my perspective, the aim of many of your edits, such as the one which sparked this subsection, appears to be to convince people of the merits of your favorite views.    I would very much like for you to share your views on the WP:NOT policy and your understanding of what this policy means.   
Please note that I had removed the true believer syndrome as described by Robert Todd Carroll from the main text in the article, because Jossi complained that people mentioned in this article were not notable. I objected to that by saying that everybody mentioned in this article was mentioned either by reputable media sources or scholarly sources that reported about SSB. Later I found out that the only one who was not mentioned by reputable news articles was Robert Todd Carroll who wrote entries in his book and website Skeptic's Dictionary about SSB and the true believer syndrome in which he mentioned SSB. So I decided to move the true believer syndrome from the main text to the see also section. I think it should stay there because it is clearly relevant for the article. With regards to violating the Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not policy I think that only one sentence could be relevant in this dispute and that is """"[Wikipedia is not] Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. """" I think I would be breaking """"What Wikipedia is Not"""" policy if I linked the word charlatan in the see also section, unless of course, SSB is mentioned in that article.  Of course, it will be clear that I do not agree with the critical information being minimized, but I do not think that I am breaking the policy here: SSB is very controversial and this article should reflect that.  
Andries, thanks for pointing this out. It is apparent I need to edit the """"True Believer's Syndrome"""" article because its mention to SSB is not referenced by reputable sources. You attempt to make your case against SSB by citing the non-reputable and original research of Tony O'Clery and Paul Holbach. Either you reference these citations by reputable sources or I'm deleting it. I am going to remove the references to O'Clery and Holbach (whose link does not work anyway). Trying to cite the """"True Believer's Syndrome"""" article because it refers to SSB is deceptive because you were the one who made that reference to SSB on that page.  talk-email 
Hi Andries, thank-you for your response.  I am glad you agree that if you created a see-also link to charlatan that this would not reflect Wikipedia policies.  However, I do not understand your reasoning that seems to differentiate between a link to charlatan and a link to True Believer's Syndrome.  From my perspective, it seems that a see-also link to charlatan would be innuendo that SSB is a charlatan, while a  see-also link to TBS seems to be innuendo that devotees of SSB suffer from TBS.  In both cases, it seems to me that NPOV is violated because controversial opinions are not presented as such.  Rather, the implication of a see-also link to TBS is that Wikipedia is voicing the opinion that devotees of SSB suffer from TBS.NEWLIN",0

 2 items of work on the """"making the case"""" section 

The discussion immediately above (regarding how to incorporate Obama's presidential re-election statements regarding the jobs bill) and how we do it.
The paragraph needs a sentence at the beginning, something benign & innocuous like """"President Obama took his case to the American public and toured 00 universities and 00 public speaking events across various states."""" then it rolls into the next sentence """"He has appeared before constituents of Eric Cantor's congressional district to press the Congress to pass his bill immediately.""""

Making the case
President Obama appeared before constituents of Eric Cantor's congressional district to press the Congress to pass his bill immediately. On September 12, he gave a speech in the White House Rose Garden in front of a group of teachers, police officers, construction workers and small-business owners in which he stated that """"if Congress does not act, just about every family in America will pay more taxes next year. That would be a self-inflicted wound that our economy just cannot afford right now."""" In Speaker Boehner's home state of Ohio, Obama gave a speech described as """"fiery"""" in a Columbus high school that led to the audience chanting: """"Pass this bill!"""" In a campaign-style rally at North Carolina State University, Obama told college students """"Every single one of you can help make this bill a reality. … The time for hand-wringing is over. The time for moping around is over. We've got to kick off our bedroom slippers and put on our marching shoes."""" At a black-tie dinner for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, Obama pitched his jobs plan to Latinos. In anticipation of criticism that the legislation was motivated by the upcoming election, the President noted that the election is fourteen months away and that Americans do not have the luxury of waiting fourteen months for jobs to be created.

Re item #1 I propose we tack it onto the very end of the paragraph with a sentence like """"Some of the criticism refers to Obama's own remarks, including past statements that he will (blank blank blank)"""" (I won't complete the sentence, but just letting you overlook my generalized proposal.) We could even take off the final sentence that is there now, and I could incorporate via some other measure. I'm a very good writer, and don't want to over-invest before I get more feedback at this point. 
As an aside, I plan to do some work Tuesday to help explain the backstory to the """"Related bill"""" section, because it fails to tell the reader the funny story (i.e. that a witty republican thought he could steal the """"antecedent"""" referred to by Obama's """"pronoun"""" because Obama was saying to pass a bill which had not yet been trademarked, so that witty republican guy trademarked the patent before Obama's people could register the name). That will require a better source than just newser and the daily caller. That will be Tuesday's work, so I just wanted to tip my hat off on what's next. On Wednesday/Thursday I'd like to create the Yuan article, then by Friday we can incorporate this week's major updates to this article, which c",0

"Tony Cragg

I am writing to you re Tony Cragg's article on Wikipedia, which I have been trying to improve. As you quite rightly pointed out, (prior to my editing) Wikipedia's coverage of Cragg's life and career is embarrassingly weak and what I have added is not 'necessarily bad.'

I am new to Wikipedia editing and it has been difficult to get to grips with how it works, but I feel like I am getting there. For all my efforts to be deleted would be a real shame. I would like to start up a dialogue so I can continue to improve Cragg's article.

As I understand it, you have identified the section on the Sculpture Park as posing a potential copyright issue, as a copy or modification of the text from Cragg's website. I did indeed use his website as a point of reference (for lack of other sources) but I am surprised you consider what I edited to be a copyright issue. I will happily work on this section further so as to improve it but I ask that you 'unblock' the rest of article and advise the best way to proceed.

I look forward to hearing from you  
Hi! It is quite amazing to me that someone so well known could have such a poor article here, but that can happen; it will be blanked for a week or so now so that anybody who wants to rewrite it can do so. I do understand that it's very hard to get started as an editor here, and certainly I don't want to make it harder for you. However, you may inadvertently have fallen foul of some of our basic rules, including the one about using several accounts (that isn't in itself a problem, but becomes one if the accounts break other rules, such as, unfortunately, our copyright policy). One of the four accounts has declared a connection to the Lisson Gallery, and the IP address obviously belongs to the gallery; it would be helpful to know if the other three editors who appear to be similarly connected, including you, are so connected, or indeed are all the same real-world person. If you have a connection to the gallery you probably have what we call a conflict of interest, and that means that in most cases you shouldn't edit the article, but limit yourself to suggestions on the talk page. I'm prepared to help with the writing in this case. A good first step would be to start assembling some independent reliable sources about the artist. These should be sources of information that do not have an interest in promoting him, so commercial art gallery websites are unlikely to be acceptable, but websites of public institutions, books, well-known newspapers and magazines are all likely to be good. You could perhaps list some of those on the talk page of the article. While it's helpful if I can see them, it's not obligatory. Then we can take it from there.",0

The current full official names of the organization are simply Ezras Torah in Hebrew and Torah Relief Society in English as can be seen at http://www.ezrastorah.org/about_us.php and in their mailings.  

(Mossad) Ezras Torah was founded in August 1915 and was known by that name in numerous Yiddish and Hebrew news articles, advertisements and publications from the early 20th century.  Ezras Torah's own publications (see the links to the hebrewbooks.org documents on the wiki page) also mention just Ezras Torah without any addendum.  One can also see """"Ezras Torah Fund"""" without any additional title listed in page 45 of the following PDF document American Jewish Yearbook, 1921-1922 (Directories).
The organization was incorporated in early 1920 under the name Torah Relief Society.  The incorporation document can be found in New York City's Division of Old Records in Manhattan.

I can think of three possibilities re: """"for Relief of European and Palestinian Rabbis""""
1) The 1936 volume by Julius Caesar Schwarz was giving a description and not adding to the title
2) That book was in error
3) Ezras Torah had a different official name in the mid-20th century (this would need to be supported by official documents or from material published by Ezras Torah)

If either of the first two possibilities were correct then the later English language publications listed above might have just copied the lengthened organization name from earlier English language sources without consulting more authoritative sources.

Reading the above and looking at the editing history, it seems to me that the whole issue turns on whether  accepts the concept of the analogue signal requirement of being continuous or not.  Since I am an engineer in the Aerospace industry, I though I would draw an analogy from that industry, that illustrated the point.  I was surprised to find that the analogy was turned on its head as will be revealed.  Every reference book I checked made the point that the analog signal had to be continuous (It was even in my Uni notes).  But to the analogy.  

The Harrier aircraft uses mechanical wire linkages from the joystick to the control surfaces (elevator, ailerons & rudder).  This is, of course unarguably an analogue signalling system.  The wire linkage forms a continuous signal, and the control surfaces move in smooth continuous steps.

The Typhoon aircraft, in contrast, uses a digital system.  The position of the pilot's joystick is digitised into a number which gets mashed around a bit by a computer.  The resultant digital signal is then fed to the control surface via what is essentially a stepper hydraulic system.  Both the signals and the movement of the control surfaces are described in all the manuals as digital, in spite of the bit size of the numbers being large enough that the movement may appear to be smooth to the pilot.

The surprise was that in the preamble notes (the part of the manual given to new starters as part of their training), the operation of the digital control contained an explanetary analogy where the system was likened to """"... a clock with analogue hands where the movement of the hands is in fact discontinuous and hence, not really analogue at all.""""

In the subject context, the movement of the hands on a clock that has discontinuous movement (i.e. the majority of clocks) is not analogue and  is wrong to continue to insist that it is.   """,0

this edit appears to me to have altered the sanction to accurately reflect the consensus of the discussion. Well done!
I cannot speak for Postdlf, but I am certainly well aware that I would have a COI if I were to create or amend the community sanction notice.  That is why I have instead contacted the admin who did it to ask for a reconsideration of whether the sanction as applied matched the consensus at the discussion.  I have never before seen a suggestion that this is improper, and in all the procedures that I can think of it is the recommended first course of action if one has concerns about admin actions.  So I am a little disappointed that you appear to be implying that it was wrong to ask you to reconsider.

The problem is that the image, by it's very nature is original research. The student, who, by the way, did a very good job, has built that image by pulling together a bunch of different sources, combining them, and presenting a single """"final"""" product. On Wikipedia, we classify that as original research, which we don't allow. As someone who has in the past taught both high school and college myself, I know that it's actually an odd thing to find out that basically any research paper that a student would write for a typical college level class, as well as a good number of high school papers, would be considered original research under Wikipedia rules. Now, it could be possible to include each of the points individually expressed in the image within the text itself, though we'd have to measure other issues (like how relevant each point is to the larger topic).

Userbox
Hi,

Strangely, someone deleted a userbox of yours as T1, even though it was userfied.  I assume this was a simple mistake on the part of the deleter, so I've restored it for you.  Best wishes,  

Actually, I was unaware the thing was already at DRV when I undeleted.  Technically, one probably should wait to undelete until the DRV is over, so I unintentionally goofed a bit.  Still, the deletion was clearly a mistake (in process and content, which is quite mild.)  Looking at the RfC and DRV, I don't see that Dmcdevit has defended it at all, so I'll continue to assume he was simply confused.

Although I understand your unhappiness, your RfC is a little bit premature  one speedy deletion can be a simple mistake (which everybody makes.)  A pattern of bad choices, and an unwillingness to reconsider them, would be required to initiate an RfC, really.  Dmcdevit is a very nice person - even if he wasn't mistaken in the deletion, and genuinely had a problem with the userbox, he isn't the type to object to taking the debate to MfD (the proper forum), at the very least.

Thanks for the kind words.  I've been off-wiki for a bit, but I'll be getting around to my old """"beat"""" soon, which includes DRV normally, so, should you have other problems, I'll be happy to help.  Best wishes,  

On looking at the DRV again, I do notice Dmcdevit there, and he isn't arguing a sound position, although he is being civil.  Surprising, I must say.  Anyway, I hope he's just having bad day... I've probably been grumpy myself lately, what with the flu, the snow, the relatives, etc. )  

 last word in 

The first question you need to ask yourself is, """"do I have a history (perhaps as yet unadmitted) of being overly critical of myself?"""" If the answer to this might be yes, then you can't always trust your own tendency to self-criticize, because your subconscious motivation is not self-improvement but self-denigration; don't pay that too much heed then. If, however, the answer is no, then if you notice a behavior of yours that bothers you, listen to the notice, and decide cognitively how much it really bothers you or should bother you. Sometimes we only notice what bugs us about ourselves by trying to observe ourselves objectively. You might be doing that, and you might do well to listen, but it's hard for me to weigh this. As for my own opinion, looking at Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 December 11#Abortion, you haven't added anything that was redundant, so I wouldn't say it's an issue. If the discussion gets long and people keep bringing up things that you've already answered, remember that the closing admin is going to read everything and they should notice if you've already answered a repeated objection. Then it's a question of how much faith you have in the admins (I know, I'm treading on very thin ice now). For instance, I made sure to answer everything at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Faith Freedom International because I wanted to be absolutely certain that if the article did get deleted, I couldn't blame myself for not trying everything. I'm likely to do the same thing at Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 December 5#Ali Sina if anyone opposes the citations I've dug up. But my motivation here is dedication to freedom of speech and for less critical articles I leave my comments for the admin and let it go. A rule of thumb that you should know is that if an article is up for deletion and 80% of the votes are keep, it will probably be kept (even though it's """"not a vote""""). If it's less than 80%, then the keepers will have to put forward a pretty solid argument to keep. As you can see at the Faith Freedom AfD, keepers had about 66% and we just barely came through with """"no consensus"""". I suspect that the factors that weighed most heavily for the admin were TruthSpreader's and my arguements, as almost no one else seriously argued the merits of the citations and notability guidelines.

Hope all that helps. —  talk —

"This letter is intended as a kind of vaccine, an inoculation if you will, against the lies that permeate Amaury's jokes. The rest of this letter is focused exclusively on Amaury, not because I harbor any ill-will towards him but because he likes values that subordinate principles of fairness to less admirable criteria. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that to believe that his opinions represent the opinions of the majority—or even a plurality—is to deceive ourselves. I undeniably profess that he rewards those who show scrupulous adherence to his worldview and punishes those who make his adversarial contrivances understood, resisted, and made the object of deserved contempt by young and old alike. Deal with it.

If Amaury continues to hurt people's feelings, I will be obliged to do something about him. And you know me: I never neglect my obligations. If we can understand what has caused the current plague of vindictive despots, I believe that we can then help people see his bloody-minded epithets for what they are. Time cannot change Amaury's behavior. Time merely enlarges the field in which Amaury can, with ever-increasing intensity and thoroughness, take a condescending cheap shot at a person whom most arrogant sectarians will never be in a position to condescend to. He demands absolute and blind obedience from his encomiasts. If he didn't, they might question his orders to create a beachhead for organized warlordism. This unrelenting demand of obedience also implies that you don't need me to tell you that this is not wild speculation. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is documented fact.

This is not to say that Amaury seems to enjoy making unfounded statements and jumping to conclusions. It is merely to point out that Amaury exhibits an overweening sense of entitlement and a predilection for depreciating others. So don't feed me any phony baloney about how he has a duty to conceal the facts and lie to the rest of us, under oath if necessary, perjuring himself to help disseminate the True Faith of conspiracism. That's just not true. There is a format he should follow for his next literary endeavor. It involves a topic sentence and supporting facts. If hidebound grafters really believed in equality, they wouldn't control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind. If you doubt this, just ask around. I'd like to end this letter with a message for Amaury. I'd like to say with emphasis and distinctness—not as a threat, but as a warning—that I will do whatever it takes to bring important information about Amaury's moonstruck, demented long-term goals into the limelight, and I won't let Amaury stop me from achieving that goal.",0

A better statement of policy is to enforce the actual definition of the term male chauvinism and not to let it be used interchangably with the term sexism.  The works as described do not address the theme of male chauvinism but that of sexism.  In none of the descriptions is any character credited with holding an unreasoned belief in male superiority.  Instead the male characters are treating women badly for reasons unknown or for reasons far more complicated (psycho-sexually in at least three of these instances, involving extremely complex paraphelias such as sadism and latent pedophilia) than a simple ideological and unreasoned belief.

The difference between male chauvinism, sexism directed toward women and misogyny are very real and the issue needs to be clarified in this article.  Being chauvinistic implies a belief system, sexism implies a pattern of behavior, misogyny implies an emotional reaction.  Simply put a male chauvinist or even a misogynist can think or feel whatever he or she (yes a women can be a misoginist and no, she can't be a male chauvinist) want, but if they do not act upon those thoughts or feelings then they are not appropriately described as sexist.

Disruptive editing
In my view the collaborative editing team working to make this a FA has shown extreme tolerance in accommodating the concerns of User:Skipsievert. This latest """"tagging"""" follows a full consideration and resolution of COI issues on the appropriate noticeboard. Repeated editing of resolved or previously discussed issues is part of the pattern of disruptive editing. Below is part of the content of the WP entry on disruptive editing:

How disruptive editors evade detection 

Disruptive editing already violates site policy, yet certain editors have succeeded in disrupting articles and evading disciplinary action for one of several possible reasons:

 their edits occur over a long period of time; in this case, no single edit may be clearly disruptive, but the overall pattern is disruptive
 their edits are largely confined to talk-pages, such disruption may not directly harm an article, but it often prevents other editors from reaching consensus on how to improve an article
 their edits often avoid gross breaches of civility, especially by refraining from personal attacks, even though they interfere with civil and collaborative editing meant to improve the article
 their edits remain limited to a small number of pages that very few people watch
 conversely, their edits may be distributed over a wide range of articles that few people watch.

 Signs of disruptive editing 

This guideline concerns gross, obvious and repeated violations of fundamental policies, not subtle questions about which reasonable people may disagree.

A disruptive editor is an editor who:

 Is tendentious: continues editing an article or group of articles in pursuit of a certain point for an extended time despite opposition from one or more other editors. Tendentious editing does not consist only of adding material; some tendentious editors engage in disruptive deletions as well.
 Cannot satisfy Wikipedia:Verifiability; fails to cite sources, cites unencyclopedic sources, misrepresents reliable sources, or manufactures original research.
 Engages in """"disruptive cite-tagging""""; adds unjustified  tags to an article when the content tagged is already sourced, uses such tags to suggest that properly sourced article content is questionable.
 Does not engage in consensus building:
 repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits;
 repeatedly disregards other editors' explanations for their edits.
 Rejects community input: resists moderation and/or requests for comment, continuing to edit in pursuit of a certain point despite an opposing consensus from impartial editors.
In addition, such editors may:
 Campaign to drive away productive contributors''': act in spite of policies and guidelines such as Wikipedia:Civility, Wikipedia:No personal attacks, Wikipedia:Ownership of articles, engage in sockpuppetry/meatpuppetry, etc. on a low level that might not exhaust the general community's patience, but that operates toward an end of exhausting the patience of productive rules-abiding editors on certain articles.

Refusal to 'get the point'

In some cases, editors have perpetuated disputes by sticking to an allegation or viewpoint long after the consensus of the community has rejected it, repeating it almost without end, and refusing to acknowledge others' input or their own error. Often such editors are continuing to base future attacks and edits upon the rejected statement. Such an action is disruptive to Wikipedia. Thinking one has a valid point does not confer the right to act like it is an accepted rule when it is not.

The editing team has expressed the view that reasonable verified and substantiated requests will be given full consideration. However, IMO the recent spate of """"refusing to get to the point"""", repeated """"tagging"""" total disengagement with """"consensus building"""", """"ignoring of requests for explanations"""", """"ignoring moderator suggestions"""", """"rapid negative engagement with new contributors"""" all spell out the pattern of disruptive editing that has long-delayed completion of this collective effort, and it deserves disciplinary action.

""" 2005 (UTC)

This periodization of Proto-Slavic (PS) is not generally accepted. However, most scholars agree that the PS period lasted for 2,000 years or so. It is impossible that the language would not have been changing for so long. That is why reconstructed forms labelled """"Proto-Slavic"""" are very various indeed (*supnas, *supnu, *sunu and *sъnъ ('a dream' or 'sleeping') can all be termed Proto-Slavic). There is not even the agreement when the period ended. Some give even 600 AD as the final date (after which individual languages existed), others say that OCS (ca. 850 AD) was still a literary form of the latest Proto-Slavic (of course, with strong dialectal, local features). And there do not seem to be any real basics for any periodization of PS. Specialists argue even on relative chronology of some language phenomena (inc. phonetic changes, for example some would see the sequence -as > -us > -uš > -u > -ъ, i.e. first changing and losing of -s, next vowel reduction, while others would assume -as > -us > -ъs > -ъ, i.e. first vowel reduction, then loss of final consonants). And to say nothing of the absolute chronology!

The situation is even more complicated when we took into consideration that most of the literature on the subject is not English and the authors use terms which are not strict renderings for English Proto-Slavic and Common Slavic. In fact, in Slavic languages there exists the term praslavyanski (or silmilar) where pra- means the same as great in great grandfather (= praded or similar). This term should be translated as Old Slavic then. Besides, the term protoslavyanski (=Proto-Slavic) refers - at least in some sources - to the early period of the Slavic language commonwealth (less or more, equal to Schenker's EPS). and finally, the (Russian) term obshcheslavyanski ('Common Slavic', Polish ogólnosłowiański with the same meaning) refers to features which are present in each modern Slavic language rather than to their common ancestor.

Anyway, I see no reasons for keeping two different articles, one on Proto-Slavic, the other for Common-Slavic, whatever these terms mean.

"On Quantification (existential/universal: there exists/for all)

My dear  argues:

You can't use the term some critics when you're listing the same bloke twice ...(my emphasis: heh, it is a 'blockquote' too;-)

As long as the Universe of Discourse contains at least one member with the predicated quality logic tells me I am empowered to use the existential quantifier. In English, that's some.

Now that's to be distinguished from 'several' which is a usual indicator of more than, say, two or three. So to use the word 'several,' in an argument, is to imply, at least more than two.

So when an acquaintance of ours, name of , known to Block and recently given some Wiki admin. priviliges (AP) cites in his AP pleading:

He has been in dispute with several editors ... 

he's padding his case, since Blacketer full well knows that the only folks giving grief were:

Block
Blacketer

This came about because I started adding much more material to the Wiki entry on Natascha Engel and, in my innocence, I sidled-up to the Village Pump to seek advice on the substantiation of some of my contributions. I was particularly perplexed by the problem of my knowing certain facts through my personal correspondence with her.

Extensive source is available on the Talk page for the Engel article about what transpired next.

Well, anyway, Galloglass left the scene pretty quickly, so that left me contending with Block and Blacketer. Now correct me if I'm being stupid, but to me that leaves two. Then, mid-ocean Block jumps ship claiming a syndrome he named 'wikibonked' (I think - I've no idea what it means, but I think I'm getting to the stage where I may have caught a dose;-)

So that left one ... Blacketer. So 'one' is Blacketer's version of 'several.' And then you made him an administrator.

I've brought Blacketer to the stage since he's part of the same story of the 'double-standards' and 'hypocrisy' that I've discovered around here.

Oh, if you get a chance and want a cheap laugh, ask Blacketer what being a 'candidate' connotes ...

Gwen I am sorry that you refuse to provide accountability for the actions you undertook as an Admin.  Accountability is simply providing the basis for which you are creating a block to an editor. 
Since you seem determined to obfuscate and side step in every possible way, instead of simply giving reasons of what I did to merit getting blocked, it does seem that my asking for your cooperation here has run its course.  Your assumption of bad faith of why I am asking for clarification are rude and uncalled for, and clearly self-serving.  I asked you a straight question.  You are not willing to give any justification for why you blocked me.  It is reasonable for me to ask.
The block was reviewed by an interested party, and then removed by an uninterested admin, whom did not see the reasons why you blocked me, it does not feel that you even reviewed why this block was overturned.

Review of 1984 version

Here is a copyrighted review or summary:

In 1984, the movie The Bounty starring Anthony Hopkins as Bligh and Mel Gibson as Christian was released. The movie is set during the trial of Lt. William Bligh upon arriving home after the mutiny had occurred. In this movie, the events of the voyage up to and after the mutiny are shown as a series of flashbacks.

Bligh is not so much portrayed as a cruel tyrant in this film, but rather as a traditional ship's captain - a man of his times. While some savage beatings were carried out under Bligh's watch in this film, it seems to be in this film no different than any other captain would have done.

The crew is shown in a different light than in the previous two films. They are shown to be a much more """"rough and tumble"""" group than the crews in the other films. Many of them are shown as typical sailors of the time. Their motivations in this film are not always as noble as in the other two films.

In this film, Fletcher Christian is a more complex character. He is shown at first as a friend of Bligh. At first Bligh thinks so much of Christian that he asks the man to sail with him for a second time. However over the course of the film both men turn against each other. The feelings become much more acrimonius after the ship leaves Tahiti after Fletcher has been forced to leave his wife behind on Tahiti. In this film, she is more of a reason that Fletcher mutinied than in the previous two films. Afterwards, Fletcher is shown as feeling remorseful because of the mutiny. He tells another mutineer that he wished he had given Bligh some muskets.

In this film, the crew is shown as having more responsibility than they did in other films. This film does not so much hold Bligh as responsible - rather it is the desire of some of the crew to go back to Tahiti. However, it does make the fact that Bligh was going to try circumnavigation as one of the reasons that some of the crew decided to mutiny.

Like the 1935 film, this version also concentrates on the trials of Bligh and those who were forced into the launch with him. It is the only film to show that one man died because of an attack by the natives of an island where the launch stopped.  Once Bligh's launch reaches a Dutch colony, his part in the story comes to an end. It shows the later voyages of the Bounty as they go to Pitcairn Island. It then goes to Bligh's trial where he is subsequently acquitted by the Admirality.

The 1984 film was probably one of the more historically accurate of the films dealing with the Bounty. It shows both Bligh and the crew as more products of their time than anything else. This film also suggests that the motives behind the mutiny might not have been as noble as suggested in the other films. It also portrays the natives mostly nude as they would have appeared at the time of The Bounty's visit to the island (the previous films couldn't portray this because of censorship and decency concerns).

Despite the distinguished cast—including Daniel Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson in supporting roles and Laurence Olivier in a cameo appearance as Admiral Hood—the film had a tepid critical reception (the capsule review in Newsday read in its entirety as follows: """"Man the bilge pumps"""") and was not a great commercial success.

The author of the book further makes all kinds of statements about Vietnamese that with distance sound condiscending or even worse. When the book starts talking about the Vietnamese mind, its almost embarrasing to read it. Yes, it won awards when it was published. But its a very flawed book. For example, the basis of your claim that only 800 people died in the anti-landlord campaign is that her North Vietnamese/NLF friends told the author so. By contrast, Stanley Karnow writing in 1983, was writing in a less hysterical political climate and had access to more material than was available in 1972.

John: As you know the lead-in sentence for this article is In mathematics, a bivector is a quantity in geometric algebra that generalizes the idea of a vector. That is, this article in WP is about the bivector in geometric algebra (although it could be redesigned to deal with tensor algebra, I suppose, which topic is presently an afterthought at the end). As such, the section on Vector algebra is a subheading of the main topic, the bivector in geometric algebra. Consequently, the reference to the pseudovector in this subsection should make note of the predominant usage in texts on geometric algebra, namely that the bivector in 3D is the pseudovector, just another example of the (n-1) grade multivector being the pseudovector. No? Do you disagree about the common usage?

On that basis it is not exactly a mis-statement but certainly an easily mis-read statement in the article that says: in geometric algebra axial vectors are usually interpreted as bivectors. In fact, what is usual and less open to misconception is  Ławrynowicz """"Hence in 3D we associate the alternate terms of pseudovector for bivector, and pseudoscalar for the trivector"""".

Hello.  To Jeffro77 above...  The original and first reference that I put in was Thomas Cahill, and his book The Gifts of the Jews - How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels.   And I originally put that ref alone.  The Wilson ref came later on, from a search, and at the request of Jeppiz.   But Cahill alone I felt was overall sufficient at that point.  (And that Cahill book had literally zero to do with anything with Jehovah’s witnesses, or any JW books or journals or sermons.)    That wasn’t even on my mind in that sense, nor did I look at ANY Watchtower publications regarding this article or this specific matter.  Cahill had nothing to do with that.       And even Jeppiz admitted a number of times that it was a reliable source and ok.       But the Wilson source I provided here later on (and then soon on the article itself) was only at the demand of Jeppiz, for another source.   He kept insisting to find something else, etc, so I did a search, and the Wilson thing was even more pointed in a way, and it’s in a pro-JW website, “strictly genteel”, which transcribed the noted WT book “Is the Bible Really the Word of God?”, and the link can be found here http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/wordofgod/wordofgod4.html.       (Also, to DougWeller, hello.   I’m still not sure why you say that I got the name of the book wrong.   That’s what’s stated as the source.    J.A. Wilson.   And “The World History of the Jewish People”.   At least that’s he main part of the name of the book, and I believe Wilson was a co-author of that or something.)    But, to Jeffro, you seem to think (incorrectly) that I probably had the Wilson ref as paramount, when in actuality that was just a side thing and accident, because of subsequent demands and circumstances on this Talk page.   Cahill was actually my guy on this specific matter on the Exodus matter, NOT Wilson necessarily nearly as much.      The exact (in-context) quote from Cahill’s book says this:   

“When we examine the considerable extant literatures of Mesopotamia and Egypt, we find no obvious mention of the Israelites.  If, as the majority of scholars have provisionally concluded, Israel escaped from Egypt in the reign of Rameses II about midway through the thirteenth century B.C., why is there no record of this marvellous defeat in any Egyptian text or inscription?   Of course, the defeat may have been so embarrassing to Egypt that, like many great powers, it could not allow itself to record honestly what happened.    Alternatively, the story of the drowning of Pharaoh’s army may have been inflated over time by Hebrew oral tradition, and what had been a minor skirmish in Egyptian eyes (we know, for instance, that Ramses II died not in a watery grave but in his bed) was eventually puffed up beyond all recognition.  Most radically:  the Exodus may never have taken place, but may be just a story concocted, like Gilgamesh, by nomadic herdsmen in need of an evening’s entertainment.    This last hypothesis, though temptingly unambiguous, can be maintained only by ignoring  undeniable aspects of the actual text of the Bible.    There are real differences—literary differences, differences of tone and taste, but, far more important, differences of substance and approach to material—between Gilgamesh and Exodus, and even between Gilgamesh and Genesis.""""

Cahill continues:   

""""The anonymous authors of Gilgamesh tell their story in the manner of a myth.  There is no attempt to convince us that anything in the story ever took place in historical time.   At every point, rather, we are reminded that the action is taking place “once upon a time”—in other words, in that pristine Golden Time outside of meaningless earthly time.   The story of Gilgamesh, like the gods themselves, belong to the realm of the stars.   It is meant as a model for the hearers, who believed, in any case, that everything important, everything archeteypal, happened, had happened, was happening—it is impossible to fix this occurrence clearly in one tense, since it occurs outside of time—beyond the earthly realm of unimportant instances.   For all the ancients (except the Israelites, the people who would become the Jews), time as we think of it was unreal; the Real was what was heavenly and archetypal.  For us, the heirs of the Jewish perception, the exact opposite is true:  earthly time is real time; Eternity, if we think of it at all, is the end of time (or simply an illusion).     The text of the Bible is full of clues that the authors are attempting to write history of some sort....But there is in these tales a kind of specificity—a concreteness of detail, a concern to get things right—that convinces us that the writer has no doubt that each of the main events he chronicles happened.”

"Vandalism 

Hey there,

My name is Julio Cespedes, I do not know if I went to the right place, but to be quite honest the vandalism process on Wikipedia is pretty daunting to the casual novice. I am from Mississippi and went to Madison Central High School there, which has recently been the subject of a lot of vandalism:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Central_High_School_%28Mississippi%29

It is actually one of the best high schools in the State and very competitive nationallyin the city of Madison, MS all factors for why it may have been the subject of vandalism.

I did not know the process for blocking/warning users, especially some who have obviously only been malicious.  

If you look in the history it is clear that this user has only tried to maliciously edit the page:

Yes, the Norman horse had several subtypes, which were merged/crossbred with Thoroughbreds to create the Anglo-Norman, which then developed several subtypes of its own, a couple of which were split off into the French Trotter and Norman Cob, and the remainder of which were bred with more Thoroughbred blood to make a basically homogenous type, which was then combined with other types to create the Selle Francais. I moved what was originally the first paragraph (dealing with the types within the Norman breed) to the history section. Now the Characteristics sections contains one paragraph dealing with the various types that developed in the Anglo-Norman (the first paragraph) and one paragraph dealing with what the breed looked like in the mid-20th century before it was merged into the Selle Francais (the second paragraph).

 AIDS origins opposed to scientific consensus

"Could you explain what explanation you think is missing from this article?  There are extensive wikilinks to articles on the details of the science, as you know.  TS 

@Tony: Links are generally bad when it is possible to give an explanation in the body of the article.  Any science article should give a clear and coherent and succinct explanation of why scientists believe x.   In this case (correct me if I'm wrong), the reasons why scientists believe the global warming hypothesis (namely the hypothesis that the earth is continuing to warm, and that the increase in temperature in the last 100 years is not merely a random accident) are

 Empirical evidence: The temperature record, which suggests that the increase is not merely a random accident.  
 Theoretical model: Radiative forcing by anthropogenically introduced factors (CO2, mainly)
 Theoretical model: Feedback

As to what is missing. There is no explanation in the article about the statistics of temperature records, nor about the need (very important in science) to distinguish random fluctuations from changes caused by an underlying process. For example, current economic theory, the Efficient Market Hypothesis holds that there are no such things as trends in stock markets - the 'trends' you see are just the result of humans trying to see patterns in events that are essentially random.  A lot of that theory involves careful definition of randomness, and types of randomness.  I don't see an equivalent section in this article. 

The explanation in the article of radiative forcing is somewhat better, but goes into unnecessary detail - the section on Greenhouse gases can't decide whether it is about the increase in CO2, or the effect of that increase.  The stuff on aerosols and soot tends to confuse the whole thing - that should be left to a sub-article. 

The role of feedback is hardly explained at all.  That (I believe) is an important part of the hypothesis, yet the section discussing it is a strange list of things with no obvious purpose.   There is no heading section that ties the three parts of the hypothesis together.

The section 'climate models' is all rather uncertain.  It needs a summary at the beginning to explain what scientists conclude from their use of models, and perhaps some material on the uncertainty that is attached to models.",0

 Lead needs to meet MOS standards 

As it stands, the lead breaks MOS in several major ways:

 MOS:INTRO#Introductory text - In that is does not """"briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it can stand on its own as a concise version of the article"""".
 MOS:INTRO#Relative emphasis - In that it gives WP:UNDUE emphasis to male rape in the UK, yet section in """"Prevalence"""" covers 6 countries from which other examples could have been given. To quote MOS, """"emphasis given to material should reflect its relative importance to the subject"""" – male rape in the UK is no more important that in any other country in the world, therefore it should not be used as a singular example because this does not represent a worldwide view, particularly as anything related to anal sex differs per culture, religion and by law.
 The examples break the MOS:INTRO#Provide an accessible overview guideline which states: """"Do not hint at startling facts without describing them."""" The UK percentages are quoted without sufficient background to explain their relevancy this early in the article, there is no context because the lead is very short and uninformative.
 MOS:INTRO#Relative emphasis - """"Significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article"""" – the stated UK <3% and <5% figures are not mentioned in Male rape#United Kingdom, which would be a more appropriate place to account for these percentages, than in the lead in this disconnected manner.

The lead needs rewriting be someone who has contributed to this article and knows the sources well, it should be much longer based on the article's current length, it should be balanced and not given to undue examples from cherry-picked county data, per WP:NPOV.

Stabbed Kercher getting axed
Hello, Wikid77 here. Now that User:Zlykinskyja has been hounded away from editing """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""", the wholesale axing of fully-sourced text has begun. See: removal of forensics. The apparent WP:Wikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman, with legal expertise, trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms. I warned beware of """"colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia"""". Perhaps if American student Amanda had been """"Adam Knox"""" then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20? misquoted infamous statements. (I didn't know any evidence in December 2009, now I know much, and some seems falsified in Italy). Zlykinskyja tried to add how """"Donald Trump"""" rejected the verdict (+source), but that was quickly deleted. Some US officials are conducting a mock-trial by judge to compare verdicts, but I doubt that could be explained in the article. Then some prankster this week posted at top, """"Breaking news: Knox dead in prison from suicide, details not confirmed"""" (from an IP edit in the London area), and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that. I wish we could split the article into several low-target subarticles (I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles). The talk-page has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on """"Amanda Knox"""" and naturally, a prior subarticle was AfD deleted.However, I suggest the following:
 """"Amanda Knox"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article with civil suits, appellate trial, and college coursework in prison.
 """"Raffaele Sollecito"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article, noting he completed his computer degree while in custody, and they met, at a classical music concert, because he looked like Harry Potter.
 """"Prosecution of Amanda Knox"""" (new) - would contain all the pro/anti-Knox text, moved from edit-wars in the Kercher article.
 """"Investigations of Kercher murder"""" (new) - would be a forensic article, with fingerprints, Low copy number DNA, luminol, unidentified DNA/prints, listing exact quotes+sources, etc.
 """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""" (reduced) - would be trimmed into an overview, linking sections to subarticles.
I have seen how other articles, split into subarticles, greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details, so that forensic details would likely match the sources, when viewed there. This message is just a general notice, sent to a few admins, and I don't expect an immediate response. Also, feel free to delete this, knowing it was posted in a 1 May talk-page revision: as a May Day warning about axing of Kercher text. Thanks. -  """,0

"Well-founded news in 'our' GPS/GSM-tracking matter 

Hi Michael

I haven't saved your email address, can not find it through Google so must contact you this way. 

I've just paid a random visit at 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking

and found an external link there - 

http://www.goandtrack.com/ ,

the penultimate at this moment. When going through their pages, I also found this one:

http://www.goandtrack.com/gps_tracking_devices/covert_vehicle_tracking.htm .

The first chapter, called 'Covert Vehicle Tracking GPS System', starts this way:

'The latest in GPS covert tracking and communications technology, this covert vehicle surveillance unit is an extremely small size and versatile location device that allows you to track vehicles or other high value mobile assets in real time. The covert vehicle tracking devices is attached underneath a vehicle using the high power light weight magnets. Here it picks up reflected GPS signals and reports position information back to your PC using SMS messages.'

Doesn't that sound promising, so to speak? Unless I'm mistaken, it proves the correctness of my earlier assumptions. I invite you to read the rest of the page and then update the Wikipedia entry. You will remember, for linguistic reasons I prefer not to do these things myself.

I haven't established a webform contact facility, so invite you to contact me directly, if you wish.

Best regards

Michael

Reply to note on article talk page
For the copyright issue, it is not enough to assert permission: you would have to follow the steps in the warning notice above. Be aware that in posting information on Wikipedia, you are making an irrevocable and very general release by which others may copy your text, modify it, and use it for any purpose - see Foundation:Terms of Use and WP:Copyrights#Contributors' rights and obligations.

But there are other issues. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a business listing directory, still less a web-host for you to """"provide online the content of our corporate documentation,"""" and it is unlikely that your documentation is suitable for an encyclopedia article. 

Also, in writing about your company, you have a conflict of interest.
Wikipedia is not a vehicle for any kind of promotion. Articles have to be of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article: the Wikipedia term for that is notability, and the requirements are explained in the guideline on Notability and in more detail in Notability (organizations and companies). Articles need to be verifiable from independent, reliable sources - a company's own website does not count as independent - and independent references are the best way to demonstrate notability. Also, articles must be written from a neutral point of view, and so people are strongly discouraged from writing about themselves or their own organizations, because of the conflict of interest involved. If you do write on such subjects, follow the advice in User:Uncle G/On notability#Writing about subjects close to you:
When writing about subjects that are close to you, don't use your own personal knowledge of the subject, and don't cite yourself, your web site, or the subject's web site.  Instead, use what is written about the subject by other people, independently, as your sources.  Cite those sources in your very first edit.  If you don't have such sources, don't write

I have added the necessary qualification.  Regarding the original lead, it was a mess. Amongst other things the original lead had redundancies, it employed terms without first defining them or linking to a definition, sometimes the term """"compound"""" was used and other times """"statment"""" was used, the relatively minor matter of material implication vs. logical entailment was too long, used an awful example and just confused what preceded it.  In the lead it would have been sufficient to just say something like: """"The material conditional is to be distinguished from logical entailment (which is usually symbolosed using [double turnstile].""""  The distinction can then be detailed in the body of the article.  Also the failure to even mention propositional calculus  which is the context in which someone is most likely to look up the meaning of the operator  was an unacceptable omission.  By the time someone reaches the study of paraconsistent logical systems they will likely have no need to look up what a material conditional is on Wikipedia.  A novice is most likely to look up this entry in wikipedia and they will most likely have encountered the operator in the context of classical/Boolean propositional calculus.   """,0

"I have only just noticed that you are changing the names from common to scientific because you are starting to do the Australian snakes (all of which I am watching). You do have a good argument, although I do not fully agree. The problem is that you are not going about it the wrong way. Since it is policy, you should be first trying to change the policy before mass changes to the encyclopadia. The policies are there to create consistency. All you are doing now is making it more confusing. People expect to find the common names on Wikipedia, because that is the way it is done at the moment. Also, it seems you haven't read the Tree of Life guidelines properly. In it, it says that common names should be used where there are formal common names (such as birds) or there is a relatively unique common name. Otherwise use the scientific names. For example: White's Tree Frog is unique, and therefore the common name should be used. However, if you look at Litoria chloris, the common name cannot be used. Its common name, the Red-eyed Tree Frog has a disambigous page, explaining why that common cannot be used, and states that Red-eyed Tree Frog is not unique. 
The entire issue is trying to account for the most ammount of people. If someone wants information on a snake, writes its common name into the search box, and comes across an article with a strange latin name, they may be off-put and think they wrote the wrong name, and it redirected to the wrong place. Especially if the article did not have a photo. If a scientist wants to look at an article, and puts in the scientific name, and it is redirected to the common name, they will be aware of what the common name is. In fact, you will find that in most scientific papers, they will use the common name, stating the scientific name once in brackets so their is no ambiguity. A lot of articles use the scientific name because their is no common name. There is no other choice, and there is no problem with this. 
Please, bring this up on WP:TOL talk page before changing any more articles. You cannot create consistency yourself, and all you are doing is making it worse.

 A request 

I ask that you consider taking time away from posting on WT:V or the subpage. Your posts there, particularly the multiple polls, became disruptive several weeks ago, and the page has basically ground to a halt because of it. I took six weeks off from editing either the policy or the talk page—from around June 20 until August 7—just to make sure other people's voices were heard equally, so I hope you'll consider doing the same. If your proposals are truly supported, they won't be affected by your absence.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

I agree that the main talk page needs a breather from this whole topic.  And I'm ready for quiet work on it in an obscure place for a while.  If you want that to not be the subpage, that's fine with me but I just said there that I went along with the subpage idea.  Sincerely,  North8000  

The main talk page needs a long, long breather. But I think you need a breather too from this topic, partly for your own sake, but also to see whether it has legs without you. At things stand, you're doing two things simultaneously (and in something of a contradiction): keeping it going, and strengthening opposition to it because of the overkill. If you would let it be, you would see whether it has legs of its own. Anyway, just a request.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

I'm ready to slip into low key """"homework"""" on this, even without a request.  Me suggesting that we adopt the first sentence just proposed/suggested by Jimbo Wales was a sort of special departure from that, I saw that as acting more as a facilitator.  I noticed that somebody tried to hide the fact that it was HIS suggestion by changing the section title. North8000  

But not before reverting and continuing to disrupt. You are posting an inherently POV poll; RfCs are supposed to be neutrally worded. I give up on you because it is pointless.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

 I don't think that it is POV to say who wrote the proposed wording.  That was the original title of the section, it's the title that people commented under, and it provides the information of who wrote it.   Since when in Wikipedia does saying the source of something get called """"POV'ing"""" it? And don't forget there is a second dimension to this.  I put up HIS suggestion, and people are removing the fact that it was HIS suggestion simultaneously with villianizing me for putting (it) up a suggestion on the first sentence.  I call that dirty pool.  But, as I said, I put it it up as a facilitator, and don't plan to further advocate it.  North8000  """,0

Hi again   I really think the solar sail people are a bit optimistic about its use for interstellar travel.  The reason is just that as the acceleration is slow, you have to wait a long time, and travel a long way, to reach high speed.  At a uniform acceleration a, you reach velocity v after traveling a distance s according to 

 v = sqrt(2as)

in Newtonian approximation, which is applicable at the speeds we could hope to reach.  Then

 s = v2/(2a)

and for a given v, s gets very large if a is small.  But since the intensity of sunlight decreases like 1/s2 with distance from the Sun, a does not remain constant, but drops rapidly, making things very much worse.  Once you get out to well beyond the orbit of Pluto, where the Sun begins to look like a very bright star, the photon drag of the light of other stars begins to become significant, as well as the cosmic background radiation, which has an energy density comparable to that of starlight.  Finally there is the problem that at really high speeds, the light of the Sun would begin to be red shifted, so you lose power from that effect too.  Some of these problems can be solved by beaming light or microwaves out to the ship, with a huge power station (a trillion watts, say) near the Earth, and a large aperture mirror to focus the beam on the ship.  Then, as long as you can maintain the focal spot as small as the ship's sail, you could get constant acceleration.  A calculation I did years ago (which I will not try to reproduce now...) suggested to me that speeds of maybe  0.1c could conceivably be reached in this manner (which is very exciting) — but then, somehow, you have to stop.  

(For example, if I recall, if the aperture of the beaming mirror is R, the ship sail dia r, the distance from the Sun D, and the wavelength λ, then you need 

 λ/R = r/D

and acceleration 10-3g will get you to 0.03c in 30 years, at a distance D of 0.5 light years, 1018/2 cm, which makes the mirror R ~ 50 km in diameter for a sail r 100 km, with a 1 um λ.  NB the mirror needs to be optically perfect to << λ, but the sail does not.)

Of course 0.1c is a useful speed, and you might split the problem between a beamed laser sailer, with a fusion rocket to stop, but the trillion watt figure I remember was for a fairly small ship, 100 or 1000 tons if I recall, and I think a nuclear-electric ship capable of reaching even a few percent of c is going to be much larger than that for a payload of 100 or 1000 tons.  I cannot imagine a decade ship smaller than an aircraft carrier, so it sounds like a pretty tough way to go, though possibly competitive with other approaches.  

What I personally think we need to do is work the problem modestly hard from an engineering standpoint, considering all approaches, producing realistic design mission studies that give us the best trade-off solution with current technology.  Right now the trip time, for a program we could realistically sell to the combined economies of the planet, would probably last a thousand years or more.  So in ten or thirty years we should redo the study, and see how that number has changed due to technological advances.  At some point the curve of reasonable trip times will either get down to the order of the time between studies, or else it will flatten out when we hit the wall of feasible engineering.  Or maybe there will be a huge breakthrough when somebody figures out how to create a wormhole to a nearby star, or something equally revolutionary.  Anyhow, only when the trip time is getting down to the time between studies (which would depend on the rate of technology change) would it be sensible to start a serious program, with what NASA would call a """"Phase A study"""", leading to a program start, then a Preliminary Design Review, and then a Critical Design Review,... which is when you can start cutting metal. 

Solar sailing is probably a competitive way of getting around the Solar System, though I think nuclear-electric ion drives are likely to prove better.  The latter can certainly take us all over the Solar System in the time scales of the great explorations of the 15th and 16th centuries.  Then in 500 years the Solar System will be ours, and we will have a far better idea of exactly what is out there in the dark between the stars, possibly mini-solar systems like Jupiter & its moons.  If such systems are common, we might find useful places to go only 1% as far as Alpha Centauri, which would change everything.  And the human species would be safe at last from the many disasters which threaten us now.

"""Here is the summary:

 I agree that wikipedia articles may have pictures and it is preferable to show them for the convenience of the reader. The pictures of Jesus, Mary etc. are very commonly depicted in the churches and other places, so whenever there is article to explain about Jesus and christianity then it is much preferable to give the abstract idea to the user about how 'Christianity looks like and what is associated with it (including the pictures of Jesus and Mary)'. Now agreeing to the this, the problem is that there are no images associated to Muhammad or other Prophets in Muslims as well as Mosques and any other places. So, when a reader will come to know about Isamic articles then he will be given the idea of 'how Islam looks like and what is associated to Isalm and Muhammad (including Islamic calligraphy)'. Now if there does not exist and prominent association about Muhammad's picture then it is NOT necessary to somehow bring 'Any insignificant' picture no matter it is drawn by some 12 year old kid or some very unpopular artist who is not only unknown in the nonIslamic world but Muslims too.
 So, when a Muslim comes to the article about Muhammad, he will just feel strange on the rediculous depiction and might even laugh that """"I did'nt know there is such picture used about Islam"""". 
 Imagine the misery of a wikipedia article in where the follower of the religion himself has to laugh at what is being shown as a fact about his religion.  
 I hope my comments look valid at the same time when I agree about the value of an image where it is actually represending the article and not contradicting it.

Yes, of course those bitter Paddies would say that no native Irish Catholics (90% of the population) were allowed in parliament and that there was in fact a British sectarian herrenvolk apartheid state in operation in 18th century Ireland... but the glory of Britain should not be undermined by those sort.

Speedy deletion of Dustin Garringer
 A tag has been placed on Dustin Garringer requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 BTW, XAL (or """"Sophie"""" or whomever you are), I usually don't read your rantings (I responded to your post above that ended with the sweet """"let's work together as a team"""" because it didn't sound like a rant), but this was pointed to me.

 In fact, I was blocked for 24 hours along with Igor by 315, for 3RR violation. but there is a difference:  I submitted to the block, I didn't go unregistered and find another IP to post anyway, but Igor did not submit to it.  he refused to abide by and posted to this talk page above """"Dear Marudubshinki...""""  This suggests that Igor believes he is above the rules.  the 3RR doesn't apply to him, does it?

 this reminds me of a time when i was a kid and we were saying """"table grace"""" before our meal.  my parents told us all that we had to be reverend, bow our heads, and close our eyes when we were praying our table prayer.  well, i left mine open and so did my much younger brother and when the prayer was over, he immediately tattled on me saying to our parents that """"Bob didn't close his eyes for the prayer.""""  geee, how did he know?

 well, it was Igor who made the complaint of the many reversions of mine and the admins decided (correctly) that he was reverting just as often as i was and the blocked us both.  but since the rules don't apply to Igor, he went and posted (using IP address for instead of logging in to his account) anyway.  it seems to me that the timing of this refusal to abide by his block was coincidental to when Snowspinner's tolerance for Igor's arrogance hit his/her limit and that's when the """"excrement"""" really hit the fan for Igor.   

?????rjb or whomever you are, I am the alone one ever in wiki on this case, both english and french who has posted with her full name and adress and telephon number and private emails, twice, and referes most of the time with both ip adress and real name, even before I had my own registration name on wiki, so suck your puppets! if cyber leaking make it possible you will soon get a 3D experience with Maharishi Maesh Yogi YBM dito Jean Perre Voyer dito leuven dito mister Rupley. {Replay!} supra transcendental levitations.....

I hope it's clarified. The ideas were connected in my head, but I did not mean to imply that you want PHG banned solely or even predominantly because of incivility. I agree that PHG needs to better accept criticism and learn a thing or two about reliable sourcing (hence my emphasis on OWN and RELIABLE), but I have yet to see the evidence (which isn't to say it doesn't exist) that he """"pour[s] bad information and fringe theories into Wikipedia"""". Also, to say that your main focus is not his incivility, while true, ignores the fact that it was brought up enough at ArbCom to generate a """"reprimand"""" and it has been brought up since at various talk pages as he re-invigorates old issues. And another thing, you must realise that he personally targets you because he feels personally targeted? I have tried to advise PHG to leave this whole topic area well alone for a while (~a year) until heads have utterly cooled. This won't work, however, if you follow him around tagging his articles, like the France-Japan one. Whatever the merits or value of that (I'm unsure either way yet), it demonstrates the need for a better and broader solution than the current ArbCom one. Frankly, I like your sourcing amendment, I'd even consider lessening the length of the ban if PHG were willing to comply with your amendation for the good of the project, since I think sourcing is the major issue here.

 Secrets from the grave 

This is pure speculation on my part, but I imagine the exhumation of Paula's grave would have been carried out under conditions of great secrecy and with some degree of security. Nonetheless, I wonder if DNA obtained from any remains might yield a clue as to the identity of the grandfather she shared with her infamous brother. Would anyone be interested enough to do the research? It would surely be only of academic interest, but even so...

I also find it a rather odd co-incidence that these mysterious documents have appeared, apparently within weeks of the exhumation. Is there any proof that the documents are genuine?

Also, perhaps this statement should begin with the words """"Many experts believe..."""" or """"Evidence suggests..."""" etc. etc. rather than making a statement of fact since this is not an established fact.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 62.6.149.18   
 This brings up a good point that many things are stated as fact when it comes to science.  I think that people are only careful to state things the way you describe for things that haven't been statistically proven, which points out several flaws in the statement.  Evolution is well enough established as well as ants evolving from wasps, but them first appearing the the mid-Cretaceous period is hard to statistically prove.  I suppose this should be changed if I'm right, but I may not be.   ~talk 
The Cretaceous period is not a short duration even on an evolutionary scale. The sentence might appear precise if used with some small unit of time but putting it at somewhere between 110 to 130 million years is not exactly being very precise nor does it appear to be an arrogant statement of the available evidence.

Hello Again. I don't have the ability to counter AlmostGrad's assertions on the SE talk page today. But I want to make sure you understand that AlmostGrad is a COI editor. On AlmostGrad's user page: """"I have a Conflict of Interest with Suburban Express stemming from my interactions with them on the UIUC subreddit."""" So she has established a link to Reddit. On Reddit, AlmostGrad100 has tirelessly posted unsubstantiated claims about Suburban Express. AlmostGrad100 seems to have catalyzed the very negative blog coverage that AlmostGrad repeatedly cites on Wikipedia talk page. As for AlmostGrad's recent addition to the talk page: I consider all false statements to be problematic, including the trivial examples which are cited in the most recent addition. The existence of trivial errors does not preclude there from being more significant errors, and there are. And I intend to enumerate those ASAP.

"Battle of Levounion 1091 not copyright violation and (Manzikert- Anatolia was not ethnic cleansing) 

Pechenegs had been driven out of their homeland by the Cumans and settled in Northern Bulgaria since some years, they raided and invaded Byzantine Thrace with their families and intended to settle at the Maritza river,[1]

But at the Battle of Levounion 1091 the Pechenegs were attacked by a combined army of Byzantines with Cuman mercenaries, the Pechenegs were almost totally killed, soldiers and civilians, this battled nearly annihilated the Pecheneg people. Later the survivors were massacred in the Battle of Beroia. (This is clearly ethnic cleansing, even if they were a newly migrated people to the Balkans.) 

I added:
At the Battle of Levounion (1091), the Pecheneg, a nomadic Turkic people from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, were nearly wiped out by the sedentary Byzantine Greeks and nomadic Cumans.{{cite book|last=Agbedo|first=Chris|title=Problems of multilingual nations  the Nigerian perspective|year=2007|publisher=Fidgina Global Books|location=Enugu, Nigeria|isbn=9789788132844|page=89|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&hl;=nl&q;=ethnic+cleansing+greeks+pechenegs&btnG;=#hl=nl&tbm;=bks&sclient;=psy-ab&q;=The+Pechenegs%2C+nomadic+Turkic+peop-o+from+the+steppe%2C+were+nearly+annihilated+at+the+Battle+of+Levounion+by+a+combined+Byzantine+and+Cuman+army+in+1091.&oq;=The+Pechenegs%2C+nomadic+Turkic+peop-o+from+the+steppe%2C+were+nearly+annihilated+at+the+Battle+of+Levounion+by+a+combined+Byzantine+and+Cuman+army+in+1091.&gs;_l=serp.12...21850.21850.3.22808.1.1.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.1...1c..15.psy-ab.NHxON2jEZfU&pbx;=1&bav;=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm;=bv.47244034,d.d2k&fp;=1f7c60039cb2be7d&biw;=1438&bih;=647

Original sentence was: The Pechenegs, nomadic Turkic people from the steppe, were nearly annihilated at the Battle of Levounion by a combined Byzantine and Cuman army in 1091.

I changed this into  At the Battle of Levounion (1091), the Pecheneg, a nomadic Turkic people from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, were nearly wiped out by the sedentary Byzantine Greeks and nomadic Cumans.

Manzikert Anatolia
This was added from the same book: After the Battle of Manzikert (1071), Greek populations of Anatolia were ethnically cleansed by nomadic Seljuk Turks

But the original sentence in the book was:[1]
The ethnic cleansing of sedentary Greek population of Anatolia by nomadic Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071.

If Levounion is copyright violation than this is also.

The idea that Seljuk Turks ethnically cleansed Anatolia is not true, Anatolian Greek populations survived till 1922, the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

Claiming Seljuks ethnically cleansed Anatolia is historically incorrect, it had a multicultural population, besides Seljuks had a sedentary state Seljuk Empire,  besides this claim was based upon one source, which was added by cherry picking and snippet abuse.

"""

Your make a good point.  Let me first address it from the perspective of Marshall Hodgson.

Civilization is a somewhat arbitrary term, often narrowly defined by language.  This obviously has its limits.  On the other hand, the more broadly you define a civilization, the more subgroupings it must include.  Eventually, we come to see civilizations as groupings useful for the purpose at hand.  And ultimately, civilizations, like religions, are self-defined.

Hodgson considers the lands of Islam to constitute a world civilization.  He calls Islam a world civilization in the title of his book The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization.

For another perspective, I can turn to H. Patrick Glenn, in Legal Traditions of the World, speaking on tradition and identity.  Not all is arbitrary in the definition of a tradition, or civilization.

Glenn quotes Fernand Braudel, who speaks of an """"underlying structure"""" of civilization; """"those elements of a civilization which could not be changed without a fundamental change, or more probably disappearance, of the tradition itself.""""  Applying this criteria to Islamic civilization, one immediately understands that structure to be the religion of Islam.

To summarize: looking at the lands of Islam, with its concept of Umma, the shared traditions, the shared Arabic religious and often secular language, and indeed the shared religion of Islam, it seems logical to fall in with those who perceive the outline of a world Islamic civilization.

Exactly, I don't own Wikipedia or have the authority to randomly delete articles. We have discussions, then we build consensus. That's why I'm discussing you here other possibilities, such as merging these battles to related articles. Please do not take offense, as I sense a change in your tone. To answer your question:
We require multiple sources so that we can write a reasonably balanced article that complies with Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, rather than representing only one author's point of view. This is also why multiple publications by the same person or organization are considered to be a single source for the purpose of complying with the """"multiple"""" requirement. (WP:WHYN)
Lack of multiple sources suggests that the topic may be more suitable for inclusion in an article on a broader topic. It is common for multiple newspapers or journals to publish the same story, sometimes with minor alterations or different headlines, but one story does not constitute multiple works. Several journals simultaneously publishing different articles does not always constitute multiple works, especially when the authors are relying on the same sources, and merely restating the same information. Similarly, a series of publications by the same author or in the same periodical is normally counted as one source. (WP:GNG, footnote 3)

We can have material split across three articles, if that is the best way to do it.  Or we can have two articles, with a redirect from new antisemtitism to contemporary antisemitism, or vice versa.  The advantage of multiple articles is that it gives a sharper focus on a specific issue.  The disadvantage is duplication.  

The problem I have with the current article is that it isn't clear to me what the distinction between new antisemitism and 'old' antisemitism is, or even if there is one.  Some duplication is OK but when I have no way to decide what should go into new antisemitism and what should go into antisemitism, I think there's a problem.  The advantage of contemporary antisemitism over new antisemitism is that it has quite a clear definition.  The advantage of new antisemitism over contemporary antisemitism could be that new antisemitism is not just antisemitism in the here and now but somehow something different.  That we have a history of new antisemitism suggests that a difference exists, but I don't see what that difference is.

The current introduction says that new antisemitism is """"the wave of antisemitism that escalated, particularly in Western Europe, after the Second Intifada in 2000, the failure of the Oslo accords, and the September 11, 2001 attacks."""" But it then says what is different about new antisemitism is that old antisemitism """"was largely associated with the political right.""""  So I'm confused.  Is it the distinguishing factor the timing, or is it more to do with the source, in which case perhaps we should be talking not about new antisemitism but about new antisemites; a new chorus singing an old song?  In the introduction we mention anti-zionism in passing, but we don't make clear what the relationship between it and new antisemitism is, we just say that there is one.

The history section talks about a Soviet new anti-Semitism, and says this antisemtism was """"close to its modern form"""".  But it doesn't explain what close means.  Presumably there are important ways in which it is similar and ways in which it is different, but the article doesn't explain what they are.

Further down, we seem to be equating new antisemitism with anti-zionism.  Maybe this is the crux of my issues with this article.  We have anti-zionism; hatred of/opposition to an jewish state.  We have anti-semitism; hatred of/opposition to the jewish race (common usage. technically arabs are also semites, but lets not go there now).   We can also identify anti-Israel sentiment; opposition to some or all aspects of Israel.  These things all overlap, but it's hard to say that any of them are the same, or a subset of each other.  For example there were jews opposed to the creation of Israel because it was man-made, not created by god.  And some dislike of Israel is anti-semitic, but not all of it.  The boundaries are fuzzy, but for each of these concepts there is a clear and unmistakable core.  I can't say that for new-antisemtism.  I can't identify what new-antisemitism is that old-antisemtism is not.

To me, new antisemitism seems to be a grab bag of an expression that mixes some different issues:  1. the apparent resurgence in antisemitism, which I suggest properly belongs at contemporary antisemitism; 2. the difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate/illegitimate criticism of israel, which I suggest belongs here, or possibly at anti-zionism; and 3. the changing nature of the anti-semite (left/right/arab/european/russian/...) which I suggest belongs at contemporary antisemitism and/or at antisemitism.

Contents: An optional bulleted list, usually alphabetized, of a reasonable number of editor-recommended publications that would help interested readers learn more about the article subject. Editors may include brief annotations. Publications listed in Further reading are cited in the same citation style used by the rest of the article. The Further reading section should not duplicate the content of the External links section, and should normally not duplicate the content of the References section, unless the References section is too long for a reader to use as part of a general reading list. This section is not intended as a repository for general references that were used to create the article content.

 You currently appear to be engaged in an edit war. Note that the three-revert rule prohibits making more than three reversions on a single page within a 24 hour period. Additionally, users who perform a large number of reversions in content disputes may be blocked for edit warring, even if they do not technically violate the three-revert rule. If you continue, you may be blocked from editing. Please do not repeatedly revert edits, but use the talk page to work towards wording and content that gains a consensus among editors. If necessary, pursue dispute resolution.   Remember that as per WP:CCC no consensus is permanent.  I have proposed a change as per WP:BOLD, and see no protest from any users other than yourself.  If you would like to discuss a potential compromise to reach a new consensus I would be more than open to that, but simply dismissing my change without any form of discourse goes against the nature of WP.

If you check the links they are all to legitimate secondary sources, and the chances they have been tampered with are remote. No reasons why such tampering might occur have been advanced. And, of course, anyone with access to the publications may check the accuracy, and bring any problems to the attention of editors. The sources for the article span various publications and television programs, so whether they span the web is perhaps not a major consideration. Nevertheless, if other supporting links are available, they should be used in preference. I think it should also be pointed out, as has already been pointed out, that one user who removed the links claiming they were improper, later restored one of those links, because he wished to use it to support an argument. So there is clear evidence of inconsistency by those rejecting these links. That said, users now appear satisfied that the links may remain (to be replaced if and when other links become available), so I would hope that this issue does not need to be reopened without good reason.

The real problem is that User:Musical_Linguist has a personal grudge against me and vigorously hunts for and reverts all of my attempts at dialog with the rest of the Wikipeida community.  Clearly, Wikipedia, with 1,000,000 articles is now big enough for the two of us, but she a pretty and polite female and so she has the upper hand.  She seems to have nothing to offer the Bill of attainder aritcle except to hit the undo button if she thinks that I have effected any changes.  Surely, she has a personal motivation directed towards me personally.  That is not really how adminship is supposed to work, is it: that an admin can hold a grudge and personally hunt down an individual other person?  Is there not some mechanism by which she can be instructed to direct her attention away from my activities and let the other 800 Wikipedia admins perform the job of protecting Wikipeida from Andrew William Morrow?  If the problem is truly Andrew William Morrow, then it will be obvious to the other admins, but in fact, that has not been the case.  Oh sure, there has been the occasional problem (if you look at my Wikipedia work as indexed on my web site, you will see that I choose to focus on controversial biographies with a high content of U.S. case law).  This Irish woman has nothing to offer the articles she has personally targeted via this tool Template:Pinktulip except to hit the undo button. She has done no research.  She has conducted no dialog with other editors.  Like you, she always claims to be """"too busy"""" to engage in any actual dialog, but she has plenty of time to sit around and chat with her Catholic pro-life friends and hit the undo button every time she sees non-vandalism contributions that she simply does not like.  As you can see by her user page, she is highly prone to view the work of others through the rather narrow prism of her Pope's worldview.  If you study Special:Contributions/Musical Linguist you will see that she spends many, many hours on Wikiepdia every day and note the quick response time of her reverts: She must be monitoring her watch list vigorously.  Is this really what you want Wikipedia to be about?  Letting admins, no matter how polite, intelligent and pretty impose their worldview on others?  Is it such a tragedy to put some horse-blinders on her to say: """"For these specific users and these specific articles, you will stay away.  You have had much more than your fair turn at these specific users and these specific articles and now you, dear and valued admin, are being administratively rotated out of them and you will stay rotated out of them for a good, long time.""""  Is that such a tragedy?  Fred: It is only a tragedy if the problem is really within the admin herself, rather than within the targeted or banned user(s).  The mature admin would not take such instructions as an insult, but simply as a matter of due course.  Musical Linguist is much like the childless woman hovering over someone else's child, ever-ready to snatch the child and claim it for her own.  It is a natural impulse, but it requies intervention because it is also a disorderly impulse.  All I have done is to flush the woman out by getting her to fill out the """"Pinktulip"""" template completely.  Her contribution to the information content the articles listed in the Pinktulip template is zero, but but she now exerts total control of them.  She is merely a sterile, charming, controlling woman and she should herself now be controlled.  She is all process and no results.  That is not what Wikipeida was supposed to be about.

 His documented emotional involvements with boys to the exclusion of relationships with women 

I noticed that the text appended below, posted on August 5th of this year, has been largely deleted, in favor of a homily on the lack of perceptivity of modern observers when faced with our quaint forefathers. Unless specific objections are raised to the sources on which this material is based, I do not see how it can be blocked from the article, nor do I see it as within our rights to preach here against modern gender studies work. Throughout his life, Brooke's principal emotional bonds were with adolescent boys, while he exhibited a total lack of interest in women. Among his more notable relationships with boys was the one with Badruddin, a Sarawak prince, of whom he wrote, """"my love for him was deeper than anyone I knew."""" Later, in 1848, Brooke fell in love with Charles Grant (grandson of the seventh Earl of Elgin), who had just been recruited, being sixteen at the time. His love was reciprocated by the boy.Empire and Sexuality: The British Experience, Ronald Hyam; pp.44-45WALKER, J.H., This peculiar acuteness of feeling: James Brooke and the enactment of desire, Borneo Research Bulletin, vol 29 (1998) pp 148- 189

 What are you talking about? 

Excuse me, I have no idea what you are talking about.  What do you mean by """"stalking""""?  I came across The Intruder and thought I could make it a little better.  I reorganized it, put in headings, added some wikilinks, deleted your signature (unlike blogs, Wikipedia editors don't sign articles), and took out some clear violations of WP:NPOV.  How is this stalking?  I haven't followed you around to any articles you have edited and vandalized them.  I don't recall how I came upon the article, my contributions list show it was just after some vandalism reverts  where I often find articles of interest, whether vandalized or not.

Many editors with blogging background don't realize that article listings for movies, books, theatre, etc. are not reviews.  Such quotes as, """"'The Intruder' contains William Shatner's best and bravest lead role, played to the hilt, and the hilt disappears into Adam Cramer,"""" are perfectly fine in a review, but not in Wikipedia.  You might want to read Wikipedia policy concerning original research.  If you can find similar sentiments in the print media or other such source, then, by all means, add it and reference it.  Don't worry about getting the format correct, put the information in the article and other editors will fix it up to conform to Wikipedia's manual of style.  You might want to look at other articles for movies to get a feel for the format.  Eventually, the """"original research"""" part of your contribution will be deleted.  If not by me, then by another editor.  I've found it better to anticipate that and write my articles accordingly.

As for Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/What Really Happened (2nd nomination), I made my comments and have moved on.  Lots of editors make comments on deletion articles every day.  I have commented on several hundred AfDs (Articles for Deletion).  For the most part, I don't recall what any individual says 5 minutes after I click the save button.  Sorry, but I don't recall your comment, nor whether you are for or against deletion (although, I presume you took the opposite stance from me).  I read enough to get a feel for the arguments, did some research, and came to a decision.  In the past I have pushed delete and the articles were kept.  Other times I pushed for keep and the articles were deleted.  That is the nature of AfD.

I am aware of wikipedia policy and don't need to reread it. I broke policy knowingly. I apologize for doing so. It was for the sake of whimsy. That impulse has left me, and I make the promise that it will not return. I do not retract anything that I said. The bigger issue which I have been addressing is the flaw within the system itself. After repeated requests to actually read what I'm saying here and what I actually said on the Beat Generation page, you clearly have mistunderstood me. Your claim that you have ignored evidence in the prosecution of my punishment is one among many disturbing signs of the flaws within the Wikipedia system. What you call extraneous issues are indeed central issues. You have done little to convince me otherwise. For example, the sockpuppetry was a bad idea when considering rules of civility, and I won't let it happen again. It was a good idea in that it was funny, but like I said, that's out of my system. The bigger issue  a central issue, not extraneous  is that admins claimed I was being dishonest. This is evidence of laziness and lack of real concern for the real job you are meant to do. If the real problem is that I was uncivil, then I apologize and make an honest promise that I will never do it again. I don't believe that really is a central issue. I'm not blaming anyone else for me being uncivil; I chose to do it and have never claimed otherwise. The problem is Wikipedia is a toilet. Why is it a toilet? Wikipedia is a punchline. Why is it a punchline? Because people who passionately care about truth get angry (even if it was pretend) on occassion? No. I realize uncivil behavior can be a contributing factor in that it can fail to lead to a positive change; I was practically begging for a positive change on the Beat Generation page, and nothing was happening. Certain other editors were relying on Wikipedia rules to stymie progress. Block me or don't block me, I don't care (and judging from the history of this process and my history with Tao  I fear you'll scan this for trigger words, see """"I don't care"""" and say, """"If you don't care, why are you wasting my time?"""" totally missing the point of what I'm actually saying)  but please look in the mirror and think about the real problem here. If you skip the first part where I genuinely apologize for the actual infraction and said I would never do it again (just as I genuinely apologized for the infraction last time and said I would never do it again  and I can keep saying this over and over again) and if you once again just look at this part and claim I'm focusing on extraneous issues and incorrectly claim that I'm blaming others  blaming others for my rant? no, please actually see: my rant is my responsibility, and once again I apologize for it  whatever you do, despite my lack of faith in anyone's ability to genuinely take some time and think about these things, please just consider what's right and what's wrong here on a larger level while in the short term focusing on my genuine heart-felt apology.

...which is the reason why I first discuss it, then change it.  An edit war is nothing pretty, you  know?  We'll see.  Anyway, what you write is largely true, but misleading. Especially:

- Free oxygen, free fluorine and moisture surely will corrode the metallic walls.  However, the chemical potential of the salt has to be controlled anyway so it is slightly on the reducing side, containing some trivalent uranium.  So any free oxygen or fluorine will oxydize the uranium ions, not the metal structure.  Moisture will be driven out with the off-gas at working temperatures.  All this is pretty much a non-issue.

- Cryolithe.  Yes, aluminium is produced by electrolysing alumina with cryolithe.  This can be considered a mixture or solution of sodium flouride, aluminium fluoride and aluminum oxide, certainly a molten salt.  But the cryolithe is really only a fluxing agent, it is chemically non-agressive and it doesn't extract aluminium or something.  You hinted that it does, which  is really misleading.

- Heating is not a technological issue.  Sure, it adds to the cost, but other than that there's no problem.  A power reactor would run quite some time without ever being cooled down, refuelling is done by adding some molten or even solid salt, without shutdown, cooling or heating.  

- But tritium is a problem.  To slow down tritium formation, the lithium in the salt has to be almost pure Li-7, and even then tritium will form.  Tritium in the salt is no problem, it doesn't attack metals.  Tritium migrating from the salt is a problem.  ORNL says, they were able to chemically trap the tritium in the secondary cooling loop.  A problem, yes, but nothing major.

And of course there are the political issues.  An MSR doesn't fit into the """"razor-blade"""" business model currently employed, research is still needed, and that is expensive, waste reprocessing is currently illegal (though this is stupid when also applied to pyroprocessing), and uranium is too cheap these days to make a breeder economically viable.

(Yes, if we can find some agreement, I'll summarize this and move it to the article proper.)""",0

 Proposed revision of the controversy section 

Though controversy shouldn't consume the bulk of the article, I think the revised section is somewhat awkwardly written and neglects the substance of the criticisms. It can be rewritten for greater clarity, and to include the quotes that have actually generated the controversy. It is just false to say conservative bloggers are basing their criticisms on """"a single line from his book""""but if it were true, shouldn't that line be quoted too? The section can be kept short, while not excluding the content of criticisms. I propose the following text.

Lloyd has been targeted by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, with the aim of forcing him to resign, as happened with former White House adviser Van Jones.

Beck broadcast a video of Lloyd's comments at a 2008 conference on media reform, in which he described the rise of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez as """"really an incredible revolution."""" Conservatives view this as an expression of support for Chavez, though Lloyd has stated that he does not support him. Conservative bloggers have also attacked Lloyd's commitment to free speech, based largely on quotes from his book Prologue to a Farce: Communication and Democracy in America, in which he writes that the First Amendment should be placed """"in context with other communications policies,"""" and on his 2007 article Forget The Fairness Doctrine, discussing """"clear proposals...to address the gap between conservative and progressive talk."""" Over 50 non-partisan public interest groups have defended Lloyd, calling conservative claims """"false and misleading.""""

This is only about 30 words longer than the present version, but I believe it does much more to inform readers about the controversy. Since the controversy section of this article is so controversial, however, I'll leave my rewrite here for a day or two before implementing it. It's always easier to see bias against your own point of view, so I hope some liberals can improve on my text! But the current version is just not accurate or informative.173.21.159.52  """,0

"Oh boy, where is Francis? Grandmaster, I can not know any other words than POV pushing to discribe what you are doing. WHERE DID I EVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT NAKHICHEVAN POPULATION IN 1830s, do you see me ever contesting those statistics? Do you even see me contesting 14th century material? Besides, Nakhichevan discribed there is NOT Nakhichevan with its current bordering. Grandmaster, don't get offended but up to now you have demonstrated that you have no clue of what you are talking about. Taking Nakhichevan as a whole, in its pick, the population jumped to 150,000, it was its most important period, after the 13th century it was replaced, in 14th century, it droped to about half of its prior population, it lost its statue, at 15th century it was taken over by Armenians from the vicinities of Van, and after the desertion of Ani, people moved there. Julfa alone represented a significant portion of the entire population. The closest to the Abbas period you cam is of over 200 years, while I provided data which covered that period. You are the one making up things which you can in no way backup. Here, let readd the materials I have provided.

For the next four centuries, Armenians, who had begun their dispersion after the fall of Ani and the Seljuk Turkish invasions in the eleventh century, continued to emigrate. In the meantime, Persia ( Iran) experienced a revival under the Shi'i Safavids, who became the adversaries of the Sunni Ottomans. From 1501 until 1639, the two fought each other periodically in Armenia. Armenians were uprooted during these wars, and, in 1604, some 250,000 Armenians were forcibly transferred by Shah 'Abbas to Iran. By the seventeenth century, the Armenians had become a minority in parts of their historic lands. The merchants of Julfa in Nakhichevan were among those who were brought to Iran by Shah 'Abbas; he moved them to a suburb of Isfahan where they built the New Julfa community. The support of 'Abbas and subsequent shahs enabled the Armenians to expand Iran's trade with India, China, Russia, and Western Europe. These merchants helped to make the Persian Gulf an important trade center. An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires by James S. Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas C. J. Pappas. p. 44

Shah Abbas devastated his frontier areas, which included parts of Armenia, as a defensive measure and so displaced nearly all the population. [from it] He settled some 13,000 families in the silk-growing northern provinces of Gilan and Mazanderan bordering on the Caspian. (Source: The Armenians and the East India Company in Persia in the Seventeenth and Early Eighteenth Centuries by R. W. Ferrier, The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 26, No. 1 (1973), p. 39)

Linda K. Steinmann in her work Shah 'Abbas and the Royal Silk Trade 1599-1629, Vol. 14, No. 1 (1987), pp. 68-74 covers the evacuation of the Armenians, and to a lesser extent elsewhere of Georgians, but nowhere does she say anything about any evacuation of Tartars.

Ina Baghdiantz McCabe covers the evacuation in her work The Shah's Silk for Europe's Silver: The Eurasian Trade of the Julfa Armenians in Safavid Iran and India (1530-1750), I don't see anything about Tartars being evacuated or an undiscriminate evacuation, or any reference of an important Tartar population in Nakhichevan.

Josepho Barbaro while visiting the devastation reports destruction of Armenian towns and its desertion, not Tartars.

Sir William Ouseley during his visit in 1812 has only discribed the destruction of the Armenian city during the evacuation.

In 1603 Shah 'Abbas, the great Safavid ruler of Persia, sent an expedition into Armenia in answer to the appeals of the inhabitants for assistance against the Turks. The death of the Sultan Mahmud III in December 1603 and the succession of his son Ahmed, a boy of twelve, opened the way to an easy conquest in the course of which both retreating Turks and invading Persians plundered the Armenians. The Persian victory was followed by a forced emigration of the population to the Shah's capital of Isfahan. « That dragon of hell, Shah Abbas, nourished from the beginning in the ways of the serpent, saw with an eye of envy the prosperity of the Christians. » So Arakel of Tauriz, the seventeenth-century Armenian historian, puts it, and it was indeed the skill of new... Armenia was left desolates... (A Seventeenth-Century typological cycle of paintings in the Armenian cathedal at Julfa, T. S. R. Boase, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 13, No. 3/4 pp.323-324)

D.M. Lang writes that one of the two major reasons of the deportation was: ...he desired to make use of the industrial and commercial talents of the Armenians... (Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 32, No. 3 (1969) p. 622) Julfa population was so i",0

Photo Caption Correction
The photo containing a U.S. Army PSYOP humvee in Al Kut is incorrect. It is a 312th not the 350th PSYOP Company team (look at the left front of the vehicle for the identifier, the Marine article incorrectly identified the Army PSYOP vehicle). I know that particular vehicle in the photo and what a pain in the rear it was to maintain it.

Speedy deletion of The Tyler
 A tag has been placed on The Tyler, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G1 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the page appears to have no meaningful content or history, and the text is unsalvageably incoherent. If the page you created was a test, please use the sandbox for any other experiments you would like to do. Feel free to leave a message on my talk page if you have any questions about this. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

There are two key concepts in the article.  Fully half of the main section, and all of the math, is devoted to the concept depicted in the figure, which is that of doing piece-wise convolution and creating a seamless result.  One has to understand that before the next step makes sense, and it is easier to understand without the unnecessary complexity of circular convolution.  Divide and conquer.  It's about teaching and understanding, not efficiency.
The details of circular convolution aren't included here, because they are explained in other articles.",0

Maybe you should talk to some GMs and ask about me. The self-agrandizing comment was removed and I did not really think it mattered to credit myself since I am one of the only ones to have analysed it this intensely aside from Wind. Maybe you should have looked at the content rather than judging my personality. Wikipedia is about content and you are not the judge of that. You should look at my site. Look at the beautiful puzzles I created. You should look over the analysis with a computer. You should notice that I am not the only one that points out that the Pinski line is not a refutation. You are afraid of being wrong. The Halloween is sound in practical chess. If god was to play who knows and who cares. But Houdini vs Carlsen and Houdini has the white side and my analysis I will take my analysis any day. That is why coorespondence is usually a good citation. But really look over the puzzles and the analysis. It really is a work of art. If you care about chess you would do it. But I think you care more about not being wrong. You insert POV that it is refuted. This is a lie. A very very obvious lie. I would post this on their talk but I seriously dont care. I care about the beauty of chess and of my own work. If I wanted to be a GM I would have been but its not an ego thrill for me. All I care about is the beauty of the game and I believe my puzzles express just that.,0

Sure, that's my point exactly: That you don't WP:OWN Wikipedia to have the temerity stick graven images of a near-naked man meditating to who knows what type of deity, equally forbidden by the Ten Commandments.

"Attendances 

Hi there, I see you've been having some trouble with adding the attendance to the Hawthorn vs. West Coast match. The reason that it kept being removed is one of Wikipedia's core policies, Wikipedia:Verifiability, which means we can't add any information to articles that isn't supported by a reference in a reliable source. Editors are actually encouraged to remove information that isn't verified (that being said, it is almost always more productive to start a dialogue than blindly revert). Anyway, I saw you add the info back, so I added a reference to it so it doesn't get reverted again. I encourage you to add references yourself in future, so that hopefully this doesn't happen again (and please note that references don't have to be online, they can be offline, such as the reference I added to the 2011 season article).

Bill,

I don't find your un-edits a gender-based attack.  I am largely concerned with the content of the article itself, but I wonder why you put up so much opposition to my very small edit.  Surely it can't mean that much to you.

I don't want to make derogatory comments about men.  I have nothing against men, and I don't enjoy tearing people down.  You mention the term """"well-referenced"""".  I prefer for statements to be well-referenced too.  I don't think that this particular statment is well-referenced, and furthermore, I don't think that it can be well-referenced, because I don't think that it is true.  And so I wonder about the author's neutrality.  Wikipedia articles are supposed to be both neutral and well-edited, and that statement is neither.

I don't want the article to be deleted either.  I think that it serves a useful purpose, and I enjoyed reading it.  I just want to do away with that particular sentence.

Of course, if you can find evidence that American women are materialistic sluts, then we have no problem at all.  But I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote that was confusing personal opinion for universal truth.
