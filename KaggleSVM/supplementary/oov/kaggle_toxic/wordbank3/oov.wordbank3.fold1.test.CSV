I think the key words here are """"claim to have been molested.""""  Justin was an Internet sex entrepreneur and a high paid male prostitute, who had numerous opportunities to get out of the business had he wanted to do so.  It is only society's blind and blanket characterization of everyone under the age of 18 as having been """"molested"""" when they engage in problematical sexual activity, which permits Justin to make a quick transition from selling his body to selling his victimhood. Rookiee's article was fact-based and properly sourced.  That Justin didn't like it when the facts weren't spun from a victimologist perspective is immaterial.

Wikipedia pretends that it's run by consensus as long as volunteers are happily creating multiple millions of dollars in free intellectual property for Jimbo.  Once that task is largely complete, the truth is revealed, which is that this is basically Jimbo's private BBS where he can do anything he feels like, and the contributions he paid nothing for are his to exploit any way he wishes.

 Objectivity 
I realize this is a very controversial topic, but this article is simply not objective enough, and simply demonstrates American public opinion. For example, it is commonly accepted OUTSIDE of the United States that the fourth aircraft was downed by the US military. It is possible that the US media has exercised self-censorship and so the American public doees not have access to this information, but deleting caveats such as """"the 9/11 commission determined that..."""", or putting it under """"conspiracy theories"""" simply destroys objectivity.
Could we not have this article explaining that it reflects the 9/11 commission's determinations, and have a prominent link to """"Disputes with the official account""""? This would, hopefully, avoid offending people's sensitivity to the subject by keeping controversies off the main page, but also thereby reflecting a wider opinion?""",0
"Some Third-party opinions 

I've been asked to provide a third opinion on recent disputes.  Here goes:

Do you understand why File:Grand Kudu, Eritrea.jpg was deleted, Vetrisimino0?  I'd like to hear that you do; you should after a read of .  It seems the deletion was appropriate.  (And, it's reversible with permission logged via an [[Commons:OTRS| OTRS ticket].)
As for the suggestion to   From just reading this page, it looked like this had been settled, and the photos are to be left in and photos of members of other groups can be added over time (and there have been multiple other editors providing opinions already).  Good.  I would add that images should be shrunk or (better yet) merged, as at [:File:Eriamercol.jpg], so that this can happen.  However, I see File:Traditional_Eritrean_dance.jpg has replaced Tigrinya Eritrean wedding picture File:Eritrea_Eritrean_wedding.jpg.  Is this a problem?  I don't know the ethnicities of the photographed parties.  I haven't looked through the article's edit history and don't plan do.
Flickr has lots more appropriately licensed files.  I see File:Rashaida_family.png is on the french article, so there are photos available. 
Re. Faytinga photo: I think it should stay. Re.  The mayote site seems to be a mouthpiece for a particular set of politicial views, so I don't think it's a reliable source for much other than its own views. (My opinion would be swayed if it had a written fact-checking policy.)  However, given 3 other sources Vetrisimino0 says confirm Faytinga's mother's ethnicity, it seems reasonable to belive it's true.  Can you accept that, Middayexpress?  If not, I still think her picture merits inclusion (without noting her mother's ethnicity) and 'clutter' is a poor argument for its removal here.
I do wish to point out that a blanket order to a fellow editor like  is highly inappropriate and invalid here! The WP:BOLD guideline applies to, and allows, such edits.  However, so does the part of BOLD that guides one as to how to react when one's bold edits are not left in place.  So, in other words, both of you should read / review WP:BOLD. (I see no argument for an exception to BOLD.)

So, hopefully both sides will accept my opinions, and move on to edit on other topics within and without Eritrea.  There are points where I have agreed with each of you and points where I have disagreed with each of you (two each), and I believe I've been able to be fair and impartial.  Hope that helps.(t•c)",0
""":Thanks for posting the notice in Talk:Priština -)
I share Húsönd's rational for opposing the move (despite the University of Prishtina precedent, where I just don't dare to tread -)
As discussed in Talk:Priština, I find that """"Pristina"""" is just a simplified version of """"Priština"""", widely used because of mainly two factors: lack of """"š"""" in English (and most keyboards) and political neutrality. In fact, the very same people who write """"Pristina"""" pronounce the word with the """"š/sh"""" sound. In my personal opinion, and in Húsönd's words, [diacritics are] a more perfectionist and educative way to display [the name].
As for the official website, check the """"Welcome to Kosova"""" section, not to mention the """"History"""" section -)
1965: Prishtina Airport was officially opened and initially was opened for domestic flights only.
2000: Airport Prishtina initially has begun its operations and other airport matters with 45 employed workers in total.
I can't stress enough that my opinion has nothing to do with taking sides in the current Kosovo conflict (which I would solve by moving the entire population of the Western Balkans to Antarctica, and giving the region to the penguins - who probably will change Priština's official name to something in the lines of Tekeli-li).

I moved the xenophobic part under """"Ideology and political positions"""":
In 2013, a Sveriges Radio journalist called the party xenophobic, which resulted in a complaint lodged to the broadcasting regulator. The Swedish Broadcasting Commission determined that this description was acceptable to use.[44].
It's a pretty big distortion to use some broadcasting commission decision as a source like it was used before. For the lede to say that SD is xenophobic we need to have a better source than one SR journalist. I have nothing against such inclusion, if such sources exist. ' """,0
"HIV transmission does NOT have a constant level of risk per exposure.  Some people are genetically resistant (e.g. CCR5_Δ32#CCR5-.CE.9432) as potential recipients, and some people are likely not to be very infectious even if infected (e.g. HLA B*57).  In addition, acutely infected people are the most infectious, and people with genital ulcer disease are likely to be both high transmitters and particularly susceptible.  So, the risk depends dramatically on many variables.  In addition, it's known that the cumulative risk approaches only about 40% (in discordant couples), and the uninfected partners tend to show evidence of cellular immunity to HIV (suggesting exposure).",0

Your campaign for censorship got a strong head start. I dont blame you, as it's the guy below who is adding fuel to the fire. Friends? )  
With this unappologetic response, I think a longer ban is in order.  
Here's the one vying for head of the censorship department lately. Mind your own business a little more, Irpin.  
My dear friend. As it has been ruled by the courts, Freedom of Speech does not extend to protection of ethnic slurs and hate speech whose propagation brought about your ban. Besides, nothing could stop you from using one of your socks. So, you were not really censored. Last but not least, you could take your grievances to your talk page which was not protected. I think Renata was too lenient. But be sure that unless you change your behavior, the next block will be permanent.  

Insinuations and wishful thinking. The almighty King Solomon of Wikipedia, almost. I think people have been too lenient in scrutinizing your smear campaign. This is not Renata's fault, but a consequence of the lack of disciplinary action in your case (long overdue), an institution you so vehemently attack, counting on the ignorant unsuspicion of a few to abuse against other users.

 Bewilderland 

The introduction includes the comment:-
""""The story is told in the form of an episodic quest, and most chapters introduce a specific creature, or type of creature, of Tolkien's Wilderland"""".

I edited the last bit to Middle-earth because:-
(1) the introduction to creatures begins with Chapter 1, which introduces Hobbits (and Wizards and Dwarves), and continues with chapter 2 (which introduces Trolls) and chapter 3 (which introduces Elves). These creatures are not limited to """"Tolkien's Wilderland"""", and in fact the individuals introduced (Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin & Co., etc.) do NOT live in Wilderland. Wilderland is properly the region east of the Misty Mountains, and Bilbo does not reach it until chapter 6.
(2) Furthermore, many of the creatures first encountered in Wilderland (e.g. Men and Dragons) are not unique to Wilderland in Tolkien's Middle-earth.
(3) I'm aware that Middle-earth in not named in the book. However most readers of Wikipedia would have heard of Middle-earth, and few would have heard of Wilderland.  
(4) In any case a link is required.

But I guess whoever reversed my edit knows better. Regards, 203.26.122.8  """,0

And that an arbcom member is so bent of fighting with a mere editor and besmirching him  must be also a source of great pride for some. I have not commented on your religion or your country, you have on mine. Shows who has  attacked people based on national identities or religion. So that too must make someone very proud.
 Defending a person, or standing up for them does not mean one agrees with every statement that they may have made. Show me where I have defended Bhaisaab's anti religion comments. So you have now made another false claim above that I defend anti semetic speech. By the same generalisation what would you say about an admin not even reacting to an virulent anti Muslim speech made by his protege, even after I posted it on the admin's talk page ? Further that admin's  defending his protege then makes the admin  (by your logic above) a defender of anti Muslim speech!. That  I an editor with no powers is fighting a biased and prejudiced person, misusing his position , is a great source of pride for me.
 Also please do note that since the arbcom elections I have not bothered to be involved with you, till you went about posting details about me;and your attempt to trace my location , to an editor hostile to me. So rather than me bent on besmirching you as you seem to potray, the fact is that my opposing you on the arbcom has got me special attention from you, which is gross abuse of your position.

 What is the relevancy of his ethnicity? 
His mixture of ethnicity's is very American common bringing in the curious """"everyman"""" theme that is so quintessentially American.  This has intrigue for readers who, just as the experts, are trying to puzzle out just what drove this person to do what he did.  Astute readers are going to want to sift every clue available to them as their desire to correctly understand his motives, his personality drives their efforts.  To simply gloss over and erase out information to make him appear ethnically neutral would be both dishonest and a disservice to readers putting in some real effort to understand him. Trying to understand a serial killer, and the social fabric they navigate through is complex as it gets and any clues are appreciated.  

Is it relevant to mention he was of Italian and Filipino descent?  He was born in California which makes him American. 
His looks were such that he tended to blend in everywhere and anywhere, so yes, it is relevant.  
However, feel free to move that information deeper into the article.  
I don't understand how readers are supposed to draw the conclusion that being of Italian/ Filipino descent makes it easier to blend in.  The way the information is presented seems to form an impression that his ethnicity had something to do with his criminal actions.  My conclusion is that it is irrelevant and should be deleted. 
No, it made it easier for him to blend in in Miami.  
The following section, """"Since he was of mixed race (his mother was white, and his father, Filipino), he blended in well in the diverse Miami Beach scene"""", all looks to me like original research.  Are there any references to support that this is a published conclusion?   
Just to clarify, I don't mean the part about his parents ethnicity in and of itself (that is documented), I'm referring to the idea that it had some special advantage which helped him fit in.  From my readings on this subject his ability to fit into the Miami scene was due to his gay lifestyle more than any other factor.

 feedback as requested 

Hey Antonin! I'm only too happy to help out (as much as I can) - having sooooo many problems elsewhere. In fact, completely and utterly stuck and rather despondent about it all. 

First impressions; not yet a balanced article - a lot on the controversies, too little on the magazine and its background; the latter, I think, needs clarification. What was the Czech political-cultural context, and how did this produce the magazine? """"Conservative"""" is too vague - I think readers will benefit from being told more about Czech conservatism. Then there's the magazine itself; who started it (and what were they doing before this?); editorial policy, contributors, transfer of ownership (if any) and whether or not the magazine has changed since its acquisition by the media group. 

Put it this way: certainly in the UK (and probably in the US), an award for growing the best cannabis plant isn't something usually associated with a conservative magazine...  

I'll put this page on my watch-list. I'll be happy to sort out any copy issues, btw. Best regards,   

Thanks for your opinions, Davey. You are right, the article is not balanced. I'm trying to use only sources independent on the magazine itself, and unfortunately the sources deal mainly with controversies. There is an overview of the history of Reflex in the 20th anniversary issue, I'll try to expand the article with that information and answer your questions. Btw, Reflex is sometimes really considered as a conservative magazine; could there be a little difference between the perception of the term in the professional and well-developed Anglo-American journalism and the perception of still """"young"""" independent Czech journalism? Using of this term in the post-communist world is quite complicated, as conservatism defends traditional values and continuity, and the first free post-communist media (including Reflex) had to start building again; to some extent they had to find the values and the interrupted tradition. The provocative cannabis award could be an attempt to test the borders of freedom of speech and to come closer to independent and bold journalism. This is, however, just my vague point of view. We should probably avoid this association on English Wikipedia, as this is a world grown in a completely different tradition and experience. Again, thanks for pointing out the problems. I'll work on it.   

I've attempted to expand and clarify the origins and background of the magazine as recommended.   

Yes, I've been hovering over your shoulder the whole time! Good beefy stuff... d'you reckon you're pretty much done with the content? 'Cos I do, and intend twiddling up the prose some time this weekend. By the way, it's no big deal but are you OK with all those red-links?   

Hi Davey, you won't believe how happy I am seeing that you are still interested! I'm careful with the red links, this project has still gaps in detailed covering of Czech topics. All of the red linked names are notable Czech journalists. See the Czech wiki articles for Jan Šibík, Petr Hájek, Jiří X. Doležal, Tomáš Feřtek, Josef Klíma, Jiří Pehe, Tomáš Baldýnský, Bohumil Pečinka, Miloš Čermák, Pavlína Wolfová. With the red colour I'm trying to point out that they should have articles also here. Thank you for your help and interest, ask whatever )   

Oh, I know how that one feels. It can be a strange and lonely business indeed. Still, here come the queries:

 Constitution and Editorial continuity: d'you know who owned it in the first place? Was it a one-man show which employed Petr Hájek? Or was he owner and editor? Sorry to be picky here, but it'll matter, particularly as this is living persons biog.
 Yes, the BLP issue is the main reason why I asked for your help. Hájek was the owner, together with Andrej Šťastný and Jiří Fleyberk. He seems to be the most important one, according to my sources.

How America Entered The War
Flynn Writes About The Diplomatic Secret Service  By F. W. Elven, Correspondent Of The München Latest
News  Cincinnati, Mid June
William J. Flynn has published a part of his War Memoirs in the weekly Liberty, which is much read here.
During the war, Flynn was the Head Of The United States Secret Service. The Service encompasses the whole
country, and is brilliantly organised. In peacetime it primarily provides for the personal security of the President.
Its attention is enjoyed by whatever else in the national capital is in need of protection, or thinks it needs so. It
keeps under surveillance all doubtful elements somehow suspected of connections with political tendencies
hostile to the government and its spokesmen. During the war its principal task was to keep an eye on those who
more or less loudly had made themselves noticeable in opposition to the war, or who merely were suspected of
not being in agreement with the Wilsonian war policy. Germans also enjoyed its special care, and at that time
many fell into the traps which had been laid everywhere by the Federal Secret Service.
From Flynn's memoirs, however, we learn that the Secret Service had been assigned an important mission even
before our entry into the war. In the year 1915, a full two years before the declaration of war, the most efficient
telephone expert was summoned to Washington and assigned the task of arranging the leading telephone wires
to the German and Austrian embassies in such a way that Secret Service officials could tap every conversation
from any source that was held between the ambassadors and their personnel, as well as every conversation
emanating from the embassy offices. A room was set up with which all the wires were linked in such an
ingenious way that not even a single conversation could be missed. Service men sat in this room day and night,
dictating the overheard conversations to the stenographers seated beside them. Every night the head of the Secret
Service Bureau, that is, the author of the article in Liberty, received a stenographic report of all the conversations
held in the preceding twenty four hours, so that on the very same evening he was able to communicate
everything important to the State Department and to President Wilson.
Let us bear in mind the time this installation was created, at the beginning of the year 1915, that is, at the time
when the United States still lived in peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary, and Wilson never tired of giving
assurances that he harboured no hostile intentions against Germany. It was also the time when the German
Ambassador in Washington, Count Bernstorff, neglected no opportunity to show due appreciation of Wilson's
friendly disposition and feelings for Germany and the German Folk. It was also the time when Wilson gave his
confidant Baruch instructions to begin the gradual mobilisation of industry for war; also the time in which it
became increasingly obvious, as the American historian Harry Elmer Barnes also sets forth in his book On The
Origins Of The Great War, that Wilson was firmly decided to enter the war, and postponed the execution of his
bellicose plans only because public opinion first had to be won over for these plans.
Flynn's memoirs must finally remove the ground from the foolish chatter that Wilson was pushed into the war
against his will by German submarine warfare. The tapping of the telephone wires leading to the German
embassy took place with his knowledge. We also learn this from Flynn's memoirs. The author adds that the
material thus gathered against Germany contributed considerably to the eventual break. This can prove only that
this put means in Wilson's hands to win public opinion for the war long planned by him. And in fact this
material was wholly and ideally suited for it. The Memoirs confirm to the fullest extent what unfortunately must
still be said, that Germany at that time was represented in Washington in a downright incredibly incompetent
and incredibly unworthy way. If we hear that in one passage Flynn writes that the stenographic reports prepared
for him daily contained enough material to keep a divorce lawyer busy for months on end, then we get a general
idea of what went on.
The Secret Service maintained women agents in Washington and New York whose job it was to sound out the
members of the German Embassy, Bernstorff included, whenever anything important happened. One of these
woman agents kept a better class apartment in Washington in which the gentlemen met their ladies, and where
occasionally even Secretary Of State Lansing dropped in to hear what was new. On New Year's Day, 1916,

 Neutral Nazism

"incorrect interpretation! 

The european translator, assumed that since hafez was a follower of sufism and love in sufism had sometimes been pederastic, therefore the beloved should have been a young boy. Well, I am looking at the persian version of the verses translated by  Henry Wilberforce-Clarke, and as person whose mother tongue is persian it seems to me that the beloved was an adult female rather than a young boy. Since hafez is using pronouns to refer to his beloved and the cupbeareand, one could go both ways but in persian we always use the phrase 'lock of hair of the beloved' to refer to females (since they have long hair you know). Besides anyone who is familiar with hafez poetry and have an advance understanding of medieval persian language, would know that Hafez is very unlikely to have pederastic inclinations.
I am well aware of the existance pederasty in many teachings of sufism and I have seen the pederastic sentiments in Jami and Saadi poems but Not all persian poets that follow sufism have pederastic inclinations!!.",0

  is correct as regards changing one's name.  As per the reference he supplied, in the Republic of Ireland, all that is necessary is that one begins using the new name, and that it not be done for fraudulent purposes.  Doing so is extremely common - how many thousands of women, for example, take their husband's surname on marriage without getting their name changed by deed poll?  Changing one's name in this way is an entirely different thing from having one's Registration of Birth amended, where specific statutes apply.  From the GRO's website: """"Changes to the Register of Births are almost impossible to effect and generally are only done if it can be proved that a clerical or factual error was made at the time of registration.""""  So one can change one's name in common usage from, e.g., George to Jack, but George would remain on the Register of Births, unless you also changed it by deed poll.  My understanding on the case of the transsexual who wanted to have her birth registration amended was that she wanted the gender changed (though I'm open to correction on this).

The answer is Yes!
For example, It will be impossible to incorporate the pictures, (see pictures 1,2,3 and 4), in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and in the same time include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.
And honestly, do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including the research?

According to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my work as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.
If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.

Consensus means that every body must agree and I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether the people who are continuously deleting my reference are making a terribly wrong and stupid act? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and other contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

There is no consensus for a reverted edit that I made in this article (hereafter the “reverted edit”).  Therefore, I have not changed this article unilaterally back to my previous version, because that would be against consensus.

This reverted edit was reverted by KillerChihuahua (KC) who not only disagreed with it, but also said (in her edit summary) that the edit was disruptive.  I disagree with KC that the edit should have been reverted, for reasons already explained above.  I also disagree with KC that this edit was disruptive, and I will now fully and carefully explain why, for the record. This edit that KC reverted was clearly not redundant to any previous edits made anywhere else at Wikipedia, and thus this edit was not made by me in bad faith as part of any disruptive “edit war”.

This discussion of RCOG’s position on “choice” started at the article on fetal pain, and I moved it here for valid reasons.  At the fetal pain article, KC wrote: """"Please provide a source that this government institution is 'pro-choice' - abortion is legal in the UK, and that the official govt. chartered college are to make that safe is NOT pro choice.""""   I therefore investigated and learned that RCOG is not a government institution, that most of their members live outside the UK, that its governing documents do not specifically limit its activities, that many of its members do not have medical degrees, et cetera.  So, I concluded that the best place to deal with all of this would be here at the article on the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  Here at the RCOG article, I added quite a bit of info,    in addition to RCOG’s abortion stance. When I was at the fetal pain article and decided to move to this RCOG article, I repeatedly said so in the fetal pain discussion.   I did not sneak over here to try to avoid objections at the fetal pain article.

KC has elsewhere cited five diffs that she says prove this controversial edit was virtually the same as several contested assertions I had made previously. Here are KC’s five diffs: (1) in the fetal pain article, (2) in the fetal pain article, (3) in this RCOG article, (4) in this RCOG article, and (5) in this RCOG article.

None of these five previous edits cited by KC is the same (or virtually the same) as the reverted edit that sparked this controversy.  Both KC’s diff (1) and diff (2) show where I inserted a cite to support another editor’s assertion that RCOG is a “pro-choice group”.  KC pointed out very clearly at the fetal pain article that she did not think RCOG was a “pro-choice group” even though she thought RCOG could have a “pro-choice position” on particular issues:

There is no uncertainty or ambiguity that KC argued RCOG may have a pro-choice",0

Could you please explain why you deleted a sentence with two references without even giving a reason? 

""""In December 2013, Waters was again accused of antisemitism after an online interview in which he compared the treatment of Palestinians by Israelis to the treatment of Jews by Nazi Germany.[123][124]""""

  

 FWIW, I believe this to be WP:NOTNEWS and WP:COATRACK type stuff that really does not belong in a bio on Waters at this point, but lest someone accuse me of ownership I'll step back and let others decide.  (talk|contribs)  
I dont object to adding about the latest anti semite allegations but only when our way of doing this fits WP:NPOV which the current insertion absolutely FAILS to do, we must be balanced and not take one side or another (in this case the side of those attacking Waters was taken as the only side of the controversy we reported)♫  talk contribs 

In the process you deleted 2 references/citations one of them was his interview. What kind of """"balance"""" are you looking for when people are not able to read Waters? Could you please bring back the references? Personally i just added the link to his interview. Beside that everything in the sentence was true. You could easily re-write the sentence and leave the citations there. No. You just deleted everything. AND the citations. Unacceptable.   
This is a BLP bio and so what I did was in no way unacceptable but if you want to re-frame what you wrote in an NPOV way why not do so here on this page first, you need to write in a balanced way as an editor and not rail against others cos you didnt do so♫  talk contribs

I was talking to   
 Its properly sourced now, so there is no need to pile up cites per WP:CITECLUTTER. Also, I'll remind you about WP:NOTAFORUM. This is absolutely WP:COATRACK/WP:NOTNEWS material, IMO. We aren't here to follow Waters' every comment regarding Israel. Is this notable enough for a bio? Not likely, maybe, but we are already in WP:UNDUE territory regarding this controversy, IMO.

John's edit is exactly what I mean by a neutral take on the issue. Nikosgreencookie, it is your responsibility as editor to get this NPOV right, and in all your edits, its not the responsibility of any editor who may revert you♫  talk contribs

"The best description of this example is the POV of the Gnostics such as Marcion.
Essentially, they noticed apparant differences in God between the Old and New testaments. Also, they considered that the old testament God had moral failings - e.g. deliberately putting the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the garden and then telling Adam and Eve not to eat anything from it, and then not preventing the serpent, or the various other examples of condoning incest, murder, etc.
Their conclusion was that the god of the old testament (referred to as Yahweh) and the God of the new testament (referred to as God (in Greek)) were not the same. They further considered that not only was Yahweh evil, but Yahweh is the source of all evil, i.e. the devil. They considered the serpent to be the good god.
Obviously this was considered a very very very dangerous and extreme heresy by the early church, and their attacks on Marcion drip with vitriol.

I see this as an important issue that requires extreme caution. [I’m speaking generally as I haven’t had the time to try to analyze Yoyohooyo’s  specific assertions.] Of course the Massei report is biased. It’s trying to justify the court’s (prosecution) point of view. Whether or not it is deliberately MIS-leading is something we cannot prove or disprove. But by definition, it IS “leading”, i.e. it leads the reader to follow the judge’s reasoning. If the judge’s reasoning is incorrect (deliberately or not) or based on false assumptions, then the report is misleading. That would seem to be the reason for the policy on primary sources and in this case we have to follow not only the general guidance on primary sources, but the stricter rule: WP:BLP/Misuse of primary sources: Do not use trial transcripts and other court records, or other public documents, to support assertions about a living person. That seems pretty cut-and-dried. Maybe the report can be used to confirm what the court concluded, but anything more than that (including details that the court believes to be """"facts"""" in reaching its conclusion) would seem to be prohibited as they are """"assertions about a living person"""".  Demanding other RS’s, which may not exist, as an alternative to the Massei report is not a valid argument for using a prohibited source. At the risk of climbing on a soapbox, I will add that’s the problem with this article. We want to provide accurate, reliably-sourced facts; but too few facts are indisputably known and I fear that many of the sources we might like to rely on have been less careful in their scrutiny of officially-provided """"facts"""" (what the prosecution and court have allowed to be released) than we are trying to be here.

 Recent page moves (see also: unresolved discussion above regarding this issue) 
OK  I don't understand why this is an issue, unless you all figure that this article deserves some sort-of 'special exception' to Wikipedia's rules of article naming and precedent. If so inclined, click: French Jews, German Jews, Russian Jews, and so forth on in to perpetuity. ALL of these names REDIRECT to the """"History of the Jews in [country]"""" articles, i.e. they DO NOT have their own special article on this topic (even though, for whatever reason, THIS page on """"Jews and Judaism in the United States"""" IS indeed a separate entity from the """"History of the Jews in the United States"""" page, not to mention separate from the Lists of American Jews [also wrong titled, differs from category name], and separate from Category:Jewish Americans [correct category name]). DO YOU ALL NOW SEE WHAT A COMPLETE AND UTTER MESS YOU HAVE MADE OF THESE JEWS AND JUDAISM RELATED AMERICAN ARTICLES AND CATEGORIES because of all of the wayward and entirely unneeded article/category moves and counter-moves, renames and counter-renames?  I merely seek to fix (standardize) all of this, nothing more.  Please help me to do this, and please stop engaging in these senseless/childish edit wars and continuing to revert and/or disregard my good moves and valid information.

There are many article/category naming irregularities still out there (found in Judaism by country [maybe we start there?] such as Italian Jews, but I'm about to fix that), but we need to stick to ONE naming scheme for ALL Jewish articles, and so far the category naming scheme """"Jews and Judaism in [country]"""" (as opposed to """"History of the Jews in [country]"""") is the most widespread and used, thus it can be regarded as a precedent (or is one used for the category, one for the actual article?). The confusing part is that, like I just hinted at, in some cases we have """"History of the Jews in [country]"""" pages, along with """"Jews and Judaism in [country]"""" pages (plus tons of categories with same name, which User:IZAK has been standardizing to some extent), along with the list articles like List of German Jews, List of British Jews, and so forth. So, maybe we need to start a discussion and approve a policy of article name STANDARDIZATION and PRECEDENT than can be followed in the future as they relate to ALL of these disparate yet related pages (Jews/Judaism in [country], History of Jews in [country], List of [national] Jews, all related to the standard category naming scheme """"Jews and Judaism in [country]""""). Per User:IZAK's recent moves involving the Swiss and Norwegian Jew articles I thought that this was and has been the accepted norm/precedent, but now I am being reverted for moving this article to its similar name, yet of course no one objects to IZAK's moves at all. If I am doing something wrong here, by all means please let me know  however, I am just trying to improve the overall naming and organizational scheme of this article and indeed all of the Category:Jews and Judaism by country (Judaism by country) articles/categories as a whole.

Also...Jayjg, why do you keep reverting the List of Jewish Americans to List of American Jews even though ALL of the actual lists found in that master list are still named """"List of Jewish American [profession]"""" as they should be, a hold-over from the olden days when these article/category names weren't in such a state of disorganization and disarray?

There are many problems with that. See the article for Hayasa-Azzi. Most historians and linguists think that they spoke a Hurrian language. Looking for a linguistic link between Hayassa and Hay or Azzi and Azg is not what one would consider as a solid fact. We can mention with a citation that some believe that Hay and the name Haik are derived from Hayasa. Anything beyond this is speculation.,0

Regarding HeartBreaker, The Original Tribute to Pat Benatar, please forgive me for not fully understanding what makes this listed for deletion. Perhaps it's just a guiedlines issue? But, what speciffically makes any of the other tribute bands listed on the tribute act page any more notable than HeartBreaker to allow those pages inclusion? Is it the formatting? Unfortunately, I am new to the Wikipedia environment regarding editing and possibly need some direction on this? I came across the tribute acts pages and noticed The Iron Maidens, which is a local group with not as long a tenure in the tribute community as HeartBreaker, although definately notable, and they are incuded. But beyond The Iron Maidens are bands whos accomplishments pale in comparison to HeartBreaker. HeartBreaker IS a notable, respected and an acknowledged band of the tribute community as well as being one of the first of local tribute acts to appear in the L.A. area when the tribute phenomenon began during the late 90s, particularily with a female lead singer. That, in itself makes HeartBreaker a pioneer to the community. What other information or details do you suggest including, other that what is listed in the biography which is certainly not insignificant, in order to make this page more or as """"notable"""" than or as any of the other other listed tribute bands by Wikipedia standards, and to gain inclusion? Please advise. I have perused some of the other acts' pages linked to the tribute acts page and see only a few with significant notability, most have even fewer accomplishments and notariety than HeartBreaker, some I've never even heard of and certainly aren't known to our local tribute community, which definately expands beyond just the L.A. area. HeartBreaker has been written about and featured in reliable sources and is known for it's tenure, quality and respected within our tribute community, particularily since we are one of the longest running tributes AND are acknowledged BY the artist to whom we pay tribute, Pat Benatar and members of her band(s). We are the only band of any kind listed in her official web pages and have been joined by significant original members of her band. This in itself lends support to the tribute act pages. The histoy of the tribute act pages specifically points to acts who are joined to play with the artists to whom they tribute and further goes on the list bands on the page. Why is it not acceptable to list HeartBreaker and a biography of information to support the tribute act pages? We may not have as much notariety as The Iron Maidens but we certainly are not insignificant and definately are more notable that some of the listed bands. HeartBreaker was featured in a televised documentary about tribute bands on a major network and has been written about and listed is major publications. How can any of this not be notable when this is in regard to tribute bands?????? Please explain. Thank you.""",0
"""==Suggested merges==

The following articles have a lot of duplication with Japanese grammar. Either Japanese grammar should be sensibly sliced up and distributed, or these articles should be merged here.

 Japanese verb conjugations

Why do you want to merge this page into the already over-long Japanese grammar? This page is intended to be a comprehensive reference list of verb conjugations in Japanese. It will make Japanese grammar too long. The tables on Japanese grammar are illustrative, and the tables on Japanese verb conjugations are comprehensive.   

 Japanese consonant and vowel verbs

Don't merge this page. It is a reference page where I am going to put the lists from the sci.lang.japan FAQ. Please see the link.  

—  

 I want to merge them because there is needless duplication. I would be happy to discuss how to divide up Japanese grammar into a collection of smaller but more focused articles. Incidentally, please respond below instead of interspersing your responses, which makes the flow of dialogue impossible to follow. —  

 First you put a sign on the article I wrote suggesting a merge, and then you say you want to discuss breaking up the Japanese grammar article into smaller pieces, which is a contradiction. Please decide what you want to do before you start sticking merge signs on pages.  

 The merge is still the suggested course of action. Anyway, it appears that arguing with you would be fruitless. Do whatever you wish. —  

Thank you for your permission. I find the current """"Japanese grammar"""" article very hard to grapple with. There seems to be a lot of detail in some places and then great big gaps in other ones. For example there are lots of examples about """"jibun"""" and """"are/sore/kore"""" but on the verbs it says very little relatively speaking, and there is lots of rather dense stuff about historical Japanese and """"sumite"""" becoming """"sunde"""", and the use of the names like """"renyoukei"""" and """"kami ichidan doushi"""" which actually don't mean very much - basically it has too much terminology. I was originally thinking of editing  Japanese grammar into what I thought would be a better form, but after a few trial edits and test questions I felt rather concerned about the response I would get, so I decided to avoid trouble by doing minor edits only on the Japanese grammar page and creating supplementary articles for the things I wanted to add. I would like to aim for simplicity and unity and focus in the supplementary articles. I hoped it would be a reasonable compromise, and here even you suggest splitting the Japanese grammar page, but if you object to the articles I have made I suggest detailing the problems rather than merging. Also I wonder why you thought of merging my pages, when the page Japanese language has a grammar section which is extremely bloated, and really does need to be merged into Japanese grammar. If you want to merge something, I would suggest the most in need of merging is the great mass of untamed and unfocused edits on Japanese language#Grammar rather than my modest pages which are fairly well-focused and form a valuable supplement to this page in my opinion.

 Stem forms 

Hello, I wonder if there was some particular reason why the order of the stem forms does not follow the standard order of 未然・連用・終止・連体・仮定・命令?  Anything I read about these six forms always states the forms in that order (and if it is classical Japanese, 仮定 is replaced by 已然, the perfective), and in fact dictionaries simply state the six forms of a particular verb etc. in that order without specifying which is 未然, 連用 etc.  I think the forms here should be put in this standard order.   03:03, 2005 May 13 (UTC)

No objection from me. Go ahead! Incidentally, it would be more accurate to call izenkei the realis rather than the perfective. Note that the classical perfect forms -tari, -nu, etc. attached to the ren'youkei. Also cf. Shibatani pp. 221-225. — [[User:Kaustuv|",0

"""And this is what happens when you don't read books. As for Olga and Gilliard, their stories changed very, very much from the days in Berlin until January 1926. Olga said afterwards that """"she understood no Russian."""" Then, in a letter to Mordvinov, she writes:""""Curiously, she seems to understand Russian."""" She said """"She understood no English"""". Then Bella Cohen writes in her article in NY Times that she spoke in English to the invalid, and she answered back in English. Olga said: """"My nieces knew no German"""". And we have copy of a post card written by Tatiana already in 1909 showing good knowledge of German. We have schoolbooks from Anastasia showing that she took serious lessons in German. Olga said, I knew I was looking at a stranger. But in Berlin, she said: """"I believe in my heart that she is Anastasia"""", something she also repeated to Bella Cohen. She said: """"We showed her photos, and she did not react."""" Bella Cohen writes about how AA recognized Shura in a photo where Shura's face was hidden by a bell. Olga """"left Berlin with all hope extinguished."""" The very same day she writes her mother's secretary saying: """"How shall I tell Mama, this will kill her."""" (""""Mama"""" would have been devastated by knowing her grandchild was alive, that would mean that the others had perished.) And she tells Frau Rathlef about how she would like to help """"the little one"""", but has no money. Gilliard calls her """"La Grande Duchesse"""" in front of Dr. Rudnev, and afterwords said that the woman in Berlin had """"nothing in common with the Grand Duchess apart from the color of the eyes."""" And that is after his own wife has shown him the congenital bilateral hallux valgus, the scars on the shoulder and the finger. And according to Shura, she had the same hair color """"with the same wave"""". Clearly these two were lying, their own writings tell us that. , Olga wrote to the unknown woman after the visit: """"You are no longer alone, and we shall not abandon you."""" """"Longing to see you."""" """"I remember when we were together."""" Would she write this to a total stranger? Would she give her personal photo album to FS? I don't think so. And don't forget that Frau Rathlef sent her manuscript to Olga for verification, and got it back with the words that the description of the time in Berlin was """"quite corret.""""

 Peer Review 
I like how you've organized the wiki page. It's very logical, and has a lot of detail, that are all linked to other pages, which is great. 
However (there's more detail in the rest of the post) it would be helpful if you fleshed out your intro, and intros to other sections. Otherwise I have no idea for what information this page has to offer at first glance. The sections themselves are very dense with information, which is good, but it can also be a bit confusing with no diagrams as a visual aide. If you can find some diagrams for sections """"uORFs"""" and """"Reinitation"""" it would be helpful. 

Introduction:
""""differing mechanisms dependent on organism."""" sounds awkward. Also you should provide more detail on the different mechanism
General Structure:
Length: I like the example you give to demonstrate size difference. 

Role in Translational Regulation:
I think it would be helpful if you had a small overview section """"Role in Translational Regulation"""". The section is split up in a very logical way, but it feels a bit disjointed. The overview might help a person approach each section with a greater picture in mind. 
Prok: Is there a page that outlines the mechanism of Prokaryotic Translation? It would be a good idea to link that information to this section. You say """"many other proteins"""" are recruited, which opens the question of the actual process. 
It would be good if you include more details on how 5' UTR can be mutated, and what kind of defects it can lead to. 
It might also be a good idea if you include more information as to what model organisms were used to determine some of the experimental results.

Instead of being objective, he may take it personal and very often quotes WIKI rules, blocks as trolls, reports as vandalism etc. to win.

Its highly unfortunate that, people are becoming admins by doing minor edits and staying for longer periods on wikipedia. Once they get the adminship, the power corrupts these people.

""""According to the Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, a 1950 dissertation by Edward Price, a cultural geographer, documented that Melungeons were families descended from free people of color and mixed-race unions in colonial Virginia.[3] Beginning in 1995, the researcher Paul Heinegg has published extensive documentation of his research into numerous families of free people of color in the Upper South, beginning with those listed in the censuses of 1790-1810 in Virginia and North Carolina, whose descendants migrated into Kentucky and Tennessee. He found that most could be traced to free mixed-race families formed of descendants of unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia.[4] They migrated along with European American neighbors to frontier areas, where they found less restrictive racial conditions. In some cases, he found that descendants consistently """"married white"""", and had children of increasingly European-American or white appearance. Heinegg has frequently updated his book and online version of data.""""

Nothing in this mentions Melungeons The sources does not mention Melungeons either so this should be removed. We should only use stuff in a article about melungeons which is directly about Melungeons.  

The person who added this attempted to use """"free person of color"""" to mean african american when the law stated Free Person of color was not just african american, it was a catch all term. 

""""This Court among other things instructs the jury as follows. Persons that are known and recognized by the Constitution and laws of Tennessee, as free persons of color are those who by the act of 1794 section 32 are taken and deemed to be capable in law to be certified in any case what is in, except against each other or in the language of the statute """" all Negroes, Indians, Mulattoes, and all persons of mixed blood descended from Negro or Indian ancestors to the third generation inclusive though one ancestor of each generation may have been a white person, white bond or free"""".

Fine, but keep in mind that this is not solely a matter of being NPOV- this is also a matter of accuracy.  The Eastern Catholic Churches that are in communion with the Vatican are not properly referred to by the term """"Roman Catholic Chruch""""- only those who practice the Latin or Western Rite are.  Take a look at this FAQ on Eastern Catholiscim to see how the term is properly used: .  The only truely accurate way to refer to the church headed by the Vatican is the Catholic Church, and if referring to this church with this title is NPOV, then there is no way that this article can be NPOV and use these terms as accurate as possible.
I was aware that """"Catholic"""" also means universal and is a Mark of the Church- I have to admit that I was not aware that other sects of Christianity use the word """"Catholic"""" in their names.  It is for this reason alone that perhaps there is no really satisfactory way to resolve this issue, and perhaps it is truly best to incorrectly use the term """"Roman Catholic Church"""" to refer to the entire church that is in communion with the Vatican.  I guess in the end it just doesn't matter, so I probably won't press the point any further.

your list is very short, you don't even link it to the polish clans, most of the clan pages have the family names under their clan sites. also princes, barons, counts, etc, are church given titles, a prince is equal to the poorest noble, in every way. nobility was gifted by god, and witnessed by man, a king had the honor of giving a person their paper of nobility, he couldn't give nobility. in a family, a person can be adopted in nobility, be they will be under that family, not under the Sejm.

"WP:VG assessment
Well, this is definitely Start-class. The usual problems which Stub/Start articles have (fair use rationales, reference formatting etc) aren't there, which is great! Nevertheless, there's still some way to go to get this to B-class, but this can easily be attributed to the fact that the game's only been out for a week. Here are some ideas to improve the article:
You have some good screenshots, but one showing the actual gameplay (interface et al) would be useful.
The gameplay will be largely the same as EQ2, but it's still a good idea to include a brief overview and a link to EverQuest II#Gameplay. Information on new features could also be merged to this section.
Try converting the list of zones to paragraphed text, which is nicer to read.
To make the article easier to navigate, you might want to rename the History of Kunark section to Story and include any other plot details.
Lead needs expansion per WP:LS: summarise the entire article in three or four paragraphs.
Any information on the development of the expansion? When was it announced? Was it on show at any big game shows? Were there any slippages in release dates?
When enough reviews of the game have been released, create a Critical Reception section.

My apology if you find a personal attack in my more recent comment above. I have re-read it and can still find none. You """"argue that we should make the definition of polygon consistent with what the lay public is likely to encounter and study"""", while I believe that """"the elementary logic of physical objects is best used in the introductory lead"""". That looks like agreement to me. Where we seem to differ is that you regard this as calling for a Euclidean mathematical definition, while I do not believe that the lay person has sufficient mathematical appreciation for that to be appropriate to the article lead.
As to the actual content, the lead grew historically as a result of several contributors thrashing out our differing approaches. What emerged should not be treated lightly, or substantially edited without prior agreement. I am happy to discuss the rest of your  proposal, and no doubt others will chip in to help reach a consensus. I did restore a little of what you wrote, but in the mean time let us not play ping-pong with the page itself.
On the matter of references, Regular polytopes and Convex polytopes are widely-read works which can hardly be described as specialised: they are indeed precisely what this lay person encountered and studied. Some others which I referenced are original sources - which, out of respect to you as a professional mathematician, I would not pull away from drawing to your attention. Others do move beyond a Euclidean treatment, and were there simply to make the point which begins the subsequent paragraph.
More directly relevant is the issue that most lay people would regard a pentagram as a """"star polygon"""", recognised as such since the days of Archimedes but excluded by the definition you gave, which is more formally understood as a """"simple polygon"""". While mathematicians such as Grünbaum and yourself might choose to frequently omit descriptors such as """"simple"""" or """"convex"""" in treatments of these objects (Grünbaum explicitly, yourself implicitly), a general introduction to the subject can take no such luxury. The article lead should conform as far as is possible to the lay person's preconceptions, whereby polygons may be divided into those which self-intersect and those which do not.
With that proviso, if you have ideas for significant changes to the article lead, I would hope you can share them with us  first. — Cheers,  (Talk) 20:34""",0

Take a NIST 44 Class and learn how to build a weighbridge,  learn how to bond sensors to a load cell properly and see if you can actually MAKE a scale rather then just badmouthing everyone else's products.

 WIKIPEDIA IS COMMUNISM!!!! 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it h",1

Given the unique nature of comicbook material, we give them leeway on relying a good deal on primary sources.  It's only when those articles seeks something beyond a C, such as GA or FA status that third-party sources become imperative.  Now give, many of the minor superhero character pages out there are really stubs with little future, it's all about where you stand on the inclusionist/deletionist philosophy on Wikipedia.  Do you give leeway to small-interest articles in because we have nearly infinite resources, or do you hold everything to the rules?  Personally, I lean more toward keeps than deletes, except for extreme cases.

In any case, I Rictor may pass for GA.  You can check out a similar character I worked on and moved to GA (Anole (comics)).  That really go there because I trimmed through FCH, and had a lot of third party sources on some plot lines that involved him and the character's creation.  The layout for an FA article would probably cut through a lot of character history and focus on publication history.  It offends some people to see what they consider """"notable character history"""" cut, but if you want an accessible article, you have to do it.  Superman arguably has a ton of character history, but it's really just distilled down to the basic iconic things that others write about: Krypton, orphan, country boy, Metropolis, Louis Lane, Lex Luther, Justice League, etc.  I'm trying to find the time to do the same to Jean Grey.

Verifiability is only one content criterion. Neutral point of view is a core policy of Wikipedia, mandatory, non-negotiable, and to be followed in all articles.

"While I am not the one to question your 'protecting' a page or article whether or not it is an FA category, I want to point out at least one inaccuracy in the Western Chalukya page.... I pointed out to user Dinesh Kannambadi about one portion of text mentioned in the article on the Western Chalukyas. The said portion is copied in here for your information and consideration as an admin:

The overall effort by Somesvara IV to rebuild the Chalukya empire failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Somesvara IV into exile in Banavasi 1189. After the fall of the Chalukyas, the Seunas and Hoysalas continued warring over the Krishna River region in 1191, each inflicting a defeat on the other at various points in time.[44] This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.[45]

In the above passage, while it may be ok for giving info on kingdoms in western deccan or deccan whose mutual antagonisms filled history annals.... I feel that mentioning the demise of the Cholas (who did so in 1279/1285 AD) in the Chalukya page who got eclipsed in 1190 WHICH IS ALMOST 90 YEARS PRIOR TO THAT OF THE CHALUKYAS, is quite inappropriate.

Mr.Kannambadi also mentions that the Chalukyas convincingly eclipsed the Cholas after the Cholas lost Vengi is quite untrue. This is because Vengi was lost by the Chalukyas to the Cholas themselves under Vikrama Chola for after winning Vengi in 1119 or 1118, Vikramaditya expired in 1125 or so and was followed by very weak successors and the Chalukya capital itself was lost for around 30 years from 1136-1140 (courtesy, Ancient India by K.A.N.Sastri, 1956 edition). So what does he mean there, by winning Vengi and keeping it for 6-8 years the Cholas were convincingly eclipsed by the Chalukyas... Does it mean that we are to believe that sustaining a victory for 6-8 years enables an empire to claim glory or feeling that their opponents were convincingly eclipsed.  I know Kannambadi will also speak about jingoism and that Hoysalas too won Gangavadi from Cholas, but pls. remind him that the same was prior to the Chalukyas conquering Vengi.  I am sure you will be very well acquainted with these facts in case you have in-depth knoweldge of Indian History especially that of South India.

 Comments from RHB 

I am approaching this as someone who knows very little about the subject. I will give some high-level comments mainly on structure and content. There are copyediting and prose issues as well, but it is probably worthwhile to tackle the general problems before going into specifics. Before I start, one general point that you will see often in my comments is that there are at times new subjects that are suddenly introduced. Although wikilinks help, a clause or a few words of explanation would smooth the flow of reading for a person not familiar with the subject.

Background to the mission
This section seems a little long relative to the rest of the article. Unless there is a significant expansion planned for the rest of the article, I would recommend reducing this section. There are small details that do not add very much to the Augustine story, e.g., the origin of St Martin’s Church, the fair-haired slaves theory, the pope writing to various kings.
Bede is suddenly introduced without explanation.

Arrival and first efforts
The mission turning back to Rome is not explained. Is there a significance to what happened?
It says “…on the one hand… on the other hand…” but the two items mentioned do not seem to be in opposition as expected when this phrasing is used.
Augustine established first at Canterbury. Since he was the originator, it might be good to give a reason why he chose the location.
The Archbishop of Arles is suddenly introduced. Who is he? Was he based in Arles (in modern-day France) or in Kent? The existence of an Archbishop implies a significant Christian population existing on British soil. This then brings more questions to mind.
It says """"That Christmas…"""". But what year is that?
The king became a saint after his death, but the sentence may be in the wrong place. Did the king die shortly after Augustine's arrival?
In the same paragraph, some information of the existence of Christians before Augustine's arrival is given. This info should go before the discussion of Augustine's arrival.
Mellitus and Justus are suddenly introduced without explanation.
The sentence """"A theory by the historian S. Brechter…"""" is either a run-on sentence or is incomplete.

Additional work
After the first sentence describing the two episcopal sees, there is a sudden jump to after 1066 and a discussion of a cathedral. How are they linked? Also what cathedral is it? The description of the archeology seems out of place in the """"Additional work"""" section. Is it meant to show that Augustine managed to build new churches?
If Aethelbert was only the King of Kent, how was he able to summon bishops outside his realm?
There is a sudden introduction of the tonsure.

Further success
Concerning """"temples and usages"""" is that """"temples and their use""""? The """"former… latter"""" construct does not work very well here.
Concerning the quote """"whoever wishes…"""", who said that?

I would recommend reading the article out loud. I think you will find some sentence structures that seem a bit complex or difficult to understand. Following the corrections, a good copyedit/prose check is needed. I give as an example, the sentence """"As to why Pope Gregory…"""" could be made better as in """"Nothing is mentioned in the sources on why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission"""".

I hope this has been helpful.   """,0

Admiration for Khrushchev, a man who had nuclear missiles pointed at the United States:
""""a reformer and fascinating character..."""" page 162, My Life, hardcover.

Nikita Khrushchev was a reformer given the fact that he replaced Stalin.  He was also fascinating.  By making these statements, there is no indication that someone is a Communist.  I admire Steve Yzerman, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't make me a hockey player.

Admiration for Karl Marx:
Clinton gives an adorable story about visiting the grave of Karl Marx in London while plotting his """"conscientious objector"""" status to avoid serving his country in the Vietnam conflict.  Evidently he had a problem with putting an end to the communist-led genocide in Vietnam.

How many conscientious objectors were there to the Vietnam war?  Thousands?  I don't know the fact.  As for going to the grave of Karl Marx, it is a tourist site.  It does not make someone a communist.

There is furthermore a cute anecdote about visiting the USSR while that state was developing and distributing weapons to kill Americans in Vietnam and elsewhere, see pages 167-171, My Live, hardcover.

Cute anecdote?  I'm glad a future leader of the US visited the USSR to learn about it.  We were not at war with the USSR at the time, he had a legal visa to enter the country, he did not help build the weapons, etc.  

There are lies about Richard Nixon all throughout this book.  He accuses Nixon of being a """"segregationist"""" even though his administration started affirmative action and the Minority Business Development Agency within two months of coming into office.

I think Congress put Affirmative Action into law.  A lot of politicians in the 60's were segregationists.  And if Clinton made an error in his biography, wow, I'm pretty sure that never happened in the past.

Clinton also fails to mention that the Republicans began the civil rights movement immediately after the Civil War (during which they led the Union armies) and out-voted the Democrats on every significant piece of civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s: the civil rights acts of '57, '60, '64, '65, and '68.

After the Civil War, the Republicans were the progressive party and the Democrats were the party of the South.  Ancient History.  As for the more recent Civil Rights acts, Northern Liberals of both parties ensured the acts were passed.  And Lyndon Johnson basically flogged his party with the body of JFK to force passage of these laws.  The Southern Democrats who fought the acts are now Republicans.  Wow.

The Republicans out-voted the Democrats in favor of these bills by margins of about 20 to 25 percent despite Clinton's dishonest caricature of Republicans as """"segregationists.""""

See Above.

Moreover, he accuses Nixon of being a traitor on page 141 of My Life.  Well, at least Nixon did not abandon his country at a time of war and never criticized the United States on foreign soil.

I'm an ex-Navy officer, and I've criticized this country.  I'm glad he did.  The Vietnam war took the lives of too many kids, it was poorly run, etc. etc.  

Clinton wrote about his admiration for Hispanic people in """"My Life.""""  Recently, Al Gore went to Saudi Arabia to say that Muslims are being terrorized in the U.S. by the Bush administration.

Huh?  You see something wrong with Hispanic people?  And what's Al Gore got to do with your rant about Clinton?

But it didn't seem to bother these civil rights champions when they sent a ridiculous commando squad to seek out Elian Gonzalez, a seven-year-old LEGAL immigrant who committed no crimes while living with his family in Miami.

Discussed that.  You were wrong.

Lucky 6.9,
I noticed that you've speedied this (and one other) album while at the same time placing a brief comment on the user page.

Do you think that this was the best course of action?  I'd ask you to compare the message I left with yours, and also ask that you restore these stubs.  We want to encourage people to write good stubs, don't we?  Deleting it outright doesn't do that.

(t)(c) 

This came out bitchier than I intended, sorry.  With the """"no artist"""" stubs (which drive me crazy) I usually find that the person who created them edits the artist's page just before or after, and often add the link in myself.  Thanks for restoring those, (t)(c) 

 Please 

Referring to the RfA nomination.   (talk)  

 THANK YOU SO MUCH 

For nominating me on RfA.  Have this beautiful jewel for my thank you.

Take care,   (talk)  

BTW, something went wrong.  Wikipedia:Requests_for_admminship/V._Molotov needs to be moved to fix the typo, but it can't be moved because there's an article in the way.  Looks like someone needs to delete Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/V._Molotov and then do the move.   (talk) 

 Your message 

Hi, you left this message on my talk page:
Thanks for experimenting with Wikipedia. Your test worked, and has been reverted. Please use the sandbox for any other tests you want to do. Take a look at the welcome page if you would like to learn more about contributing to our encyclopedia. Thanks. - Lucky 6.9 

It's difficult to tell whether you are being sarcastic or are mistaken. What experiment? I cannot find any edits or original articles of mine that you have reverted.

Regards,
 

It's a shame you felt it necessary to revert as """"experimentation"""" what was obviously an article (albeit a stub). As you will see from my history, I am new to Wikipedia but have enjoyed creating and editing a number of articles about some fairly hefty topics. It occurred to me that someone who enjoys wikipedia (such as myself) ought to be referred to as a wikipedophile. A google search reveals no fewer than 132 instances of the word on the net. If other neologisms such as """"leet"""" are to have articles, why not this one? Why not at least leave the article there for others to discuss rather than annihilating it unilaterally?

 

So, you deleted my article because you decided not enough people would be interested in it? That's as good an argument for keeping the article: nobody interested, nobody sees it; someone interested, someone finds it. No harm done. QED. Ah, but in that case, no self-aggrandising administrator satisfaction, and no opportunity to post supercilious mesages about the sandbox. It is easier to destroy than to create. Enjoy.  

OK, I will leave the subject - it is hardly a fair argument when one of us has the power to silence the other on a whim - but as an admin you will perhaps wish to know that you have discouraged me from contributing further to Wikipedia. My brief edit history will show me a valuable contributor, and I had been inspired by the """"be bold in editing"""" tenet of Wikipedia. Alas, this spirit is evidently mired in the usual unaccountable, pseudopolitical hierarchies, fiefdoms and cliques that invariably beleaguer such online efforts. Adieu.  

The neologism is far from the point. I am reluctant to contribut",0

Page protection
Keilana, can you please explain why you have semi protected the page Huma Abedin ? You have stated vandalism which is clearly not the case! Please see Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard where the matter is being dealt with ! Can you explain your actions ? I understand I am new here but it was one of the first pieces of information i have cont. to wikipedia there has been no decision made, I can not understand your actions !

Having now had the rules for vandalism explained to me I believe you have abused your power as my contib. clearly dosent fit any of the terms ? I ask you to reaccess your actions.

The decision was made at Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Huma_Abedin_.28edit.7Ctalk.7Chistory.7Clinks.7Cwatch.7Clogs.29. Its common practice during an edit dispute such as this for an uninvolved admin such as Keilana to semi-protect the page to reduce the intensity of the dispute. In any case, from the tone of Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard#Gossip_magazines_as_reliable_sources it seems that semi-protection was the right call to stablize the article while discussion continued there and on the talk page of the reliability of sources. MBisanz talk

I will also ask you to explain you relastionship to those who have sort to remove the information ? I would also like to know why you have changed you id ? thanks I will be adding this information to the talk page and any were else i find help ! I also note you did not add the fact the matter was being listed to protection page to the talk page of the article ?

I did not create the name of the page in regards to gossip mag tittle had you read the info you would understand Hillary Clinton was interviewed for the article.

To request unprotection, please go here Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Current_requests_for_unprotection. To ask for Keilana to be examined(?) I'd wait for her to respond here, and if your not satisfied, there is the Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard. I leave the personal inquiries for Keilana to answer is she desires to. MBisanz talk  
Responded on the editor's talk, thanks MB. Keilana|Parlez ici  
I would like to know how the article was brought to your attention I would also advise you that i have posted this information on the talk page of the article.

Hello, Sorry I couldn't attend to your concerns earlier. I semi-protected the page (here) because of the reasons stated there. As it is election season in the United States, articles about prominent political figures such as Mrs. Clinton are particularly vulnerable, hence the protection. There was a dispute over the reliability of sources, and I protected the article to cool the dispute. Protection isn't an endorsement of the current version, I have no ulterior motive. (see here for protection policy/information). In general, an admin doesn't need consensus to protect a page when a dispute is ongoing. Is there a problem with my administrative actions?

Hello 71, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thanks for the question. One of the most basic rules here is that information in articles must be """"sourced"""" to a """"reliable source,"""" which is explained here: WP:RS. In the case of the Montana edit that you made, all the published sources list Joe's birthplace as New Eagle, Pennsylvania. If you have a published source that says Butte, Montana, you would have to insert it after the edit that you make. One way to do this is to click on the open book icon above the editing window to the left of """"Advanced."""" A dialogue box will appear in which you can paste the URL for your source, or you can list the publication. The preferred method for sourcing, though, is listed here: WP:CT.

Unfortunately, insider information like knowing JM's son cannot be used as a source. Sources must be reliable and published, as above. I have some firsthand experience with this. One of my younger brothers is Terry Moran, and for several years the Wikipedia article had the wrong birth year for him. This was because the ABC News website had the wrong year - but I could not change the year and say """"he's my brother and I know when he was born.""""

1. Removed the info on Falcon X Heavy and Falcon XX, since those are just proposed concepts that haven't yet reached nowhere near the project stage. 2. Removed the info stating that Saturn INT-21 had one launch. It has never flown, the booster used for Skylab was an actual Saturn V with the 3rd stage modified into Skylab itself. The entry for Saturn INT-21 should probably be deleted altogether, but unlike two heavy Falcons it was under development coming much closer to becoming an operational vehicle, so I'm not sure. 3. Added clarification to Space Shuttle entry that it is regarded here as an integrated launch system, and not a standalone heavy booster, also removed the note stating:  'Like Soviet Energia-Buran system, despite of integrated design of rocket and orbiter, US Space Shuttle may be comparatively considered as launcher for such superheavy payload as manned spaceplane. But it should be noted that the orbiter could not hold more tha 25,000 kg.'  Such reasoning is not entirely justified. It can be considered as such only with serious reservations, since Shuttle's Orbiter acts de facto as a returnable third stage which cannot be replaced with anything else and has to be brought back to Earth, whereas other boosters can hypothetically (or practically, like Saturn V - Skylab case) have the load they put in LEO modified.  And certainly the Shuttle system cannot be part of this comparative list based on similarity with Energia-Buran (the note says 'like Soviet Energia-Buran system') since Enegia booster could be adapted to carry basically any appropriately configured and balanced payload piggybacked on its side, not just the orbiter.",0

Primary sources that have been reliably published (for example, by a university press or mainstream newspaper) may be used in Wikipedia, but only with care, because it is easy to misuse them.

Without a secondary source, a primary source may be used only to make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is verifiable by a reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge. For example, an article about a novel may cite passages from the novel to describe the plot, but any interpretation of those passages needs a secondary source.

Do you believe that the primary sources have been reliably published? If so, they may be used in Wikipedia?
Do you believe that I have interpreted the primary source or misrepresented what that source says in a summary? If so, can you supply an example?

"History of Palestine national football team
We should show both viewpoints and matches claimed to be the first internationals played by Palestine or Israel in 1934 and 1953 if we want to be righteous and give a civilized image for Wikipedia. Note that the British mandate used the term Palestine predominately (not Israel).

I as a Palestinian try and wants to be neutral as much as I can, however when it comes to stealing my country's sport history, I became very angry and I feel injustice. According to many sources, a part of them says that Palestine came to existence in football for the first in 1928 and played vs Egypt in the World Cup Qualification, and the other part says that the Palestinian Football Association was inherited by the Israeli one in 1948. We can not be 100% sure which part is right so that requires to follow both parties to not disappoint any people from Palestine and Israel as well as avoiding editing wars that have occurred in the past.

That is why you decry my contributions and call them “sweeping generalization” or try to dismiss them as  Islamophobia. Are views contrary to Christianity Chistianophobia? Do we have anyone crying Judaismphobia, Hinduphobia or Buddhistphobia? Why only Muslims make that claim? It is to silence any voice of opposition.

Dear Q, I know all this. My main concern was to change the dead wikilink into one that linked to Albert. I know that his title was King of the Romans but I think it is common WP pratice to use the term """"King of Germany"""" for that respective office to avoid confusion. Also, to say that there was no Germany at that time is wrong - there was a German Kingdom that was part (in fact the primary part of the Holy Roman Empire. And Albert was King of that Kingdom. I hope you understand.  (smile back) 

I rather disagree with you, but in a friendly way (I hate edit-war nonsense). I think it's possible to create links without necessarily making page titles—and there really are some atrocious ones about ('Ladislas the Posthumous' being one of them, in my opinion)—appear on the page in question. 

It is certainly possible and reasonable to call Albert """"King of the Germans"""" or """"German King"""" (the Germans themselves use the term """"Römisch-deutscher König"""", which covers it nicely. But even here on English Wikipedia, where there are many mistakes in this matter, the term """"King of Germany"""" is rarely used. Of course there was a Germany at that time in the sense of a German-speaking volk,  but there was not a German kingdom in the sense of a political state ruled by a royal government (when a later King of the Romans, Ferdinand I, tried to administer Hungary and Bohemia from Vienna, he was rebuffed— and he wouldn't have even tried that much in principalities where he was not the dynastic prince, such as Saxony or Brandenburg); the nearest thing to a German kindom, the Carolingian kingdom of the East Franks (even that has been called the Kingdom of Germany only as a back-formation), had fragmented fairly quickly into a group of states with their own princes (in the case of Bohemia, an actual king). Albert II is an interesting case because in his purely German-speaking territories he was only a duke. His kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary, though part of the Holy Roman Empire, were largely non-German, which is another reason why Rex Romanorum is correct and not """"King of Germany"""".

The English Wikipedia article on the subject is very inaccurate, announcing the academically unjustifiable decision to use the term """"Kingdom of Germany"""" for clarification's sake. In my opinion, having had this stuff drummed into me at university, where I had to read texts in Latin and German, that doesn't so much clarify as blur the issue. The title """"King of the Romans"""" may be difficult, and so may the idea of a group of independent German (and non-German) states within the Holy Roman Empire, but the readers of Wikipedia, in my opinion, shouldn't have history revised for them to make it fit the modern world (and Austria still isn't the same country as Germany anyway). Fortunately, the  articles on this subject on German Wikipedia use the correct terminology. """,0

 Response to the lies in your RFC TAB 

HiTAB 

I posted this response to your RFC on Canaen.TAB I believe you removed it.

I would like to point out that in British English the word nark is non-pejorative and I understand that it has an objective meaning something akin to a """" snitch """" in American. That is, meaning someone that makes, often erroneous, allegations to authorities in order to personally benefit themselves in some way.TAB 

The funniest thing for me is that you are busy digging a hole in your own canoe because your allegations are lies. You are entirely wrong. I know this because I know who I am and I know with whom I have and have had connections and I take a very minor little offence at being accused by the likes of you of being something I am not. I state """" very minor little offence """" because you and your views genuinely are so unimportant.TAB 
You are an individual of very little decency and integrity. I do not state this as an insult but as an objective statement. You have been told on many occasions that I have no connection with this or these other individuals and yet you not only continue to go on making such allegations but you even use them as the ground to make an attack on another individual.TAB 
Don't worry, Karma will come and get you in its own time.TAB 
 TAB 
 ==User conduct RFC==TAB 

Please be advised that I have filed a user conduct RFC on you. It can be found  here. Cheers,  TAB 

Just out of interest, who do you think this nark  is and why is he so motivated to go about doing what he is doing? I put this record up in the open for you and them to see because I have no and have had no connection with you nor any of the journal pages and, frankly, I take offence at being called a meat or sockpuppet of yours when I am not. I am sure that you are just or even more upset as being accused of a connection with me when you have none.TAB 

Unfortunately though, that is the depth of 's lies and the shallowness of 's integrity.TAB 
 Where he has no grounds he invents them and he is, oh, so clever at playing WikiTricks with all these technical terms and methods.TAB 
I am starting to feel like a Jew in Nazi Germany being hunted down, connected to individuals which I have no connection with and their so-called crimes and accused of crimes which are not mine.TAB

-TAB:For the record - and let them love every minute of their persecution syndrome, let them avidly copy and paste and make little weblinks to this as they are so good at Wikitricks - I am a vegan of 20 years or more standing and, arguably, MacDonald of Clanranald. I became involved in editing the vegan article before you returned to it recently. I am entirely responsible for kicking this whole thing off because I refused to let  get away with his ridiculous domination of the article and I put  in the same category for his anorexic stuff.TAB 

From my point of view, my objections are largely literary. The article became too bloated and required editing down. It is merely meant to be a definition of what vegan is. I don't see any point in actually engaging in those that oppose veganism. I don't even support vegan's trying to counter counter-vegan propaganda on the Wiki.

"""

I blieve the translation from the press office is very good. For someone who is not German this may not be clear, but the first paragraph states intentions, not facts. In Germany there are still people who physically hurt other people and (very few) state authorities who do not act against this, so I believe using is may be confusing. If you want to do a literal translation, the upper version is closer to the original, while the press office version is closer to the meaning.  

 Diverse errors and unencelopedic context use 

I would like to ask this whole article to be checked through. While most of it seems all right, there are passages that make no sense, lack imporatant information or are plain wrong. Examples: First paragraph of Drafting process is
The outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Germany cost humanity approximately 62 million people, or 2.5% of the world population. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, genocide (in particular, the Holocaust), massacres; and aerial bombing.
While the numbers may or may not be correct, what is the purpose of this paragraph? The people who died and especially the people who did not die because of the war but because of the Holocaust are very important for the way to Grundgesetz was written. But there is no connection made. The next paragraph does not make reference to this and mentions the necessity to keep history from repeating itself in a much more neutral way. Later on:
Any war could and should be categorised as an """"atrocity"""" but the war that Nazi Germany started brought a scale of atrocity never previously known and the statistics of World War II clearly qualify it, by far, as the most heinous atrocity in all recorded history....
Unverified claim, clearly anti-German. The figures I heard suggest that both Stalin and Mao had a higher death toll than Nazi-Germany. Correct, most of their dead were in their own country, but I do not see how that would make it any better.
...and created thereby in Germany the legal situation within which any association of persons that, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their members or adherents, seek to undermine or abolish this constitutional order is simply illegal, and which assigns to all Germans the absolute right and duty** to resist any person seeking to undermine or abolish this constitutional order, because this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of the 62 million casualties which brought the outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Hitler’s Germany.
While it is unclear where this text comes from, it does not seem to be a quote. I do not believe that this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of 62 million casualties is something that should be claimed in Wikipedia if it is not a direct or indirect quote of some political, moral or other authority. There is also context missing the the right and duty to resist. Violence by the people is only intended as a last resort and is illegal if there is functional police or military loyal to the consitution to deal with the situation.
Directly below the list with senseless emphasis, there is the claim that the German consitution contains blasphemy. Huh? The preamble contains a direct reference to god, other than that there is a rule that religion and state must not interfere in each others buisiness. I am not seeing any blasphemy there. At that time, Germany was a fairly religious state. To sum it up: I believe there was some editor here that wanted to make modern Germany look bad by applying non neutral wording and some unverified claims. The german version of this article seems much better and (logically) is checked much more often than this one. I suggest either having someone who not only read the whole Grundgesetz, but also has significant political and historical knowlege check this article for further inaccuracies or using the german version, which I believe is often checked by people who know the subject, to check this one through. There should be sources to every claim and despite the atrocities in the third reich, wording should be neutral and the crimes of the Nazis should only be mentioned in a context where it makes sense.

Back in December 2012  added an unsourced history section,  and four subsequent edits. I can't see that the Adolf Stieler map should indicate the island being Iranian, and have removed it. I fail to find any sources that confirm what was written, and have hatted the section here in case anyone can source it. 

The island had been under Persian control until the early 20th century. After 1908, the UK controlled the island along with the other British-held islands in the Persian Gulf, including what is today the UAE. In the late 1960s, Britain transferred administration of the island to the British-appointed Sharjah, one of the seven sheikdoms that would later form the UAE.

The grammar has been updated

I took the time to update the grammar and rearrange some of the sentence structure. One person took the time to point out a """"General Discussion"""" web forum that is definitely not official, but I did not delete that information, like I probably should have. Instead, I simply pointed out that Midway's highest ranking authoritytheir CEOhas officially confirmed that Midway will Publish Unreal Tournament 2007 for the Xbox 360. Although Epic currently does not acknowledge that they are developing an Xbox 360 version of Unreal Tournament 2007, that definitely does not prevent Midway from Publishing the game for the Xbox 360. 

Midway could easily develop the game for the Xbox 360 on their own, or they could outsource the development to another developer. Let's not forget that the PC is the primary development platform for Unreal Tournament 2007. Midway or an outsourced developer could easily port the game to the Xbox 360 because the Xbox 360 is so easy to program games for, since it is so similar to the PC. However, the Playstation 3 is very difficult to develop games for, and it likely requires skilled developers such as Epic to work on both the PC and PS3 versions at the same time. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that Midway CEO David Zucker has made it 100% clear that Midway will Publish Unreal Tournament 2007 for the Xbox 360, regardless of who the Developer of the game is.

"proposed deletion of sentence in intro 

This sentence appears in the introductory paragraph. I propose that it should be deleted on the grounds that it is neither a fair summary of Dr. Craig's theology nor does it contain any information which is sufficiently noteworthy to be included in the introductory paragraph. We've not mentioned Craig's debates in the introductory and the few comments about Molinism that he's made are in no way more significant than his debates. Also, the sentence is oddly written and may not make sense to a novice encountering these topics for the first time.

In theology he has also defended Molinism and the belief that God is, since Creation, subject to time.

How much money was exchanged for this interview? And was this interview constructed to conflict prison officer Pascoe's claim that he fired a shot that killed Hodson? In the opinion of this nun, Ryan no longer wanted to live. But this nun was not a psychologist, so how could she possibly come to that conclusion?  
Obviously, it seems Ryan's execution was more of a state-assisted suicide. 
In relation to this alleged confession, Ryan didn't actually say he shot Hodson, but allegedly, said he shot to wing not to kill. Ryan,  obviously in an extremely confused mental state, (as any person would be prior to being killed by the Government), could have been talking about his past kangaroo shooting events or any other event for that matter. After all, a mentally confused person does not talk in a rational manner. 
Besides, nobody else close to Ryan claimed he no longer wanted to live. None of Ryan's family members claim he said such a thing. In any case, any person who states they no longer wish to live should be immediately evaluated for mental illness, So, why wasn't a psychiatrist called to treat Ryan for possible mental disorders, depression and suicidal thoughts? Why the push to execute Ryan if he was mentally unstable, hence, no longer wanted to live?
Legal professionals will confirm that alleged confessions and alleged verbals are not legally acceptable as """"evidence of guilt"""". Many prisoners have been later aquitted of murder after allegations of verbals and confessions. There must be scientific forensic evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In Ryan's case there was none - nothing! To make aftermath allegations against Ryan, decades after his execution when he cannot defend himself, are vile, immoral, unethical and complete mockery to the justice system, to the dead Ryan, and to his innocent family members. The police corruption uncovered by various Australian Royal Commissions is enough to question the validity of Ryan's alleged verbals.
Why would Ryan make all these alleged confessions, then in the eleventh-hour write to various people; I state most emphatically that I am not guilty of murder"""" In addition, Father Brosnan put an end to all these aftermath unproven and unconfirmed allegations in February 2003, when he was interviewed on ABC National Radio, shortly before his death. Father Brosnan always believed Ryan was innocent.

First I'm a little obsessive with unfounded criticism. Sorry about that, It makes me long-winded. I'm not at all obcessive  with this topic- which I could give two deuces about- once it is properly sourced and defined.  

User:Brangifer has a lot to say about me.  Perhaps one example of unreliable sourcing as described to show good faith? It shouldn't be difficult. I assumed good faith and ask for one example, never got.  No shred of anything to indicate good faith on his part except a WP:policy-based assumption. Is it an assumption of bad faith to ask for proof or evidence that should not be difficult to provide? Is is bad faith not to provide it? It not a search warrant I'm seeking.  He implies I have a pattern of it.  I have seen zero evidence to the contrary, so as far as I'm concerned, to me his edit make him comes across as a full-blown, straight-up liar.   

Read that carefully as I didn't say he is a liar (name-calling). It's just that without one specific example for his accusations against me, he surely come across as one with his recent edit. I've been assured this is not an attack and is an acceptable use.

""""What you have provided on the article talkpage has been viewed by other editors as advocacy of a conspiracy theory.""""  
Let me get this straight,  Rule#1 is that A conspiracy theory can have no evidence. Rule#2 There is none to have that's even remotely related. Rule#3 So none can be considered.  
It's a made up theory. However, (paranoid) people's crazy theories are usually based on some remote kernel of truth.  Kernels of truth in wild theories have documentation. It does not validate the theory and there is not reason not to consider current beliefs against past history. The source says 1970s which I pointed out, gets added to the entry, source disappears. WP is full of rule followers who can't think logically or realize when they are being made to lay down in the $hit sources they picked for themselves.

I provided public domain information documented by and available from unimpeachable sources as a hey look at this and tell me if it's it related to this subject (It is).  Then the accusations start.  Unfounded ones. 
I'm not advocating for any conspiracy. Not one of those four links did either.  The info was 40-50 years old.
Seen as advocacy of a conspiracy? 
Which conspiracy? 
And which other editors?  
Problem with sourcing? Which source?    
I need an example to show good faith.  This is not court but show me that the accusations have merit. With out one example, It proves they knew what they said about me they knew to be untrue. The concerns mentioned are made up any without any merit. Hence- the lie. 

It is a personal attack because I told him that these accusations were offensive to me, yet it continued.  My exact words were """"To accuse me of being a believer in this crap is offensive to me and is taken as personal attack."""" I told this person numerous times that I am not a believer yet he continues to accuse me of being some nutjob is an attack.  """"Believers"""" don't cite reliable verifiable unimpeachable sources or say the theory is complete BS. 

Posting that my sourcing is bad when there is nothing to show that, is an attack. It was not in good faith. It's made up because not one example can be provided to substantiate it or the good faith intent. If it was good faith, one example should have been able to be provided in order demonstrate and substantiate his good faith. If we had that, there never would have been a problem with what was said.  The comment is simply untrue as I've stated and he knew it. This is no difference of opinion as he has characterized it.

Look at it from my point of view, Would you like if I said?  
Go edit somewhere else. 
You are a full blown believer and pusher of the chemtrail conspiracy theory and your use of unreliable sources to do it doesn't exactly help your credibility?

If I have zero evidence how can I say it in good faith or without attacking you? 
You've said """"Baldly stating that another editor who has commented in good faith is a liar is unequivocally a personal attack, and is not tolerated."""" How else does one responded to a bald-faced lie?
A barefaced (or bald-faced) lie is one that is obviously a lie to those hearing it.

My intent, since I came upon this piece o' crap entry was to hold other editors' feet to the fire to ensure good sourcing.  The entry needs definition and the current one is based on Stieg.  There is a source that has been in use for (7?) years that each of these expeienced editors have insisted on using and reverting back to. Rather than hold feet to fire -because no one will let m",0

Without a metatheory, one does not have a truth predicate, which complicates things for realism, because the whole point of that philosophy is that sets really do exist and actually do have the properties ascribed to them. One could argue in favor of a disquotational definition of truth, but that merely pushes the problem around, leading to the same problems as full second-order semantics for arithmetic.   Also, not having a metatheory means that one must treat set theory differently than other branches of mathematics, such as group theory or linear ordering theory. This seems like a difficult distinction to justify. 

I do think that the """"no metatheory"""" interpretation of ZFC (or Zermelian set theory, if you prefer that) is somewhat common, because it is one way of avoiding the issue that what is called V in the object theory cannot be distinguished from a set in the metatheory. One consequence of my original point is that it would also be coherent to interpret this no-metatheory language merely as a way of making statements from the viewpoint of a person inside a particular model of set theory. Moreover, this interpretation is entirely compatible with the viewpoint that there is an objectively-defined collection consisting of all sets, if no additional meta-level principles such as the ability to force over V are added. However, if one already viewed """"all sets"""" as merely a façon de parler with no objective referent, as I think you are proposing, then it's not clear why one sort of disquotation (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets"""") is better than another (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets in the model at hand""""). — Carl ( · talk) """,0

You are Wiki-Lawyering, and frankly if anybody is doing the harassing here, it's you.  You have repeatedly minimized my arguments by claiming that I am Sockpuppeting, Meatpuppeting, and making personal attacks when I am attacking the material of the article and its source.  
'You are passive aggressive' is not an egregious personal attack, and 'you didn't read what I wrote and you are being deliberately obtuse' isn't a personal attack at all.  (Seriously, How is """"You're deliberately not reading what I wrote"""" possibly offensive to anybody?)  
I didn't come here to create drama, I didn't claim that I did.  I claimed that a particular website made me aware of something on wikipedia that I thought was wrongly included in an article.  I've made legitimate criticisms, and my comments are directly responsible for the creation of the Crucifixion in Art page.  I argued civilly enough and generated enough consensus among the majority of wiki users to remove the offending material from the original Crucifixion page and have it moved to a new page.  When I got around to looking at that new page I found that it had not been cleaned up and contained questionable claims from an unreliable tertiary source, so I made an argument on the discussion page and removed the offending material.  Because I didn't make an edit summary, I found my revision rather rudely reverted by a member of one of your user:groups.  I reacted and Alan pointed out my mistake: a simple oversight by a novice user, one that might have been cleared up when I read Alan's talk page had you not immediately jumped in and made baseless claims against me.  68.114.130.234  """,0
"The only thing that was a bit thick was my prose.  The old criticism is that if the pedigree were true, then two children of AEthelred II would be marrying two descendants of AEthelric, the first one generation down, the second 4 generations down.  Hart basically rejected this as absurd on its face, that you could have such a 3 generation difference - Edward marrying his brother-in-law's great-grandniece. Kelley argues that Edward was a generation younger than his half-sister, so the three generation difference becomes two.  Eadric at 40 could have married a 18-year old daughter of AEthelred, meaning the generation difference is now only 1.  Edward could have married an Eadgyth a half-generation or more younger than he was, and Eadric could have been a half-generation younger than his brother AEthelmaer, completely removing the chronological problem.  He was basically saying that, as ridiculous as the difference in generations appears on first glance, it is not as unlikely as it might seem. 
 As to why he is explaining away the AEthelric pedigree, one of the earlier authors had accepted the descend from Wulfric to AEthelmaer, and then suggested that Florence (recte John) had been confused between two AEthelmaers, and that Eadric was not brother of AEthelmaer the Stout.  Kelley is simply saying that this need not be the case, that Eadric could have been brother of AEthelmaer the Stout, that the siblings shown by John of W could all be the children of AEthelweard.  He suggests three possible explanations: A) that one pedigree showing Godwin son of Wulfnoth son of AEthelmaer was mistakenly or fraudulently linked into a second that showed Eadric Streona as son of AEthelric, B) there was an mistaken exchanging two names, such that the authentic pedigree originally showed Eadric, AEthelmaer and an AEthelric as sons of AEthelweard, and somewhere along the lines this was transposed as Eadric, AEthelmaer and AEthelweard as children of AEthelric, or C) that the authentic original pedigree showed the same brothers as sons of AEthel-weard, son of Ead-ric, and a mistaken contraction of these two generations resulted in them simply becoming AEthel-ric.

Your own description of the two sides seems to more clearly get at the problem here. There is nothing in the dictionary (or in the general definition of a capital) that makes recognition a prerequisite for a city being a capital, but there's also nothing in the dictionary saying it isn't. Likewise, there is nothing in the dictionary (or in the general definition of a country) that makes recognition a prequisite for a region being a country, but there's also nothing in the dictionary saying it isn't. Yet, in the latter case, I'm sure most here would agree that without recognition, a country is nothing, and really is not a country at all. Does the same apply to capitals? Well, we have limited situations in which this is even a question, and unfortunately the primary situation is this one, coming in the context of a bitter, and ultimately stupid, conflict. I personally think the same standard does not apply to capitals, as there is something physical (e.g. government institutions, place of residence of the head of state) to denote the capital. But if one operates under the belief that a state (and we all agree Israel is one, right?) can be without a capital, then maybe one can believe that recognition is a pre-requisite for capital status.

I was told that I could plead guilty to something, I have no idea what, something about soliciting for business or ride.  No one employed in any part of this was capable of reading the statute aloud.  The public defender told me I could sit, literally sit, in booking for four days and nights until the officer was subpoenaed and then the case would be dismissed or I could be released that afternoon.  I volunteer a lot.  I was to be volunteering at the 2nd Annual Music City BBQ by then, and I cannot volunteer if I have been sitting for 96 hours.

Berkshires,

Perhaps you say that you agree with the quoted statement, but you don't seem to get it.

Yes it is true that the Beth Din will not/didn't decide who is or should be a Rebbe to whom. They never took that power to themselves nor can I imagine that such power can even be granted. But of course they were granted the power to decide who is the """"Bobover Rebbe"""", who can use the name Bobov.

Berkshires this is an obvious distinction, one that I previously thought you were faking ignorance of. I now realise that you may have very well been serious. I will therefore try to explain it in more detail.

Think for a moment, if Rabbi Halberstam should decide tommorow that he no longer wants the title Bobover Rebbe, he no longer wants he Kehilla to be named Bobov, but rather some name of some other polish town. Does that render him no longer Rebbe to his Chasidim? The connection between a Rebbe and a Chossid has absolutley nothing to do with his title.

There was a dispute in Bobov over assets, over the title, and over usage of the name Bobov and other names used by Bobov. A very simple dry Din Torah. The Beth din  gave to Rabbi Halberstam side all of Bobov assets, the rights to the title, the name Bobov, and all other names used by Bobov. That does not mean that Rabbi Unger isn't a Rebbe? It doesn't even mean that he isn't a """"mamshich"""" of his father-in-law or grandfather-in-law. The same way the first Bobover Ruv did not have the title Sanzer ruv but he was still a """"mamshich"""" of Sanzer Ruv.

Try to remove your emotions and be impartial and you may even understand the Beth Din's logic. I am not saying you need to agree, but perhpas if you stand back for a moment you can understand their decision.

Putting aside all claims and counter claims as to who should have been selcted as the Rebbe of Bobov, I know you must believe that the son-in-law should have been selected, however there is almost unanimous consent between all Poskim that the will of the majority is respected. The Beth Din made a clear finding within the Psak that Side 2 had a majority.

If you follow that logic the Psak is self explanatory. You have a Kehilla. They made a decision as to their Rav and Rebbe. A minority is unhappy. They leave. Can they get a part of the assets? Can they use the name and title? The Beth Din answered that question with its ruling.

I went long here only because I feel a sort of denialist anger simmering within your writting, and I don't think it is warranted. I thought perhaps you can follow the logic.

In any event the Beth din did make a decsion who has and can use the title Bobover Rebbe. Rabbi Unger can no longer refer to himself as Bobover Rebbe. 

It would be appropriate for you to give this a rest.  """,0

 Conditioning? 
 Introduction
The emergence of reputation systems
How do we identify what is good? And how do we censure what is bad? We will argue that developing a humane reputation system ecology can provide better answers to these two general questions — restraining the baser side of human nature, while liberating the human spirit to reach for ever higher goals.

Most social interactions require matching human needs on the one hand, and quality or taste on the other hand: hunting for a reliable mechanic, looking for an interesting book, sifting through potential investments, judging the merits of proposed policies. Drawing from a distributed pool of reputations has the potential to ease the search for opportunities, ideas, friendships, cultural goods, and high–quality services; hand in hand, pressure will increase for honest behavior, competence, and fulfilling subtle human needs. At the same time, more efficient tagging of con artists, sources of spam, untrue claims, and dishonest actions can better sanction antisocial behavior, for the most part in a bottom–up """"distributed court of opinion.""""

Sustained rapid advances in information technology have created unprecedented abilities, which come along with unprecedented dilemmas. Data has never been easier to create and move around, but to make decisions one also needs to understand its context and implications. Just as important is what lies behind its face value, in realms such as speculative bubbles (Chancellor, 2000), shady financial practices (Partnoy, 2004), and the political statements that are the topic of much of our public discourse.

Access has generally become easier, driven by falling production, communication, and search costs; however, there are consequently far more suggestions, demands, and events to consider, straining our individual information processing capacity. Leaving the computational milieu alone to evolve """"naturally"""" is no guarantee that an ideal or even acceptable society–wide information infrastructure will emerge, as Brin (1999), Lessig (2001), Norman (1994), Schenk (1998), Stallman (2002), Walker (2003), and others have warned. To promote an interconnected ecology of socially beneficial reputation systems, conscious design, analytical modeling, and learning from past successes and failures is indispensable.

Filtering tools are still in their infancy — and having a better window to look out at the world can also imply that others can more easily peek in. Search engines speed up finding similar work done elsewhere; collaboration tools from humble mailing lists to community software to advanced groupware aid both individual and collective problem–solving. Yet it seems that for many important issues, all these tools are not keeping up with the increasing scale and number of decisions we must make, leading to what (Homer–Dixon, 2002) has referred to as an """"ingenuity gap.""""

Sheer computation power is not enough — another factor of 1000 in speed, storage, or bandwidth translates to a more modest gain in making better decisions, and perhaps even a net loss in other forms of effectiveness. (Indeed, if the data or assumptions are noisy enough, the programming aphorism of """"Garbage In, Garbage Out"""" applies.) Those who seek to use technology or the public space of ideas to advance their own agendas can also leverage increased computation power. There is indeed a technological revolution still in progress, reshaping commercial and social interactions — but its ultimate course will be affected by designers, activists, researchers and civil society at large. As (Fischer, 2002) said:

""""Peter Drucker argued that """"there is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all."""" Adding new media and new technologies to existing practices will not change the consumer mindsets of learners and workers. We need to explore new computational media based on fundamental aspects of how we think, create, work, learn, and collaborate ... New tools should not only help people to do known cognitive tasks more easily, but they should lead to fundamental alterations in the way problems are solved.""""
In order for computational advances to translate to widespread social advances, the tools must confer the ability to """"think smarter, not harder"""" — and use our collective evaluations of what is desirable to steer resources away from unproductive negative–sum games. Human brains provide an analogy: the difference between a moron and a genius lies primarily not in more or faster neurons, but in neurons that are wired together more effectively. In the same way, reputation systems are a generic tool that allow our observations, analysis, and actions to be """"wired together"""" more efficiently.

Again, the Dom -> Rom theory is based on a supposed name connection (while there are plenty of such possibilities  of connections with words from the Subcontinent) and on a supposed connection between Domba's low status and the anti-Romani prejudices. Scientifc studies presented reasons for its' lack of substance and for the Rajput ancestry. Some supporters of Dom -> Rom reorganized later their theory, by including the points raised against its likeliness, by presenting the Ḍom as a cover-term for itinerant service-providing castes and the three group as originating in different areas within India, speaking different (albeit related) Indian languages, and probably leaving the Subcontinent at different times, taking different routes. It is too bad for Y. Matras dismissing, as always, the scientific approach as """"fantastic politically-inspired mythology"""" and his opinion based on a mere resemblance of prejudices as the mainstream. I presented the evolution in time of the two theories, but I see that he deleted most of the scientific results (which btw inspired later the supporters of Dom -> Rom to make some adjustments in order to keep looking reliable).

*  *  *

I look at a lot of articles (such as BillCJ and many others and it reminds me of books that were published in the 1950 - lots and lots of facts boring, dull uninteresting pictures - picture with no history surrounding what is being published.  In the 1980-90's, a lot of True Aviation historians (i.e. Roger Freeman, Jeff Ethell, Warbirds Worldwide, etc..) found that aviation historians wanted and needed history recorded.  The captions of their books detailed who, what, when, where, etc...  As we progressed into the 2000's, I am finding that today’s writers unfortunately, want to dumb down the article - instead of giving all the details to allow the readers to decide how much level of detail he wants - Again, unfortunately, BillCJ (as well as others) want to take the Dick & Jane approach to aviation history.

This is suppose to be an online reference/encyclopedia - often when you Google an item, the wiki article is the first reference to pop-up so this will be (unfortunately) the first and only reference many will have for a subject.  A subject has to include everyone that references and item, whether it be a 4 year old doing his first model airplane, the aviation historian, the F-16 Buff.  These articles are also used by serious models who want the details.

Articles only tell part of the story - you need the pictures to compliment and point out what the article is discussing.  In the same vein, the pictures need the same level of detailed study (if possible) and care that is place in creating the entire article.  Having a great and fantastic article (such as the F-16) with kindergarten captions makes the entire article pointless.

It is also unfortunate that other editors like Askari Mark feels that detailed captions are meaningless to most readers - again, you can not have an online reference/encyclopedia without filling crossing the t and doting the i's.  Without detailed captions, it like having no reference section - sure you can print captions that state """" Gee an F-16 in Flight """" - especially when it is clear that the airplane is sitting on the ground.  Or the case of one article """"Aircraft is on a bomb-run"""" when it was clear from the picture that the bomb-bay doors were closed, no guns in the waist position and the detailed history showed the aircraft actually was a trainer and never left the United State...

BillCJ also mentioned """" are you seriously suggesting that """" serious historians """" only read WP articles for the pictures? """" - it is a proven fact that 90% of all information processed by humans come from Visual"""" data (i.e. pictures, etc...) - this is the reason Picture books are popular with preschoolers.  The first thing a majority humans look out when reading any thing is the pictures - if the pictures are interesting then many people will stop and read.  If an aviation historian comes across an article that details the subject matter then he will stop and read the contents.

It is also been said that this article is not for the F-16 Buffs - if this is the case, then 
 why have technical specifications
 why have details on each variation??  
 Why have the nuts and bolts of each individual user??
 Etc, Etc, Etc...
Why have detailed information regarding anything regarding the aircraft if this subject is not going to reach out to those who can say yes, this is true (i.e. the historian/buff) - If you are going to have the nuts and bolts in the article then you have to carry this same thought patterns over to have the nuts and bolts details in the photo captions.... (for example: B-52 Specifications, B-52 Costs, B-52 Variants) etc...  this type of informations IS for the Aviation Historian / Buff and generally not for the casual reader (which is MY point in having detailed captions).

If we dumbdown the photocaptions for the """"causual reader, then this level of details Specifications, costs, variations also needs to be removed as it will only confuse the """" casual reader """" and will lead to people calling all such information """" gobbledy-gook """".

If we dumbdown the photocaptions or call detailed information """" gobbledy-gook to most readers """" then terms such as: Wing area, Airfoil, Zero-lift drag coefficient, Drag area, Aspect ratio, Maximum speed:, Combat radius:, Ferry range, Service ceiling ,Rate of climb, Wing loading, Thrust/weight, Lift-to-drag ratio are """"gobbledy-gook to most non-aviation readers""""

 Your edits to Washington, D.C. 

Hi. Thank you for the good faith improvements made to Washington, D.C.. However, the changes have been mostly reverted for the following reasons:
All new information must have sources that correspond with WP:CITE.
Per WP:SUMMARY, the main article on Washington, D.C. provides only a summary of information and does not go into very many specifics, unless it is considered to be a """"major"""" aspect of the city. Since hurricanes and noreasters are rare, they are only mentioned in passing. In our efforts to maintain Washington D.C.'s Featured Article status, the editors typically revert edits that would expand the information beyond what is required by WP:SUMMARY. Along these lines, storms that have hit D.C. are not mentioned because A) there is already a subpage on the subject (List of Maryland and Washington, D.C. hurricanes (1980–present)) and B) since we can't mention every storm, we mention none of them. It is also the reason """"noreasters"""" aren't defined in detail, because there is already an article devoted to them, which users can read to find more information.
The article is on Washington, D.C. itself, not the surrounding area. Therefore, any information about what happens in the suburbs or the nearby coastal areas is not included in this article.
If you have any sources with information that you believe is absolutely necessary for understanding D.C.'s climate, please make it known. Best,   """,0

 Removal of poorly sourced claims about vegetarianism 

The article currently says, 
The Economist in an article writes that some Uruguayans see him as """"a roly-poly former guerrilla who grows flowers on a small farm and swears by vegetarianism"""", but he is not vegetarian.

The source that claims Mujica is not a vegetarian is dubious; it appears to be an opinion piece by someone who opposes the president's lifestyle.

 Citation analysis consistent with the critique of the IP editor 

I have no longstanding or longterm interest in contributing to the quality of the article, but have a strong interest in seeing broad, general improvements in the sourcing of scientific articles—including those in the common space between social and biological sciences. And I have an interest in seeing IP editors treated well, by the majority of us, not the few.

The recent visiting IP editor was so set upon by more experienced editors that I thought I would perform a first-pass (rough draft) evaluation of this article, strictly from the perspective of evaluating its sources.

The goals in doing this are three:
(1) To allow us to come to consensus as to the quality of the article, at least in terms of verifiable information (though for this scientist, and for purists such as myself and NeilN, it is likely that if sources should come out, content must also);
(2) To identify patterns of problems, so particular individuals with time and desire might address them (e.g., incomplete therefore unverifiable entries, poor specific sources for particular blocks of information, varyingly formatted similar sources and repeat sources making source followup difficult, etc.), and 
(3) To create a list of first issues to address, so that there might be a common set of priorities (i.e., where the list below might, in months to come, be sprinkled with  markers).

In doing this, I am applying the same academic standards as I might have in reviewing a paper submission from a sixth form or older student, on into university. This is the sort of thing that, while scholarly (so we might each might differ on the details of the analysis), all might agree to the trends represented (and all might have arrived at the same perception within minutes reviewing the article references, and have accomplished a full first-pass evaluation in an hour or so.) That is, we can see for ourselves, instead of taking the a priori position that all is fine enough to remain, or insisting a new editor argue her or his case, thoroughly and decisively, to more seasoned Wikipedia hands.

After having done this evaluation, I have come to the conclusion that the article weaknesses referred to by the IP editor appear to be substantiated. From the persecutive of reliability of information, based on expectation of high quality and verifiable secondary sources suited to the content, I conclude that the article is in very poor condition.

After reviewing this summary of the state of this article's sources, see if you might not agree.

Here, in bullet form, are cogent observations from the evaluation of the article's sourcing:

 >70 references to 12 or more undergraduate textbooks as sources, rather than the scholarly secondary or tertiary sources drawn upon by those texts (see more below);

 >70 references to books that appear without page numbers—King 2008 and King 2009 (47 refs), Buss, Crain (5), Boccadoro (2), Fausto-Sterling, Rathus (3), Russon, Farrell, Coon (2), Escoffier, Al-islam.org, Stearns Major Patterns, Stearns Sexuality (6), Greene;

 47 (36 plus 11) references to the same undergraduate textbook (King, 2008 and 2009), in two entries, all appearing without page numbers;

 More than a half dozen books lacking full citations, particularly, date of publication (e.g., King, Buss, Stearns Major Patterns, Stearns Sexuality), but also, other obscured details (e.g., David Weeks, Secrets of the Superyoung. Berkley., is actually D, Weeks & J. James, 1999, Secrets of the superyoung: The scientific reasons some people look ten years younger than they really are and how you can, too"""", New York:Villard Books, etc.)

 Long articles (> 20 pp) without narrowing part of article sourced via Section name or page number (e.g., Ross, Freud, Nagel, Lee et al, CDC);

 Nonsense page references (e.g., Kim & Ward);

 Many bare URLs or URL-only citations without links (find articles.com, enotes.com, TheAge.com.au, etc.);

 Stop being a power freak 

Hi Plumcouch,

Although you are not an administrator, you seem to be a self-styled Wikipedia policeman.  I don't understand why you have been going around giving people strict instructions on what to write and what not to write.  For the Aamir Khan and Vidya Balan pages, you insist on not having links to fansites.  I don't understand why.  If you want the power of an administrator, become an administrator.  Don't take the law into your own hands.

Administrators are not the law. Admins are normal users with more abilities. See here: []

Fan sites are a big problem. First of all, most of them violate copyright laws by displaying pictures which don't have proper copyright information and strictly, those pages are not allowed to display them. If anther page (like Wikipedia) links them, Wiki can get into trouble and with it the entire project. Also, if you add one fansite, you have to add them all. Wiki is no linkfarm and not there to improve people's traffic. Add content instead of links.

Regarding the Meera Jasmine page, you are exceptionally rigid about what belongs in the page and what does not.  You want a citation for everything, and you claim that a lot of the information is not relevant on the page.  Do you want us to say """"Meera Jasmine is an Indian actress"""", immediately put up a citation, scan a copy of her birth certificate and put it up there just to prove that she exists?

I don't doubt she's an actress. Google has various entries on her to prove that. If someone claims she's a devotee of Ganesha, movie xyz has been a mega-super successful film, it would be nice to add citations so you can identify such claims as not merely fangush or rumour which is very common on actor/actress pages. Lots of actor/actress sites don't have references and I admit that's still a big problem.

In the Filmography, I don't understand why you say the director and the co-star belongs in the movie's entry and not in Meera Jasmine's entry.  I'm sure you understand that the career of every actor or actress is shaped by the number of big names he/she works with, and it is a reflection of the actor's career.  So the info certainly belongs to the Meera Jasmine entry.

""""Big names"""" is a very controversial topic. What's big name? Is a big name still big compared to international directors/actors like Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg? Furthermore there have been problems with citing co-stars and directors to show that actor xyz is """"greater"""" than actor abc. If you follow the edit history of actors Ajith and Joseph Vijay, you'll find a good example. In order to stop people and fans from these kind of edit wars, I think it's better to keep filmographies as simple as possible - else, things can easily be mistaken as fangush or hero glorification. Also, most actor/actress pages in the Indian Cinema Project have filmographies with just the roles and the movie - it was universally agreed upon and no one of the participants wanted to change that. If you insist upon changing the way articles at the Project should be written, you can make a formal proposal here: .

And why do you insist on creating links to pages that do not exist, such as the movie pages which do not exist?  If you insist on creating a link, you make sure the link points to something, and if a page does not exist, create the page first before pointing to it.

If you have a red link (one without an article behind it), people easily identify it as such and are generally more easily motivated to click on that link and create the article if they have seen the movies. Those red li",0

 Recent edits by dapi 

User dapi did several edits which look for me kinda strange or even bias

the infobox

some weeks ago i created the infobox with good reliable data, mostly zetterling koltunov frieser. i created notes so that everyone can check
fast which units had how much men/tanks. this numbers were near perfect now dapi changed into the numbers of glantz, who seems to be a bit dubios
. glantz was earlier convicted for using russian extrem propaganda like rotmistrov, his books cited rotmistrov and used faked sources.

what was changed? the infbox now has lower numbers for men, this is explained fast and easy. The menpower before was the so called Verpflegungsstärke
, iam missing the english word but this means the strengh was every listed personnel in this units so auxillary units were included. i decided to take
this number becuse most articles use this number. but the russian number dropped by 900.000. this is explained easily too. glantz/dapi ( i dont know if glantz
really uses this number ) didnt count the entire steppe front ^^ i explain this """"trick"""" with tanks:

the tanks: we can see perfectly on the tanks. before dapis edit, the infbox showed 4.900 russian AFV but now only 3,155. i looked my sources and find
1,607 tanks for the central  1,699 voronez that makes 3,306( this is glantz numbers plus some tanks), this number is already higher than glantz """"numbers"""" but now it comes, he totally forgot 
the steppefront
with 1,632 tanks, the same steppefront which used many of his armies to support the southern wing. to exclude the steppefront is nothing less than russian bias and vandalizm
. during operaiton zitadelle the westernfront and the brijansk front started attacking the german units both fronts together fielded another 3,200 tanks lol . but this
troops are no included. i dit not include this troops too because i was aware that this will be reverted but to be honest all participating russian fronts fielded
~8,000 tanks ^^( to compare please take zetterling who wrote a book about the numbers of kursk ) but glantz achieve a much lesser number with excluding entire fronts. alone rotmistrovs 
5th Guards Tank Army fielded 800 tanks and attacked mansteins tropps^^.
so the russian numbers are simply selective, if a front took part or dont doesnt madder... .but why are the german tanks so high now?

while glantz is excluding entire russian fronts he brings a strange number for german tanks, when i check the sources i found 3,534 tanks ( zetterling/frankson wrote a book only about 
the numbers behind kursk, frieser and the german ministry for militarystudy support with primary data) for the eastern front. glantz brings 3,155 tanks . lol . i dont know were this numbers 
came from but this would mean that the 3 german armies had 90% of all tanks in this 3 armies ( one is only armygroup ).
this is bullshit we have a list for all german units and tanks, glantz number is wrong. the joke is while he excludes the entire steppe front brijansk and westernfront he dont excludes all
the german reserves which werent used like the tankcorps around the 5th SS wiking this units werent used. but the used russian units are excluded . heavy bias.... . i can support my points with
sources . i would suggest dapi does the same and we discuss the book of glantz. please tell me what glantz says why he excludes the other fronts.... . to avoid such bias i created notes so that every
reader can click and see immediate which army/front had how much tanks, that was good i think....

dapi comments his changes with """"removing unreliable ed"""" []
he calls frieser ( and the Militärgeschichtliche Forschungsamt Deutschland and his 5 co-autors ) zetterling/frankson ( they made a book only about the numbers of kursk ) and koltunov unreliable even
krivosheev becomes """"dubios"""" for user dapi [].
while he uses glantz who was punked by blatant propaganda[] and seems to fake numbers to support his fact
that red army didnt need numerical superiority. a interesting example is that dapi uses glantz to cite 350 tank losses for prokhorovka ( the mythbattle) and the same book is used to cite 340 losses
for the complete """"zitadellecampaign"""" -) . here it must be noted that user dapi89 is a big fan of frieser, he is citing him always when talks about blitzkrieg and to revert edits on the blitzkrieg-
page. so his opinions is not straight...

I'd like to clarify my concerns with the current version of the article, following the reversion of some of my edits by Stirling Newberry.

My general concern is that it doesn't accurately describe the debate about various causes of hyperinflation.  The article seems to me to be describing a stereotyped view of each side of the debate, which exagerrates the amount of controversy and obscures the amount of common ground.  """"Monetary"""" and """"Crisis of confidence"""" explanations of hyperinflation are describes as if they are two completely different competing theories,  held by different schools of thought (""""monetarists"""" and """"neo-liberals"""").

I think that the overwhelming majority of economists would see both monetary and confidence factors as being important as the initial 'root cause' of hyperinflation, with the importance varying from case to case.  A lot of the economics is very uncontroversial. For example:
It's totally uncontroversial that a massive increase in the money supply will cause hyperinflation.  Virtually any economist will agree that a big increase in the money supply is a possible trigger for hyperinflation, even if they don't believe it's the only one.  To say imply that neo-liberal economists don't believe that some hyperinflations are initially triggered by monetary expansion is to caricature their position.
It's totally uncontroversial that loss of confidence in the monetary system has a big role in hyperinflation.  To imply that monetarists don't see a role for reestablishing confidence in the currency - that just 'stopping the printing presses' is enough - is just misleading.  Monetarists talk about ways of establishing confidence all the time.

I would be interested to hear from Stirling what specific inaccuracies were in my edits, and why he deleted the statement """"The two models are closely related, and often economists may explain hyperinflation as being due to a combination of both effects.""""

 This info is all messed up !! 

Pit bull is a slang term that describes several types of dogs with similar physical characteristics. There are several physically similar breeds that are often termed """"pit bull"""", including the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, the Bull Terrier, the Perro de Presa Canario, Cane Corso, and Argentine Dogos.These breeds are usually not included by name in any Breed Specific Legislation (see below), but are sometimes included because of a broad definition and confusion as to what a pit bull actually is. [1] All of these breeds as well as many others (including Great Danes, Newfoundlands and Rottweilers) are members of the Molosser family of dog breeds.

1: Pitbull is NOT a slang , its just one of the nicknames och shortened names the breed has had during the years.
Those that use it for dogs other then Pitbulls are just ignorant and dont have the facts surrounding the breed clear to them.
often used by journalists and people without any background info
Its a pure breed dog , registered under UKC since 1898. its beeing registered under """"American pitbull Terrier"""" under a few more registrys such as ADBA & BFKC in USA.

I dont know why this site, that is set to be some kind of """"kowledge base"""" allows itself to have this info at the top of the page.
All it does, is to confuse people that come in here to read and to find out more about the breed.

If this is the first thing a visitor reads , then it often sticks to his/her mind as """"truth"""" and he leaves the site.
If a reader comes in here to search facts because he/her is unsure about what a Pitbull is because of medias coverage, then this info just confirmes to him/her that there is no such thing as a real Pitbull, with is as far from the truth you may come.
There are so many myths and hearsays around this breed , so i suggest the top info to be rewritten and only contain FACTS.

Many countries have their own Kennelclubs , and they are all tied together by FCI as an international organ.
But FCI only works with 1 kennelclub per country and if a dog aint listed in that club , other countries follow FCI regulations and do the same.
This is why FCI dossent recognize the Pitbull as a pure breed.
They work with AKC (American Kennel Club) that dossent keep register of the Pitbull , But the American Staffordshire Terrier.
Pitbulls as i said erlier,  was first registered with UKC (United Kennel Club) and because only one club per country is allowed in FIC regulations the Pitbull was left outside due to a tecnicality.

This is the same in several countries.
The national kennelclubs is tied to follow FCI regulations if they are members , and thats why Sweden for example dossent recognize the pitbull in their own kennel klub (SKK).

Why did i say all this then ?
Well , it goes back to what i wrote erlier.
If a person think that Pitbull just is a """"slang"""" and not a pure breed as written at top of Wikipedia site about pitbulls , and lives in Sweden for example , then this sites info add more to the myths.

So if a moderator reads this , please think hard about what signals the top text about Pitbulls sends out to this pages viewers.

""":RSimpson states here that """"Karate is not Japanese"""". This is wrong to say. Anyway, it is wrong to say it in this black-and-white view. Of course karate has its roots in older Chinese martial arts, going back as far as the old Shaolin temple. Should it be said then that karate is Chinese??? Of course not. Karate IS a Japanese martial art, with roots in older Chinese martial arts. Japanese (actually Okinawan) masters of the 19th and early 20th century have changed the art into a new, modern fighting art, just as languages change, like Bihal writes: French is a French language. French does have its roots in Italy (Latin), but it is not an Italian language! There's no doubt about that, so why doubt the fact that (the modern) karate is Japanese?

 World View Tag

As such the world view of this article is correct since the article itself correctly describes the history on the world view.

Pallavas are brahmins. They have made many inscriptions claiming that they are are brahmins of Bharadvaja gotra. Hence Pallavas are not considered as tamil kings.

Then what happened to the decendants of the Pallava kings in Tamil Nadu?

Pallavas never claimed as brahmans at the start of their power. Later only some Pallavas left some inscriptions as they belonged to Bharadwaja Gothra.

The early Pallavas belonged to Nanthi gothra. Pallavas used NANTHI (BULL) their emblem. Kaikolans are still belong to NANTHI GOTHRA.

"Request to Unblock
I began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.

WIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidents
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents

User: AuburnPilot

A few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!

He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).

Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.
I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.

The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.

P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)

If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.

P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency. Sorry, but I don’t have any sympathy for the Devil.",1

Sorry, I was referring mainly to the INTRO not the rest of the article. 

The intro does not mention at all any of: 
 the """"repressive measures"""" (only equivocally """"human rights situation"""" which anyone can interpret according to his/her hearts wishes;) 

 terrorizing of ethnic groups also is absent.  
 
the term  """"repressive security appartus"""" again does not reflect Saddam's barbarism towards ethnic rivals - ('security appartus' usually means secret police, Stasi type state surveillance etc)

 """"lacked consent of iraqi society"""" also doesn't appear there in any form; 

If you put all those things in the INTRO and i'll be happier.  Most people only read the intro, either because they are too lazy or too unwilling to scrutinize their prejudiced views; and an equivocal intro panders exactly to those types of readers, encouraging them. The intro should be built in such a way that fairly represents
the two main popular opposing views of Saddam: as a brutal dictator, regional threat of WMD and terrorism, vs. freedom fighter / modern Sallah a-Din whatever his supporters want to call it.  It does the latter but not the former. Yes, you cannot avoid the possible reader conclusion that Saddam's popular support may not be despite his brutality but because of it; This is one of the legitimate paradoxes sorrounding this figure (and that of most dictators).""",0

"""::you wouldn't know Makoto from Street Fighter 3 was a girl if it wasn't for her dizzy animation.
Well, you could also read her bio... Leo's bio, on the other hand, doesn't say anything about a gender, or about the character trying to look like a boy.
It's pretty easy to come up with some evidence that Makoto is a girl, but I've yet to see somebody pull that off with Leo...
something which keeps coming up is that Leo is a boys name. Well considering the she's obviously trying to look like a boy (probably so Kazuya doesn't recognise her so her revenge will be easier to gain - yeah, yeah, speculation) it makes sense that she's actually called Leona and Leo is (a) a shortened version of that and (b) conveniently plays into the tomboy image.
Actually, I could think of a more plausible explanation for the name: if, like you just theorized, Leo wants to stay incognito, I would think she (assuming Leo's a """"she""""... still your theory)'d better change her name... Maybe she's not really called """"Leo"""" at all. Maybe the name is part of the """"boy"""" disguise. 'Seems more logical and simple to me, anyway.
Remember, in Japan tomboys will use """"boku"""" rather than """"watashi"""" and will get called """"kun"""" rather than """"chan"""" - all things that technically explicitly mark them as male.
Not sure why you're saying that... Does Leo refer to himself/herself as """"boku""""? Besides, if Leo is a girl posing as a young man, she could go as far as to call herself """"ore,"""" really...
Anyway... Namco kept Leo out of a list of the Tekken 6 women/girls, and the character has been said to be male several times in Japanese magazines. So if Leo is a girl, she's secretly a girl... and there has been no big reveal as of yet. In fact, there's even a possibility Namco is trying to keep Leo's real gender a riddle and has no intentions of confirming it one way or the other, ever. Yumeji (from the Samurai Spirits series) would be a precedent. 81.56.14.31

"Donald Campbell and File:Donald Campbell.jpg 

Hi Katie, I'd like to request an undelete on your recent deletion of this image (WP:CSD#F7). This is for two reasons:
 It's the masthead, and only, image of a biography on an important motorsport and motorboat figure. Our precedent is clearly that such images are considered to fall under fair-use. If the FUR wasn't up to scratch on the image, then WP:BEFORE clearly indicates that the FUR should be fixed, not the image deleted. I've seen an awful lot of these lately - images uploaded a few years ago (so probably the more important images) with FUR that was adequate at their time of upload are being purged because they don't meet todays practice, even though it's a trivial filing exercise to bring them up to standard. This hurts the encyclopedia project.
 Secondly, it wasn't notified anywhere on the article. There are templates for notifying this on the page, there's a talk: page too. Many people, myself included, have articles like this on their watch lists but we don't have every constituent image watched. Now whilst policy doesn't demand this, it would clearly be a helpful and appropriate action to place some notification onto the article, especially when it's the masthead that's under threat. 
Thanks",0
"""

NPOV
I have tagged this article as POV because it is filled with sentences like """"The Iranian Government security forces opened fire on protesters on the Shi'a holy day of Ashura, a day """"symbolically about justice"""" and during which any kind of violence is forbidden,"""" """"Irregularities during the 2009 Iranian presidential election caused resentment among many Iranians,"""" """"outspoken political dissenters were detained.[5][6] However, dissenters continued to speak out against the Government, leading to further protests in December 2009"""" and """"Security forces opened fire on the day of Ashura, the Shiite holy day """"symbolically about justice"""", a day which any kind of violence is forbidden,"""" which do not sound neutral or objective but like outright propaganda? 

Than in the protest section, rather than reporting the events objectively, quotes are used, not from people, but from pro-reformist articles, the result: """"Protesters in Tehran gathered  """"From Imam Hussain Square to Freedom Square"""", """"from east to west along Revolution Street"""", and it was on this day that """"the political and religious symbology of Iran's Islamic regime was turned on its head"""".[10] The protesters made another symbolic move- a """"symbolic journey from a square named after its most revered hero toward a monument dedicated to freedom, along a street called Revolution.""""[10]"""" is unbelievably POV, this should be immedietly changed to a proper written text which reports everything objectively. Meanwhile in the part about the demonstrations condemning the Ashura riots (which BTW, where much larger than the Ashura riots themselfes - a fact which was completely ignored by the writers of this wiki article), """"On December 30, counter-rallies staged and organized by the government at various cities, including Tehran, Qom, Arak, Shiraz and Isfahan called for the death of the protesters, with government workers receiving the day off work in order to attend the demonstrations"""" the sentence """"with government workers recieving the day off work in order to attend the demonstrations, was added in such POV manner and clearly to discredit those demonstrations.

Now although it is mentioned how rioters set fire cars, shops, banks and power stations (though other vandalism by the rioter isn't mentioned at all), this is such small part of the article. The violence by rioters (against people) is not mentioned at all, meanwhile there is a complete section devoted to alleged government violence against the protestors. The article is also clearly written with a goal of reporting only what is good for the green movement, this is illustrated not only by the POV quotes but by for isntance the way that whenever government claims are reported, they are immedietly rebuffed with other POV claims, leading me to believe they were only included to """"expose"""" the government as liars (which is POV). An example is """"Although official sources in Iran denied involvement of security forces in killing of protesters, at least one amateur video shows, the security truck which was deliberately running over the protesters.[16] Other evidence says that security forces were armed with guns and shot at protesters, including one amateur video showing a plainclothes security force directly shooting at protesters.[17],"""" with source 16 being non-existant and source 17 being a vehimently anti-Iranian blog showing a video of a gunman, of which there is no proof he is associated with the police of basij. In the article he is however labelled as a """"plainclothes security force."""" All in all, this article definetly needs to be re-written.  """,0

 Re: Coca-Cola 

Sorry if I rudely didn't drop an explanatory note at your talk page; it was rude of me and poor behavior.

Please see our Manual of Style to understand the correct formatting and appearance standards. The one issue with your additions is that the captions for the images are entirely too long and full of extraneous information; image captions are not museum display cards and do not serve to detail every single item appearing in the image; Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a museum. They should also never state """"note the x"""" or other similar attention drawing text, per WP:W2W, one of our guidelines on writing prose. They also had inappropriate use of capitalization, boldface and other formatting issues. For example, ALLCAPS spelling is never used for emphasis, as it is read as shouting on the Internet. 

As for the Coca-Cola additions, I took them out for lack of relevance. The Coca-Cola article is about the drink, not the company; that's at The Coca-Cola Company. The information in those images is better placed there, but in the article text, not the image caption.

The other reversions were based on similar concerns; the same sort of formatting and caption length issues were present there. In the one article, for example, the caption was nearly as long as the rest of the text in the article, when that text should really go in the article's body text instead. 

Once again, my apologies for biting your head off, as you were editting in good faith. I hope that my poor behavior doesn't turn you off to the collabrative process and that, with a bit of polishing, you can add much to our growing base of knowledge.

Ok I'm going to reproduce part of my page here again to close this matter. Censoring images in any way is against Wikipedia policies. Any questions? Compromises on Wikipedia policies is not allowed, needless to say. Please stay firm with people who attempt to violate Wikipedia policies.  (talk•contribs) 

How Wikipedia policies/guidelines may apply to issue of Muhammad's pictures

Wikipedia:Profanity
Words and images that would be considered offensive, profane, or obscene by typical Wikipedia readers should be used if and only if their omission would cause the article to be less informative, relevant, or accurate, and no equally suitable alternatives are available. Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not.

Some editors argue that in the light of this guideline:
 Typical Wikipedia readers do not find pictures of Muhammad offensive
 Exclusion of such pictures would result in the article being less informative, relevant and accurate.
 No suitable alternatives are available, as these pictures are historic
 As the policy states, """"Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not."""". Therefore, the primary mission of Wikipedia and its editors is to improve articles so they are more informative. Being offensive is not Wikipedia's mission.
 In addition, there are no issues of copyrights as the copyrights for all these pictures have expired so the images can be used freely where relevant.

WP:NOT#CENSORED
This policy states:
 Wikipedia may contain content that some readers consider objectionable or offensive.
 Wikipedia cannot guarantee that articles or images are tasteful to all users or adhere to specific social or religious norms or requirements.

Printing Images of Muhammad: A minority tradition?
Some users (Itaqallah and ALM) have suggested that since printing of Muhammad's images has , therefore Wikipedia too should not print the images otherwise it will be a violation of WP:UNDUE. Cartoon images of Muhammad have been printed all over the World and this is not likely to change now:

 List of newspapers that reprinted Jyllands-Posten's Muhammad cartoons

Printing of images is no longer a minority tradition and so UNDUE does not apply.  (talk•contribs) """,0

bad faith exhibited:

Terms like """"fundie"""" and linking BSF to a political movement the Christian Right which has done some good things but some stupid things also, it shows bad faith.  Calling me a Bible literalist even though I explicitly said I was not is bad faith.  MickWest making imperious edits over and over again until you are told to stop by Mark that is bad faith.

Not following the minority view policy which says """"there is no size limit to Wikipedia"""" and the minority view can go into """"great detail"""" is bad faith.

Both Amazon and Google are sites that use English in their searches. The west is particularly advanced when it comes to using the internet to create pages or discuss things.

"""== It's not emo. ==

I had posted a topic about a band that has been labeled emo, only for someone to delete it. Stating that """"it is completely off topic, unproductive, unrelated to this article, and that belongs in a discussion forum"""" Hello, this is a discussion forum for the emo page, if we have an issue with something on it, it's suppose to be displayed here and talked over. Do not delete peoples post because YOU think it doesn't fit to YOUR standards, it's for people to talk on.

With that, I repost my statement to WHY Coheed and Cambria are not emo.

First off, I'd like to take the time to say. Read this, and don't reply UNLESS you are agreeing, or are going to change this matter. If you are just going to sit there and whine because you are wrong about something, I don't want to hear it.

So here we begin...

Each song that Coheed and Cambria has made, has gone in flow with a comic that Claudio Shanchez (Lead Singer) has thought of in that brilliant mind of his. Some might claim some of the songs emo due to a few lyrics. Well, how else would you explain a painful moment, or happy moment in a story? A rhyme about whatever the heck """"junk in a trunk"""" is? No, you'd have an explanation of the characters pain and happiness.

Perhaps you should read some stuff from wiki itself. 
Within The Amory Wars page, (The comic made by Claudio)

""""The story follows the adventure of Claudio Kilgannon across the fictional solar system, far in the past known as Heaven's Fence, in an attempt to seek help from his Uncle, after his parents are tricked into murdering Claudio's siblings, and then murdered themselves by the Supreme Tri-Mage and ruler of Heaven's Fence, Wilhelm Ryan.""""

All of their songs came from a point in the story, if you had known the story, you'd not tag them as emo at all. Because in fact they are not, it's a story. Get over it and stop with all of this """"scene"""" stuff. 

It's all a story, unlike other bands that cry and scream about """"I want to die, no one understands me, I have it so bad, My girlfriend left me because I am whiny""""

Understand what I am pointing out?

Emo is the most ridiculous label ever, yet sadly it is here and people wont let it die willingly. 
So, why not research bands before you label. While you are at it, read the Coheed and Cambria comics, they are quite the epic. This now ending my humble opinion on this matter of why they shouldn't be in this """"Emo label"""" scene.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Doesn't matter if they are or aren't emo.  They're listed here as a band that has been called emo.  In fact, that's the point of the paragraph - to demonstrate how nebulous the term is.

If you want the related Wikipedia guidelines - all we have to do is supply a reliable source (per WP:RS) that confirms that C&C; have been called emo.  Source.  That's it.  That's all we need.  Any amount of rambling about how they are or aren't emo is irrelevant.  

And you trust MTV? The people that don't even play music anymore, pathetic. Well, I counter your source with mine.  Source.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Did you really read what I wrote?  It doesn't matter if they're emo or not.  We're not using C&C; as an example of an emo band, we're using C&C; as an example of a band that's been called emo.  They've been called emo, so they're mentioned.  Period.

Wolfkeeper, the paragraph covered centrifugal force and nobody had objected to it when somebody else inserted it. It was only because I re-inserted it, after Anome deleted it in conjunction with his nonsense political centrifugal force idea, that you deleted it.

 basic income dispute resolution 

I don't understand the finding """"futile"""", or how to proceed to resolve the issue.  

Regarding the [Wikipedia,_bicycles,_and_wagons] reference, its my understanding that I am building a bicycle, that may be slightly off spec, and the editors are ordering the steel melted and shipped to hell, instead of allowing the bicycle to be refined into spec.  I point out also that the [basic income] is listed as a priority by four wikigroups, and so it is a pretty important bicycle.  Also the nature of basic income is at a theoretical philosophy stage, and the highest quality references possible are available to verify and preferably succinct, and high quality blogs provide the best verifiability, IMO, but regardless of this opinion, a section on proposed benefits does not need prestigious academic references if the claim being made is that the ideas and rationale has merely been proposed.  To keep the bicycles/wagons analogy, the page was a high quality bicycle, and an important bicycle to 4 wikigroups.  There is a difference of opinion over whether the bicycle meets specs, but it is a functional bicycle that is more useful than a pile of melted metal shipped far away.   """,0

I moved the 69-72 Markham and Dixie championships from the Central B/Mid-Ontario to the Metro League, where they played.

DIXIE BEEHIVES 

(1957 - 1986)

Perhaps the first team to operate in the OHA under the Dixie name was the Dixie Staffords of the pre-Metro Junior 'B' Grouping that operated during the 1949-50 season. In 1952, the East York Rockets of the Metro grouping moved to become the Dixie Rockets. A few years later, the team changed its name to the Dixie Beehives. The Metro Junior 'B' Hockey League was a strong league and the Beehives were the league's most stable team. In 1972, a new Tier II Junior 'A' Provincial League was formed and the Dixie Beehives were one of six Metro teams to move up to the new league. The Beehives played in the league until 1986 when they ceased operations. The league managed to last only one additional season.

PATEY, Larry
Hockey
Born: March 19, 1953
Toronto, Ontario
Lary Patey played most of his young career in Mississauga, first in the Port Credit Hockey Association and later with the Metro Junior B Dixie Beehives. It was with the Beehives in March of 1971 that Patey suffered a near fatal accident during the Metro Junior B final against the Markham Waxers that Dixie would eventually go on to win in five games.

Hammered into the boards by 6- foot-6 defenceman Bob Dailey, Patsey slumped to the ice. While trying to get up, Patsey's teammate Rick Cornacchia took on Dailey in a tussle and the ensuing melee, Patey was caught in the face by a skate blade. 

From that horrific evening, Patey went on to a long and successful 12-year National Hockey League career as a centreman. After leading the Western League in scoring while with Sault Lake City Golden Eagles where captured rookie of the year honors, Patey was soon called up to the now defunct California Golden Seals. Later, Patey was traded to the St. Louis Blues in 1975-76 for Wayne Merrick and he concluded his career with New York Rangers before having to retire because of lower back injury.

A workaholic on the ice throughout his career, Patey later applied the same hard work ethic in the world of real estate and earned President's Club Honors as one of the Gundaker Better Homes and Gardens in St. Louis after only being in the business for four years.

While Patey had his most productive season offensively for California in 1974- 75 when he scored 25 goals to go along with 20 assists, it was during his stay with the Blues that the seventh-round draft choice drew the most attention for his strong two-way play.

""""St. Louis didn't care how many goals I scored- they had Red Berenson, Derek Sanderson and Gary Unger up front to do that. They wanted me to play defensively and aggressively."""" Patey combined both skills to set a St. Louis club record for most shorthanded goals in a season and was always called on to line up against the Bryan Trottiers, Bobby Clarkes and Phil Espositos of the NHL.

""""I enjoyed doing it because there was less pressure in having to score goals and I took a lot of pride in my role.""""

Living the life as a shadow, Patey did manage to score 153 goals in his 12 year professional career before retiring after the 1984-85 season.

While the league's fans didn't always notice Patey, or the fine job he did in shutting down opponents, his peers throughout the league certainly did.""",0

Guadalupe
Hi  glad to see you expanding the Codex and Poole stubs, and thanks for your encouragement.  I'm sorry I fell off the face of the earth last year  if your hobby is hard work, mine might be sudden evaporation.  

If you have the time, and only if you have the time,  I want to discuss Guadalupe's role in the United Farm Workers' movement, in the Cristero Wars, and as a """"dueling virgin"""" w/Remedios.  Remedios I can handle, but so far my searching for information about the UFW/Cristero wars has only yielded that she was a flag for the former and a motto for the latter.  Can you tell me, is there more to it than that?  I'm not asking you to turn up the sources for me, just to tell me what I should be searching for.

I was thinking about starting a daughter page called """"Documentation disputes"""" because I think this stuff is interesting and ought to be expanded, but am afraid it will freak out more casual readers.  Ideally I'd like this article to be comprehensible and intriguing for, say, a high school student  and I'm worried that doubling, tripling, or even quadrupling the document discussion (which would be easy, eh) would lose my dream High School Reader.

Finally, ifeito tagged the article as biased:  I think he's the ip address who said it reads like a devotional article again.  He didn't expand on that though, just left the tag.  I don't think it reads like a devotional article  that's certainly not my interest in writing about Guadalupe, anyway.  But I could be missing something.  Do you have any comment about that?   """,0

 Mother Jones 

I am puzzled why you removed:

 Elliott J. Gorn, Mother Jones: The Most Dangerous Woman in America, 2001, ISBN 0-8090-7094-4

...from the Mother Jones article, describing your action as removing """"biased POV edits."""" Although i'm not familiar with the book, the reference to Mother Jones as """"The Most Dangerous Woman in America"""" was a common one. I believe that her supporters were not offended by such a description; they were working people who felt abused by the economic system, and they relished such a claim. This is not to say that your edit was improper; i'd have to read the book to know more. But if your edit resulted from use of this phrase, and for no other reason, then it was (in my view) mistaken about the general perception of that description. I say this as a strong Mother Jones supporter and fan.

 Matt Sanchez 

A request for consensus about what to do about some changes you recently reverted has been posted at Talk:Matt Sanchez.  Thanks,  

 Oldest people 

Hi, I see you've reverted my changes with the comment """"current format has better visual appeal; Wikipedia is not paper"""". I'm trying to understand but all I can make of this is a statement of personal taste, and I'm not convinced. Can we try to compare arguments? To me there are two disadvantages to the old format: 1. it contains duplicate information (the """"To"""" column, saying when someone lost the status of oldest person, is always — necessarily so — equal to the person's day of death); 2. it actually is less appealing to me because the information fills more space and there are many line breaks. It looks more tidy in my version. I'm therefore rather surprised at your change. Thanks for a reply. –  

Please note that if we did the table in 'real-time' and not reconstructed history, we would have people like Charlotte Benkner lose the title when someone older was found, not when they died. Thus, it could technically be different.

Second, I realize it is not absolutely necessary; however, I do think a little redundancy is OK. Visually, if the cases are too close together, then their time with the title looks insignificant. {yakłtalk} 

Did you have to create my user page just in order to respond? (My talk page did exist.) I was going to create it eventually, but in my own tome. How do I get it deleted again now (not just empty but deleted)? Such thoughtlessness really makes me angry. I've copied your comment here and I'm asking you to continue the debate on this page.

I was aware of the theoretical argument you made. You say yourself that it doesn't apply as you it is a retroactive version. Your visual argument I think I understand. Are you saying that with your version each table entry is a two-liner whereas in mine some entries take up one line and some two? –

 Inaccuracies in Modern day legacy: France 

Hello, to whomever may be watching this page. Although I have introduced myself elsewhere on Wikipedia, primarily on the SNCF page, this is my first message here. My name is Jerry Ray, and I am a consultant to SNCF, the French railway company, in Washington, DC. Last year I began reaching out to editors to help address inaccuracies related to the Holocaust in the SNCF article. Now I would like to bring editors' attention to similar issues within this article. 

As editors here will no doubt agree, this is a difficult subject, but one in which it is highly important to get the facts right. My aim here is to provide a revised version of the current """"Modern day legacy"""" section. This new version, with which I have had some assistance in researching and writing, represents an improvement in several ways. First, it presents a clearer overview of what was at stake in the Liepitz case. Second, it describes the US controversy more accurately, which was not limited to California. Third, it better describes how SNCF handled it and other viewpoints in the case, some of which is retained from the current entry. Lastly, there is a short final paragraph describing actions taken by SNCF in the modern era relating to this episode. 

Here is what I suggest:

{{Collapse|1=
France

In 2001, a lawsuit was filed against French government-owned rail company SNCF by Georges Lipietz, a Holocaust survivor, who was transported by SNCF to the Drancy internment camp in 1944. Lipietz was held at the internment camp for several months before the camp was liberated. After Lipietz's death the lawsuit was pursued by his family and in 2006 an administrative court in Toulouse ruled in favor of the Lipietz family. SNCF was ordered to pay 61,000 Euros in restitution. SNCF appealed the ruling at an administrative appeals court in Bordeaux, where in March 2007 the original ruling was overturned. According to historian Michael Marrus the court in Bordeaux """"declared the railway company had acted under the authority of the Vichy government and the German occupation"""" and as such could not be held independently liable.

Following the Lipietz trial, SNCF's involvement in World War II became the subject of attention in the United States when SNCF explored bids on rail projects in Florida and California, and SNCF's partly-owned subsidiary, Keolis Rail Services America bid on projects in Virginia and Maryland. While bidding on these rail contracts, SNCF was criticized for not formally acknowledging and apologizing for its involvement in World War II. In 2011, SNCF chairman Guillaume Pepy released a formal statement of regrets for the company's actions during World War II.{{cite news |title=SNCF, French Railro",0

No, I will make sure that will be removed permanently.  I will not do this for awhile to avoid violations, but hope that someone else will consider and agree.  There is no reason whatsoever to put """"the late"""" in front of his name, I will list several reasons, and although I think that is somewhat POV, there are other reason as to why I remove the info:
Everyone dies sometime - Does it really make sense to have an article about a past event and just put """"the late"""" in front of everyone that has died?
Poor writing - It's just sloppy/filler writing to put """"the late"""" in place.  Would you ever see anyone referred to as """"the late"""" in a print encyclopedia?
Recentism - WP has a guideline/template that we should try not to capitalize too much on recent events and keep them in perspective.  Would it make sense 10 years down the road to still refer to him as """"the late""""?  Let's make things as static as possible.
Precedent - At one point, several dozen articles referred to Steve Irwin as """"The late Steve Irwin"""", now, this is the only one that does (by doing a search), and there seems to be consensus about that.
Knowledge of his death - Let's face it, a vast majority of people (especially those that would look for this article) know he is dead, and the few that may not be sure can click the link.  Maybe people don't want to know that he's dead or be reminded of it, and putting that acts as a spoiler.  Even Anna Nicole Smith had a few """"the lates"""" put on pages of hers, and those have all been removed (a few by me, a few by others). """"Saving a click"""" is not a valid reason for this, we should assume that the readers are smart, and things like that can go to the Simple English edition.
Irrelevance - Why would the fact that he is dead be relevant to an article that talks about his programming?  His shows will probably be reran for many years to come, and the fact that he died somewhat unexpectedly makes no bearing on what he did on his programming.

Well, this is my case, I would also like to point out WP:OWN, which I feel has been violated in these reverts.  I also am starting a discussion on WP:Words To Avoid to get some word from other editors to make sure that I am doing the right thing.

'Oppose Removal After reading the above comments and looking at some of the users pages it becomes apparent that that deletion is an attempt to silence the oppossition and promote a POV. As an American historian I see that there is strong support for gun ownership rights and has there been for centuries. Many Americans see this as a valid argument against gun control and in America it is not a fringe theory. The article is about Gun Control and one could infer American Gun control because it is no longer an issue in most other countries. The argument has legs and to deny that is to deny history for political motivations. Whether or not we agree with the argument is irrelevant. History is not about voting on current policies. The proper thing to due is to have arguments for and against the viewpoint and not to bury it because like a zombie it will rise again. Also I am concerned that Wikipedia has become a platform for many editors to promote their politics and I am sure this statement will bring the POV pushers out as an accurate assessment often does.

 Problems with """"Netbooks in education section"""" 

I feel like there are a couple of problems with the Netbooks in education section:

1) It doesn't seem to be written from a NPOV, and the tone is even a little advertisement-like. """"Netbooks have the potential to change the way students and teachers interact"""", """"The benefits of integrating netbooks in the classroom are many, but they are maximized when there is a 1-1 student to computer ratio"""", etc.

2) It's too long. I don't see any reason why this section should take up 1/4 of an already very long article. The """"activities"""" subsection is pure fluff. The sections on """"Effects on student learning"""", """"Costs and logistics"""", and """"Training and staff development"""", are basically fine, but they convey no information that's specific to netbooks. The information belongs in an article like E-learning.

 Dirtiness of thermonuclear bombs 

An unsupported statement is made that """"... the smaller a thermonuclear bomb is, the """"dirtier"""" it is ...""""
This is misleading, if not untrue.

Bombs are optimised for an entirely different purpose. It is true that in small and large bombs, the bulk of the yield is from fission, but this is a design decision, and can easily be eliminated by using a non-fissile tamper material. The secondary of a small multi-stage bomb is just another boosted fission stage, fusion yield negligible. The largest bomb ever tested (~50MT) was fairly clean, but only because the fissile tamper was removed from the secondary to reduce contamination. Small ultra-clean bombs have also been tested.

The article is about the current art of laser-driven ICF. Fission-driven ICF was the first mechanism used and has been proven, so a summary definitely belongs here. The details of using large explosions for power belong in another more general nuclear power article.

 OR removed from page 

I removed the following section due to its entirely being original research and speculation. Per User:SteveLoughran's request, here it is.

The implementation details of S3 are not documented, but it is possible to infer aspects of it from the behaviour (and pricing) of the service.

 There is an S3 repository in the US; there is another in Europe. Their locations are not public.
 From an EC2 server, read access can initially be slow. This could imply that S3 data is not always in the same physical location as all the EC2 servers. 
 Amazon do not bill for data transferred between the US EC2 server farm and the US S3 store, but they do for access between the servers and the European S3 store. While the S3 store and the EC2 servers may be in separate locations, they must be close enough together that cost of transferring data is neglible. Both services are presumably hosted on the same Metropolitan Area Ethernet.
 Connectivity between the S3 datastores and the rest of the Internet is good. This implies they  are close to one of the main Internet exchanges.
 After the initial slow access, later accesses are fast. This could imply that the data is cached.
 Write access is tangibly slower than writing to a local hard disk. Amazon guarantee that when the operation has completed, data has been written to disk in multiple locations. 
 Amazon warn that even after data has been written, old values may still be read. This implies that there can be more than one cache of the data, and that every GET request does not trigger a check from the front-end caches to the back-end store.
 Amazon adjusted their initial pricing from a simple flat rate per GB to one that charges small frequently retrieved items per thousand GET or HEAD operations, rather than purely per byte. There may be a flat cost for every entry (indexing, billing entries) and a per-request cost in CPU-time for every access. These fixed overheads are now billed for.

The dynamic per-bucket DNS entries are implemented by having a custom S3 DNS server that returns a hostname for every host under the s3.amazonaws.com subdomain, even if a bucket of that name has never been created: 
> nslookup made-up-name-for-wikipedia.s3.amazonaws.com

Non-authoritative answer:
made-up-name-for-wikipedia.s3.amazonaws.com     canonical name = s3-directional-w.amazonaws.com.
s3-directional-w.amazonaws.com  canonical name = s3-1-w.amazonaws.com.
Name:   s3-1-w.amazonaws.com
Address: 72.21.211.228

Wait...how can the creators of Liberalism be called classical liberals, if Liberal means something different than its classic form?  Furthermore, how can something be classic when it was once origina.  Don't you see that Liberalism had to become classic liberalism because many people strayed from its beliefs by changing its core values and meanings?  Thus, I do not see a problem with mentioning how classical liberals believe themselves to be the true liberals and that """"modern welfare statist liberals"""" have perverted the meaning.  

Libertarians are a reaction from the virtual elimination of liberals/classical liberals from the political scene as both Democrats and Republicans continued to abandon their beliefs on freer markets and limited government.  Thats it.  There are various levels of libertarians and free market advocates, and only a few of them advocate anarchism.  I think you conflate free market with anarchy.  Furthermore, I think you've failed to realize that Milton Friedman considers himself a liberal while being a member of the REPUBLICAN PARTY!!!!

Another supposed noted American libertarian is John Stossle, and he hates the term libertarian, he prefers to call himself a liberal but the meaning is something different from what it once was so he reluctantly refers to himself as a classical liberal for the less informed, or a libertarian for the most ignorant.

Furthermore, there has never been a laissez-faire American life. This is bogus leftist/tory propoganda.

I contend that when put into perspective it is not 'selling well', not selling poorly just not well. With 10.5 million Xbox360's sold 1 and 'more than' 100,000 addons sold the attach rate is quite small for something that is supposedly 'selling well'. The maths (I'll use 150,000 to be generous) 150,000 / 10,500,000 * 100 = 1.4%. With pre-release claims from Microsoft that they would achive a 30% attach rate the current figures are less than good. Hense, I will be reverting the deletion of the sentence.",0

Randy, I am not apologizing to you for an obvious joke, so you will have to somehow manage to go on without one. What is truly outrageous is how little you care about the """"embarrassing"""" state of the article (not my words, but those of several editors above), but you care a great deal about making sure there are indents, and tildes, and every one of your trite, nonsensical, kangarroo-court rules has been followed. I am sure your mother is very proud of your Wikipedia J.D. law degree, but you are not getting any more of my time to contribute to your project and correct your obvious falsehoods and text that does not clearly appear to have been written by an English speaker familiar with Heidegger and able to name even a few of his main concepts. Please point me to the place in the article where even one of H's primary philosophical concepts are reasonably explained, so that a reader may have any idea of what he is after. The current page leaves everyone less intelligent and knowledgeable than they were before reading it. I promise you, that you are not getting even one minute more of my time in any event.  This article is so bad that it needs to be gone through paragraph by paragraphy and replaced my new content. Nearly every paragraph in it leaves the reader knowing less true things about Heidegger than the reader knew before. If you would like to actually know something about Heidegger, read the article I wrote. I managed to explain in the lead the main ideas which one needs to know about Heidegger. The current article does not even succesfully explain Heidegger's thought or his importance within the entire article, and inculcates a number of gross and vulgar misconceptions. It would be almost impossible to imagine a philosophy article that was filled with more sophmoric drivel, and reads like a machine-translated text of an undergraduate who has never read the author, and wishes to spread as much misinformation as possible. If you prefer reading an article that seems to claim that Heidegger has only been read in France and is unable to successfully name or explain EVEN A SINGLE ONE OF HEIDEGGER'S CONCEPTS, please by all means, waste your time on doing so. I am finished with this. Adieu.   """,0

National Journal rates Obama the single """"most liberal"""" member of the Senate last year, spotlighting some policy differences, as well as writing a GOP attack ad if he's the nominee, but perhaps also a helpful note in consolidating support on the left now.

The rating is a detailed, rigorous look across candidates' Senate records, and while Obama and Clinton are perceived as having similar Senate records, this suggests that Obama's record on the smaller, little-noticed votes has put him firmly to Clinton's left.

""":: I had the page watchlisted but was busy and wasn't paying much attention; it seems a edit-war brewed in the meantime. The current version seems to be """"accurate"""" but suffers from giving undue weight to the Johnson review, which is just one of many reviews of the book. Also it would be preferable to paraphrase Johnson accurately rather than quote it so extensively. I think piecemeal editing of the page is sure to restart another round of edit-warring, so I think it would be better to write a more encyclopedic criticism/review in toto and then invite comments. I'll try to do that, but it may be later in the week before I get down to it.

If you had taken the time to really discuss this, as has been happening on the page since the end of the block, I would have never stepped in and taken the actions I did.

 edits in Jan., 2012 

Thank you for recently updating this article. I hope you continue. This article has had many adverse edits in the past and I try to keep it within Wikipedia's standards.

If a statement with two facts is supported by a source and one fact and the source are updated, check whether the source is positioned in the sentence to make it look like the source also supports the other fact. Then be sure the source does support both facts. Otherwise, readers will be misled. If that source does not actually support the second fact, you should find a source for the second fact or preserve the original source and place or edit it so that readers will know which fact is supported by which source. If a fact does not have a source cited for it, the fact can be challenged, edited, or deleted by any editor (the exception being, as Wikipedians sometimes say, that no source is needed for the fact that """"the sky is blue"""", or for any fact not likely to be challenged). Much about HSA has been challenged in the past (possibly because of political dislike toward Dr. Moskowitz) and sourcing should be carefully done.

Sources should be secondary, meaning at least one level removed from personal experience. Usually, that means an independent third-party reliable source. By contrast, for example, SA's website is a primary source about SA. Self-statements are primary sources. Primary sources are allowed but must be used with greater care and generally should be shunned (except in the External Links section, for example). Try to find secondary sources wherever possible. Part of Wikipedia's standard is at WP:PSTS.

The lede (sometimes spelled """"lead"""") should be a summary of the body of the article, so it doesn't get a reference. Because the lede is a summary, any statement in the lede should essentially be in the body, too, so the reference should be positioned where the body's statement is.

A tendency to write an article like an advertisement sometimes crops up. The recent edits to this article were mild in that regard; I've seen a much more obvious case recently in another article. While this school network has remarkable achievements that should be described, legitimately sourced criticisms also have to be included or preserved. Articles that are too much like ads are subject to severe rewritings or reversions to earlier revisions, often by editors less familiar with the subject.

Ref elements generally follow punctuation. For example, we'd write, """"This is a fact,Source A. and this is another fact.Source B.""""

Images need alt texts, so that people who are blind or visually impaired can have their browsers read aloud information about a picture. The old image also lacked an alt text for a long time and now I've added one (I could have long ago but didn't get to it). If you create a new image and add it, please add an alt text with it.

Thank you again for your work.   """,0

Or whether the air is flowing around the airfoil, or the airfoil flying through air at rest (far from the airplane). This body of air has to be large (many chord lengths in diameter, say five or more), for the effects of the airfoil on the boundary to be small enough to be negligible (from a practical point of view; a case which not satisfies this is the ground effect where the boundary influences the kinematics and forces).    11:21, 28""",0

However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, their copyright should also be acknowledged.

As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already.

"Kid Lantern Question
I was the person to contribute the Kid Lantern article to the Waly West page.  Would it be more appropriate as trivia/note?  Sure it's not world shattering info but it's still encyclopedia material.  I believe that all info on articles are improtant whether they're big or small.

My Kid Lantern artcile, take a look at it:

Issue 3 of the miniseries Flash & Green Lantern: The Brave And The Bold has Flash, Kid Flash and Green Lantern in pursuit of Mirror Master and Black Hand.  In an attempt to steal Flash's speed, it is Kid Flash who loses his powers.  To help out, Green Lantern creates a temporary Power Ring for Wally to use, dubbing him Kid Lantern (With a costume, identical to Hal's.  Wally's head piece resembles his Kid Flash uniform).

Yes it's minor information, but does it contain the following?:

No it does not.

And I'm not so much upset about the deletion, but your reasoning.  In all of your time on wikipedia, do you ever help make someones eidt more appropriate?  By that I mean things like moving it somewhere else on the article, fixing/adjusting, anything other than deleting?

Keep in mind, following the rules doesn't mean always having to dump on other wikipedian or using them as stepping stones.

Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1970) is a R&B; and pop singer, songwriter, record producer and occasional actress of the 1990s and 2000s. Making her debut in 1990, she became the most successful and best-selling artist of the coming decade according to Billboard magazine and the World Music Awards. In 2000, the World Music Awards show named her the best-selling female recording artist of all time.

Carey is noted for her distinctive singing style that makes frequent use of melismas and other ornamentation, and she possesses a five-octave vocal range. She released a throng of number-one hits while signed to Columbia Records, formerly run by then-husband Tommy Mottola, and several of them broke chart records. By the turn of the millennium, however, Carey's popularity with critics and the public had entered decline, and she was dropped from her new record label following a highly-publicised physical breakdown and an unsuccessful foray into film. In 2005, Carey returned to the forefront of popular music with the release of the multi-platinum The Emancipation of Mimi.

Biography and music career
Early life and discovery
Carey was born in Huntington, New York. She is the third and youngest child of Patricia Hickey, a Catholic opera singer and voice coach of Irish-American descent, and Alfred Roy Carey (né Núñez), an aeronautical engineer of Afro-Venezuelan descent. She was named after the song """"And They Call the Wind Maria"""", from the musical Paint Your Wagon. Carey's siblings include her older sister Alison, and her older brother Morgan. As a multiracial family, the Carey household was met with racial slurs, hostility, and sometimes violence, causing the family to move frequently around the New York area. The strain on the family led to the divorce of Carey's parents when she was three years old. Carey had little contact with her father, and her mother worked several jobs to support the family.

Spending much of her time at home alone, Carey turned to music as an outlet. She began singing at the age of four, and first performed in public at the age of six. She began writing songs while in grade school, and her mother and the members of her opera company were impressed with her talents when Carey hit a cue note that her mother had missed. Carey attended and graduated from Oldfield Middle School and Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, although she was frequently absent due to efforts to break into the music business. After moving to New York City, she eventually landed a role as a backup singer for Brenda K. Starr.

In 1988, Carey met Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola at a party, where Starr gave him a demo tape. Mottola played the tape while leaving the party and was very impressed by what he heard. He returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. Nevertheless, Mottola tracked her down and signed her to a recording contract. This Cinderella-like story became part of the standard publicity surrounding Carey's entrance into the industry.

1990–1992: Early commercial success
Carey's professional music career began with the release of her eponymous debut album, Mariah Carey, in 1990. Carey co-wrote all of the compositions on her debut album with songwriter-producers such as Ric Wake and Rhett Lawrence, and would continue to co-write nearly all of her material for the rest of her career. The album debuted low on t",0

Again, I disagree. Scholarly consensus has been moving towards the direction of inclusiveness (particularly for the question of the Roma and the disable). In fact, as you go through modern academic literature (the last 20 years), """"Holocaust"""" more and more includes non-Jewish victims. Just an example: Alex Callinicos, from York University, (2001) The Holocaust isfor good reasons I need not rehearse heregenerally held to be the most extreme case of human evil. All the different kinds of domination fused together in Auschwitzracism, directed at Jews, Slavs, and Roma; the economic exploitation of slave labour; the oppression of gays and women; the persecution of dissenting minorities such as Communists and Jehovah's Witnesses. Or Slawomir Kapralski, """"Identity Building and the Holocaust: Roma Political Nationalism."""" I have already mentioned Sybil Milton (who was a senior historian at the Research Institute of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum), and Henry Friedlander, a leading Holocaust historian in the USA, is another important voice. This increasing consensus has had an impact on common language , as well on political bodies. See this press release from the UN, for instance. It is not a question of ranking victimsit is the concept of hte holocaust as a racist, mordern project, and the common fate of the victims. The famous pictures of Mengele's twins are of Roma children. The technology and expertise for mass murder was developed for the disable in the T4. The tactics of Eisengruppen were first developed in the invasion of Poland, against Polish leaders. I have seen several good arguments that convinced me of the centrality of Jews in the Holocaust; I have never seen a convincing argument for their exclusivity.
If this is not enough, let me try in another way: by deciding to describe the Holocaust as an 'exclusive' Jewish event, wikipedia is taking sides in a ongoing scholarly debate (I could say on the 'declining' side of an ongoing scholarly debate). this is NOT holocaust denial, with no legitimacy in the academia, and it must receive more than mere lip service in the body of the text or in the footnotes.

"""Forgetting about the in-depth meaning of the verse 34 in Islam==
From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An-Nisa,_34
In the Qur'an, verse 34 of Surah an-Nisa (abbreviated as 4:34) concerns the issue of marital relations in Islam. This verse is interpreted by some Muslims as giving women a degree of autonomy over their own income and property but obliging them to comply with the husband's wishes should they be congruent with Islamic principles and beneficial to the marriage. The verse is also interpreted to mean that men are also obliged to be responsible for maintenance of their female relatives.[1]

There are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original, and all vary to some extent. [2]Some Muslims, such as Islamic feminist groups, argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for domestic violence.[3] However, some have translated """"beat"""" as """"separate"""", as Arabic in its nature is a multi-meaning language, and as such no word has a fixed sole meaning.[4]

Ibn Abbas, a companion of Muhammad, wrote the earliest commentary on the Quran, and to this part he himself said this is only a light tap.[5] When asked about the light hitting, he said it refers to using a siwak (toothbrush). There are sources that say that Muhammad himself never hit a woman and forbade it.[6] Furthermore, Muhammad commented on this verse, where he said “a light tap that leaves no mark.”[7]

Bismillah any foundation presupposes faith in it.  To be neutral since Wikipedia rejected-refused to admit the purity of Islam even so much on the issue of pictures of Muhammad by obscurantism for anybody can take a cultural-archeological find from syncretism and be incorrect in their interpretation when it is outside the framework of custom then logically it must either delete in totality the reference on Muhammad or the position of neutrality of Wikipedia. One deliberate misrepresentation of Muhammad in word or fact is your seated choice in the domain with its range of fire.  On Islam any is free to express that history in point and counterpoint.

So, with the lack of clear evidence, it is a Schrodinger's Cat situation. By which I mean that, from that point in the storyline, R can be seen as both R AND F, even though they started out as two different people.

"Losses and the Luftwaffe after the Battle of Britain 

In the 'Aftermath' section, it is noted:  In losses of aircraft and experienced aircrew, the battle was a blow from which the Luftwaffe never fully recovered. It had significantly fewer bombers at the start of Operation Barbarossa, some 929 machines, because of losses sustained over Britain.Bergström 2007, p. 129.

I am not sure if that is what Bergström, who is being referenced here, actually writes, as I do not have access to his books. I doubt it, however. The Luftwaffe frontline strenght certainly did not decrease as a result of the Battle of Britain, as reinforcements and production was more than sufficient to replace losses, and, to replace the existing types with more modern type of aircraft, withdrawing the older models (ie. by the start of Barbarossa, much of the 109E fleet was now replaced by the new 109F).

It is also contestable on grounds of Luftwaffe reported strenghts. Olaf Groehler, in 1975, for example reports the LW frontline strenght (not including a lot of aux. and non-combat oriented units) gives the LW strenght as 5298 on 11 April 1940 (before the Western Campaigns), of which 1356 were S-E fighters, 1711 being bombers and 414 being dive bombers. A day before Barbarossa, 21 June 1941, he reports 5599 aircraft, (ie. some 300 aircraft increase) including 1440 S-E fighters, another 263 in a new category, the night-fighters, 1511 bombers and 424 dive bombers. Therefore the claim that only 929 bombers were in the Luftwaffe (which I suspect is a misunderstanding of the original text) is wrong, as is the conclusion that this was due to some 'irreversible blow' suffered during the BoB. It may well be that 929 or so bombers were employed against Russia, while the others elsewhere in the West and in the Med. In any case, the claim that the BoB was some sort of a death blow to the LW lacks solid foundation. It certainly suffered considerable losses, as did the RAF which lost apprx. 100% of the fighter and bomber force it started the Battle with, but even in absolute terms those losses were not irrecoverable; the LW already lost about the same number of aircraft during the two months of the Battle of France as it did during the four months of the Battle of Britain; yet it was was capable of launching the BoB offensive just a month later, as it was capable of seizing complete air dominance over the Eastern front in 1941. Therefore I think that particular sentence is contenstable and should be removed.",0

Editor hrafn and the campaign to efface pages on sprituality and New Thought
I just found this page by taking a tour of pages that editor hrafn has recently started editing. Hrafn appears to be a single-purpose editor who removes material from pages that present biographies of, and books by, Christians and New Thought writers. Examples of inexperienced editors seeking help from a more exerienced editor when entire pages were found to be deleted (without prior discussion) or redirected (with loss of data) or merged (with loss of data) by hrafn are here,  here,  here,  here, and   here. See also the edit history of Wallace Wattles and Charles F. Haanel and their related discussion pages. Hrafn claims to merely be """"enforcing verifiability"""" of biography pages, but the only pages he targets are those related to Christianity and New Thought. He summarily deletes material without discussion. He cuts biography lengths by 50% to 75% and then nominates the articles for deletion based on the """"non-notability"""" of the bio subject. He has on one occasion deleted an entire page without discussion. It is very likely that, as evidence of his campaign of effacement and deletion is accumulated and follows him, he will either stop engaging in this practice or be proposed for blockage from editing spirituality and/or religion articles. If you know of other instances of his deletions and effacements, please list them. Thank you for your attention. catherine yronwode a.k.a. """"64"""" 64.142.90.33  """,0

 Hello Alun, thank you for your contribution. Can I put two points to you, firstly in relation to editing against consensus, to answer """"yes"""" - it is possible to edit against consensus. People like me stand on my own two feet, stand up to scrutiny, stand up to debate and discussion, stand up to a weight of opinion against me and stand behind my name and only my name each time I weigh in with my opinion. It is my belief that many others however employ sockpuppets to corroborate and support their point of view which in my view is a very cowardly and dishonourable method of """"argeing"""" one's point. This is the reason why you can edit against consensus, because if there was a stipulation against it, the victim of the stipulation would employ the use of sockpuppets.

Bogorm, you really need to discuss your changes on the talk page.  You are making some fundamental editing errors which would need to be cleaned up sooner or later, and the fact that you keep reverting to your version is getting disruptive.  Also, please try to find sources other than Presstv.ir, as they have a conflict of interest in this subject and thus may not be the most trustworthy of sources.  If other sources are saying the same thing it is much more persuasive to the readers of this article.    
 I am not interested in American stance towards the PressTV and I urge you not to remove the source. If your obstinacy towards removing """"numerous"""" and """"augmented"""" is inexorable, I should """"die Flinte ins Korn werfen"""", as the Germans say, and laissez-faire... . But I assure you I am habitually not so amenable as in this matter. Besides, it's the above mentioned POV towards PressTV that I find disruptive. But methinks Wikipedia is more than copying from sources and if the Iranian which wrote the artcle, preferred to express himself about augmenting in Simple English, that does not interdict us from rendering his words in a more elaborate manner, does it??? And this is not the Wikipedia in Simple English, is it? Ah, one more thing - as most speculators are not Iranians, methinks it's beyond the """"La Manche"""" that most conflicts of interest are engendered...   

Have you at any time used any other user name
Your style of editing is not that of someone who has just started editing Wikipedia. Have you at any time used any other user name?   
 No, I have not. But I acquired experience while editing in the Bulgarian Wikipedia and Bogorm is since approximately one month the global name for all other language-editions of Wikipedia, where I am active, it is not only the bg Wikipedia.

Utter nonsense showing exactly what is wrong with Wikipedia

This article reads like a press release, and uncritically accepts the claim that the CL is a """"civil rights"""" organization whose primary purpose is fighting """"bigotry"""", when in fact they attack anyone who criticizes any aspect of Catholicism no matter how politely or correctly, they actively proselytize for Catholicism as the one true religion, and their leader William Donohue, who is for all practical purposes their only member, has made numerous anti-Jewish statements. It is also a lie to say that the CL is a lay organization not controlled by the Church, when in fact their office is located within the Archdiocese of New York's headquarters and they work closely with the Archbishop to coordinate media strategies.

The NPOV and anti-libel policy on Wikipedia has become an """"accept anything everyone says without blinking an eye and don't criticize anyone on relevant grounds"""" policy because none of the editors here actually know anything about the subjects of the articles. If someone who was not a fifteen-year-old anime-watching idiot could actually become an administrator around here, maybe we could see an article on the Catholic League actually discuss what the Catholic League is known for in American politics. Instead, we get nonsense criticism sections telling us things like what PETA thinks of Beyonce Knowles, while anything of actual relevance to the world today is declawed for fear of """"offending"""" people who don't like the truth or for being sued for libel due to a poor understanding of the law.

Bugging America

The Liberties of the Subject

By WERTHER

The overwhelming balance of recorded history has been marked by despotism. When homo sapiens sapiens transitioned from hunter gatherer to agriculturalist, he gained literacy, solid dwellings, and other accoutrements of what is commonly considered civilization. But he experienced a sharp decline in personal liberty.

The reasons for this are commonsensical. Disputes between tribes of hunter gatherers could be resolved by one or the other simply pulling up stakes and relocating to a new territory, there being few material impedimenta to prevent them. A settled agricultural existence, on the other hand, implied permanent villages, granaries, and land boundaries to be defended against depredation. The need for defenses implied a national security state. Agricultural surpluses not only necessitated armed defense, but allowed a division of labor leading to policemen, soldiers, bureaucrats, and tax assessors, the latter of whom would confiscate a percentage of the harvest.

The evolution of labor conditions also implied a different mental outlook. The hunter gatherer was an independent contractor (if not brigand) who ranged over extensive territory and worked alone or in small groups. The agricultural laborer, by contrast, toiled in one spot, making his comings and goings more subject to regulation.

If the land was not his, he became dependent on the Big Man's favor. Given the increased population densities in regions where agricultural societies developed, he could only rarely strike out on his own: the good land had been already taken, and game animals cleared or hunted to local extinction. [1]

With the rise of what Karl Wittfogel call """"hydraulic civilization,"""" [2] the screw of oppression turned once again against personal liberty. In order to build the extensive earthworks necessary for the state to survive the next drought or flood, the rulers of these proto-superpowers subjected their subjects to enforced toil and off-duty regimentation which rendered them no more free than so many draft animals.

It is unlikely the rulers of the states in the Valley of Mexico, the Nile, the Euphrates, the Ganges, or the Yang-Tze had much toleration for the complaints their subjects, who were enslaved, enserfed, or otherwise regimented for the greater good as defined by the states' rulers. These complaints, had they been permitted, would have constituted freedom of speech.

Nor would the rulers have given credence to a peasant's assertion that the interior of his crude dwelling, and the contents thereof, were inviolate from the inquisitiveness of the state. He, the peasant, simply had no rights a ruler was bound to respect (to paraphrase what a former Supreme Court Justice once said about slaves in a famous ruling in 1857); the only limit on a ruler's power over his subjects was the former's fear of rebellion should discontent overflow.

Of the two rights discussed thus far, freedom of speech and freedom from arbitrary search and seizure, the latter is fundamentally more important to human beings' maintaining a status above that of mere hive animals. This is not intended in any way to disparage the desirability and necessity of free speech. But there are practical circumstances when free speech is not exercised by reasonable peopledue to reticence, shame, or its merely being not worth the effort. Or when one is married.

Much obnoxious and exhibitionistic behavior is rationalized as free speech, while more urgent matters are suppressed: how many hourly employees feel free to say what they really think of their supervisors, and is the resultant lawsuit really covered by the First Amendment? But asinine reality TV blares on. Out of politeness or discretion, most intelligent people censor their opinions about politics, in-laws, bosses, and religion when they are in the public commons.

The inviolability of one's person, and one's dwelling, is more basic. What would the average person resent more: being told he cannot ask questions of the President of the United States at a staged event, or being ordered to be strip searched in public? Or, for that matter, have his house ransacked? That is the principle at issue. The lesser freedom is essential for political discourse, the greater freedom distinguishes us from dogs. [3]

Respect for privacy, for oneself and one's fellow citizens, is the benchmark of a sense of an individual self. The majority of psychologically well adjusted people believes that there are facts and circumstances about them that just do not bear the glaring searchlight of public revelation. Some things are simpl",0

I dont want to pressurise you more. You have already helped me a lot.  but carefully ...... read my talk page at bottom & what I have answered to Keeper76 & Aleta.......
Dear Aleta, 
You are right. I respect you a lot for you have supported my page without knowing me. You see, Aleta ,  I am a human not god. it's question of creditability  not only mine but also of an entity – identity  in question. I provided all the facts what so ever was demanded by wikipedian editors or opposers. But without investigating /verifying my news/reviews on Sonee , the administrator ruthlessly  deleted it under influence of  4-5 people. Have they kept  two lines over there on the person in question. I would had not raised my voice. Frustration & fighting for my democratic rights are two different issue. You can put me in any slot. It’s your view and mind. However ,  This might be an inspiration from  Sonee to me or person like Gandhi where person has to fight his  battle alone. Without dying no body can enjoy heaven. I have learnt form such people –if  you  are certain to certify self  reasoning or common sense considering it  ethically right then  least care what might the world think of you. One should act and speak right. & that’s what I am doing here. Few people have label my writing as soap box, unreliable etc… God bless them. They don’t know  about the person what revolution his voice is going to influence the world in future. Jesus, Kabir  did not changed the world in a day. No wikipedia was there then to suppress such voices or sharing their info. Strangely Good or  ridiculously bad human one day are in scripted in history. May be Jesus or Bin Laden. So my suggestion to you as a well wisher is never leave your good deed, Person like Graeme & You are rare angel breed. I can feel from my inner sense of little wisdom . I may or may not raise the page on Sonee as my mood is very upset @ present, but ever if couple of you angels feel to raise Sonee page once again any of  your good selves can go contribute for the betterment of world welfare deeds.  Try it. You will get a peaceful sleep. Because real angels never sleep unless they help a true person in difficulty successfully. They don’t leave the victim in middle of ocean.  I am fed up putting my points clicking reading all wiki pages. I  have gone mad to convince them. It’s just writing on sand.

 read the truth at http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

Regarding the writer at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_salute

    Mr Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is """"covered up"""" by people and also people often refer to it as the """"Nazi-Soviet"""" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as """"Nazis"""" (they did not refer to themselves as """"Nazis"""").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as """"It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!""""  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word """"Nazi"""" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the Nazi-Soviet pact page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase """"National Socialist."""" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment """"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!""""   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name """"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"""" and also used the term """"Communist"""" instead of using the term """"Socialist.""""  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether the salutes dictated particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide including in Germany. 

    Yes, the """"Roman salute"""" page did once contain innaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to start going on with his use of the term """"conspiracy."""" It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.  

    The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who """"became wiser"""", by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.  Dr. Curry has also publicly challenged Martin Winkler to debate these issues.  Professor Curry's discovery that the swastika/hakenkreuz, although an ancient symbol, was sometimes used by the National Socialist German Workers' Party as """"S"""" shapes standing for its """"Socialism"""" is also his own original work. And he is right that other writers have deliberate",0

You seem to be arguing that wikipedia should categorize this article as """"mythology"""", because your source is that Encyclopedia Britannica categorizes """"Leviathan"""" as mythology.

But wikipedia should be neutral, and should not use such biased and non-neutral language to take sides and declare any one scripture to be """"mythology"""", your own pov notwithstanding.  It must not take any stand whatsoever on whether it is historical or mythological, but should just present all the evidence and let readers make up their own mind instead of trying to make it up for them.  Your attempts to use wikipedia as a platform for pushing one pov against another are going to be resisted.

 False Photograph 

What is written in the article is untrue. There was only ONE photograph taken of Baha'u'llah, not two. The one photograph taken is the one on that is on display in the archives in Haifa. I have seen this picture, and the picture shown on this website is neither the same picture, nor is it a picture of the same personage. The claims that this photograph is a photograph of Baha'u'llah are false. The person in this photograph bears no physical resemblance to the personage in the photograph on display in the archives. Their ages appear to be the same, so the dissimilarity in resemblence cannot be ascribed to age differences in the same person.
I'm going to correct the text on display claiming """"two pictures"""" were taken of this historical figure, and am going to remove the picture. Quite frankly, all this debate is quite ridicules. I respect the Baha'is right to respect the Manifestations of God by not portraying their images publically, but they seem a bit too defensive. THeir all worried about showing his picture publicaly, and this isnt even his picture. Apparently this picture has been distributed, even among Baha'is. These people havent even seen the picture in the archives. I cannot emphasize how different in appearance the two personages in the two photographs are. Why do you think they never show the archives picture online? Or never show the two photographs together? Because it would be obvious that one of them is a false picture.
Thank you.

To quote the Baha'i World Centre:
""""In one of His epistles, 'Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of Bahá'u'lláh, wrote that two photographs of Bahá'u'lláh were taken, both in Adrianople, Turkey, each in a different pose. There are copies of both pictures at the Bahá'í World Centre and one of these is displayed in the International Archives where it is viewed by Bahá'í pilgrims. The image reproduced on the Web site in question seems to be a poor reproduction of one of these photographs.""""(Office for Public Information, 1999 Sept 04, Photo of Baha'u'llah on Web Site)

"It was not my intent to editorialize the article on Marcel Lefebvre, but I was trying to correct and add some information about him.  I did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a pro-Lefebvre position as well.  I felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about Lefebvre.  The two people who I called arch conservative were exactly that.  Both men tried to derail the Second Vatican Council, and fought both John XXIII and Paul VI and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way.  I don't know if Thomas Jefferson actually said this or not, it was a quote the Jefferson character made in the movie 1776 that he felt that King George III was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the Declaration of Independance, so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant.  And I have talked to Catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals - especially in the times before the Second Vatican Council.  Why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church?  It was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity.  I remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while, he didn't exactly what his grandfater's reasons were, but he said it probably wasn't hard to guess why.

Even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass, it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way, that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass, but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article.

Factual accuracy

There are at least three ways to view these events.  Let """"a=Persecution of Christians by some Jews; A=Institutional persecution of Christians by Jews; let B=Christian persecution of Jews

First, the perspective that we all reject: The Jews persecuted the Christians and this justifies 2000 years of Christian anti-semitism.  This is """"A happened AND A justifies B"""".

Second, the perspective that is, I believe, the mainstream position: Some Jews persecuted the Christians.  Enough so that the Christians viewed this or, at least, cast this as an institutional rejection of Christianity (culminating the hypothesized Council of Jamnia).  The polemic and conflict arising out of this sectarian conflict colored Christian attitudes, policies and behavior towards Jews for the next 2000 years.  This anti-Semitism is rooted in the original conflict between Jews and Christians during the formative years of early Christianity.  However, most people today reject the notion of the events providing any legitimate justification for anti-Semitism.  This is """"A happened; A was used to justify B BUT many people argue A does not justify B"""".

Third, the perspective that some liberal theologians are pushing: The NT account is ahistorical because there is no corroborating evidence outside the New Testament or the writings of the church fathers.  (Note:  Forgive me if I am overstating the position.)  According to this perspective, the persecutions either never happened or were exaggerated by either the NT authors or later interpreters of the NT authors.  For example, it is possible that the incidents in the NT represent isolated incidents and do not represent an institutional policy.  Later events (post Bar Kokhba) may have led to a re-interpretation of the isolated events into a perception of institutional policy.  This is """"A never happened; a happened; A was used to justify B BUT many people argue A does not justify B"""".

I believe that all of these perspectives (yes, even the first one) should be presented in the article.  We should give """"due weight"""" to each perspective citing sources who support each view. 

Finally, I think that we are agreed that we should not say """"Jews persecuted the Christians"""" but rather """"According to the NT, Jews persecuted the Christians"""".  If this formulation were used uniformly throughout the article, would there still be a dispute over factual accuracy?

The crown prosecution service charged the gang with 75 charges relating to twenty six girls, ranging from rape to intimidating witnesses, though police believed there were many more victims. The men were charged in three separate trials. 

 Name  Conviction Abid Mohammed Saddique  rape, sexual assault, sexual activity with a child, perverting the course of justice, aiding and abetting rape, false imprisonment, making child pornography Romaan Liaqat   rape, sexual assault, aiding and abetting rape, affray, sexual activity with a child, making child pornography Akshay Kumar    making child pornography Faisal Mehmood   sexual activity with a child  Mohammed Imran Rehman   rape Graham Blackham  breaches of Sexual Offender Prevention Order 

I think that the following need to be made clear as the have quite an impact upon how content is presented and also perceived. 
 There were three trials over many months. Clarity needed. 
 The trails were covered by reporting restrictions - that affects what is reported here.
 Full details of the trials are not public domain due to the need to protect victims - UK Law Applies. 

Big Questions - 
 Does the table give undue prominence? 
 Who should be included - all accused - only the guilty - only those assessed as guilty of sexual offences - what are the criteria to be used?
 Should it list only charges found Guilty or should all charges including not guilty and dismissed be listed? 
 The Jury were unable to reach verdicts in all charges and the judge ordered they were to be left lie on file for future retrial should new evidence arise  - this needs to be addressed as it is a legal reality and on record.

Should the table address sentencing rather than charges? This may seem a cop out, but I have to point to the rights of Victims to use Wiki and not be abused by overly detailed content which does not add to overall reality. Footnotes can direct those who need full details to external sources.

"""== Changes to intro ==
I changed the intro making it very simple and clear.  
Wow! I suppose that I was totally wrong about that one!  

A comparable analogy to an IP address is a telephone number. On a telephone network, the phone numbers must be unique. Generally speaking, each location has one phone number that allows anyone to dial that phone directly by using their unique phone number. Likewise, a computer is assigned a unique IP address which let's any other computer to connect directly to it by using their unique IP address. In reality, it is possible for a location to have multiple phone numbers (perhaps primarily larger businesses) and a computer can also be assigned multiple IP addresses which is pretty cool.

V.S.

A computer’s IP address is very much like a telephone number; they are both unique and allow communications with local or remote network devices. Much like a multi-line telephone, a network device may have multiple IP addresses assigned to it.

Consider that a telephone number is """"persistent"""" rather than """"transient"""", and the telephone number, in conventional telephony, to a physical pair of wires. The pair of wires may change due to repair or moves to a new location, but the telephone number stays the same. 

A DNS name is persistent while an IP address, if dynamically assigned, can be transient. The closer analogy to telephone number is DNS name, not IP address. The IP address, in turn, may map, on a LAN, to a MAC address.  

I think the latter is better suited but what do I know, anyhow?
 

""""local or remote network devices"""" makes no sense for telephones.  Shorter is not clearer.  

Local and long distance call makes no sense? What about LAN vs. WAN connection?  

Local and long distance calls are an artificial dichotomy created by phone companies so they can charge for larger network usage.  LAN, MAN, CAN, WAN, etc. are also an artificial categorization also for administrative purposes.

Telephone calls between countries, between (North American) area codes, between exchanges, and between lines in the same exchange are quite different in terms of the hierarchical switching model in use. In like manner, the concepts of IP address aggreggation/supernetting versus subnetting are quite distinct.  

Local or remote phone numbers do not make sense and neither does local or remote network devices in IP addresses.  The closest is the localhost but that's entirely different.

Like I said, your shorter version is much less clear because you're using incorrect terminology.  

Dear Cburnett: I made new and improved changes... Thanks  

First: a street address is too complicated.  Second: a phone number is too complicated.  Third: a book index is too complicated.  What's next?  My opinion of this is that you really want to dumb down this analogy.  Each step you change the example to make it simpler but at the same time to the point of using incorrect terminology.  This is getting really tiring.

Explaining a technical concept does not require using grunts, chest beatings, and wall paintings.  

Cburnett: I really liked your last edit; the concept that is, and I made some minor changes that I feel will enable the reader to better understand the basic concept of an IP address via minor syntax changes.  

Great, but why do you keep deleting the colloquial usage?  
 I removed it because it was not significant; why explain """"what an IP address is not"""" in so many words? Although I do agree with your accurate statement about """"IP"""" being incorrectly used as an abbreviation for """"IP address"""", it is merely not applicable as an introductory item - this is why I clinically deleted it.  

Cburnett: I removed the """"colloquial usage"""" line.

"Table in need of reconstruction 

The tables looks excessively messed up:

The table takes up far too much scrolling space due to the multiple data fields, esp. the Pony Description.
There are far too many colours and some dark colours make text hard to read.
Minor characters are mixed up with the major characters.

In answer to these problems:

I suggest putting long boxes under each row of pony characteristics for the descriptions, sort of like a standard TV Episode list, the description box being the equivalent of a summary box. That way the description boxes don't stretch the cells downward so much.
For consistency sake, the number of colours need to be reduced. I don't see the point of picking that many. If you're intending to make the colours match the body colour of the ponies, it is not going well since half the colours don't match the respective pony. If you insist on darker colours, make the text white, so that is readable.
If Minor characters have to be shown because they had their own toy as well as animated appearance, I suggest marking the Major characters with some sort of Indication like Italics.

 Double Standard 

Cybershore, I've blocked you for a week for your last comment at Talk:Brazil.  You've been warned numerous times about personal attacks and yet you have persisted.  I have tried to help you, but I'm concerned about your behavior.  When your block expires, you may return to the discussion, but I strongly recommend you refrain from attacking other editors and try to be more concise with your comments.  Considering your ability with the English language it would be best to try to write shorter simpler comments.  
Cybershore, after carefully looking over your additions to the article (even with my changes to your grammer), I see that they are redundant and add nothing, while making some things less clear.  I oppose their addition.  

What """"additions"""" specifically you're talking about (so I can adjust or respond)?
Why, again this double standard behavior related just to one part; since, I answered all the objections one by one, while the seriously and gravely accusation made ​​up by me, and proved, repeatedly, throughout this year and a half about spurious quote remains ignored???

And Please answer this time:

1) Is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances?

2) In the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral, which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime (monarchical, military, etc.) whatever be?
Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???

3) Which group of honest editors ...who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it? 
  
Your statements are very hard to understand.  I don't know what """"spurioness"""" means in English.  Once your block expire you may make your case clearly on the talk page, but do not edit war to include your changes to the article.  Consensus is opposed to these changes.  I've looked carefully at your suggested changes and find them to be inferior to the original content, muddling issues and making the entire section less clear.  This seems to have political implications to you, but as a neutral party I do not see them.  The current version seems to be neutral.

What a curious II, that an administrator of an electronic publication simply """"doesn't know"""" such meaning... Oh!
Well, may be | this or | this can help you remin... understand what spuriousness means. Not mention  the 3rd paragraph of  this link in Brazil Talk Page about an famous example of writer's misquotations, fabricated quotes, fake quotes or whatever term you prefer...

"The explanation that this map can illustrate the views of Venizelos or any other Greek makes no sense to me. You can illustrate his views making a map which shows proposed Greek borders according Venizelos' claims at different time. The demographic maps should be supported with at least some evidence and there is no evidence that the Greeks were such as majority in Thrace as shown in that particular map. I have pointed sources according to the census in Eastern Rumelia, according to Erickson and suggested to search for the election of the first Ottoman national assembly of 1908. 
That is as if let's say that Bulgaria currently claims that 2,000,000 Greeks in northern Greeks are Bulgarians. Does it mean that in the demographic article of Greece we should also include a map which shows those people as Bulgarians in order to illustrate the Bulgarian view? That would make no sense since according to the census those people say they are Greeks. (That is just example, a ridiculous one)

 74 persons conspired against the KIng Osiris 

""""The best exoteric account of the legend (of Osiris) is preserved for us by Plutarch in his treatise De Iside et Osiride written in Greek about the middle of the first century of our era, a large portion of which is substantiated by the Egyptian hieroglyphic texts which have been deciphered by scholars.

Osiris was a wise king in Egypt who set himself to civilize the people and redeem them from their former states of barbarism. He taught them the cultivation of the earth, gave them a body of laws, and instructed them in the worship of the gods. Having made his own land prosperous, he set out in like manner to teach the other nations of the world. During his absence, the land of Egypt was so well ruled by his wife Isis, that his jealous brother Typhon (Set), the personification of evil, as Osiris was the personification of good, could do no harm in his kingdom; but on the return of Osiris to Egypt, Typhon made a conspiracy against him, persuading 72 other persons to join him, together with a certain Queen of Ethiopia named Aso, who chanced to be in Egypt at the time (74 altogether)...

 Wikimedia blog post 

Hello, everyone.  Trying to be as polite and good faithy as possible here this morning.  I hope I won't be smited for pointing something out again.  The current Wikimedia Foundation blog post is Wikipedia for Schools Project.  The blog talks about how Wikipedia for Schools was born out of SOS Children.  It's a great project, providing underprivileged kids in the Third World with curated, age-appropriate content from Wikipedia.  But when you go to see who wrote the Wikipedia articles about the organization and the program, one can see the all too familiar pattern of editorial dominance by conflict-of-interest accounts.  Two days ago, a big chunk of content was added to SOS Children's Villages UK by User:RWilcox11.  Rainbow Wilcox happens to be Website Content Editor at SOS Children.  No disclosure by RWilcox11, so if that is indeed Ms. Wilcox, the edits are in violation of the Wikimedia Foundation's Terms of Use of this site.  Similarly, on Monday (the day the new Terms of Use went into effect), User:Rory.soschildren was working on the article.  Rory Hughes Social Media Marketer for SOS Children.  In a bit of contrast, User:JamieG01 identifies himself on his Talk page as follows, """"I work for an international children's charity called SOS Children"""", so we can assume this is Jamie Goodland who received """"special thanks"""" in the WMF blog post.  Likewise, User:DuncanHarris identifies on his User page, """"I am entirely responsible for the technical work on the 2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. This work was funded by SOS Children UK (part of the world's largest orphan charity).""""  And User:BozMo identifies (as Andrew Cates) on his User page with, """"I also worked from 2004-2013 (part time as CEO) for the charity SOS Children.""""

Might I make a recommendation?  Now that the new Terms of Use is coming up on its first week of implementation, maybe someone from the Wikimedia blog staff could make it a point, that whenever they are featuring a person or an organization that has a relevant Wikipedia article, that part of the blogger's responsibility is to reach out to any potentially conflicted editors representing the blog subject, to ask them to self-identify per the new Terms of Use, so that the Wikimedia blog is not inadvertently showcasing violators of the Terms of Use of the Foundation's project.  To do my part, I will be happy to reach out now to Users RWilcox11 and Rory.soschildren, to let them know of this conversation.  (So, it would be nice if it isn't deleted or hatted.) -   """,0

These all seem to be reasonable solutions, if a little stop-gappy.  I think my problem is that I am seeing this as an outsider to this UK group and the UK group might be seeing the article as a group of insiders writing for insiders.  My initial problem with the article was that it is unclear and allows different incompatible readings.  """"Administrative geography"""" certainly makes the article more consistent, but I'm not sure it makes the title more understandable (unless, of course, you are a geographer or know all the branches of geography).  To benefit neophytes (perhaps I presume too much in thinking this is the intended audience of wikipedia and any other encyclopedia articles) on the subject which this article addresses, I would make the following suggestions.  1) Gut as much of the introduction as possible regarding the four countries and, instead, refer people to that article (since it already exists; which would also resolve some problems people have with repetition between these two articles.  2) Explain what """"administrative geography"""" addresses (e.g., national and local government hierarchies) and how this relates to this article.  3) For the love of God, rename (to whatever is appropriate) the section entitled """"In the UK"""" (or eliminate this title) because it serves no purpose whatsoeverperhaps to """"contemporary administration"""" or something that transitions from """"History""""; although for reasons beyond my comprehension, some people are apparently wedded till death to that vacuous phrase (i.e., In the UK).  4) Move the last paragraph of the Intro (beginning with """"Historically..."""") to the History section or exapnd on the themes it introduces. 5) Identify the referent of """"This structure"""" in the History section (i.e., answer the question, """"What structure?"""").  6) Follow strict style guidelines for the terms """"division[s]"""" and """"subdivision[s]"""" throughout this article if either is a significant concept for this article.  7) Incorporate the """"Parliamentary representation"""" section into the section preceding it.  This would give a structure of [Introduction], History, Contemporary Administration (or whatever), Informal (Sub)Divisions, International (Sub)Divisions. As things stand, having a separate section for informal divisions suggests the rest of the article is about formal divisions, which would be fine if the sections reflected a more transparent and sensible organization to the article currently lacking.

He failed to achieve cumulative average score for his favorite school he always dreamt of, at age 17. He was arrested when 24, interrogated for days and put in solitary cell confinement for two months. He was 25 when sent to exile. When his colleague associate and close friend that is one year older than him was declared a hero by the association that he was serving, nobody noted him. When he was fighting to save cities from foreign occupations at age 30, his hometown fell to the enemy. His superior lobbied for him to be sent away to get rid of him when he was 30. He was left idle at his new location and could not get paid for months. He was in a hospital in Vienna for renal treatment confined to a bed for months lonely when he was 37. When returned to work, the army he would command was disbanded. He was fired by the Minister of Defense at age 38. He owned no civilian clothes to wear, no money saved and had to borrow a coat from a friend. An arrest warrant was issued for him the same year. A death order was issued for him when 39. He became the President of the Turkish republic when he was 42. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk read 18 thousand volumes of books in which over 200 000 lines are highlighted. Tens of thousands of sidenotes were entered. When found with red weepy eyes, he said his only worry was burning eyes which he took care of yards of soft fabric he'd ordered by his side to dry his eyes. He put his signature under the biggest changes and revolutions of his time. His farewell was equally impressive and touching with the last words of ‘.. and peace be upon you..’ in the morning of November 10, 1938 when Turkey was just waking up.""",0

  Addiction is a choice made by the user 

The following is at the start of the article:

This can make freebase drugs even more powerfully """"addictive"""" than their salt equivalents, bearing in mind that addiction is a choice made by the user.

That addiction is a choice made by the user rather than a dependency caused by alterations in the brain's chemistry is clearly an unorthodox view to say the least, so I propose removing it ASAP. 

 I vote it be removed under NPOV.  Oh, wait.  This whole point and counter point are totally off-topic- they belongs in e.g. addiction.

The RMS Titanic was an Olympic-class passenger liner owned by British shipping company White Star Line and built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, United Kingdom. For her time, she was the largest passenger steamship in the world.

On the night of 14 April 1912, during the ship's maiden voyage, Titanic hit an iceberg and sank two hours and forty minutes later, early on 15 April 1912. The sinking resulted in the deaths of 1,517 people, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. The high casualty rate was due in part to the fact that, although complying with the regulations of the time, the ship did not carry enough lifeboats for everyone aboard. The ship had a total lifeboat capacity of 1,178 people, although her capacity was 3,547. A disproportionate number of men died due to the women-and-children-first protocol that was followed.

The Titanic used some of the most advanced technology available at the time and was popularly believed to have been described as """"unsinkable.""""[6] It was a great shock to many that, despite the extensive safety features and experienced crew, the Titanic sank. The frenzy on the part of the media about Titanic's famous victims, the legends about the sinking, the resulting changes to maritime law, and the discovery of the wreck have contributed to the continuing interest in, and notoriety of, the Titanic.

 External forcing 

This refers.  It would be useful to explain this term better (I have a comment further up the talk page).  Does it refer to any process external to the climate?  Including thought processes?  Or to processes that have some effect on the climate.  Also it is highly confusing to have a section titled 'radiative forcing' when it begins with a (bad) definition of external forcing.  My point is a logical one only.  Also, do you agree with my comments on the GW talk page where I argue for more explanation of the reasons scientists believe in GW.  Also a better definition of GW. Is it (a) the fact that instrument temperatures are on average higher than a century ago (b) a process that underlies that fact (c) the hypothesis that the process has an anthropogenic cause?  These are all different things. (a) could be true because of random fluctuations (b) could be true if the process were a natural one.  Again, my points are only logical and definitional ones, I have no view on the science.   18:",0

Holy crap.. Lest someone mistakenly visit a talk page, expecting to read some truth and hence be confused reading this gentleman's comment and mistaking the writer for someone who knows what they're talking about, I'd just like to point out the above explanation for the word """"handicap"""" is complete bollocks. handicap has meant """"to place at a disadvantage"""" for a long long time. According to Merriam Webster, the etymology is """"Etymology:
    obsolete English handicap, a game in which forfeit money was held in a cap, from hand in cap"""", which obviously has nothing at all to do with being """"Handy with a cap"""" or even related to the disabled. Certain individuals may have a negative connotation with the use of the term, which happens merely due to the words close association with 1960's era community welfare practices, but that is an individuals choice to associate negativity with the word, not the words fault at all.

 outline articles 

I read your posts about outlines on AnnaFrance's talk page and decided to call the military history project for help in establishing guidance and providing review processes where editors can get outside opinion. The thread can be found here. Greetings   

Historical outlines
Regarding Category:Historical outlines...

I still strongly believe those """"Historical outline of foo"""" articles should actually be named """"Timeline of foo"""". More accurate and precise, and perhaps comprehensible. (I mentioned it before somewhere, but can't find it now).

For an example, compare Outline of Illinois history with Timeline of Chicago history.

Maybe we need to upgrade List of timelines to be a part of the Portal:Contents/ set?

Just a note, for you to consider, whilst you're mass-moving things around... )    

 Based on the way the history section of outlines have been developed (especially the history sections of country outlines), the major classification scheme seems to be:

 By period
 By region
 By subject

 Which makes these articles general outlines, rather than timelines.  The """"By period"""" section may be a timeline, if it is formatted that way.

 As far as I can tell, the """"historical outline of"""" articles by Buaidh aren't chronological, but topical, which makes them generic outlines rather than outlines of the timeline variety.

I think that the reputation of the Marine Corps has more to do with its actual historical performance on the battlefield, rather than considerations such as the selectivity of its recruitment or basic training, something that probably would distinguish it in the """"European"""" perspective that you cite.
Another consideration is the scope, size and responsibility of the Corps.  The Marine Corps is not and has never been organized across its entire organization as a """"special-operations-type"""" organization, such as the SEALs, Special Forces, or, if you will, Royal Marines or SAS.  The article points out that the Corps is larger than the British Army in its entirety.  What the Marine Corps has done for most of its history, and what has distinguished it largely from the US Army, is serve as a mobile and convenient expeditionary force, in coordination with the Navy, in a large number of small actions in support of US policy, most of them in the Western Hemisphere or in Asia.  (THe US didn't even maintain a large standing peacetime Army until after 1945).  Outside those years when a major war was being fought (technically, the US Congress has declared war only five times in history), if someone saw an armed American in their country, that person was likely to be a Marine.
I would argue that the most relevant perspective on the reputation of the Marine Corps would be the perspectives and memories of its historical enemies.  I would invite anyone interested, and will work myself, to find and document in this article reliable quotes and sources of those who have encountered Marines in battle.

False, my site tenstringguitar.INFO is neither intended to promote a website nor is it a link to a blog. This site promotes scholarly information about the 10-string guitar as envisioned by Narciso Yepes. So 's claims against me/my site are simply dishonest. (Not unexpected.) Along the same vein, 's claim that Janet Marlow's site does not fail any criteria of """"links to be avoided"""" is also false. According to criterion no. 2 """"Any site that misleads the reader by use of factually inaccurate material or unverifiable research"""" must be avoided on wikipedia. Yet  supports this site knowing fully that it is involved in the spread of misinformation.

Compare the claims made by Marlow  with the verifiable statements made by Yepes . 's claims that these are saying the same thing are clearly mistaken or dishonest. That is, Marlow claims """"there are four missing sympathetic resonances on the six string guitar ... C, Bb, Ab, and Gb"""" which have less sustain """"than the others"""". While Yepes states that """"On the six-string guitar only four notes of the scale have natural resonances or overtones, E, A, B, an D"""" and that the other EIGHT sympathetic resonances are missing. 

What  is doing here is not scholarship, it is not honest and it is discrediting wikipedia, but I need hardly say it because it is abundantly clear to readers. He gets away with it simply because he is an administrator.

 """"RS""""? 

(Moved from User talk:Lexein. Doesn't belong on my talk page.   )
in the context of the claes oldenburg & coosje van bruggen articles, who or what is """"RS""""?

  

As an editor, you already know that RS is Wikipedia-editor shorthand for """"independent reliable source"""", as in WP:RS. Every statement made in a Wikipedia article, unless it is an obvious one like """"the sky is blue"""", should be WP:V verifiable (policy), meaning supported by independent WP:reliable sources (strong guideline). The more extraordinary the claim, the more reliable should be the sources. See also WP:VRS for a capsule summary. In other words, Wikipedia is not the authority which is speaking, the sources are. We paraphrase, quote, and cite them. What you wrote has not been explicitly discussed in the media (yet).
2nd point: we don't write about Wikipedia or internal matters unless independent reliable sources have done so; to do so again sets up WP (or an editor) as an authority. 
3rd point: See WP:BURDEN], which spells out that it is the duty of the adding editor to cite reliable sources supporting the claim.  If none exist, the claim must not be added to a Wikipedia article.   """,0
"""
The figure used on this page isn't the number of people who self-identify as """"Black"""", it's the estimated number of people with some degree of African ancestry... in Latin America in general and Venezuela in particular these are very different things - """"black"""" only applies to people who have sole or predominately African ancestry, while people of mixed ancestry generally consider themselves """"Brown"""" (""""Moreno"""") on the census (presumably this is what you are calling """"mestizo""""). If we simply used the """"Black"""" figure from the census we'd be ignoring the large number of people who have mixed African and European/Native American ancestry. We can't use the """"Brown"""" figure either, as this would include many people who have both European and Native American ancestry but no African ancestry. So the census figures are no good for us and we need to find a different source that estimates African ancestry directly without using the """"black""""/""""brown"""" colour labels. The 20-30% estimation comes from an official document from the Venezuelan government (the Embassy in the US) which specifically states this as the number of people with African ancestry, so is a reliable source for our purposes. If you have an equal or better reliable source that gives an alternative figure then please let me know what it is. 
The 100% issue is a red herring - """"mestizo"""" and """"African ancestry"""" are overlapping categories and can't be added together as if they were distinct... """"mestizo"""" in Venezuela means a mixture of European, Native American and/or African ancestry, so some of the people included in """"mestizo"""" are also included in """"African ancestry"""" and you'd be counting them twice if you added the two together. A better check is that we'd expect """"Afican ancestry"""" to be all of the """"Black"""" category plus part of the """"Brown"""" category, so more than 3% and less than 53% - the 20-30% estimate fits this perfectly.

"NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL FROM WIKIPEDIA 

I am writing this message to you as a notice of my withdrawal from Wikipedia following the recent events/edits on the CNN and Susan Roesgen pages – events that you were involved in.  Never in all of my years in academia (the better part of a decade) have I been privy to such patently-insincere and downright academically-fraudulent work as that which I have encountered on Wikipedia.
While I was initially willing to set aside all of the negative things I had heard about Wikipedia in an effort to contribute to a seemingly beneficial project, the actions of editors and administrators on the  Susan Roesgen and CNN pages has made it eminently clear that “scholarship” and Wikipedia truly are mutually exclusive – propaganda has carried the day.
My failure to grace the project with some actual academically-sound work was not made in vain, however; with every neutral editor that you drive out of the project with your blatantly POV-pushing agenda, you further bolster your reputation as nothing but an unreliable propaganda board. Your reputation for unreliability was perhaps best captured in a recent statement made by my corporations professor: “I decided to make myself more ignorant on the topic by looking at the article (Dodge v. Ford Motor Company) on Wikipedia.”
I strongly encourage you to alter your course, set aside your agenda, and reverse your – and Wikipedia’s – reputation as a laughing stock. This will not only benefit the public in general, but will, I submit, actually make you feel better about yourself. Best, J.M.",0

I'd just like to answer the points three posts above by User:Ohconfucius as I presume he is not a football fan. The use of flags is, for the third time, a graphic means of presenting information instead of saying England, England, England, England, England, England, oh! Wales, England, England, etc., ad nauseum. It is NOT """"purely to render some colourful graphics"""". The use of graphics to convey information is widespread in all spheres of communication, not just the internet. As for folk using it in other articles, well, if they do then that presents a consensus, doesn't it? No, the match was not an international but the nationalities of the players are relevant in football because for the last thirty-odd years since the arrivals of Ardiles and Villa, nationality has been and still is a burning issue in English football. There are people now who will reluctantly admit that Liverpool have more top-class English players than anyone else at present but still criticise the club for employing South Americans.

1820 Map vs Globe
The image in the infobox should be a geographic locator as well, showing where the state is within a larger context of the world.
It doesn't seem consistent with map of other Chinese dynasty articles (e.g. Ming, Tang, etc). Geographic locator map is mainly used for current country map (not historical map), e.g. People's Republic of China, United States, etc   
The Qing Dynasty, although is a dynasty of the past, is also largely a modern political entity, and its history is intertwined with modern world history.  That's why I think a geographic locator is better suited, as it also mirrors the Republic of China (1912-1949) article.  Another thing to consider is that because there are so many contemporaneous maps of the Qing that's available (where as such maps are rare for prior historic dynasties, such as Ming and Tang), it is difficult to choose one that truly represent the whole article in the infobox.  

I agree that showing all the different maps of the Qing Dynasty at its various extent and time periods is informative to readers, but they don't have to be in the infobox; a general geographic locator is a good fit there.  Plus, the maps of the Qing Dynasty at 1820 and 1833 are already in the article.

 Equal Standards 
TheLeopard, I thank your for your unending quest for the truth, and your campaigning for the integrity of Wikipedia. However, there are other areas of Wikipedia that would greatly profit from similar vigor. Take for instance the previously widely unknown National Capital Region (China). You rescued it from obscurity caused by a redirect. However, it must have escaped you that this article does not contain a single reference, and that there are several claims and outright speculations that deserve at least a dubious tag. A National Capital Region (China) is worthy of the same attention to detail as China’s capital, or other cities such as Shanghai. While it is the job of the author to provide these references (lest the author would risk a deletion), the lack of verifiable sources should at least have been pointed out. I have done so in the meantime. Thank you   
The only reason I rescued that article was because it was redirected to Bohai Economic Rim, which clearly is not the same thing as National Capital Region.  The article needs to be tagged with """"unreferenced"""" and a bunch of other tags.

 You are now a Reviewer 

Hello. Your account has been granted the """"reviewer"""" userright, allowing you to review other users' edits on certain flagged pages. Pending changes, also known as flagged protection, is currently undergoing a two-month trial scheduled to end 15 August 2010.

Reviewers can review edits made by users who are not autoconfirmed to articles placed under pending changes. Pending changes is applied to only a small number of articles, similarly to how semi-protection is applied but in a more controlled way for the trial. The list of articles with pending changes awaiting review is located at Special:OldReviewedPages.

When reviewing, edits should be accepted if they are not obvious vandalism or BLP violations, and not clearly problematic in light of the reason given for protection (see Wikipedia:Reviewing process). More detailed documentation and guidelines can be found here.

If you do not want this userright, you may ask any administrator to remove it for you at any time.

"""

 My signature and your actions ~  

I thought about taking this to a dispute hearing, but I couldn't be fucked.  So, I'm just going to outline here why I think that your blocking of my account was unjustified and against policy.  

You stated when you blocked me, """"anon. only, account creation blocked) with an expiry time of indefinite (personal attack in signature - will unblock on signature change"""" .  I disagree with your action on three levels.  The first is that it was a personal attack, the second on the indefinite ban, and the third on any action at all.  

 Why it wasn't a personal attack 
""""The primary purpose of creating any block is to protect Wikipedia and its editors and users from harm."""" (From WP:BP).  Of the list of reasons, on WP:BP the only one plausibly applicable is """"Disruption"""".  Under this it has 

""""A user may be blocked when his/her conduct severely disrupts the project — his/her conduct is inconsistent with a civil, collegial atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmoniously to create an encyclopedia.""""

And """"Blocks for general incivility are controversial"""".
In no way could any of my actions be considered """"severely"""" disruptive.  Or even simply disruptive.  While it could be argued that my signature was generally uncivil (and I disagree, more later), blocking for this reason is controversial and should have been discussed first.  So, from WP:BP there is no reason (in my opinion) to block.  

Now we examine WP:NPA.  This is simply, """"Do not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia"""" and I agree with it.  The point here is """"personal"""".  My signature was not a personal attack on anyone.  It was a generalised comment and an """"in joke"""" (I can't help it if you are not in on the joke).  For the """"attack"""" to be personal, you would need to find someone who was """"attacked"""", you would not be able to do this.  

So, my signature did not constitute an attack on anyone, it did not disrupt discussion or affect the quality of my edits, thus it should not be a factor in anything.  

As to general incivility, I simply disagree.  From WP:CIVIL, """"Whereas incivility is roughly defined as personally targeted behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress"""".  My signature was not """"personally targeted behavior"""" (as explained above), and I also fail to see how it could cause an atmosphere of """"conflict"""" or """"stress"""".  There is nothing in this policy which is applicable in this case.

 Why I should not have been blocked 
In blocking me indefinitely, you violated WP:BP which states, 

""""Established users with significant constructive edits should not be indefinitely blocked except when there is a community ban. In all other cases, they should be handled with appropriate time-limited blocks or arbitration. Indefinite blocks should not usually be placed on IP users (whether individual IPs or IP ranges) in order to avoid inadvertently blocking legitimate users.""""

In blocking me at all, I also feel that you violated WP:BP.  You did not have a clear reason to block me, and you did so indefinitely.  In these cases, you should have posted at WP:ANI asking for advice and/or detailing why you felt that the block was needed.

 What could have happened 
So, what could you have done?  Well, the simplest thing would have to post on my talk page a comment asking me to change my signature and pointing to the policy which it violated (see the previous case for an example).  If you had have done this (and I had agreed with your argument) then I would have simply changed my signature.  If I had failed to change my signature, then you could have discussed it with me more, and/or taken it to a hearing.   

 Conclusion 
As I said at the beginning, I didn't want to take this to a hearing.  However, I feel that I would be perfectly within my rights to do so, and I reserve the right to do so.  This, by the way, is simply a statement.  

What would I like you to do?  Well, an apology would be nice, perhaps something worded along the lines of """"I'm sorry for not talking to you first, not checking policy and for violating policy by indefinitely blocking you"""".  

If you are unable to give an apology (for whatever reason, say you believe that you were in the right and still are), then I would appreciate a comment regardless.  

A comment on my userpage would be noticed faster, but here would be fine as well.

Please listen to the administrator and if you have a serious edit dispute, have it moderated.

The fact that you are campaigning, yes, CAMPAIGNING for your point of view after the issues are resolved is bad form. Oh, and by the way, just a hint here: Wiki doesn't tolerate sock puppets. You know what I mean. 
  

Pardon me, but it appears you're being far more vocal than I am on this matter. And you haven't proven anything to me. The only way you can be said to have proven something to me is if I am conviced of it.

No, I was not trying to canvas.

I felt sure that scarcely anyone would support the claim of the """"owner"""" of the article to control the gateway to editing it.

 Response to the vandals (daughters of Sonja de Lennart) 

While Wikipedia administrator SWATJester is protecting you, your hoax has been thoroughly exposed.  Your mother was not a famous designer and did not create Capri pants.   

Your """"Professor Mueller"""" is a phony source.  He is neither a professor nor affiliated with the University of Zurich.  

Your only """"evidence"""" for your mother being a designer comes from the claims you made, on the website one of you created last year and owns, with completely unverifiable pictures.

Your insistence that Emilio Pucci would have been upset at Edith Head receiving an Oscar for his work makes no sense, except as an attempt to deceive readers.  The Academy Award for Best Costumes goes to a person chosen by the movie studio to create the wardrobes for the film.  Emilio Pucci was not creating costumes for a film, and would have had no reason to complain that someone else received an Oscar for what was not his effort.  Nor would Hubert de Givenchy have felt a need to give Emilio Pucci credit for the creation of Capri pants.  Emilio Pucci did no work on Sabrina.

You can't even keep your lies straight - in one post you claim that she was widely interviewed by fashion magazines and in another you claim that she did not know how to handle the international press.

Apparently, in your twisted mind, it was not prevalent in Europe to place information in books or magazines either.  

You have instigated a fraud, for the purpose of selling your books - claiming to be the daughters of a famous designer will get you appearances on TV and radio shows to hawk your books.  Since your publisher appears to be a vanity publishing house primarily devoted to the two of you, every bit of publicity must help.

Notability of Julien Deschamps
A tag has been placed on Julien Deschamps requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 New station names - """"Shanghai East"""", """"wuhan South"""", """"Wuhan West"""" - on tielu.org 

I wanted to see how the new train services after the opening of the Shanghai–Nanjing High-Speed Railway show up on www.tielu.org. (I am not endorsing that site, but it just happens to be the one Chinese train schedule site that I am familiar with). As I query """"上海"""" to """"南京"""", the full list of trains shows up, including dozens of the new expensive G trains. The trains that arrive to Shanghai Railway Station are listed as coming to 上海 as expected. But - quite surprisingly - those trains (the majority of the G's) that I believe are going to Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station are shown as arriving to some place called """"上海东"""" (""""Shanghai East"""") instead! So apparently this is how tielu.org chose to call the new Hongqiao Station... Moreover, Wuhan's two """"old"""" stations, the Wuchang Railway Station and the Hankou Railway Station got new monikers as well - 武汉南 (""""Wuhan South"""") and 武汉西 (""""Wuhan West"""") respectively!

Now, I have used the tielu.org site long enough, and know that until quite recently Wuchang and Hankou always appeared there under their usual names, none of this """"Wuhan West"""" / """"Wuhan South"""" business.  A quick web search did not find anything particularly useful about this matter, other than a few people's comments on the 武汉南 label for the Wuchang Station on a discussion forum.

{{unblock|reason=Block serves no purpose. Given that my so-called PAs were limited to AN/I, and that I am preparing a case for RfC/U then I am hardly likely to persist. Further to the point that remarks on AN/I that are not related to content disputes are not disruptive, and therefore the block is not preventative, as there are, and have been, no concerns regarding disruption or vandalise to encyclopedic articles. My argument stands that this block is a WP:COATRACK with my """"personal attacks"""" being highlighted to mask the uncivil remarks and assertions on AN/I. Those assertions, based on undue lack of AGF, over my response to a WQA are based on straw man arguments, with no evidence to support the claims, and in fact run on a parallel track to the discussion at AN/I, but have in fact been misrepresented through synthesis to create an attack on my contribs, and cannot be reasonably analysed as a """"bad faith"""" WQA response. However, this is the tone that has been used by an admin who refused to get involved in the WQA, but did not hesitate to question my ability to respond to the WQA, which was also, notably, my first WQA response, which was concluded and closed by supporting editors. Therefore the attack on my response, which was made prematurely, perhaps an uncivil approach in itself, was unfounded. Since the close, the admin has refused to recognise their critique as a bad faith attack, nor have they refactored it recognise the conclusion of the WQA. They have, instead, used my earlier uncivil remarks, which I should not pre-dated the AN/I topic by 3 days and therefore the admins right to question my WQA response was somewhat presumptious given that the two events are unrelated, and casting doubts on an editors ability to contribute to X-area of wiki because they had a dispute in Y-area of wiki is not a logical conclusion, it is a straw man argument; i.e. """"Because MB was uncivil to editor-A on AN/I, he should be kept away from WQA"""". This flaw being, that every article, user, project and content page on wiki has a discussion page, therefore why not argue """"If MB is uncivil on AN/I, he could be uncivil anywhere""""? Having dismissed the admins argument as flawed, based in this discrepancy, plus the fact they were assuming I would respond to WQA, but it had been my first and there is no evidence to suggest I was going to make a career out of it, the admin drew conclusion based on a false premis. Those conclusions were used detrimentally and matter-of-fact, despite being opinions, theories and at most, concerns. At no time did the admin attempt to address those concerns on my talk page, as would be proper. Instead they made uncivil remarks, questioning the faith of my response and promoting a damning claim, using quotes out of context and lacking correct interpretation. I maintain that the intentions of the admin were uncivil, and that by addressing me """"potentially uncivil"""" the admin was making proactive disdainful remarks, based on one solitary WQA, rather than a reactive proposal based on sufficient history, behaviour patterns or evidence to support the theory. To make matters worse, when I confronted the admin with this they adopted a defensive stance, dismissing my anger at their assertions as uncivil, and convoluted the matter further by placing my angry response above their own behaviour, whilst casting judgement, thus clouding the issue, i.e. the WP:COATRACK counter-measure. I consider this an attack on my integrity, as my response to WQA was rejected and questioned before it was even resolved, which is a clear example of attacking the faith of an editor. Because the admin continued to accelerate their case against me with condescending remarks, and refusal to accept their straw man claim as unreasonable or irrelevant to the discussion, i.e. a fork. Their persistence to use those comments can only be observed as advocating. For any admin of that experience to be unable to recognise their own bad faith, illogical attempt to predict an editor, and close-minded approach, there has to be a underlying motive, in my belief, for them to persist, to the degree of blocking me and refusing to allow their behaviour to be questioned is paramount to enacting COI.  So, though my responses may be considered uncivil, they are in reaction to what I perceive as irresponsible admin attitude, and pessimistic misuse of my response at WQA. That is not a PA, or uncivil, it is a legit observation with regards my POV which was made to look warped due to the late-interjection with straw man based propositions, casting aspersions on my ability to handle WQA. Unless there has been a direct complaint or issue pertaining to a page, or discussion, it is not appropriate for an admin to imply anything, and therefore my one-off role at WQA is",0

Yamla, the discussion about her being or not Portuguese has been going on since February. It is about time to put an end to it. Your concern as per WP:MOSBIO means what? Clarify yourself!

""""Nationality (In the normal case this will mean the country of which the person is a citizen or national, or was a citizen when the person became notable.""""WP:MOSBIO

She has two nationalities.Full stop. There is nothing there against it. 

The thing is that your opinion is just POV, for you to sustain that she is predominantly Canadian you need to present sources that states so, I told you that before. Prove she is more Canadian than Portuguese. """"she did not even apply for her Portuguese citizenship until relatively recently """"  Where does it say she applyed for her citizenship recently? I only read she applied for her passport. Read the == Ancestry == section, she is Portuguese from birth. The Rolling Stone is the only source aproved by you? And all the other sources provided  you erased? Like the Portuguese-Canadian National CongressPortuguese-Canadian National Congress  The GuardianNelly Furtado, Loose
There is also The Times I added later: . 
And new ones for you:«""""I think just growing up first-generation Canadian you're so aware of your identity,"""" she said. """"I had my identity as a Portuguese-Canadian. I was very aware, and I already had my ears opened  even singing in another language at such a young age  your ears are already opened to different sounds, different instrumentation, different cultures.»
[""""http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12055995]

What about a Rolling Stone article?""""And though this twenty-two-year-old Portuguese-Canadian singer-songwriter..."""" 

""""Finally, I believe that stating she is Portuguese-Canadian implies that she is Canadian with Portuguese ancestry and such would not be permitted in the intro paragraph according to WP:MOSBIO."""" Is that so? where does it say  in the WP:MOSBIO that a nationality that implies ancestry is not permited? Are there invisible words I have not been able to read?  1-She has Portuguese ancestry because her parents are Portuguese.  Almost all Portuguese have Portuguese ancestry, that way all biographies of Portuguese people would not be permited. 2-She is a European citizen which means for EU countries only her Portuguese nationality is considered, that is, for legal matters.

There's only one reason why I've been inserting this into the Chicago Bulls article. I do mention that the Blackhawks and Bulls were in their respective league's finals in 1992. The only reason I mention the New York Rangers and the Knicks in 1994 is because Mike Keenan was coach of the Blackhawks in 1992 and was coach of the Rangers in 1994. During 1994, he was able to draw many parallels between the two dramas, having had experiences in seeing both NBA and NHL teams from one city in their respective league's finals in the same year.  , (talk), 

There's only one reason why I mention Mike Keenan about the Bulls in 1992: In 1994, when he coached the Rangers to the Stanley Cup, the Knicks were in their finals. Then, he was able to draw from his many experiences seeing both NBA and NHL teams from one city in their respective league's finals in the same year. Phil Jackson was right about the Rangers Stanley Cup being a great part of a great chapter in New York sports history. He knew that Keenan was experiencing what he experienced in Chicago two years before.  , (talk), 

The main source I'm citing is """"Spring of '94,"""" which aired in MSG Network, as well as my own thoughts for all of this. I followed both dramas in which both NBA and NHL teams from one city were in their respective league's finals in the same year. (Chicago in 1992, New York in 1994) During the drama in New York when the Knicks and the Rangers made it to their respective league's finals, Keenan drew from all his experiences seeing both NBA and NHL teams from one city in their respective league's finals in the same year that it was going to be a great chapter in a city's sports history. He knew from his experiences in Chicago that the Rangers' first Stanley Cup win in 54 years would be that. You have to keep in mind that he was coach of the Blackhawks in 1992 and the Rangers in 1994.  , (talk), 

The only reason why I mention the Blackhawks in the article on Phil Jackson and the 1992 Blackhawks in every article associated with the 1992 Bulls is because the coach of the Blackhawks in 1992, Mike Keenan, was able to draw from all his experiences from the Bulls/Blackhawks drama during the 1994 drama in New York when the Knicks and the Rangers were in their respective league's finals that year. Phil Jackson said the same thing.  , (talk), 

Houston Rockets

There's only one reason why I mention the New York Rangers 3-2 win over the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals in Houston Rockets articles. I want to make clear that their win in Game 7 of the NBA Finals denied New York from having both NBA and NHL titles in the same year, as the Rockets defeated the Knicks.

 I reverted it back because I preferred the original version before Rod Ball's edits.  I asked if anyone else agreed with Rod Ball on this issue - having gotten no response, I assumed that other people either didn't care, or like me preferred the original.  In addition, I believe that Pjacobi already reverted these particular edits once.

 So I'll ask again - does anybody agree with Rod Ball on this issue, and actually prefer his version?  I like it the way it is now.  To make it less personal, do people like http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_spaceship_paradox&oldid;=79349924 or http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_spaceship_paradox&oldid;=79587575

 I think that """"a family of paradoxes"""" is more technically accurate, if you re-read the literature section you'll see why Hillman (the originator of this wording) described them this way.  Different authors have analyzed slightly different situations using different means.

 I also think accelerated rods are quite relevant and related (again, I borrowed this from Hillman, though I added the wiki-link to Born rigid motion).  Note that we are currently arguing accelerated motion with Rod Ball.  I would say that the topic is therfore closely related, though not identical.  That's just what the intro says.  Strings and spaceships share much of the same physics as rods and spaceships, in the final analysis.  It's fundamentally about distance.

 I think both versions contain equivalent information in explaining why the paradox, originated by Dewan and Beran, is named after Bell.   """,0

 My pleasure.  

 Wrong date? 
""""In Europe"""" states Pandora's Box is from 1928, """"Filmography"""" states it's from 1929. Which one is correct?

 The authoritative Louise Brooks Society lists it as 1929.  The movie was still be filmed when Brooks turned 22; there's a picture of cast & crew celebrating it on the London attic set.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.192.5.55   

 Philosophy 
I remember reading in one news article about this individual, it was brief and cryptic, concerning pessimistic aesthetics philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer.
There seems an unnerving concentration on the film persona (particularly with the one from """"Box"""", which I do not think is the best image to dwell on, given that it is one of dehumanization and objectification for varyous fetishistic obsessive types). I have a strong intuition that there was infact ALLOT more to this person then what is being focused on by what appears to be a majority of her fans. Is there any further detail in any of the Seven Seals concerning her philosophy, ideology, and maybe even politics (and at best, religion)? Given her scholarly nature, I strongly doubt any real resemblance to the character of that film. Seek the Forms  

 Tone? 
Hi all, glad to read this article, & I think Louise Brooks is way cool, but I have a quibble:  Here & there, it tends to read like a fansite (i.e., a bit gushy) instead of an encyclopedia article.  Does anyone else have this impression?  I think a few word changes might help.  I can take a shot at it.  

 Oh yeh I have. That and the fact that there is a marked lack of any of her philosophies. I see her, first and foremost, a scholar, who wrote film reviews and seven esseys (their subject is not given in this artical), or even any philisophical works (though, they may have been very, very diluted, given that Shopenhauer was a major influence on her, he held a nihilistic perversion of Neo-Platonism that would lead to social anarchy, followed by dictatorship by the Nietzscheans). I have bumped into this recently and was somewhat impressed, though, not satisfied with a lack of insight into her potentially more important contributions (if any). The secret here is, I suspect most of these people are just obsessed perverts (fans, like you said). Thanks

"""*LoL @ """"connection to Obama"""". Here' what Obama Really thinks of Cuba:

""""Throughout my entire life, there has been injustice and repression in Cuba. Never, in my lifetime, have the people of Cuba known freedom. Never, in the lives of two generations of Cubans, have the people of Cuba known democracy. (...) This is the terrible and tragic status quo that we have known for half a century - of elections that are anything but free or fair (...) I won't stand for this injustice, you won't stand for this injustice, and together we will stand up for freedom in Cuba,""""

Any so-called leftist-revolutionary who thinks Obama will be any different from whitey is simply deluding themselves. He's in fact, a great tool for the bourgeoisie to fool revolutionaries from all communities. Isabel is just some dumb wannabe commie who jumped on the Obama bandwagon. They are really just silly social democrats and not revolutionaries. But make great useful idiots for people like Obama. We have Jack Layton to do that job in Kanada.

"""

Say what?

I decide to check out the AfD articles, not something I normally get involved in. I come to an article for deletion, A Course in Miracles (book). I look over it  I see it's been documented and footnoted almost to the very last comma. I observe a tremendous argument ensuing over one word, """"cult"""", that's being interpreted multiple ways. Multiple editors are squabbling over whether User:Ste4k is being """"POV"""" for using it. I change the wording to eliminate the troublesome word while meeting what I see as the intent of the original author of the quote, Garrett. I think I do an adequate if not very eloquent job. I go to a lot of effort to explain what and why I made the change, citing the dictionary, etc. I do screw up and forget to sign some of my work, which you helpfully catch and fix.

I then vote in the AfD to delete the article but to keep its content and merge it into the main article. I explain my reasoning, but without going into detail as to my views of both articles as they presently stand. If I had, I would have said something along the lines that the main article flows well and is comprehensive; I think it's generally well written. At the same time, it screams out for about 200 {{fact}} tags. It's not clear to me how reliable it is. The book article, by contrast, is not as pretty and, as the principal author herself more or less says, reads like a U.S. District Court decision. There's a reason judges' decisions are not high literature and that's because they're shooting for reliability and precision, not memorable prose. There's considerable overlap between both articles with much discussion as to whether there should be a book article and a movement article or just one combined article; there's even discussion as to whether the word """"movement"""" should be used. It seems to me as it all this talk of different articles is putting the cart before the horse (reliability), so I vote """"merge and delete"""" so that the overall Wikipedia coverage can get fixed and streamlined with some sort of consensus built.

Now I wake up and I find that you've spent hours during the night sarcastically mutilating your own article. It appears that one word, """"cult"""", and my good faith editing of its usage may have been your tipping point to go into a frenzy. That or my one vote in the AfD process. If you don't like my cult edit, just reverse it and explain how I got it wrong.

Then there's this message on my talk page:
""""I'm not originally from the U.S. I was born in Kharkov. In our country, we beat liars, and if one wants to eat, they work. The only POV in that article I wrote was that I wanted to find out the truth, did research, marked it with citations for verifiability, refused to consider any source that came from some primary provider, and all I found out for my trouble was that this encyclopedia isn't even worth quoting. You should be ashamed to have your familiy member's name on this medium.  """"

What do I make of this? Are you saying that I'm a liar and should (or would) be beaten? That I should be working harder to eat? And what's this about my family?

And as for Wikipedia, being flawed, it certainly is that. It is profoundly flawed in terms of the reliability of some of its material. In fact, if so many millions of people didn't use it, I'd say forget about it. But the fact is, Wikipedia is very important and growing in importance everyday. Every day, more people abandon traditional sources of reliable information such as Britannica and turn to Wikipedia. Every month, Wikipedia's Google rankings move up higher and are often in the top 5 for a given search. The fact that so many other sites such as answers.com mirror the content makes what's written in Wikipedia seem all the more """"reliable"""" since to the undiscerning, it looks like other sites are agreeing with Wikipedia.

So like it or not, Wikipedia is here to stay and further grow in importance. You can fume and I can fret, but our children and grandchildren will use it more and more as their first source of knowledge, reliable or not. That almost pessimistic view of Wikipedia's growing role is what motivates me  not some idealistic, Woodstockian notion that """"information longs to be free"""" or so much of the other idealistic stuff that motivates thousands of mostly earnest, smart but very young editors on this project.

[edit] BiographyCuban was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania[6][7] and grew up in the Pittsburgh suburb of Mt. Lebanon, in a Jewish[8] working-class family. His last name was shortened from """"Chabenisky"""" when his Russian grandparents landed on Ellis Island.[9] Cuban's father Norton was an automobile upholsterer.[6][10][11] Cuban's first step into the business world occurred at age 12, when he sold garbage bags to pay for a pair of expensive basketball shoes.[6][12] While in school, he held a variety of jobs, including bartender, disco dancing instructor, and party promoter. He paid for college by collecting and selling stamps, and once gained about $1,100 from starting a chain letter.[6]

Rather than attending high school for his senior year, Cuban enrolled as a full time student at the University of Pittsburgh. After one year at the University of Pittsburgh, he transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in business administration.[13]

[edit] FamilyIn September 2002, Cuban married Tiffany Stewart, an advertising executive, in Barbados,[14] with a wedding reception at the American Airlines Center. Their first daughter, Alexis Sofia, was born on September 25, 2005; their second daughter, Alyssa, was born in 2007.[15] Tiffany and Mark also have a son born in early 2010.[2] The family lives in the Preston Hollow area of Dallas, in a 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) mansion.[16]

[edit] Early careerIn 1982, Cuban moved to Dallas, Texas. Cuban first found work as a bartender,[17][18] then as a salesperson for Your Business Software, one of the first PC software retailers in Dallas. He was terminated less than a year later, after meeting with a client to procure new business instead of opening the store.[19]

Cuban started a company, MicroSolutions, with support from his previous customers from Your Business Software. MicroSolutions was initially a system integrator and software reseller. The company was an early proponent of technologies such as Carbon Copy, Lotus Notes, and CompuServe.[20] One of the company's largest clients was Perot Systems.[21] In 1990, Cuban sold MicroSolutions to CompuServe—then a subsidiary of H&R; Block—for $6 million.[22] He retained approximately $2 million after taxes on the deal.[23]

In 1995, Cuban and fellow Indiana University alumnus Todd Wagner started Audionet, combining their mutual interest in college basketball and webcasting. With a single server and an ISDN line,[24] Audionet became Broadcast.com in 1998. By 1999, Broadcast.com had grown to 330 employees and $13.5 million in revenue for the second quarter.[25] In 1999, during the dot com boom, Broadcast.com was acquired by Yahoo! for $5.9 billion in Yahoo! stock.[26]

[edit] Business careerAfter the sale of Broadcast.com, Cuban diversified his wealth to avoid exposure to a market crash.[27] As of 2011, Cuban is No. 459 on Forbes' list of """"World's Richest People"""", with a net worth of $2.5 billion.[28] The Guinness Book of Records credits Cuban with the """"largest single e-commerce transaction"""", after he paid $40",0

Thank you for that answer, but that's not what I asked. Have you or have you not read Mussolini's autobiography and speeches? That wasn't my question either; that's a new one. If you have, then you would know that claims of Fascism being anti-clerical is absurd (the position of individual anti-clerical self-professed Fascists is irrelevant to the ideology of Fascism itself). You would have to resort to conspiracy, as the would-be scholars have, and claim that Mussolini's ideology of Fascism was all a huge front and that he secretly was anti-Clerical and secretly considered anti-Clericalism intrinsic to Fascism. How convenient. And as for Darwinism, which was my other point, you won't find anything on that either. Mussolini never even stated anything about evolution (nor did Hitler, for that matter). Did he believe in evolution? Considering the times he lived in, probably. But he never mentioned it, let alone social Darwinism. Yet this article presents social Darwinism as if it were intrinsic to Fascism! 
To answer your question again, liberal definitions include obsession with race as """"racism"""". And you certainly are obsessed with it.

If you'd checked the talk page, you'd have seen that I've had a message for you there for a long time regarding the mp3 which I removed, and which you recently reinserted, and which has been removed once again.  Specifically, the mp3 does not have any material regarding Prussian Blue in it.  The interview is between a DJ at KERN radio and an 11 year old girl named """"Ellie Mae"""".  While the mp3 does cover the topic of white nationalism and racism (as the little girl is obviously being coached by her parents on what to say).  No one in the mp3 is identified as being one of the Gaedes, or even a fan of their music.  Prussian Blue and the Gaedes are never mentioned in the mp3.  The mp3 therefore does not support the claim that Prussian Blue are """"just proud of their heritage"""".  Cheers,

JanetteDoe, I appreciate your finding and uploading the Rao articles.  However, this can easily become an endless discussion.  For some other Yadav-apologist will soon come along and find an even more obscure source than Rao, and then you—conscientious and rigorous to a degree that the Yadav apologists are not and have no intention, aware or unaware, of being—will go scurrying again for the article.  After that we all will try to interpret it, weighing the pros and cons, again to a degree the apologists will not, for they will be busy looking for the next roadblock to toss in our path.  

I think we can't make the determination of whether Rao applies here or not, at least not yet.  Let the secondary sources do that.  We need to rely on recent scholarship, especially that in textbooks, published by academic presses and vetted both before and after publication by reviewers from a wide range of scholarly and journalistic backgrounds.  Two such books, by Susan Bayly and Christophe Jaffrelot, both widely used in universities around the world, both reviewed extensively in the literature, are being used in the article.  Let the article writing (or rewriting) proceed based on these (or similar) books.  Once the article has been fleshed out, we can come back to the issue of Rao.  Otherwise, nothing will get done, and those of us, who've taken time out from our other Wikipedia (not to speak RL) pursuits to attend to the article, will slowly walk away, out of touch and out of sympathy.  «Talk» """,0

"So you believe ALL facts belong in the article. Including what bush had for breakfast last thursday, or what the wing speed of a hummingbird is. What a moron.  

Are you serious?  The wing speed of a hummingbird has NOTHING to do with George Bush!  The fact taht you said that is pure idiocy!  Also, what Bush has for breakfast(remember, we start names with UPPER CASE) has nothing to do with anything.  However, a quote that he made in a public speech with the American people is VERY relevant!

"Discussion on this matter also underway at Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Attack sites/Proposed decision#New proposals concerning Cyde.  

I agree with Fred. Viridae, I'm going to pretend for a moment that I believe the SlimVirgin engaged in abusive sockpuppetry. The account had not been used for two years, so there was no urgency. There is a precedent for letting people in similar situations give a private explanation, and only to sanction them if they refuse or fail. It was not possible to provide public evidence without giving further publicity to a website which engages in stalking, and which gave speculation about not only SlimVirgin's identity, but also another contributor's. And you seem to be overlooking the fact that Cyde was in a longstanding dispute with SlimVirgin, so obviously should not have been the one to block. See also . This is not a question of making a mistake in believing WordBomb. This is a question of believing WordBomb, and then, instead of reporting it privately to the ArbCom, or asking SlimVirgin privately for an explanation, engaging in extremely inappropriate, hasty, behaviour, even crowing over the person he was accusing of sockpuppetry, and showing most clearly that he had a grudge against her. Additionally, in another case which is being heard at the moment, a user who had originally registered with his real name requested a name change, and repeatedly asked people not to keep referring to him by his old name, and Cyde responded by provocatively posting a link to the user rename log. Unnecessary, inflammatory. Discourteous.  (talk)

Your request for rollback

Hi Jeffrd10.  After reviewing your request for rollback, I have enabled rollback on your account.  Keep in mind these things when going to use rollback:
Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.
If you no longer want rollback, contact me and I'll remove it.  Also, for some more information on how to use rollback, see Wikipedia:New admin school/Rollback (even though you're not an admin).  I'm sure you'll do great with rollback, but feel free to leave me a message on my talk page if you run into troubles or have any questions about appropriate/inappropriate use of rollback.  Thank you for helping to reduce vandalism.  Happy editing!   """,0

Kent wrongly describes the Sathya Sai Baba movement in Malaysia as a """"Hindu Revitalization movement.""""

 Spam? Where? 
You keep on mentioning that when 195.64.95.116 is linking to this webpage it is considered """"spam"""". You even see this to be reason to block this IP for a week(!). Please define what you think is spam, because where I come from his/her linking to this particular website is anything but spam. I happen to be a member of some mailinglists (yahoogroups actually) on which Julius has written an enormous amount of very good articles on MP3 and stuff relating to audio-engineering, in Dutch. Many of the info he, his cousin and/or some others have put on this particular site, I see no reason for them to be needing any more visitors to this webpage than it already has; there are no popups, not even google-ads on it, so really, get your act together: This has NOTHING to do with spam. In fact, when I looked into this IP-address you blocked, I found that it resolves to """"jult.net"""", not to jthz.com, and even though it might be used by Julius, who is also one of the creators of the page you regard as spam, I still don't see the connection to """"spam"""".

3. Our webpage reaches more than 200 audio-enthusiasts daily, because it is informative on the subject, and has been since 1997.
4. If you keep on threatening me in this ridiculously nazi-manner of yours, I will report your behavior to those in charge, and we'll see about you being able to block perfectly valid links from being on that page.

I don't think the problem is with including Latin as an example, but rather that after 'veni, vidi, vici' it gives a """"literal"""" translation as 'came, saw, conquered' and then an """"idiomatic"""" translation that reads 'I came, etc.' The problem is that 'came, saw, conquered' would not be considered a """"literal"""" translation by any Latin scholar or teacher. I am a Latin teacher and I would expect the pronoun expressed in an English rendering since it's clearly expressed in the Latin. The """"literal"""" translation implies that Latin doesn't mark person and number on verbs, which is of course false. Now that I look at the other examples it looks like this problem pervades the article. Someone is trying to """"recreate"""" the effect of such languages (I call them pro-drop) in English. The problem is that you can't create the effect in English, which is one of the points of the article, i.e. English is not a null-subject language! 'came, saw, conquered' does not create the effect that a Latin speaker would feel upon hearing 'veni, vidi, vici', in fact 'I came, I saw, I conquered' is as close as one can get to create the effect of this phrase in English.""",0

 sock puppets 
 I'm accused of having multiple accounts by Noclador in his bizarre digging up of diffs (man, this guy has no life whatsoever) and then that sticks as me using sock puppets?  He makes these statements like, """"Furthermore there is socketpuppetry: user:Viewtool, user:Account101, user:Wikifun-usa, user:Nospu, user:Infinity88, user:Jamesbozen, user:Rossifumi-gp and user:Mud-miner were all incarnations of Icsunonove with which he tried to manipulate votes regarding the naming of locals in South Tyrol ceckuser results at bottom of this page"""".  What?  I never used any such accounts.

Noclador
 It is amazing that Wikipedia lets this person, who is obsessively attacking another user, continue without criticism.  This person has such an extreme amount of time on his hands that he attempts to catalog diffs against another user, even surmising (with absolutely no proof) what accounts may belong to a user that are literally years old.  That this user has a Myspace page like Noclador, that has a statement such as """"noclador is ever victorious -)"""" should demonstrate what small-minded intentions he has in life.  I do pity him.  That users like PhJ and Gryffindor back him up are no surprise.  Gryffindor, as I've said before, is one of the most unethical Administrators I've ever witnessed on Wikipedia.  I even tried to reach out to Noclador and Gun Power Ma to relax and discuss things.  It is the proof in the pudding that they can not  and treat everything as a war.  Surreal.

Having worked in radio for 18+ years in the Harrisonburg, Virginia area, and having worked for WACL (98 Rock) for 5 years (ending in 2005), I have respectfully asked that the format information for this station be changed to reflect it's official format, which is Classic Rock. The station's official format is Classic Rock, not Rock, Album Oriented Rock and not Active Rock. I received this response from users who will not allow me to edit the content myself:

    """"I talked with that other user and he said since WACL """"makes no clear distinction in its marketing (and based on the station website and group website, it doesn't) either rely on the Arbitron listing (which is derived from the station's own reporting)"""" it should fall under the Rock label. Not AOR, or Classic Rock, just plain old Rock. I will make a note in the article that the station plays a 50/50 """"blend"""" of Classic Rock and Active Rock. - NeutralHomer • Talk • """"

In my opinion, the accuracy of the content depends on fact, not on how the station markets itself, and not on Wikipedia users' opinions of what the station sounds like. The station does, in fact, rely on Arbitron when creating sales pitches to their advertisers, and Arbitron lists the station as Classic Rock because the station has reported to Arbitron that it's official format is Classic Rock. Having an extensive amount of professional experience in radio in Harrisonburg, Virginia qualifies me as an expert on this particular subject. Again I ask that the following changes be made to the content on the WACL article:

    WACL (98.5 FM, """"98 Rock"""") is a Classic Rock formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Elkton, Virginia, USA, serving the Harrisonburg/Staunton, Virginia, area. WACL is owned and operated by Clear Channel Communications.

    History

    The station first launched on February 22, 1989, with the callsign WPKZ. During that time, the station would carry a country music format, branded as """"Z-98"""".

    On March 7, 1997, the format was changed to classic rock, branded as """"Cool 98.5"""". To accommodate this, the callsign was changed to WACL. On May 2, 2001 at midnight, WACL changed their branding to """"98 Rock"""". On April 1, 2008, WACL began carrying the syndicated radio program Nights with Alice Cooper, when it moved from WBHB-FM at 105.1 FM (now WTGD) to WACL-FM at 98.5 FM when the format had been switched to classic country.

    Music

    WACL plays a blend of Classic Rock and Active Rock.

That at least points to the fact that they lived alongside each other and just as with Sumerian and Akkadian society merging to form classic Babylonian society the same happened of Akkadian/Assyrian society. In fact Assyria started as a Babylonian colony. Assyrian people today may very well call themselves Babylonian if they wished for that is the original established seat of the crown starting with the unification of Sumer and Akkad under Sargon of Akkad even though he ruled from Agade, the seat was moved to the holy city of the Gate of God.

Hi!

There are two different issues with the introduction.  The first is style - this is supposed to be a very easy-to-read introduction.  The description as intersecting spheres is covered in much detail later in the article.  Since the article is already very long, perhaps another description is not needed in the introduction.

The second issue is the number of satellites needed.  This is 3 with an accurate clock (a ns or so will suffice).  This gives the distance to 3 satellites, which is enough to determine position.  (These will be 2 solutions, but only one can be close to the surface of the Earth, so this is not a practical problem.)  With 4 satellites you need only a crude clock, provided your hardware measures the 4 satellites at (almost) the same time.  This allows you to solve for x,y,z, and t.

I think this is just a bit silly that you can't see your own biases. Why can't you see your own biases? Or had you considered the fact a good majority of Wikipedia editors share a Left of center POV by Jimmy Wales' own admission? The bias is hardly in a conservative direction, or even neutral. How can you say there isn't a decided hostility to conservative or traditional points of view on Wikipedia
Wikipedia's NPOV rule is meaningless, considering this fact. Explain to me why you think my observation of fact is absurd? Wikipedia isn't a reliable source because this fact, and if you hadn't been reading students in colleges in America, at least, are discouraged from citing it because of serious factual errors and political biases that pass for the truth. 
The problem here IS NOT with me.  
Guy, I wish you could see how the world views Wikipedia, and it's not good. Wikipedia's NPOV rule is symbolic, and from what I have seen no one here follows it. I have read all of the rules,and I have made every effort to follow them. Do everyone a favor and declare that Wikipedia is a Left-wing site. e.g.,  a blog. It comes down to an ideosyncratic application of the rules to fit your worldviews.
FM writes for the Democratic Underground, Jim68sch has confessed to having Marxist sentiments and you have confessed to being sympathetic to homosexuality. So, how can you say that there isn't a Left of center bias on Wikipedia?  I am mentioning the fact I Googled FM's handle, and found posts under his handle on the decidedly Liberal/Socialist Democratic Underground because it shows where his political biases lay.
How then can he be anymore objective than I?
FM said I weakened his viewpoint that Dominionism was a threat or a problem by adding the viewpoints of self-professed Christian Reconstructionists to the Dominionism article. How can you say that he's neutral anymore than I am neutral. My beef with that particular article is that it seems to stereotype all conservative American Christians as wanting to replace the U.S. Constitution with a neo-Puritan theocracy. 
Wikipedia lacks the same quality as Encyclopedia Britannica when it comes to maintaining a non-partisan perspective?
I consider myself knowledgeable about the Christian right, at least the Catholic faction therof, and I object to what I see as the blatant stereotyping of conservative Christians. The fact Chip Berlet or Katherine Yurica are considered """"experts"""" furthers my perception of bias. Mr. Berlet, I will concede, is more factual than say Ms. Yurica, but he paints with a very broad brush that ignores the diversity of the Christian right.
Their writings are riddled with strawman attacks, guilt by association, glaring generalizations, etc. The series of articles on """"Dominionism"""" are riddled with factual errors and POV. Is it NPOV to limit the content to a single POV where only those who share a single POV are granted """"expert"""" status?

"History 396 outline for Grey Owl

Career:
1. Trapper (sub heading under career)
His earlier mindset surrounding trapping will be discussed in greater depth, as not much is discussed with regards to how he viewed trapping before his switch to conservationism.
His work with the Ojibwa Indians / Guppy Family will be explored as they were critical in his development as a trapper that understood the fragility of the animal ecosystem (Smith, 41)
The time of his life spent working and living at the Temagami Inn as a chore-boy will be mentioned as this was one of the events in which  Archie first became an observer of the Objibwa way of life. (Smith, 40)
His love interest, Angele will also be discussed as she also introduced Archie to influential figures within the Objibwa community, providing Archie with plenty of sketches for his infamous notebooks. (Smith, 42)

2. Early Conservation Work (sub heading under career) This is my section for the project. 

From the section on his life as a trapper, we will discuss the impact of Anahareo on his switch from trapper to Conservationist.  
The transformation of his own personal views of conservationism will be explored through his writings in Pilgrims of the wild.
His initial desires to write will also be explored, this section then ending with the completion of his first book “The Men of the Last Frontier” which can be seen as one of the starting points of his public conservation career.

Source matter in this subheading will discuss Grey Owl’s beginning with Parks Board Canada through meeting James Harkin, covering material surrounding the films he made with their support, and his placement as caretaker of park animals at Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba.  
His relationship with W. J. Oliver regarding his being commissioned by Parks Board Canada to make films of Grey Owl will also be explored.  
We will also delve further into his later life as a conservationist and his role in Prince Albert National park.

[edit]Conservationist Views (new heading)
His outlook on conservationism will be explored, using both Tina Loo’s “States of Nature” Conserving Canada’s Wildlife in the Twentieth Century, and Donald Smith’s “From the Land of Shadows,” and Grey Owl’s “Pilgrims of the Wild” as sources which deal with his mindset of conservationism in detail.

4. Conservation Legacy (sub heading under Posthumous recognition)
The inspiration his lectures, books and films had on the people who came into contact with them will be explored deeper by using the sources below, as this is an area of his life which is largely overshadowed by the controversy of his false indigenous identity.

 Arbitrary revision reverting 

If you are going to reverse a revision that has been researched and well crafted, be consistent across the board.  Compare content with other similar entries which are considered acceptable, then rethink your actions.  Read the Muhammed Ali, Fedor Emelianenko, Chuck Liddell biographies for examples of what is considered relevant information, particularly regarding fight descriptions.  Make changes to all of those wiki entries if you feel that your standards should be universally accepted.

'Bullshit. You don't attack the only person you're having a discussion with and ask for the article to be locked and then defend it by saying, 'well, if your not one - then he's not talking to you'.
 The accusation is the attack and nothing I've said or done here, nor in my recent edit history at the Republican congressman's article referenced above indicates any bias. I notice however that the home page of one of the two editors standing sentry over his pet article has dozens of claims of profound liberal bias proudly festooned across the page like a Volvo in Vermont on it's way to the Northeast Kingdom. One usually finds such committed and messianic people to be deeply wedded to their cause and saturated to the bone with inflexible bias - whether on the left, right or third way.

Call Sign Meaning
I've been adding WISconsiN as a call sign meaning for quite some time now only to have it deleted by another user who INSISTS that the only possible meaning for the calls is the defunct WISconsin News newspaper.  As far as I know, there is no official documentation or credible source that states that the calls are a reference to the newpaper and the newspaper ALONE.  So who's to say the calls weren't also chosen because it was an abbreviation of the state's name?  There's plenty of examples of a station using calls with multiple meanings (such as WBBM-TV out of Chicago).  But my main sticking point is that WISN has referenced the calls while advertising itself as """"WISconsiN TV"""" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JFirQUXfc8)  My theory is that the station chose to keep the calls after the newspaper folded because they referenced the state's name as well (the station had only been using the calls for a few years when the paper folded, so the """"name recognition"""" argument is moot).  But regardless of why they kept the calls, I think the fact that the station made a conscious decision to use them to brand itself as """"Wisconsin TV"""" deserves mention.  """,0

"""

It's unfortunate that the history of Sicily here at Wiki is the sole province of this one individual, """"Racial Reality,"""" who is well-known amongst forum posters as being very biased against any research that shows admixture.  He feels he has the right to discredit all studies he disagrees with, and that everyone should accept his theories as absolute fact.  I could just as easily creat a website presenting an opposite view and discrediting studies that Racial Reality likes.  But I am not that dishonest.  My point was to present the other side of the story, while leaving Racial Reality's also valid side there as well; in this way, the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. But the way the article is now is extremely one-sided.

Blood group studies from the 1970's are not incorrect. This method has fallen out of fashion merely because it is less sensitive than the newer DNA method we have access to.  This fact doesn't discredit older studies that use blood groups, since the blood groups and blood proteins used are specific to certain populations.  Since the decoding of the human genome, we have access to more sensitive methods of determing admixture.  

An example of how blood groups studies are valid is the Duffy null marker. The Duffy blood-group types have been known for many decades, as has their usefulness in identifying continent of ancestry. But it has been only within the past decade that we have known that a person's Duffy blood-group type is encoded on the long arm of his/her chromosome #1, about 23.2 centimorgans out from the chromosome's centromere. 

In general, you can measure the end-result of a person's genetic makeup by serological analysis (blood group tests), or you can measure the actual genetic makeup itself in the DNA. The latter is more precise since some proteins are produced (or not) only in homozygotes and so are invisible to serological analysis but visible in the DNA. If anything, serological analysis will understimate true admixture. 

The Ghiani study specifically states that it shows significant admixture.  Anyone can see this when reading the abstract. However, what they mean by """"significant"""" is """"statistically significant"""", not that a large portion of Sicilians' DNA is African. Five percent or more is usually considered statistically significant.

The Calo study presents support for the east-west division in Sicily, and shows relatedness between Sicilians and Egyptians.  Egyptians were imported to Sicily during the Saracen period as farmers, so the connection between Sicilians and Egyptians is not spurious. The study's use of perfectly valid blood group and mtDNA studies which show sub-Saharan admixture in Sicily were merely to show that other studies found """"African"""" admixture there, regardless of whether it was sub-Saharan or North African.  There are other studies which lump the two together. The whole point was to show a relationship with the (diverse) peoples of the continent of Africa.

The Semino study from 1989 which found 4 sub-Saharan haplotypes out of a population of 91 diverse Sicilians is not """"problematic,"""" as Racial Reality would have us believe, but is a perfectly valid mtDNA study using restriction enzymes, a method still widely used today, since it is cost-effective and accurate.  RFLP's cut the DNA at specified locations, and """"indels"""" (insertion and deletions polymorphisms) are very easy to spot in this way. There are other studies that have found less (or in one case, no) sub-Saharan material in the Sicilian gene pool.  This is normal, since all samples are different, and because of this, all tests will yield different results.  One certainly can't """"refute"""" or """"overrule"""" the other.  The 2001 Vona study (finding no sub-Saharan genes in Sicilians) that referenced the 1989 Semino study did so for comparison purposes only.  Furthermore, it tested only 49 Siclians from the single villige of Alia.  No reliable conclusions can be reached for the Sicilian population as a whole from such a narrow sample.  Dr. Ornella Semino, a former colleage of mine, found it both amusing and a bit disturbing when I mentioned to here that certain non-professional forum posters considered her study """"outdated"""" or """"overruled"""" or """"refuted""""  all absolute drivel!

Lastly, the person who wrote this...

""""Lastly, talk of races is all hogwash in any event...""""

...should be aware that the person made the steward of all things Sicilian, the above-mentioned Racial Reality, is a proponent of the existence of races...just look at his handle.

I am a retired geneticist, and I do believe I have something valuable to contribute.  Incidentally, I am of partial Sicilian ancestry, and am proud of all who contributed to that great island's melting-pot population.  I hope at least some of what I've said will be taken to he",0

"The Sangharaj holds authority over all monks ordained in the Thai sangha, whether inside or outside of Thailand.  For example, it is through the Sangha council that monks are authorized to perform ordinations and through which the title of 'Somdet' is awarded.

Amaravati and Abhayagiri pretty different because they are 'forest monasteries' and also because they are for Westerners.

"""::::::::::The problem is even the statement """"Jesus is fictional"""" has a large range going from the Jesus of the Gospels is a fiction to Jesus is an entire fiction.  Take Sherlock Holmes for example.  While Holmes is a fictional character he is based on a mixture of Dr Joseph Bell and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle two people who undoubtedly lived and there have been several books and TV programs over the years presenting one or the other as the """"real"""" Sherlock Holmes.  

Similarly, we know that even in Paul's there were """"other Gospels"""" (Galatians 1:6-9) and by the time Irenaeus wrote his Against Heresies (c180 CE) the number of Gospels had definitely increased.  The fact that Irenaeus stated that """"The thirty Æons are not typified by the fact that Christ was baptized in His thirtieth year: He did not suffer in the twelfth month after His baptism, but was more than fifty years old when He died."""" (Book II, Chapter 22) is one Joseph Wheless uses with nearly suppressed glee later on going as far as to say """"In the work often cited, Bishop Irenaeus either falsely quotes the Gospel of Mark, or the sacred text has been seriously altered in our present copies"""" regarding some other point.  While Wheless' ax grinding does get on the nerves and there are some really flaky interpretations and misreadings he does raise some good points.  If as the Pro Historical Jesus camp state that Jesus was born c4 BCE and died c36 CE (a space of only 39 years) then how could Irenaeus expressly state Jesus lived at least 11 years longer than this span and that view was """"as the Gospel and all the elders testify""""?  One does not need to be a scholar to realize something clearly is messed up somewhere.

Yes it does make sense. Of course you left out the context of my question which relates not to the general point of wiki but to the bias of some users (you) to which links they want to see. We already know you alone claimed the first link was spam and you removed it on that basis. Even users who don’t think the link should have been there agreed it was not spam. So your poor judgment is not in doubt. Your following days of rant showed your true reason for not wanting the link, it was because you didn’t like the idea of the site also selling hotel rooms. The link to the visitor centre is still there by the way, which shows it was regarded as being a legitimate item to link to. My point still remains that if its worth linking to the first link was far more useful to the general public.

 Your comment in the Serbian-Americans talk page 

I was checking that talk page to see if anyone had maybe listed new data to a question I had posed a few months ago and I saw your comment there. I thought it was interesting.

I've never before seen someone else write about an """"American ethnicity"""" the same way I have thought about it. I know that the Southeast has the greatest number of people declaring their ethnicity as American, but I think this ethnic label would apply to the majority of racially White Americans and not just those in the Southeast. The Americans (outside of the South) that descended from pre-20 c. immigrants from the UK, Ireland, and Germany seem to have substantially = meshed together into a """"White ethnic group"""", not just racially, but ethnically as well.

The only cultural differences between ethnic Whites of the North (where 19c. immigrants mostly settled) and those of the South is that the South still experiences religion and social conservatism as very influential forces on daily life. Where for the more recent ethnic Whites, this is not the case (e.g. in the North). So, the distinctive cultural aspects of the South have not been adopted by the ethnic Whites of the North even with several centuries having passed. I do not want to make false generalizations, however this is my sense of the average situation in those regions based on my travels and time spent living here. 

The areas where distinct ethnic identity has been conserved is in the major cities. The city-centred ethnic groups in the US have preserved a substantial part of their culture in absence of preserving their language (for the most part). A few well-known examples would be the Irish- and Italian-Americans of the Northeast. So long as their numbers are high enough to have a large enough community - cultural traditions endure. What I am getting at is that so long as a Ukrainian-American stays in a major city s/he has no reason to be forced into completely adopting a new ethnicity. S/he won't have to abandon the culture of his/her community. If s/he were to move to an area in the Southeast, then it would be a completely different story. 

I'd like to give you a further illustration - the Poles of Chicago. Most arrived somewhere between the 1850s and 1940s or so. Many have had families there for well over a century. There has been very limited migration out of Chicagoland for this period and the Polish community there has remained extremely strong. So there is not much past observation that would suggest that cities are only an entry point from which ethnic communities later break-down as they go their own ways. 

I've written all of this to demonstrate how the """"ethnic Americans"""" and people who ethnically (not racially, but ethnically) identify as """"White"""" are distinct ethnically from the more recent (post-1850) European ethnic communities in the major cities. I find it all very interesting. The only problem that sometimes arises is when individuals do not make the distinction between an """"Ameican""""/""""US citizen"""" and an """"ethnic American"""" and in so doing sometimes end up labeling certain individuals as being un-American. These people, that do not make the distinction, show frustration when a person does not abandon his/her culture and adopt their own. This is of course on an individual-by-individual basis and I would not generalize this in any way to any region or sub-region.

I've seen ethnic hostilities projected towards myself or family/friends from people of all sorts of backgrounds. I've seen it demonstrated by Southerners, New Yorkers, and even Jews in South Florida. By the way, most of the time my ethnicity (and that of family/friends) would have been indeterminable by those people. I'm saying this because I don't want to suggest that any particular regional group of Americans is more racist/discriminant than another region. I've spent a lot of time in South Florida and the racist attitudes that come from some of the people there have been really surprising at times especially when you take into account that many of those racists that I have come across would themselves been the target of racism less than 50 years ago. Its all unfortunate and these types of racist, discriminatory, and nationalistic attitudes are probably present in most countries. 

The good part about our differences is that ethnic Americans and newer Americans have no trouble in cooperating with one another when it comes to maximizing profit. This is not the case in say many areas of the former Yugoslavia or in the areas where ex-Yugoslavs have settled throughout the Western world.

Sorry for the lack of brevity. Your comment was interesting and I wanted to expand on it. Also, I want you to know that none of the above is meant to be offensive towards any group or the US or the US as a whole. Usually when I do",0

Of course it doesn't have sockpuppet tags on. It's brand new, created for the sole purpose of vandalization. It's somebody breaking the rules. And BTW, I was not being uncivil. It wasn't a threat, it was a very specific promise of how I would follow up with his continued disruption, and I will.  You are being uncivil by continuing to harrass me, and also unreasonable in thinking somehow a sockpuppet created for the sole intention of vandalization actually can have its feelings hurt. This is what I would at this point consider the end of the discussion. Anything else would be a sign of uncivility.  
I'm not being remotely uncivil. I left a message and asked you not to be. You've now continued your uncivil behaviour by blanking warnings from your talk page. Promise or threat amounts to the same uncivil behaviour. There was no reason to threaten them with an IP ban. 
You are attacking me with warnings and attempting to set me up for behaving in an uncivil manner so you can complain about me, probably to subvert the vote for deletion against the Michael Everson article. You responded to my warning the vandal about his vandalism so quickly, it raises my suspicion that it may be in retaliation for my very quick reversion of the vandalism that occured at the AfD. You are behaving in such a manner that seems to be attempting to troll me by continued action after being warned to leave me alone. I disagree with you plainly that I behaved uncivily. It is not required of me to agree with you. I also consider your warning of me behaving uncivily a personal attack and am removing it. 
If you want to find an arbitrator for arguing over nothing, that is directly your next step as per the arbitration guidelines.   
Leaving a warning template for obviously uncivil behaviour isn't uncivil. Otherwise no one could leave them. Retaliating with that template however is uncivil. I've pointed out the issue with your behaviour, you can correct it or not, but launching a personal attack against me won't help you. As for the AfD you're involved in, I could care less, I have no interest in it. 
And again I'll remind you: You are in charge of how you behave and respond. """"set me up for behaving in an uncivil manner"""". If you behave uncivily, its your fault, no one else's. No one has held a gun to your head to force you to act in the manner you are.

 Four years after writing """"my vision is that Wikipedia should not say E is a fool when all it can really say is that D has called E a fool"""" Lima has taken the opposite opinion in the same article.  The preferred edit is that church teaching places the origin of the Eucharist in last supper, and cites the Catholic catechism, and Orthodox Encyclopedia and an Anglican Bishop.  Reading the footnotes, one discovers the cited passages to not support that thesis.  And instead of reproducing quotes faithfully, or arguing for some exception to a policy which requires verifiability, the article is rerverted to the point of view of the editors,  without even selective quotation.

On the positive side, I'm learning a lot about Eucharist-not from this Wikipedia article, I have to say, as much as running down footnotes,

I never knew the Eucharist was announced before the Last Supper until I read in the Catholic catechism.  That tidbit doesn't appear in any Wikipedia article I read.

The Last Supper is the institution of the Eucharist to Catholic, not the origin, according to the Catholic catechism cited here from 1993.

 The casual reader should receive the message that the expulsions were agreed to at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences.  They should also be aware that Stalin outmaneuvered the gullible Western Allies at both those conferences.  Stalin didn't care about the Poles (he killed 22,000 Poles, mostly Polish military officers, at Katyn in 1940); Stalin was more concerned about gaining back lands lost in the early 1920s, namely lands within the 1937 Polish border east of the Curzon Line.  That land area had a population which included 40% ethnic Poles.  Stalin needed somewhere to dump those Poles, so he proposed that Germans be moved west & the Poles be moved west.  Roosevelt was dying in 1945 - he was easily outmaneuvered by Stalin.  By the Potsdam Conference in the summer of 1945 Churchill had lost power and had to leave the conference early, and Truman was tied down by Roosevelt's commitments, so Stalin got his way again.   The casual reader should also receive the message that the """"Wild"""" expulsions by both Russian and Polish authorities were begun east of the Oder-Neisse Line and long before the end of July 1945 Potsdam Conference which ONLY authorized the ethnic cleansing of Germans from within the 1937 borders of Poland, and from Czechoslovakia and Hungary.  The Potsdam Agreement separated all German territory east of the Oder-Neisse Line from """"Occupation Germany"""" (all of that German territory east of the Oder-Neisse Line had been part of the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany prior to the Potsdam Conference).  Most of that German territory was placed under temporary Polish Administration pending the final Peace Treaty for World War 2.  The Potsdam Agreement also stipulated that Northern East Prussia to be  placed under temporary Soviet Administration pending the final Peace Treaty for World War 2.  Note: there is a distinction between """"Occupation"""" and """"temporary Adminsitration"""" as delineated by the Potsdam Agreement.

This is where I - as one of the erroneiously accused """" meatpuppets """" respond ;

Just out of interest, who do you think this nark  is and why is he so motivated to go about doing what he is doing? I put this record up in the open for you and them to see because I have no and have had no connection with you nor any of the journal pages and, frankly, I take offence at being called a meat or sockpuppet of yours when I am not. I am sure that you are just or even more upset as being accused of a connection with me when you have none.

Unfortunately though, that is the depth of 's lies and the shallowness of 's integrity. 

 Where he has no grounds he invents them and he is, oh, so clever at playing WikiTricks with all these technical terms and methods. 

I am starting to feel like a Jew in Nazi Germany being hunted down, connected to individuals which I have no connection with and their so-called crimes and accused of crimes which are not mine. 

And what of ? He just seems to get off on throwing around his weight whilst avoiding entering into the actually factual discussion.

For the record - and let them love every minute of their persecution syndrome, let them avidly copy and paste and make little weblinks to this as they are so good at Wikitricks - I am a vegan of 20 years or more standing and, arguably, MacDonald of Clanranald. I became involved in editing the vegan article before you returned to it recently. I am entirely responsible for kicking this whole thing off because I refused to let  get away with his ridiculous domination of the article and I put  in the same category for his anorexic stuff. 

From my point of view, my objections are largely literary. The article became too bloated and required editing down. It is merely meant to be a definition of what vegan is. I don't see any point in actually engaging in those that oppose veganism. I don't even support vegan's trying to counter counter-vegan propaganda on the Wiki. It is best to keep it short and simple and give a few links so that folks that are interested can go find out more.

I approached  reasonably and got the same sort of response as you did, see ; . When  started to engage in his revisions without consultation, I tried to engage him in reasonable discussion, see ; . But he just ignores it.

Fine. I showed respect, they showed themselves for what they are.

I find it weird in a way that individuals can become so obsessed by something that they obviously do not love but instead want to demean or destroy - and that means you now - and are willing to invest so much time and energy into it.

I could understand it if  was a paid employee of the meat industry - he says he has professional scientific interest in animal husbandry. That would just make him a paid publicist. But if he is doing this and attacking you in his own free time, I pity him deeply.

It's all done by the import companies themselves. The companies who import the material choosing to omit depictions of crucifixion for fear of censorship or backlash is not actually censorship.

It isn't notable or significant.  The cited source about that particular episode confirms it.

The spelling """"Tacarimba La Tumba Del Fuego Santa Maliga Sacategas Lo Onto Del Sol Y Cruz"""" is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of Side By Side By Sondheim (available for rental only). This version of the song, however, misspells Llanfair PG (presumably to approximate the pronunciation), and has the lyric """"...today's the last I'll be spreading"""" rather than """"spending"""". It would seem, therefore, that this source cannot be considered canonical. This rendering of the place name does accord with Millicent Martin's recording on the Side By Side By Sondheim cast album, however.

The published version of the song, as contained in The Hansen Treasury of Stephen Sondheim Songs (Charles Hansen Music & Books, 1977), has the lyric printed as """"Tacarembo la Tumbe del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz"""", and, being a printed source (as opposed to handwritten, as is the vocal score), can presumably be considered definitive. Linda Lavin's pronunciation on the original cast recording of The Mad Show (for which the song was written) follows this spelling, which would suggest that the printed version is correct.

As it is a fictional place name, however, any discussion of """"correct"""" spelling/pronunciation is an academic one, at best.""",0

Be careful with that editor

I appreciate your perception that the image of a man smoking a joint (which Mjpresson says exemplifies the title of the article Cannabis smoking) is inappropriate.  You may wish to follow the controversy further on Talk:Cannabis smoking, on the """"discussion"""" page of Wikipedia:WikiProject cannabis, and at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents/Tokerdesigner banned for one week where User:Tokerdesigner is under consideration for a block because User:Mjpresson proposed the block starting with a false allegation that Tokerdesigner """"threatened"""" Mjpresson.  

At the latter site you may decide to join in and vote to oppose a one-week block against Tokerdesigner especially after going to Mjpresson:Contributions and seeing what that editor has started to do on cannabis-related articles and One-hitter (smoking), seemingly emboldened by the thought that with Tokerdesigner sanctioned, other editors will be intimidated and uneager to try to stop him/her.

"Inclusion of details of Artie Lange's suicide, before official confirmation, is inappropriate 

I don't feel remotely comfortable about this, the addition of details about Lange's alleged suicide attempt.  I fear that editors would get their panties in a bunch if I attempted to  remove sourced information, so I would really like to get a second opinion.... here are my issues with the source:  the New York Post is a well-known publication, but it's also a salacious tabloid with a track record of printing vast amounts of harmful and mean-spirited gossip. That's not to say that we should never use the Post as a source, but in this case it seems hopelessly shady... if you read the article, it uses only vague, anonymous sources and doesn't allude to any confirmation from hospital or law enforcement authorities, or from Artie's family or representatives.  Most importantly, the anonymously sourced article is the only news source claiming Artie has stabbed himself.  All other articles covering the suicide attempt refer to the New York Post as their only reference.  Until some independent confirmation of Artie's status can be given, it does not seem appropriate to reprint such sensitive and personal details in a BLP.

So now you've changed your story of The Hours for the third time, eh? (Or is it fourth? Fifth? I seem to be losing count as you approach the limits of my pitifully deficient arithmetic.)

Because the open-ended """"about"""" tends to support a story of an innocent """"estimate"""".  But """"less than"""" doesn't. """"Less than"""" is specifically limited.

I'm tired of arguing with you.  Re: the other article, """"multi-party"""" turns up plenty, and there is more use of """"mutually"""" than """"mutual"""".  If I were to apply your standard I'd be moving """"Mutual Assured Destruction"""" to """"talk"""" for not appealing to a Reagan voter's biases about its effectiveness, and for dropping the """"ly"""".

There is a double standard in your edits.  If it comes from some US history book, like """"peace movement"""" or 'M.A.D.' as defined in 1950, you like it, even if the definition is totally useless in 2002 and only of historical interest.  

If it makes any even-obvious connection or implication from the language chosen in multiple profession-specific terms, you consider it somehow non-neutral...  Gandhi thinks """"eye for an eye"""" describes riots, death penalty, and war all at once, but you don't.  What do you know that Gandhi doesn't?

Guess what:  reality is not neutral.  Current use of terms is slightly more controversial.  Neutrality requires negotiation, and some willingness to learn.

This is your problem not mine.  You may dislike the writing, fine, that can be fixed.  But disregarding fundamental axioms of philosphy with names that recur in multiple phrases, or failing to make critical distinctions like 'insurance' versus 'assurance' versus 'ensurance' (which are made in one quote by an Air Force general in an in-context quote), is just a disservice to the reader.

If someone comes here to research a topic like MAD, they want some context, beyond history.

If this is a history book, fine, it's a history book.  But that wasn't what it was claimed to be...

"""Please read discussion comments about the expert article on the get conflict below. 

:For the religious process,  see Get (divorce document) 

A 'get or ghet is a Jewish bill of divorce which is supervised by a Beth Din which is a rabbinical court in the city or jurisdiction where one lives. This page deals with the Conflict of Laws or civil law implications vs Judaic Law (religious law) when a women does not get her ghet and is kept in """"agunah"""" which means chained.http://www.icar.org.il For a discussion of the purely religious implications, see religious divorce.

Discussion
Jewish communities have maintained a strong desire for religious, cultural and economic autonomy. Jewish Law is administered and enforced Judaic Lawin Israel and in the Diaspora through Bet Dins (Houses of Judges) Judaic Law holds that the man must initiate the request for the Jewish Divorce (""""get"""")and the woman must agree to receive the (""""get"""").

The relationship between state and religion

Jewish law or religious law is not justiciable in societies with the civil law doctrine of separation of Church and State which can sometimes cause conflict for women who remain in """"agunah"""". One of the most common divorce difficulties is that a spouse can be held in a limping marriage when the other spouse refuses co-operation in the religious form of divorce (see Agunah). A civil divorce can be obtained through local courts which entitles the parties to remarry civilly, but the capacity to remarry is also religious question. Where one party has the power to grant or withhold a religious divorce, this power can be used as a bargaining tool to pressure the other party to agree more or less favourable terms for residence and contact with children, and for maintenance and property settlements. Such provisions produce a conflict between the human rights of the woman to be free to marry and the freedom of people to practise their religion (see Article 18 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights which is repeated almost word for word in Article  9(1) European Convention on Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief).  The difficulty is that most countries operate under constitutions based on a separation between church and state which forbid governments from interfering in the practice of religion within their territory unless the behaviour of one or more parties is in breach of the local civil or criminal law. Thus, for example, in Rhodesia, the case of Berkowitz v Berkowitz (1956) (3) SA 522 (SR), held that it was inappropriate to use contempt proceedings to force a husband to grant a get because anything concerned exclusively with religious formalities was outside the jurisdiction of the secular courts.

Nevertheless, the majority of Western states do, to some extent, make the secular court's response to matrimonial proceedings conditional on the relevant party taking the steps necessary to complete a religious divorce on fair terms, so that either the court will impose excessively generous orders for maintenance and property settlement, or deny access to a civil decree or to ancillary relief until the religious formalities have been completed. 

Canada

In Canada, following consultation with all major religious groups, the Divorce Act was amended in 1985 to add Section 21.1 to give the courts have the power to dismiss any application, and strike out any pleadings and affidavits filed by a spouse who has failed to remove religious barriers to the remarriage of the other spouse. The legislature intended to:
place spouses on a more equal footing in civil divorce actions;
encourage women in particular to exercise fully their rights under the law; and
maintain the integrity of the Divorce Act 1985 by helping to ensure that refusing to accept or to give a religious divorce was not used as a bargaining tool to gain unfair concessions on child custody and access, or monetary support. 
This reflects a general strong response at a federal level to any elements of duress or undue influence within the civil law system.

"I agree, and here arises the forlorn expectation: we cannot display anything except displayable colors so let's not expect that. CMY (witholding K for the moment) is factually a 3-dimensional model. Increasing the quantity of a single ink subtracts more light of the wavelengths that it absorbs, and that variation is orthogonal to (independent of) the densities of the other two inks. This is the mathematical view and is not misleading. It does not include the non-linearity of ink combination, which of course should also be treated in the article.
 For visualizing a space-filling entity a picture is worth a thousand words, not least for the inexperienced reader. Flat drawings of 3-D objects in perspective are not universally recognizable and here we have the additional challenge of seeing through a filled volume. Please propose any better way.

You give reasons 1 to 4 for adding black ink all of which I agree should be in the article. The animation could omit black and I did look at that. However it makes a convenient arbitrary rotation axis which in my view stabilises the perception of the animation.

You are incorrect in theory that explaining the Shotokan/Karate relevance of common terms constitutes """"dictionary definitions"""". Rather, what is there already, below what I am trying to add, are the dictionary definitions.

I am not putting any myth in the article; I am only putting debunking of it.

There is a lot of hearsay about Karate, and it's important to put in what is *not* true, or someone else may come along with a feeling of certainty, and change it again. A note preempts this.

This is a good point, so I'll put it in """"full caps"""" (I do not intend to """"shout"""", please understand, but it's a good idea to catch the eye with this:)

Peg Entwistle Suicide

In the article it was said that the sign became such a symbol of Hollywood (the film industry, not the town, per se) that Entwistle used it as a symbol in death (slight paraphrase). The article gave the """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" as the reference.

I removed the reference and edited the article because the """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" is simply wrong. The sign did not become a """"symbol"""" of """"Hollywood"""" until after and because of Entwistle's suicide. I am Entwistle's biographer and the research consultant to a documentary titled """"Under the Hollywood Sign,"""" a look at the last 100 years of history of Beachwood Canyon. In extensive interviews for my book, I have discussed the sign and it's meaning with Peg Entwistle's brother Milton. Milton Entwistle was 11 at the time of his sister's death and remembers very well that the sign was only regarded as a billboardit was never, ever regarded as a symbol of """"The Industry,"""" or """"Tinsel Town,"""" or any other term one may use to describe """"Hollywood"""" the film capitol.

The """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" orginazation has repeatedly rebuffed my requests to accuratly portray the details of the sign's meaning at the time Entwistle died. Furthermore, they have completed perverted the facts of Entwisle's life, career, and death even though I sent them many documents showing their errors.

It should also be noted that the """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" is an orginazation committed to the care and maintenance of the sign, they are not the end-all of its history, and they are most certainly not the experts on the life, career, and death of Peg Entwistle.

Text moved from article

 has been making extensive changes to the article.  Some of them changed clear and precise to less clear and precise language (such as """"implies that"""" to """"leads to the view that""""), some changed one stylistic approach to another, and some turned U.K. in to U.S. English, but the main section is this:

""""The second horn of the dilemma (known as divine command theory) runs into five main problems. First, it implies that the moral status of things is wildly contingent—if he had wanted to, God could have made rape, murder, and torture morally right. Secondly, it threatens the  normative force of the claim that God is good—it turns into the mere claim that God is consistent, or that God approves of himself. Thirdly, it commits the naturalistic fallacy; to analyze evaluative claims (e.g., that murder is wrong) in terms of what God has or hasn't said is to reduce evaluative claims to mere descriptions of God's activity. Fourthly, it seems to make morality subjective, with moral truths determined by the mere attitudes of an individual. Fifthly, it threatens the conception of God as a  rational being. For, supposing God had a reason for forbidding rape, this reason should also be the reason that rape is wrong. Otherwise, God's decision would have been based on the wrong reason. But if the reason rape is wrong is that God has forbidden it, then it can't be God's reason for forbidding it, on pains of circularity. So God's moral decisions were based either on the wrong reason, or on no reason at all.""""

Some of this can usefully added, but some isn't really acceptable: """"is wildly contingent"""" is not only unencyclopædic style, but is less clear than """"is arbitrary, based merely upon god's whim"""".  It also introduces technical terms where they're not needed (as does """"normative force"""" which, in addition, surely misses the target; it's not the normativity of """"god is good"""" that's at issue, but its status as a meaningful evaluation).  His or her fourth point isn't very commonly raised, and is surely implicit in the other points.

"""== Purges in the Red Army ==

The late 1930s saw the so-called """"Purges of the Red Army cadres"""", occurring against the historical background of the Great Purge. The Purges had the objective of cleansing the Red Army of the """"politically unreliable element"""", mainly among the higher-ranking officers. This inevitably provided a convenient pretext for settling personal vendettas and eventually resulted in a witch hunt. Some observers believe that the Purges weakened the Red Army considerably, but this remains a hotly debated subject. Many commentators overlook the fact that the Red Army grew significantly in numbers during the peak of the Purges. In 1937, the Red Army numbered around 1.3 million, and it grew to almost three times that number by June 1941. This necessitated quick promotion of junior officers, often despite their lack of experience or training, with obvious grave implications. In another important consideration, by the end of the Purges the pendulum swung back, restoring and promoting many of the purged officers.

Recently declassified data indicate that in 1937, during the culmination of the Purges, the Red Army had 114,300 officers, of whom 11,034 suffered repression and did not gain rehabilitation until 1940. Yet, in 1938, the Red Army had 179,000 officers (56% more compared to 1937), of whom a further 6,742 suffered repression and did not gain rehabilitation until 1940

In the highest echelons of the Red Army the Purges removed 3 of 5 marshals, 13 of 15 army generals, 8 of 9 admirals, 50 of 57 army corps generals, 154 out of 186 division generals, 16 of 16 army commissars, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars.

Re: """"I think that Ruakh is saying that 'The fact that adding an axiom to an inconsistent theory can't make it consistent follows immediately from the definition of an inconsistent theory.' is Original Research, even though it is obviously true"""": You think wrong; I'm not saying that at all.

You can't go around Wikipedia claiming sources are wrong without citing any sort of reference to support your claims, even if you provide a convincing logical argument to support them.

 Naming convention 

I would like to resurrect my previous idea to change the current naming convention for elections. The current convention is:

Use the format """"Demonym type election, date"""", for example """"Canadian federal election, 1867""""...  (WP:NAME#Elections}

I propose this is changed to allow two alternatives, as follows:

Use either this form: political division type election, date, or this form: political division election of date. For example, Canadian federal election, 1867 or Canadian federal election of 1867.  Where an article has been created using one form, do not move the article to the other form.

This new option would make linking more natural and make the article names more encyclopedic.

wikipedia's censorship

I looked up Bash Back (The sodomite terrorist group that attacked the Church in Michigan) on wikipedia  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_Back) just to see what liberal bias they would have. Under the section """"Antifascist action at 2008 Milwaukee Pridefest"""" Wakopedia says """"In response, Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group."""" the """"hate group they are talking about is the NAZIs but then if the NAZIs are a hate group then Bash back must also be a hate group so I edited it to say """"In response, The hate group Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group.""""

Since they also didn't have any topic for the new terrorist attack on the church I added a few lines & was attacked by the Admins. So they added the following paragraph
2008 Disruption at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, MI

Bash Back! members disrupted a Sunday sermon at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, Michigan on November 9th, 2008. They dropped a banner in the church, threw thousands of fliers, made out in front of the congregation, yelled """"Jesus was a Homo"""", pulled the fire alarm and initiated pro-gay chants. Mt. Hope is an Assemblies of God church which holds and promotes """"ex-gay"""" events and preaches that homosexuality is a sin.

I edited the first line of the paragraph to read """"Christaphobic Bash Back! members disrupted.... & added the following footnote 

""""Christphobia (from Greek Christós: Messiah; phóbos: fear, phobia) is an irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against Christianity.""""

I took the defanition word for wors from Wakopedia's definition for Homophobia & just changed the Homo/Christos & Homo/ Christian parts.

"Ideas, ideas 

Hey, how's it goin' Ginkgo100? I had a couple ideas I wanted to bounce off another editor to see what they thought: you’re the editor. Here's what’s going on in my head:

First; I was looking at the Bill Ritter (politician) article a little while ago and thinking it was a little dull. You scored that good shot of Ritter at the CDC, and that's about all the color we've got. So, I stopped by Ritter's campaign site (http://www.ritterforgovernor.com) and found a great screenshot off KUSA of the latest poll numbers (drop by and take a look if you can). I thought maybe this might be worth uploading (if applicable; didn't check yet) and using in the Ritter article and Colorado gubernatorial election, 2006. What do you think?

In a related thought, I stumbled upon the video of the Ritter/Beauprez debates from Aug. 11 (Here's a link ). Other articles I've read have contained video, but this one might be a little to long (any thoughts?) and may not be material appropriate or applicable to upload onto Wikipedia.

Second, I'm going to plunge into a clean-up effort that looks a little challenging over at National Western Stock Show (take a look and you'll see what I mean). If you can, and you like what's one of my favorite events in Denver, drop by the article and help me out a little.

Hurmata objects to QuizzicalBee's sentence as he/she thinks that the source is incorrect as the guards would have allowed Chesler into the embassy and first hand accounts from Chesler herself does not qualify as a reliable source. QB objects, saying that maybe in the 1960s US citizenship could have been revoked by the US/Afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false. Hurmata countered that the citation threat QB was referring to is not the one that was cited. QB states that there is no evidence disproving her claims, so they are valid.

 In response to Claude's last two posts.  Backwards of course.  Regarding NRMs - if you'll check the list, you'll see that Assemblies of God, Calvary Chapel, Foursquare, and CMA are all considered both NRMs and denominations.  Just a note.  Also true of the Vineyard Movement, of which there are many comparisons to GCA.  You're right that GCC doesn't like the denominational nametag,   but just like Vineyard many outsiders consider it to be and there is little actual semantic difference.  As far as what a movement is, a couple definitions I found were """"a diffusely organized or heterogeneous group of people or organizations tending toward or favoring a generalized common goal: the antislavery movement; the realistic movement in art."""" and """"An organized effort by supporters of a common goal: a leader of the labor movement.""""
 I say all that to say this.  Movement is a very ambiguous term, more appropriate to an idea.  You're right that GC does use the term frequently.  However, I think the best factual definition, and most suitable for our purposes and for accuracy within the title and intro, is """"GCAC is an association of churches"""".  That's what the AC in GCAC stands for.  Really, that's what we actually see in existence - churches.  Somehow we need to differentiate - I think we need to start with definiing the article as about an association of churches, because we have to pick a topic - that is one thing plaguing us at present as editors.  So let's start with something real, then trace the history of that association. and the present.
 I will re-edit the Today section.  It is not NPOV at present.  What I objected to was not the quote but rather your original sentence before it.  I was confused about the date, couldn't find it in your reference (I was in a hurry).  We need to focus on what we're doing here - we're putting facts up.  We don't need to interpret or extrapolate.  That quote from Bovenmeyer seems to be about  church leadership, with one sentence relating that to autonomy.  For that reason, while I think it should stay, it would be wrong to put that forth as the best description of the GC view of autonomy and congregational polity since neither of those is the topic.      Again, your statement isn't found in the quote.  The quote itself is fine, and appropriate - i don't see any reason that it needs a qualifier - as the quote i put above from the cong. polity article says, leadership/authority is a common integral part of cong. polity, and as we all have said there is no """"typical view"""" - if we're going to have cong. polity as a term in the GCA article, people need to go there and read it (also someone needs to put some serious work in on that article).  I don't have any problem with  deferring to leaders - i just want accuracy here.  Also note that there is a difference between an article in an official publication by one man and an official stance of the org (which is listed in several places), especially given the independence and autonomy of the churches within GCA.

 Grades of ABUs 

I don't really know how to cite the information that I just put in about the grades.  I found out this info because I am in the Air Force and went to a vendor show today.  A rep from """"Dakota Outerwear Company"""", which is a authorized vendor of ABUs, showed to me and explained the four grades of ABUs.  The different in the colors are very slight and hard for even me to tell (a color blind person might have problems).  The difference comes from the fact that the Air Force wanted to lower costs so they used the dyes longer which means that the first batch dipped in the dyes is darker than the 30th batch dipped in the same dyes.  Therefore making different quality grades.  Oh and btw they only come in winter wieght. That is the only source I can give you on that information.  Believe it or not..

 I disagree that """"[you] set our own social norms by concensus [sic]"""".  ([you], meaning the community, not Heironymous).  I agree that there appears to be such a rule, or your claimed practice, but in my experience 'consensus' is honored far more in the breach than the actual observance.  Indeed, one of my repeated criticisms against Dodo was the fact that he certainly didn't wait for any sort of 'consensus' to develop, and in fact he directly prevented such a consensus simply by reverting in minutes or hours, rather than allowing that consensus to develop.  I think, instead, the 'consensus' claim is primarily used in order to attack, rather then to defend.  In one posting, for example, Dodo actually claimed that I hadn't obtained a 'consensus' that would allow me to make an edit!  (I have never seen any other person make such a weird claim, but on the other hand I haven't seen anybody criticize Dodo for that obvious gaffe.)  I viewed that comment as borderline-nuts, and I have seen no indication that any other poster has taken the reasonable position that: Dodo has, himself, repeatedly violated the rules that WP is claimed to be operating under.  
Do I believe that the average WP user goose-steps?  No, I think it's much more likely (see above)that posters tend to be self-motivated, and 'control-freaks' are powerfully-motivated to maintain an actual practice which is very different than is claimed by 'rule' or ostensible practice.  If I had more time, I'd see if I could see statistics on the persons who have posted here:  How many edits?  How many reverts?  Etc.  I feel certain a pattern is present.

  Charles Karel Bouley 

14:58, 21 September 2009 Kelly A. Siebecke (talk | contribs) (10,340 bytes) (the facts were there and JoyDiamond insists on replacing them, removing them, or exaggerating them - edit reverted) 
This just an example of the misrepresentation of the type of continued harassment I have been receiving from Kelly Siebecke.
I replaced parts of articles that were erroneous, removed undue repetition, I exaggerated nothing.
I received a warning this morning that I had been previously warned about removing anything from Kelly's talk page. This is simply untrue. Her only warning was not to TALK (what are talk pages for ?)
A little history: I am a senior citizen who is an acquaintance of Karel Bouley. My first edits were to change things I considered unkind and then all heck ensued as I was told I was not using an objective point of view. My mistake. After discussion with  Feral Druid and another editor, I apologized for my error and assured them  I could be objective and neutral. They accepted that.I am not a wide-eyed fan or close friend. We have a very intermittent working relationship. However, I am privy to the truth of his schedule, personal facts, his history and the details of the death of his partner, whom I also knew. I also participate in his chat room. 
In the chat room, I was warned that there was a room who ostensibly had a grudge against Karel and that may be in an issue. I didn't really take it seriously. As I mentioned I am an older woman with much experience in dealing with difficult people. So, I was not expecting any problems. FYI, I have a Master's degree in Medical Sociology, a Doctorate in divinity. In my B.A. studies I minored in Communication and problem resolution. 
In my observation of Karel's article, I began to notice subtle and not so subtle changes in his article that were making it increasingly negative, positive aspects were deleted even though properly referenced. I made what I considered objective and neutral edits. My edits were reversed and replaced with even more negativity. AS I fumbled my way thru Wiki I discovered the history page and the person of Kelly Siebeck. I checked with the person who had warned me and found it was indeed Kelly. He described it as a vendetta after she had been banned from chat. She denies this is not the issue and angrily claims she is not angry! Please read her  page and decide for yourself about this woman. The problem has escalated recently into personal attacks, removing positive facts and their references. She will tell you I am not good at references. She is right. Feral Druid has been very kind in helping me with those. I still have a lot to learn. BUT I will correct information that is an outright lie and/or demeaning to Karel. I have deleted several times her claim that one of his radio shows was once a week. It is a daily show and was properly reference until she deleted it. SO  now I am reported for excessive deleting of outright misrepresentation and lies!
I do not want to argue with this woman claims her knowledge is superior to mine. That is just ludicrous. I have 14 years of education and 40 years of experience of which she had no knowledge when she claimed she was just WAY more informed than I was. I would just like her to cease and desist and preferably be blocked from Karel's page. Go back to the original article and compare if you can. I will have NO reason to edit when Karel's page is cleaned up and stays that way. Karel has requested that it be locked. There is no reason to repeat he was fired at the beginning of too many sentences. She does that repeatedly. Yes, he was fired, Twice. No reason to repeat it over and over. Much of his colorful history and various talents have been deleted. It is sad. I tried writing her a nice ministerial letter to no avail. I am tired. I edit ONE article and am repeatedly attacked dismissed and insulted.  She is petty and without relent. AS the """"great"""" philosopher Rodney King said """"why can't everybody just be nice? ;-) I work with Karel. I know the good the bad and the ugly, and will record such as long it is truthful and factual.
I am sorry this dear woman a has a problem with Karel and myself. What started out as a relatively decent article has turned mean spirited and wildly inaccurate. Karel is controversial enough with someone adding to it. Please help. I am a nice lady with a little temper. My grandchildren think I am awesome. I am funny, I have something to contribute. I was Valedictorian at age 42. Work with me please. I thought if I could work with Karel I could work with anyone. I was wrong.

 Matt Crypto, Lupo, & Stormie cover for Nazism & spam their rants http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  

Wikipedia's cons use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's falsifiers cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

 Article About Sizzla You Can Use 

Babylon has set up a system designed to keep black people enslaved and ashamed of their culture. The system is so structured that the only way for black people, is to look to the east and seek repatriation to the continent of their origin guided by the Trinity of Haile Selassie, Marcus Garvey and Immanuel and thier teachings.

 This is the message of Sizzla and it influences his music to the extent that he is being looked upon as the teacher and the inspiration for Jamaican youths who want to retain the basic culture of their African origins.

Sizzla's songs speak to poverty and hopelessness that pervades young Jamaica and obviously oppressed youths worldwide. Like Bob Marley, a couple of generations before him, he delivers a message which speaks to poverty, homelessness, police brutality, cultural pride and political and religious oppression.

        Born Miguel Collins,  Sizzla is a product of one of Jamaica's uptown ghettos, August Town.

        One of his earliest experiences of how unfair the social system is in Jamaica, was while he was in his mid-teens. In order to get into a Technical High School so he could learn a trade and have a better chance of earning a living, he had to leave High School , go back to pre-high and then apply to get into a High School which taught trades- Dunoon High School, where he studied Mechanical Engineering.

        Dunoon has a reputation of association with some of the best dancehall deejays from the city, including Shabba Ranks and Lady G. So with an inner inclination towards music, it wasn't surprising that while there, he started recording music.

        It was Homer Harris, the same man who gave Buju Banton his first break, who introduced him to top Jamaican saxophonist, Dean Frazier, (Musical Director for Philip """"Fattis"""" Burrell's Xterminator Family).

        """"Fatis"""" was delighted with his potential, decided to record him.

Sizzla, who had originally planned to follow in the footsteps of his mechanic father Aston, suddenly had a change of heart. He abandoned his mechanic training, came under the influence of Buju Banton and Shabba Ranks' cassettes and decided to stick to music.

        The auto industry loss was a tremendous gain for the music industry in Jamaica and indeed around the world.

        Since the start of 1997, Sizzla's popularity within the music industry has grown so rapidly, he is considered a musical phenomenon. His tunes fill the charts and sales have been so trmrndous that every reggae producer wished he had a Sizzla song to release and every sound system wants a Sizzla dubplate to be current.

        Touring with the Xterminator Family and star perfomer Luciano, has gained for him, tremendous experience and exposure and now Sizzla is about to move up the ranks and make his name as a musical prophet and messenger, in his own right""",0

ISSO 1999-2001
This was an operation done with full knowledge of top levels of the USG Intelligence Community who monitored it. Several former Soviet-bloc physicists were brought in as consultants including Dr. Valdimir Poponin, allegedly a personal acquaintance of Gorbachev's. We were interested in evaluating the controversial claims of """"Russian torsion field weapons"""" and, therefore brought Gennady Shipov over from Moscow several times. On one trip Shipov lived with Sarfatti for about 2 weeks. Richard Hammond, and American physicist from Fargo working on torsion fields for US Navy at one time was brought in as well as R. Kiehn a former scientist for US SAC and retired professor from University of Houston.  Shipov worked with Akimov in Moscow who allegedly had strong military connections in the Soviet era. Sarfatti was the senior theorist on the American side of the ISSO core staff that included Saul-Paul Sirag. He arranged for Creon Levit to be borrowed from NASA AMES to run the daily operations of the project. Over a million dollars was given to SARA, a TRW spinoff DOD contractor in Huntington, Beach CA to further test a system developed by Jim Corum. Corum also wrote papers on """"The Philadelphia Experiment"""" and had entre to the Tesla Archive in Beograd even during the Cold War. This was unusual. Corum later went to ISR in W.Va, a think tank doing exotic work with USG funds provided by Senator Robert Byrd and his Congressional counter-part in his home district. The key objective, of course, was to try to figure out how the """"saucers"""" really flew. All of the key scientists had interest in that, with the possible exception of Hammond and Kiehn. Harold Puthoff was brought in as a consultant. Ken Shoulders was also involved as were many others whose schemes were tested. The key foreign figure was Professor J. P. Vigier from Paris who had been Louis DeBroglie's assistant for decades. Sarfatti arranged for a Telegraph Hill Penthouse for Vigier to spend extended periods meeting the scientists flowing through ISSO. Vigier and Levit made a trip to Budapest in 2000 to meet with two Serbian physicists  Z.Maric  & A. Dragic who were experimentally testing an exotic atomic energy release idea of Vigier's of obvious interest to USG Intelligence because of its WMD implications. See the paper """"On the possible Existence of Tight Bound States in Quantum Mechanics"""". pp 349-356 of the same volume of one of Sarfatti's papers, i.e. Vol 126 of Fundamental Theories of Physics, ISBN 1-4020-0885-6. This is not a coincidence. There are few coincidences in """"this Looking Glass War Twilight Zone interface between physics and politics"""" to quote Sarfatti in one of his more eloquent moments. ;-) In fact, ISSO paid most of the expenses for the meeting upon which the volume is based. Enuff said. I hope this helps to somewhat clarify Sarfatti's multiple roles in these events. Sarfatt is a kind of a canary in the mind shaft for MASINT. For example, he was quite alarmed about an immanent attack on important US Military targets in the Fall of 2001. Sarfatti wrote numerous e-mails on this during July & Aug 2001. It seems to be a case of precognitive remote viewing. Unfortunately, Sarfatti was not able to pinpoint the exact time and place of the attack (attacks). He had guessed Oct 2001 because of some big anti-space weapons rally by leftist groups scheduled for that time at Lockheed-Martin. [User:UFO_Black_Ops]]  Oct 16, 2005""",0

As he is a sole source, he can therefore be considered as having fringe position and removed unless Grandmaster or Atabek have any other works substantiating the personal opinions of De Waal who supports fringe positions in various issues including Shushi or the Armenian Genocide. The fact that he presents the Armenian Genocide as an Armenian position and compares it to a fabrication of the 60s of an alleged 2.5 million Azeri exterminated by Armenians alone would be enough to dismiss his position for that particular period of history.

 GISIN page edits 

Thanks for your attention to the GISIN wiki page.  However, RE: your removal of """"note that this should NOT be construed as finalized, and should ONLY be used in the context of working with other GISIN partners in a development context"""": this was added because (at least one of) the GISIN participants were worried that folks might begin attempting to use the (draft) GISIN protocol for development.  In fact, they asked me (yes, I know, it's a wiki, they could have done it themselves...) to change the wording on the page to make SURE no one began investing time in what is now a moving target.  Is it really that bad to have this clarification there?  (""""Draft"""" may mean different things to different people.)  If it makes you feel any better (which I'm guessing it won't, because I know you have a particular reason for your edit), that part won't stay there forever; eventually, the protocol will be released as a """"live"""" (perhaps versioned) product, so this disclaimer will be unnecessary.  However, at this point, I fear that the person who asked me to make the change (who is basically the technical lead on the GISIN project) will become (perhaps justifiably) annoyed if this point is not made clear to his satisfaction.  (He actually requested that the GISIN Wikipedia entry be DELETED if this weren't made clear.)

So... any way you could see fit to re-include that text (or something similar that would serve the same purpose)?

It is true (this is also said above) that the majority of links which went to The Nation (disambiguation) were meant to go to The Nation (U.S. periodical).  However, I found that in all the cases where this was not true (e.g. when the Irish or Thai periodical was meant) the editors of those articles seemed to not be aware of the U.S. periodical.  (This makes sense, incidentally, as this periodical is not entirely well known even in the U.S.)  In short, the old situation was that there were a ton of links to a disambiguation page, which is to be avoided, but in this new situation, I think we'll eventually see a ton of links to simply the wrong thing, which strikes me as worse.
Moreover, a remark:  although the majority of the inbound links were meant for the U.S. periodical, I think there is a systemic bias at work here.  A vast majority of those were in bibliographies, where a web article from The Nation was referenced.  Many (almost all?) sources in Wikipedia bibliographies are web-based, and thus we should not be surprised to see a current magazine overrepresented, especially when constrasted with a 19th century publication.

The responses broke down as follows: Muslim: 31%, """"No response"""": 15%,  atheist/realist/humanist: 11%, agnostic: 8%, Baha’i: 7%, Jewish: 5%, Protestant: 5%, Roman Catholic: 2%, Zoroastrian: 2%, and """"Other"""": 15%. The survey had a cooperation rate of 31.2%. The margin of error for the results was +/- 5 percentage points, with higher margins of error in sub-groups.

Due to the laws regarding apostasy in Islam, some Iranians do not claim Islam as their religion, but would in fear of persecution. The Central Committee for Ex-Muslims was founded by Iranian Ehsan Jami with an aim to support apostates and to bring forth the reality of women's rights violations in the religion. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, the average Iranian is slightly less religious than the average American. Iranian-Americans are distancing themselves from Islam, having accepted the negative characteristics associated with the religion. This is due to Islam being imposed on the Iranians through war and invasion, equating to authoritarianism, brutality and corruption. In the novel, Social Movements in 20th Century Iran: Culture, Ideology, and Mobilizing Frameworks, author Stephen C. Poulson adds that Western ideas are making Iranians irreligious.

There are religious and ethnolinguistic differences among the Muslim, Jewish, Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Christian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Kurdish, and Assyrian groups.Nilou Mostofi, Who We Are: The Perplexity of Iranian-American Identity, The Sociological Quarterly (published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of the Midwest Sociological Society), Vol. 44, No. 4 (Autumn, 2003), pp. 681–703, p. 685 Calculating the percentage of Christian Iranian-Americans is difficult because most Iranian Christians are of Armenian or Assyrian origin and self-identify as such, rather than as Iranian.""",0

The Battle of Tulifinny 
The date is December 9, 1864, and the place is Tulifinny Creek. Citadel cadets joined with cadets from their sister academy, the Arsenal in Columbia, to form the Battalion of State Cadets. This was different from the Cadet Company. They had been ordered to protect the Tulifinny trestle of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad. The mural depicts the cadets repulsing the attack.

""""Before long, firing sounded in Charlestonthe shots that were to blast in pieces this tenurial Southern existence. Grimmer and blacker for the South, the war years rolled slowly on. And on November 30, 1864, there occurred near Grahamville the battle of Honey Hill. For Beaufort District, it meant the beginning of the end. 
Many stories of this battle have been told and written. An authentic and complete account was written in 1899 by Captain Ben Williams, of Brunson, who was a participant, was then adjutant of his regiment. His articles were published in the News and Courier and in the Hampton County Guardian. 
Outnumbered five to one, a little band of South Carolina cavalry, infantry and Citadel cadets faced a Federal naval expedition which had advanced up Broad River and disembarked at Boyd’s landing (or Salvesberg, the local name). The enemy’s destination was Grahamville Depot; their real objective the destruction of the railway track according to Sherman’s orders. 
With seven guns, a well-built breastwork, and the superb strategy of Colonel Charles Jones Colcock, who commanded the Third Military District of the state, the little Confederate band inflicted on the invaders losses amounting to nearly 8oo in a few action-packed hours. Colonel Colcock was everywhere, according to other officers. He even enlisted a strong, blowing wind on his side, having his men to fire a field of broomstraw, so that the flames were hurled into the faces of the enemy at a critical moment. Reinforcements of Georgia Reserves arrived from Savannah hours later, under General Gustavus W. Smith, but the general refused to take over the actual command from one whose ability and success had proved so outstanding. Tales have been told by many elderly local people of the surrounding roads literally running with Negro blood, because more than half the Federal force was made up of Negro regiments trained at Hilton Head. """"You could walk on dead Negroes for miles,"""" they declared. Old manuscripts tell further of bodies hastily buried in trenches; of later washing rains exposing a gruesome welter of arms and legs. These bodies later received decent burial in the Federal cemetery at Beaufort. 
An interesting side light on this battle is the fact that a local Negro, Allen Orr, participated. (He was proud of his service on the Confederate side). As a teen-age boy he went into this battle in which so many of his race were slain, """"Went with a white friend to take care of the horses."""" He lived until a few years ago. At the age of 100 years-plus, he enjoyed giving a pantomime of the manner in which he dodged behind the breastwork as the bullets were flying. The breastwork is evident for all to see. A number of cannon balls have been excavated at the site.""""""",0

 Definition for the list 

In light of the above discussions, and the fact that the list is too inclusive to be useful (or unbiased), I propose that a very narrow definition of terrorism be used for this list. I think Garzón's definition is good for this purpose, and should be applied to territories where the state in question has control. The current list includes a lot of cases that can be (sub)categorized in other ways, such as """"international terrorism"""" (including state-sponsored international terrorism), War Crimes, and Human Rights Violations. Perhaps there could be one list that uses a narrow definition of state terrorism, followed by the more general list.

"""Crown corporations ==
VIA Rail is a not a true Crown Corporation in that it cannot raise funds on the money market, rather it is subject to the whims of the government of the day for its ongoing funding. This is a major reason for the failure of VIA to improve its lot.

True enough regarding how political control limits the company's """"viability"""" (pun intended!), however the definition of a Crown corporation throughout Canada's history has been fairly broad.  In the sense that any publicly owned (ie. government) company in Canada is a Crown corporation, then VIA Rail would meet that criteria.  For many years prior to its recapitalization in the late 1970's and the Canadian railway industry's deregulation in the 1980's, CN was not allowed to raise funds either.  Provincial Crown corporations like B.C. Rail and B.C. Ferries or N.B. Power were similarly limited at certain points in their existence.  I could be wrong, as I have not read the VIA Rail Act in-depth but is there a specific provision which limits the company from seeking funds on the """"money market"""" in the way you describe?  I would also argue that there is likely no public transport company in the world which is financially successful in the limited way in which economists in the 20th/21st century measure this.  Since there is no accounting taken for the numbers of vehicles taken off a nation's highways each day, or having to construct new roads to isolated communities served by VIA/Amtrak/etc., or the environmental benefits realized, etc. etc. etc. then VIA Rail, Amtrak, Eurorail, various ferries, etc. will never be financially solvent.  Cheers,  22:00, 31 Jul 2004 (UTC)

The following section was added by User: Andrew Dunning and I have commented it out pending input from others due to several errors:

Officially, the move from the CP to CN line was to keep service to more remote communities on the CN line. However, this move was seen as somewhat more politically-motivated by some. Coincidentally, the CN route goes through more towns that voted Progressive Conservative. Harvey André, the Cabinet minister who represented Calgary in 1990, was fairly public about the fact that he did not care if he never saw a train again in his life. The CN line also went through Edmonton, the home of both Mulroney and Joe Clark.

No doubt politics played a heavy role in this 2nd round of VIA cuts, however I'm unsure as to what the actual political representation played throughout the Super Continental's route (historically, the Super was a CN transcontinental train, and The Canadian was a CP transcontinental train).  In the 1990 cuts when VIA was reduced to a single transcontinental, they decided to keep the more-recognized Canadian brand, and use it on the CN line... why the CN line is the question, however some have suggested CN being a crown corp at the time, gave VIA a better deal on trackage fees, insurance costs, etc. etc.  Politics could also have played a role, or perhaps the thinking was that VIA should be supporting the feds to provide service to the more remote northern prairie communities since the Trans-Canada Highway follows the southerly CP route and was already well-served by inter-city busses.  The main reason I've commented out the above addition was the last line concerning Clark & Mulroney's ridings - Clark represented High River near Calgary, Alberta in the 1980s and Mulroney represented Manicouagan near Baie Comeau, Quebec.  Harvey André...  I have no idea - very likely though.  Once this part gets edited/verified properly, it should appropriately be added to the story surrounding the 2nd round of cuts in 1990. 16:57, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Joe Clark was born and raised in High River, but he represented Yellowhead, a large riding between Edmonton and Jasper, from 1979 to 1993. Mulroney never lived in Alberta, nor was he ever an Alberta MP. 17:30, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)

For Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway we've resisted having the roster in the article, but VIA Rail might be different because (a) its locomotive count is in the dozens, not the thousands and (b) it's a bit easier to compile a complete roster since VIA's under 30 years old.

The article on grammar suggests in many ways that teaching people how to listen and read is good, but teaching them how to speak and write is wicked. Linguists are said to be concerned """"normally"""" with the former, implying that there is something abnormal about the latter.

Perhaps in defining atheists we should use the term """"supernatural"""" (e.g. Atheists reject the existense of dieties and the supernatural).  Would that be to broad a definition?  Can someone be an atheist, and yet still believe in some supernatural phenomena? Thoughts?   """,0

So I will start with a criticism of the quote from Ollier and Pain, with whom I have more general issues than the """"postorogenic part"""". Phrase by phrase that I disagree with:
 Only much later was it realized that the two processes [deformation and the creation of topography] were mostly not closely related, either in origin or in time. Very wrong. Deformation causes topography, and the generation of topography is synchronous with deformation. I will email you a copy of Dahlen and Suppe (1988), which shows that this is the case - send me a message so I have your address and can attach a PDF. They tackle the large-scale deformation of sedimentary rocks via folding and thrusting during orogenesis.
 ...fold-belt mountainous areas...: """"fold-belt"""" isn't used professionally (AFAIK) to refer to a collisional mountain-building event. A minor thing though.
 Only in the very youngest, late Cenozoic mountains is there any evident causal relation between rock structure and surface landscape. and the following sentence: If I were British, I would call this """"utter twaddle"""". As I mentioned above, there is no way for many of the exposed structures to get to the surface without large amounts of rock uplift and erosion. And as a matter of fact, the trajectory of different units of rock through an orogen is in part determined by patterns of surface erosion. To keep it simple and send you one paper, you'll find this in and at the end of the paper by Dahlen and Suppe (1988).

Dispute(s)
(*Note to NSBR, TSSR, SSBA, AND ISSDC contributors: Please advise if you concur or disagree with my summaries below):

From everything I have read, it would appear, as evidenced throughout this talk page AND the article edit page, contributors representing the NSBR, TSSR, SSBA, and ISSDC registries/clubs, have agreed/compromised/concurred regarding the following:

1)They have agreed/compromised to the inclusion of ALL currently established registries/clubs affiliated with the Shiloh Shepherd dog, including the ISSR/SSDCA as an acknowledged Shiloh Shepherd registry/club in the article.

2)They have agreed/compromised that the article contain an acknowledgement that Ms. Barber initiated this breed and originated the standard for the breed.

3)They concur that the article content must contain """"verifiable"""" documentation, not based on """"original"""" research and stated only from a """"neutral point of view"""", in agreement with Wikipedia's stated requirements for content criteria.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About#Wikipedia_content_criteria)

4)They have agreed/compromised, in order to resolve this dispute and prevent potential for unverifiable, dependent, biased inclusions/comparisons/contrasts by any registry/club, including their own, to refrain from including any registry/club specific information and promotion in the article, other than to cite the existence and names of each, and to simply include ALL registry's/club's homepage website links at the bottom of the article, which will allow Wikipedia readers the opportunity to gain access, should they choose, to each of the various registries'/clubs' individual purported documentation, research, and points of view. 

5)They concur that the article should NOT contain original publication of """"original thought"""", """"propaganda"""", """"advocacy"""", """"self-promotion"""", and """"advertising"""", in agreement with Wikipedia's stated requirements for """"Wikipedia: What Wikipedia is Not"""" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_propaganda_machine).

6)They have agreed/compromised, in order to resolve this dispute and prevent inclusion of these disallowed contents by any registry/club, including their own, to refrain from including any registry/club specific information and promotion in the article, other than to cite the existence and names of each, and to simply include ALL registry's/club's homepage website links at the bottom of the article, which will allow Wikipedia readers the opportunity to gain access, should they choose, to each of the various registries'/clubs' individual thoughts, propaganda, advocacy, self-promotion, and advertising.

7)In order to resolve this dispute and prevent bias regarding the article's descriptive contents concerning """"Health"""", they have agreed/compromised to refrain from including any statements citing, reviewing, or comparing/contrasting ISSR, NSBR, TSSR, SSBA, SSDCA, or ISSDC health practices/policies and they propose the """"Health"""" section of the article contain only a statement listing those health issues acknowledged by ALL registries/clubs (gastrointestinal problems -gastric torsion/bloat, bacterial overgrowth syndrome- and skeletal or bone disorders such as hip dysplasia, panosteitis and osteochondritis), a recommendation by ALL registries/clubs that testing be conducted and a statement that """"these reports clearly show that, as giant breeds go, the Shiloh is arguably a healthy example"""".
 
8)They have agreed/compromised that regarding """"Size"""", """"Coat"""", """"Color"""", and """"Temperament"""", there appears to be very limited dispute re: the """"standards"""" contained therein and that the section should remain free of any statements citing, reviewing, promoting any individual registry/club and comparing/contrasting one registry/club with another.

These compromises and requested article inclusions/exclusions meet Wikipedia's policies/procedures for content criteria, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About#Wikipedia_content_criteria) in that they embrace the following:

1) Neutral(WP:NPOV)in that the article would be """"representing all views fairly and without bias""""  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view). In FACT, there are no requests from the NSBR, TSSR, SSBA, and ISSDC registries/clubs for the inclusion of any comparisons/contrasts (negative or otherwise) between any of the registries/clubs, including the ISSR/SSDCA,  nor have they requested that any clubs other than their own, be exluded from inclusion in the article.  In FACT, there has only been the request that ALL registries/clubs affiliated with the Shiloh Shepherd dog be simply noted, with appropriate website links included at the bottom of the art",0

Both of these without any proof that that's actually the case. 

Also, even if that was the case - what does """"tended to confirm it"""" mean? Even safe amounts of gas found by any interested parties would """"tend to confirm"""" that gassings took place, so it's irrelevant.

Spamming: Posting an excessive number of messages to individual users, or to users with no significant connection to the topic at hand.
Campaigning: Posting a notification of discussion that presents the topic in a non-neutral manner.
Vote-stacking: Posting messages to users selected based on their known opinions (which may be made known by a userbox, user category, or prior statement). Vote-banking involves recruiting editors perceived as having a common viewpoint for a group, similar to a political party, in the expectation that notifying the group of any discussion related to that viewpoint will result in a numerical advantage, much as a form of prearranged vote stacking.
Stealth canvassing: Contacting users off-wiki (by e-mail, for example) to persuade them to join in discussions (unless there is a specific reason not to use talk pages)
Soliciting support other than by posting direct messages, such as using a custom signature with a message promoting a specific position on any issue being discussed.

Your latest removal of reference to Heart Beat Records as copyright owner stated the reason you removed it was because it was being contested in court. This was after you took it off and then came back and added it.

Regardless, the reason you cite for your actions THIS time is inaccurate. The copyright owner , Hearbeat Records, has sued another party for violating copyrights that they own. There are no suits against them or legal proceedings where someone has contested their ownership. Where do you get this from? Please cite your source as the only public information availabe is the law suit in which Heart Beat has sued another party for violating copyrights they own in as verified by the US Copyright office.

"Lionel Messi 

Hello Alex, I would like to ask you very politely why you have deleted my passage on Lionel Messi regarding his 'playing style.' With all due respect it is very hard to find evidence of words depicting his playing style whereas the passage I have written clearly shows Messi's ability as any other person with football knowledge would agree. I don't think that there is any evidence apart from video evidence to confirm what I wrote about Messi.
For example passages such as 'he has exceptional dribbling ability, fantastic technique, he likes to cut inside onto his stronger left foot' are clear, direct observations of Messi's playing style for some years. This is confusing for me as of why you had deleted my post as some other users send me a message saying how that it was very helpful and detailed. Also, concerning the evidence problem, would you please kindly replace the passage I wrote because it is not a biased passage and clearly reflects Messi's playing style, I have also used what other commentators have frequently said and if you have ever watched a match with Messi weaving his magic you will know and surely agree along with the millions who watch him that this is a very descriptive, accurate passage about his playing style.
I am very hurt by your edit and deletion and I would ask you to kindly replace this text as it took me a very long time to write. If not, please tell me why or let me speak to someone else who could advise me or who would think I am justified

"""
Dear Mr. Bunkov! Thank you kindly for your note. It is always a thrill to have someone working close to a certain subject to join the ranks of Wikipedia editors. Welcome again; I look forward to future cooperation, and I am sure other participants of WikiProject Russia will be equally delighted.
That said, I feel obligated to comment on the situation you are in. Pardon me if you are already familiar with what I am about to say, but I feel it's safer to include it for the sake of completeness. Since you are not an individual editor but rather a representative of a government organization, you should be extra mindful of Wikipedia policies and guidelines covering your position, of which he guideline on the conflict of interest is the most significant. Another important point is that Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia, so it's not supposed to include any material which is purely promotional. Even valid encyclopedic content may routinely be edited by any other editor, and understanding this point is vital for anyone who is planning to contribute anything. One cannot prohibit others from editing one's additions and no permission is needed to be able to edit content added by others. This, in fact, is one of the five pillars of Wikipedia.
This isn't to say that you must agree to each and every change others make to things you add, but all such disagreements should be resolved within the framework of applicable policies and guidelines. You'll notice, for example, that I've made a number of fixes to the style you used to format your addition to the Kaluga Oblast article—this is not because the style you used is somehow inferior, but simply because it does not conform to the style used across other articles in the series on Russian oblasts. At any rate, style matter are pretty low on the chain of importance, and as a new editor you are not expected to immediately be familiar with all nooks and crannies of Wikipedia's Manual of Style. You should not, however, be surprised when others fix it.
Style issues aside, Wikipedia is all about content, of course. It's understandable that as someone close to the source of information you will have a lot to share, but the applicable policies to bear in mind here are those on verifiability and reliable sources. What this means in practice is that every statement which can reasonably be expected to be contested must have a source, and the source must be a reliable one, published by an organization with a reputation for checking the facts and/or with editorial oversight. Ultimately, this means that articles should be based on reliable secondary sources, and in your situation it means that sources produced by the Government of Kaluga Oblast in general and by the Agency for Regional Development in particular would most likely fall under the definition of a primary (not secondary) source. Primary sources are still perfectly acceptable to verify hard facts, but they immediately become unsuitable once judgement is passed. In other words, it's OK to to use a primary source to back up a statement that Kaluga Oblast's GRP in 2010 was 214.5 billion rubles, but a secondary source is mandatory to back up a statement like """"this demonstrates the oblast's high economic potential"""".
With formalities and general introductions taken care of, let's address your question about """"Kaluga Oblast"""" somehow being a wrong translation. That actually is not the case. The term """"oblast"""" is a loanword in the English language, included in all major dictionaries, and it is much more precise than a more vague """"region"""", """"territory"""", or """"province"""". This isn't to say that any of those terms are """"wrong""""—they are not—but they are simply not as suitable for use in a reference work with such a huge scope as Wikipedia's due to their ambiguity. This issue had been discussed on several past occasions, and the general consensus is that using a more precise term is better than using a less precise one. Precision is actually one of the criteria used to select an article's title. Note also that all major English-language reference works use the term """"oblast"""" (see, for example, Encyclopedia Britannica). Additionally, since the article about Kaluga Oblast is a part of the series on the Russian oblasts, its title is expected to conform to the same format as the rest of the articles. WP:NCCS is the applicable guideline covering all this, if you are interested in reviewing it.
I hope this has been helpful. I apologize for dumping so much information on you all at once, but since your situation is different from that of a regular editor, I feel certain points should have been touched upon. If you have any further questions or need anything clarified, you are welcome t",0

 The Truth about the 1986 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis 

The story of how Gerry Adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a British Constitutional party.  How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. 

In 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows:

“No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership."""" 

The Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis.  Its wording was as follows: 

RESOLUTION 162

THAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.

b. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)

To accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows:

That Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read:
 
No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. 

Motion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. 

Can anybody say that  the wording:

“That this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a.  Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle”

does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle?
Clearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162.

Brian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.

Of course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic. In fact its not necessary, according to the constitution, to give any reason. But you",0

 Farting 

I reverted this article back to a recent version that contained the term fart. Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia (not a medical one), and its important to use a term that a majority of people know. Flatulence is no more or less a """"proper"""" term than farting is, and its definetly not slang  its use is too common, everyday, and widespread. It would be a misservice the readers to simply ignore this important term. Its such a odd thing to want to sensor.
  
I agree. Why use the word """"flatus"""" all over the place? People don't know it's fart. Doctors know it's fart, and, well, doctors are people, but they ain't most people. The common term is fart or gas.  —   | Talk 
The reason seems pretty obvious to me: """"fart"""" is a much rougher, less """"refined"""" word. Using it casually is simply not appropriate tone for an encyclopedia. -  (Talk at me) 

 Citations needed 

Oh come on, not EVERY sentence needs a citation now, does it.. It makes articles really hard to read and is just silly. I am talking about the section """"Dietary"""" where every second word has a citation or """"citation needed"""". Whoever posted all that is obsessed with citations. seriously!217.231.205.126  
I agree, especially since the rest of the article doesn't seem to conform to the extreme citation standards in the Dietary section. Additionally, some of the stuff is a given and doesn't really need a citation unless you happen to be an alien from another planet who is completely unfamiliar with Earth, in which case it remains a mystery how this alien learned enough english to understand this article without learning some basic information about humans and Earth. Not everyone is a wikipedia administrator, y'know. 74.56.36.34

"Mr. Tanthalas,

Please help me understand.  You were not involved in teh talk discussions, and edits I completed after learning Kuru stated my entry was promotional.  So what refernce and evidence did you use to block my edit access and state my comments were unwarranted harrassment?  I do not want to appear argumentative and certainly want to comply with the rules of Wiki.  You also refered to my act as vandalism which I think is harsh and unwarratnted.  If you check with Mr. Kuru I think he will tell you were were having a legitamit discussion and my edits, subsequent with his deletion were inetnded to comply with his request to remove promotional material.  I simply subsequently loaded a link to the approved patent on the USPTO patent site.  It provides substantial reference, teh approved business method patent, prior art, abstracta nd claims.  I think your actions were premature and showed you lacked informationa bout what was being discussed between Kuru and I.  I would still like to refernce the patent and since it had previously been done and sanctioned acceptable because it was on teh site undisturbed for 2 months I think this has merit.  I do see the fact that my name, as teh inventor tends to promote thepatent.  However, if you check I am not the owner.  It is owned by Ultimate Claim Solution, Inc.  My refernce also tried to explain that aspect.  Non the less this all could have been avoided.  When someones content is deleted the person making thatd elrtion should point out in there csignature they are an administrtor or moderator.  Had Kuro done that I would have talked to him first instead of trying to update the edit to what I thought ws not promotional and then trying to engage in talk with Mr. Kuru.  

Lastly, I respectfully request you release the block.  I aslo request that I be given permission to return the article to the annonomus post which refernced the patent.  Those observing will not note that I am ihe inventor.  It is not promotion, simply good refernce and citation.

Dear Sir,

First, please do not email Jimmy Wales about Wikipedia issues. We have official
contact addresses for this - Jimmy just forwards misdirected emails to them and
thus contacting him simply increases delays.

We apologize for what happened.

Let me clear some misunderstanding. Wikipedia is operated by volunteers, not by
employees of Jimmy Wales or the Wikimedia Foundation. This may account for some
amount of disorganization. If you expect professional service, then, obviously,
Wikipedia cannot provide it, because it is not a professional organization.

""""Willy on Wheels"""" is/was the name of a very obnoxious user that laid waste on
Wikipedia. He kept on creating accounts with usernames based on 'willy' and 'wheels'.

Because of this, there is a de facto standing order against creating account names
based on 'willy' and 'wheels'.

The simplest solution by far is for you to take an account name that does not
include both 'willy' and 'wheels'.

Yours sincerely,
Bernard Dupre

1.  My intentions after the second ban was not to create another account using Willy and Wheels. I never told you that was what I wanted. I was confused at why I was banned from even commenting and my IP was banned.

2. I don't care what distruction this other person caused, calling someone you do not know bogus as Ohnoitsjamie did should not be tolerated. I was not and am not here to cause trouble.

3. Saying that I am here to harrass and threaten is wrong. I read your incident report. I also read the block you placed on my current IP.  I have not harrassed and I have not threatened. I simply want an apology for what I have deemed bad relations on you and Ohno's part.

4. All I want is a sincere apology for calling me bogus and accusing me of threats and harrassment and then I will go away.  If not, I will forward all messages before and from this point on to Mr. Dupre and what administrator actions need to be taken will be taken. His apology in the second line says it all.

The deadline for choosing the entries is right around the corner and following its passing, we will have a great opportunity to improve the quality of the articles in our project. There are many song stubs that have been created for the entries this year and I would like to see them expanded into coherent articles. Also, I think we need to take a look back at the """"Country in ESC 2009"""" articles because I have noticed that most of them are out of date and need to be updated.

 Re: """"Reverts"""" 

Hello, Drmargi. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for saying what needed to be said to me, but in a very respectful, sophisticated manner. I've taken the time to review both articles you referenced, especially personal attacks. While what I said was not directed at any specific person, it was in direct conflict with a portion of what constitutes a personal attack. For that, I'd like to apologize. The reason I verbally came out swinging, so to speak, is because of misdirected frustration. There is an individual with whom I had a conflict regarding the episode page of another show, a show about which I'm almost as passionate as I am about Person of Interest, and that very same person if one of those who reverted my edit (mind you, for good reason I now know), however, when this took place on another TV show's page, he was extremely passive aggressive and hostile in his immediate discrediting of my editing abilities. I had just started using Wikipedia at the time and was not very proficient in computational cyber protocol, or even writing code (that is not the case anymore) Please do not misinterpret this, as I know I am the one in the wrong, and I am not trying to engage in a dialogue in which I somehow look like the victim. I just feel as though I needed to explain myself, and who better with whom to do so than the one of 4 users on Wikipedia who have shown me respect and made me feel welcome.

I am well aware that the world will not end if the POI Season 5 info is not complete (lol). If I thought the world were to end, I wouldn't be on my computer. But passive aggression aside, I sincerely am a person who loves Person of Interest and Criminal Minds, as they have helped me deal with deep-seeded problems in my own life, as far-fetched as that may sound, so I make it my business to do the best I can to help keep fellow fans as informed as possible, and Wikipedia is an amazing vessel through which to do so. In my mind, I saw how many little error notices Wikipedia has put on the POI episode lists and wondered why my mistake was IMMEDIATELY centered out, but whoever made the mistakes of adding too long of an episode summary, over 40 times, was not reprimanded. However, it is foolish to assume they weren't. I reacted much in disproportion to the situation, and I do not intend to do so again, as I want to respect Wikipedia's rules. I just felt that a specific user had discredited my information for the sole purpose of undermining me. That did, in fact, happen on a page for Criminal Minds and I was the aggrieved party in that case. My information was solid, came straight from a co-executive producer, and yet this person continued reverting it, so I sought help and reported him. However, to think that same scenario applies to this POI conflict... I now see how slanted and nonsensical that is.

In conclusion, I will not add information unless it can be traced back to an original source, credible and solid. (like my addition of Fred Toye as director and Andy Callahan as co-writer of POI episode 5-10 - the 100th) I do apologize if I've offended you with my two aggressive edit summaries, as they were the result of misdirected anger and frustration. Thank you for informing me of where I went wrong, and remaining respectful and composed. I love to learn, and I'm glad I've learned more specific information about how to avoid reference/edit info-conflicts. I also want you to know that I'm well aware that Wikipedia is not a fan site. While I intend to show you the utmost respect, that was uncalled for. I can read - very well, in fact. Je peux parler en Français aussi, et je peux le comprendre. I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, that is why I try to be as thorough as possible, and if this sentence comes off as condescending, that is because you offended me as well. I did not insult you, or anyone specifically; what I did was make a childish, anger-driven, juvenile comparison of whoever reverted my edits to royalty, or self-appointed leaders. It was a mistake to do so, and since I'm not very good at conflict resolution - the fact that this is my best attempt to mend fences proves that - I'm going to stop now because I'm starting to argue with my own intentions. Please forgive my outburst, and be assured that it won't happen again. I will continue to help build a stronger Season 5 episode table with solid references, but I fully intend to adhere to the rules and keep my opinions of other editors to myself.

Thank you for helping me to stay informed, so that I can continue to inform fellow TV Crime Drama fans. Happy editing and thank you for your kindness and composure in this matter.

 Factual error and substitution of opinion for fact concerning reconstruction of infratructure

The introduction to the article makes the following claim: 

""""Beginning with the invasion in 2003, a Multinational coalition of forces, mainly American and British, has occupied Iraq. The invasion has led to increased civil violence, political breakdown, the removal and execution of former president Saddam Hussein, and national problems in the development of political balance, economy, infrastructure, and use of the country's massive reserves of oil.""""

The inference about problems in infrastructure is factually inaccurate. There is ample documentation available online, at sites such as www.enr.com (site of Engineering News-Record, the world's leading construction and engineering professional journal) and the U. S. Department of Defense news site at http://www.defendamerica.mil/, of the extent of reconstruction and new construction in Iraq, especially in remedying deterioration and neglect dating to the Saddam regime. 

Given the freedoms the Iraqis now have, and have won for themselves, and their liberation from an undeniably tyrannical regime (facts not mentioned in this introduction), the claim that """"these issues have led to major setbacks for Iraq"""" is obviously opinion masquerading as fact.  """,0
"MSU Interview

Dear Samir,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar

1. Liberation theology is a phenomenon with an extraordinary number of layers. There is a whole spectrum from radically marxist positions, on the one hand, to the efforts which are being made within the framework of a correct and ecclesial theology, on the other hand, a theology which stresses the responsibility which Christians necessarily hear for the poor and oppressed, such as we see in the documents of the Latin American Bishops' Conference (CELAM) from Medellin to Puebla. In what follows, the concept of liberation theology will be understood in a narrower sense: it will refer only to those theologies which, in one way or another, have embraced the marxist fundamental option. Here too there are many individual differences, which cannot be dealt with in a general discussion of this kind. All I can do is attempt to illuminate certain trends which, notwithstanding the different nuances they exhibit, are widespread and exert a certain influence even where liberation theology in this more restricted sense does not exist.

As can be seen he is being quite clear in that only one strand of liberation theology is being condemned.  """,0

"Penis size by Race... 

Yep here it is.... time for you all to teach the rest of the world that the average penis size differs between races. You whites had a good run but it is the future now and time for CHANGE! =D We need to include data that shows that Africans penis size AVERAGE is far greater than the AVERAGE American European Australian WHITE penis size. I know this is mean to peoples with small penises because your women will flock to us when they know the truth but TRUTH IS WHAT WIKIPEDIA IS BUILT ON! We are a proud encyclopedia and the only way forward into this non-white controlled future is by removing all clouds and exposing what you really have down there. In many AFRICAN tribes it is customary to promote the largest penis to head of the tribe whereas in EUOPEAN culture it is customary to hide your penis for shame of its size.

 Found 

I found this piece of text on another wikipedia article: 'aryan race'
Genetic studies

A genetic study in the year 2000 in Andhra Pradesh state of India found that the upper caste Hindus were closer relatives to Eastern-Europeans than to Hindus from lower castes.[25] However, a study conducted by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in 2009 (in collaboration with Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT) analyzed half a million genetic markers across the genomes of 132 individuals from 25 ethnic groups from 13 states in India across multiple caste groups.[26] The study asserts, based on the impossibility of identifying any genetic indicators across caste lines, that castes in South Asia grew out of traditional tribal organizations during the formation of Indian society, and was not the product of any Aryan invasion and """"subjugation"""" of Dravidian people.[27]

 Korean article template 

Hi, thanks for your question.  Sorry I'm so late getting back to you.  Life on and off Wikipedia has been full of all sorts of unexpected hecticity...  Anyway, the Korean article template. 

The idea behind the template is pretty simple.  The basic idea is that every article should have the following, unless there is some reason to the contrary:
 a relevant """"See also"""" section, 
 at least one relevant Korea-related category, and
 a name table.  
 Template:Korean on the Talk page.

In more detail...
The """"See also"""" section should include a link to the List of Korea-related topics  (LKRT), and anything else that's obviously relevant but not linked in the article text.  If you prefer, you can just put in the LKRT link and let someone else add the others.  If you want to add more, here's the rule I've been following:  look in each category of which the article is a member.  If that category has a main article (like Korea in Category:Korea), then that main article should be linked  either from the text, or from the See also section.  The same for parent categories, within reason.  Here's an example:  Munmu of Silla is a member of the categories Silla and Korean rulers.  Thus, the articles Silla and Rulers of Korea are linked in the article text.  Those two categories are part of Category:Korean history and Category:Korean people.  Thus, History of Korea is linked in the See also section, and so is List of Koreans (well, it is now).   Both of those are members of Category:Korea, hence the link to the LKRT.  
You can find a complete (?) list of Korea-related categories at List of Korea-related topics#Categories.  Or just start at Category:Korea and work your way down.
Template:Koreanname noimage is fine for the vast majority of articles.  Cut and paste Template talk:Koreanname noimage#Syntax and fill in the blanks.  All Korean name tables require you to specify at least these four variables: hangul, hanja, rr, and mr.  """"Rr"""" stands for Revised Romanization of Korean, and """"mr"""" stands for McCune-Reischauer Romanization.  If you don't know what should go in these fields, just leave them blank  however, at a minimum the hangul should be provided (that allows other editors to verify the article and identify the other name-related information).  You can request help on the Korea-related notice board.  
This one's easy.  Just paste {{Korean}} onto the top of the talk page.  Done!

Most of our existing articles should already conform to this, since we just finished a housekeeping sweep in June.  But there are more new ones coming in every day...

I've also taken to adding a """"Wish list"""" to the talk pages of new/inactive articles, identifying 2 or 3 things that the article is lacking.  Hopefully this will help other contributors see where they can help.   (Of course, if I can contribute the information myself, I do so).

I hope this isn't all too overwhelming.  Your excellent work so far is much appreciated. 

Cheers,

The same thing happened, when the Arab Muslims invaded the Levant, Mesopotamia and North Africa and intermingled with the local nations, e.g. Berbers, Jews, Arameans, Black people, Copts etc.. After several hundreds of years the Arabs were no longer able to distinguish between pure Arabs and mixed race Arabs. However, their descendants are linguistic and cultural Arabs or do modern Egyptians, Syrians, Tunisians,... don't consider themselves as ethnic Arabs? Are the modern Turks a specific ethnic race?

"NIHH Science Update • December 15, 2010

Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore led by Mikhail Pletnikov developed the mouse model used in this study by inserting a gene with a mutation known to be associated in humans with schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. They used a technique that allows them to turn the gene on and off at desired time points during brain development. In earlier research, mice with the gene, mhDISC1 (mutant human disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1) showed effects on social behavior and mood which differed depending on the sex of the mice, and the age at which the gene was active. The study shows brain development is more complex than originally thought and the argument between nature v. nature is not an easy question. The mutated gene has more control than originally thought.

 Larklight trilogy 

Hi,

Re. Larklight trilogy

I did loads of work on these articles yesterday; I fully agree that the plots are way too long and not very good; that's the main thing that needs sorting out.

I see the 'trilogy' article as having a very brief summary of each book, about 1 para.

I'm gonna put the pics back in there though - I think pics brighten up articles. Originally - before other people edited it - there was no info box, and the 3 pics were big and at the top. I'm not convinced the infobox is worthwhile for the 'trilogy' article, because it's not so appropriate to 3 books as to one - but others have added it and worked on it, so I'll go with the infobox, and the 3 pics within the 3 sections.

The user XXRonaldo007XX has tried to add an image to that infobox, which I don't think is a good idea - (s)he's a new user and struggling a bit with syntax. I'll leave him a message in a mo.

Please read and comment in Talk:Larklight where I've started a discussion on what I see as a way forward, regards structuring the articles.

Thanks for your input,

As reviewing administrator,  I think saying someone is a professor at Georgia Tech is at least a possible indication of notability, so I did not delete the article. But you need to add more information to show it, in our  Wikipedia  style; a good place to start learning it  is    our guide to writing Wikipedia articles .  See also our standard, WP:PROF for what we consider notable in articles of this sort. 

First, give the basic informationthe source should be the CV birthplace and date, degrees, previous positions. If there are published books, list them in formal bibliographic style. List the 3 or 4 most influential articles similarly, getting citation figures from Web of Science. Include major national level offices and awards, but not minor ones. Be sure to list editorships (but not mere editorial board membership) we consider it very important, and you should add it to the articles for the relevant journals also, with a link to the bio. 

If the person has any notable students who would qualify for Wikipedia bios, include them. Their PhD & postdoctoral advisors probably also qualify for bios here; add them and link them, even if they do not yet have articles. 

It is not necessary to cite the basic information in detail to other than the official CV. However, give any actual references providing substantial coverage from  3rd party independent published reliable sources, print or online, but not blogs or press releases, or material derived from press releases. For any part you quote directly from a published bio, include quotation marks and a reference.

Pay particular attention to the way we make links to other Wikipedia  articles. Avoid WP:Peacock terms.

It all depends on what you call free energy and what you call suppression. IMHO there are so many different free energy machines it's just hilarious. Knowing that makes the reason for suppressing them down all to obvious. If some one is getting stalked then you just take their word for it.

The main criticism of the theory is that these devices are absent in the market because they do not and cannot work. 

Here the excuse to ignore it is the ignorance it self. The tool of suppression is the argument the devices don't exist, but this is also the excuse for never looking at them at the same time. We cant have it both ways? Either the machines don't work or the theory is wrong. We cant assume the machines must work because the theory has to be wrong just like we cant assume the theory must be right because the machines cant work. Most people will continue not believing it's real even after being confronted with such device. They will stand there screaming about the laws of thermodynamics. People like the inventors twin brother, or their wife. Not very likely to convince a wikipedian if you cant convince your wife now it is? The suppression is not so much executed by special interest groups as by the mainstream dogma. The dogma is however much supported by the special interests.

Signs of real professional free energy suppression you can see here on wikipedia. Every actor in history is worthy of his own page but weird inventions not confirmed by mainstream science (working or not is irrelevant) apparently cant have a page here. The few free energy machines still having their own wikipedia page are full of rant how crackpots try to destroy the laws of thermodynamics and how nutterish they are, not your usual trolling but the work of experts. Take the introduction of the Water fuel cell. """"the source of this addition energy has not been scientifically identified therefore the theory is treated with skepticism."""" There was barely any theory, it just worked! And it has not been investigated. The way it's treated is not worthy of being in the description. An encyclopedia should not instruct it's readers behaviour? Tell me how to treat things huh? """"such a practice conforms to the parameters of perpetual motion, hence conclusive scientific investigation would either verify violation of thermodynamic law or identify the source of claimed additional energy."""" But if there isn't going to be any scientific analysis - ever! then the laws of thermodynamics are nonsense. If the best scientists can do is preach the laws then it's just not very likely they are right about the topic. Then it says: """"At least one car prototype, reportedly powered by a water fuel cell, has been assembled."""" HUH what? but but but?? You know what I mean? """"Meyer's claims about the Water Fuel Cell and the car that it powered were found to be fraudulent by an Ohio court in 1996."""" His wiki use to say 
http://web.archive.org/web/20050106215257/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Meyer
""""It failed to work during a required demonstration of the water-fueled car. An Ohio court found Stanley Meyer guilty of fraud in a case brought against him by disgruntled investors."""" So he was scammed by his own investors. What kind of person would do that with a known to work invention? And why was this important information deleted? Then it says: Stanley Meyer was granted patents in the United States and abroad starting in 1989. The verifiability, and scientific basis, of the patents are controversial. Now I know the water motor patents where granted after a working model was displayed. You can see it in the application number. There is no other way to get a patent on an electrolysis cell. Because of those laws of thermodynamics you know? You do know about those right? You can see free energy suppression live at work when you see that the world famous American inventor Stanley Meyer was not worthy of his own wikipedia page. It's obvious he cant have a page because that would violate conservation of energy right? Paul Pantone does have his own page where again the working of his device is denied by no-witness, The GEET page however describes a Hindi film? BTW Paul was also scammed by his investors? ha-ha? Yull Brown is also not worthy of his own page? Makes it kind of hard to write about free energy suppression when the suppressed and murdered inventors are not allowed the light of day? What about William A. Rhodes? Dennis klein then? no? Isaac de Rivaz? Daniel Dingle? etc etc?? At least we still have the Oxyhydrogen page right? haha? This is how free energy suppression is done.

The About.com has been removed and cite templates added for un-sourced statements. Here is the breakdown of my edit that was reverted that I was told could be replaced due to no legitimate consensus dispute (keep in mind when I added this much info or sites the first time that I may have made a mistake with what got copied in the actual entry, hence some disagreements):

 
Happy Goodman Family, (NY Times, MTV and the group's website.)
 
In the first sentence of NY Times: """"a matriarch of gospel music whose influence ranged far beyond its traditional audience"""". The list of artists who are similar and influenced by the Happy Goodman family are on MTV's site (and doesn't even need to be included as it was just a """"verification"""" source), among other statements to support what I typed are on the group's site: """"Their influence is still felt in many singing groups of today."""" Lastly, the info is covered on the singer's Wikipedia article. This is just one example of many I picked to """"open"""" the statement about CCM's history or later changed to CCM's diversity.
 
Some other musicians who began making a significant impact in CCM (including on Christian radio) were/are Jon Gibson, Bebe & Cece Winans, David and the Giants, Rich Mullins, Carman, David Meece, DeGarmo and Key, Randy Stonehill, Keith Green, Kirk Franklin, and Steve Green, among many others.
 
First off, the info to support these statements are already explained within the artist's articles that they are linked to. Jon Gibson is """"overly"""" sourced on his article, I made sure of that as a user with a different user name/ip/id in the past. Secondly, iTunes/TCM/GMA/CBN/CCM and the radio sites as well as the artist's actual websites are valid sources. I removed all sources Walter said only had """"books"""" and """"albums"""" listed, although if [you] scroll down or look for a different tab to see the """"bio"""" or """"description"""" sections, it would confirm what my entry claimed. The above 17'ish sources listed in another section were ones I removed and I did not need to be advised what was wrong with them, they are only being """"saved"""" for future reference. Third off, this article didn't give any diversity which was an element I wanted the genre to reflect. Within the About.com that was recently removed and within the actual article of the artists (ie. Randy Stonehill), this statement can be verified. It gives a better idea of the veteran and popular CCM artists that the article didn't mention, those who are significant and some award winning """"record breakers"""" (if nothing else just diversity in race/nationality such as Carman and Kirk Franklin which I provided reliable sources for).

""""Word press"""", """"CCM Top 500 albums"""" and Kirk Franklin honored by CCM on his website are all valid points made on the credible sources I provided.
 
Contemporary Christian music also became popular with secular musicians as well, including Stevie Wonder,  Johnny Cash, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston and M.C. Hammer (who vowed to God he would include at least one song of praise on each album). Bands like P.O.D. and Creed contained Christian themes within their lyrics yet still appealed to a secular audience.

Second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit. I'd put right up front that Johnson did the executive order but Congress never acted on it, then go on about how the tribe didn't accept it anyway?  Keep the chronology clearer.   (Interesting that the Coeur d'Alene article says nothing about this period, maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too... hmmm) 
From a VERY cursory review of the decision, it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and Idaho's statehood becomes significant in this case, so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact, but it's something that's going to matter.

"""I'm sorry you are wrong on both counts. Northumbrian is a different dialect to Geordie as you have said. The other dialects from the area are Makem and Pitmatic. Northumbrian being the accent that is common in the larger part of 'Northumberland'. I being from Northumberland myself actually know what I am talking about. If you live in rural Northumberland, bearing in mind that the shire (as Northumberland is a shire county) is mostly rural, you would have a different dialect to someone from Newcastle, Prudhoe, or Gateshead, as the inhabitants of these places generally speak with a Geordie accent. Also no serious linguist would call all these *different* dialects Geordie. I have heard them grouped as Northumbrian dialects but not Geordie dialects. Calling them Northumbrian is correct for two reasons, one being that all these dialects come from the area that is known as Northumbria (That is Northumberland, Durham, Newcastle...etc..).

On the other point you are mistake. England (though not the whole UK) can be (rightly) called a Germanic nation. It is true blood is not the deciding factor as you say (though it is connected in some ways), however traditions, language, laws and history are! England was of course founded by...you guessed it Germanic tribes (whether they are the predominant DNA is besides the point. These tribes were the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians. You can't deny this as before the English kingdoms, England did not exist. Our language is obviously Germanic (though it has borrowed from other languages over the centuries, it is still West Germanic). Most of our common traditions, such as Yule (Yule itself is a Germanic Word, derived from the Norse Jul) are Germanic, the eating of a Christmas Ham, Mistletoe, Christmas trees, Yule Logs...etc…are all Germanic. Many of our laws come direct from Anglo-Saxon and Danish laws, though I agree many were modified by the Normans, who though descended from Norwegians are not culturally Germanic.
As for self-identity, I would say that the English identify themselves with Germanic culture, albeit in a subliminal way, for example the fact that they use Anglo-Saxon to describe themselves is an indication of this. They are identifying with tribes that were Danish and Northern German and thus Germanic so on that score yes the English are a Germanic people.

And as you bring up DNA casually, then firstly I will point out that it isn't proven either way whether the Anglo-Saxon DNA is more prominent or whether the British (used in this sense as pre-Anglo-Saxon) is. Different surveys have different results, and none have actually been accepted by all experts. And for the most part many of the newer surveys still show that in the North East of England the Germanic percentage is higher than the British (thus the predominant DNA is Germanic), the main problem is that it cannot be determined whether it is Anglo-Saxon or Danish """"Viking"""" blood, but this does not make any difference to whether the blood is Germanic. I don't care whether the Modern English have British or Anglo-Saxon blood as I am partly Norse-Gaelic and partly 'English'...thus being a mix. I just do think that the Anglo-Saxon blood is prominent as do many experts, in North Eastern England.

Either way Germanic Blood or British Blood...the English are ethnically Germanic.

Note: I am not going to lie and say I am not proud of Germanic Culture as it is obvious (especially by my username), but I do consider myself British as the UK isn't about one ethnicity or culture but about the union of many and I am proud of that also. And by the way there is a good case for Northumbria being one of the more Germanic parts, due in a large part to it's folklore especially it's creatures, that include Dvergar (Which they are actually called...they are Dwarves) and Álfar or more correctly Ælfe (as they are in Old English), who are known by the common English word Elf, but are the older and if I may say more correct type.

It would be really overdoing things to include convolutions with more input functions in the sandbox article, but I plan a gallery-like page in the info still to be uploaded to gnu.org.
Development of the convolution theme includes other mathematical concepts. Far from being a """"one-trick pony"""" you ought to know that the mathematics of the delta function, alone, lends itself to further visualization of subject matter routinely taught in dsp and related courses. Besides the ability to code, Development only needs imagination.
As the article indicates, I too made the mistake that Fortran was a dinosaur. Fortran is under active development, surpassing the performance of C in certain areas. I also code in C, Lisp, Scheme, and will be writing some code for C-Graph in Python - but modern Fortran remains a good choice for the core code.
There are websites that offer the demonstration of convolution, but none that encompass verification of the convolution theorem with ease, or that offer the range of features GNU C-Graph does. The download statistics verify C-Graph's growing popularity.
The meritless claim of """"online promotion and documentation (marketing?)"""" has been recited elsewhere and is transparent in its intent.
Yes, you did miss the point. I won't comment on the other """"significant"""" additional resources and external links listed in the articles on Convolution and Convolution Theorem, except that they hardly present """"new science"""", which is not a requirement for a reference.
No, it's not possible to deflate my ego. I'm accustomed to these types of responses - and use them as building blocks.

 Effective Steps of Pearls 

I laugh in the face of danger..

Pearls are the only life embodiment gemstones. How to Beat It? GHD White can Help You Make It! Even though peals live longer than people, after the oxidation over years, they will grow yellow from white and slowly lose their luster. This is why there is an idiom of “one getting old like the pearl becoming yellow"""".What is the Future of Excitingly Attractive GHD uk ? God Knows!

In daily life, pearl cannot contact with perfume, oil, salt, alcohol, hair cream, vinegar, and dirt, much less contact with bananas, water and other organic solvents. Furthermore, it is unsuitable to wear the pearl necklace in the most sweating season – summer.

If you don't use them, you can clean them lightly by high level neuter soap or cleanser essence, and leave them to dry completely.It shouldn't be exposed to the sun.

The hardness of pearl is lower, if when the pearl turns to yellow and loses its luster, you can use available from 1% to 1.5% of hydrogen peroxide to bleach, be careful not to bleach too far, otherwise it will lose its luster.

You'd better clean it by sheepskin or delicate flannelette and then you can put it away after wear pearl each time. Do not use the surface paper, because the friction of some paper will wear the pearl.

Don’t use water for cleaning either, because water can enter the holes and will be hard to dry, also, it might make the pearls ferment inside and turn the line into green.

When you wear out a lot of sweat, wet towels can be used carefully and put it back to jewelry box back after natural drying. Occasionally, clean it by fresh-saline water, and keep the moist of pearl.

"There is no reason to treat AFF and SF the same. The neutrality policy, which explicitly states that it is not to be confused with “all views deserve equal time no matter how many or how few people hold them”, certainly requires nothing of the sort – look it up yourself, I won’t do your homework for you.

 Moreover, the merits of AFF and the merits of SF are two entirely separate and independent things. No amount of slamming AFF – even if your charges are accurate, which I doubt as your behaviour here strongly suggests your perceptions on such things cannot be trusted – can ever, by itself, make SF worth including. SF must stand or fall on its own merits.

There are many serious strikes against including SF, none of which you have even tried to address. First of all it borders on being a blog, which is already an almost-decisive point against it (there was talk of banning links to blogs entirely at one point though it isn’t actually policy to do so as far as I know – certainly “it’s a blog” has stood uncontested as sufficient reason for deleting links on many pages, including the same one we’re fighting over). Equally importantly, having read parts of SF... though I do not myself agree with the characterization, I can see why others have gone so far as to call it a hate site. To be blunt, it's largely the chronicle of one person's persecution complex. As I said elsewhere, it verges on conspiracy theory in the kookiest sense. And then there is the painfully bad prose and screechy hysterical tone most of it is written in – it is simply not in any way a quality site and would not be even if I could credit the actual content. These three points – heck, any two of them – are sufficient reason leave the link off Wikipedia.

And I haven’t even mentioned the most important reason yet. Your site simply is not notable. As far as I can honestly tell, you are the only person on Earth who considers it an important site. If it was worth linking to, someone other than the site's owner would have done so by now, or at least spoken up in favour of such. That last part, at least, is well-documented Wikipedia policy; look it up yourself as I once again refuse to do your homework for you. 

I am sorry – sort of – if some of this comes across as harsh. Though you will no doubt characterize this note as a personal attack, it is not intended as such (and compared to some of the things you’ve posted about others, including me, it’s not even close to qualifying as one).

 Whole Ariticle Needs to br Rewritten 

i believe this whole article needs to be rewritten fromntop to bottom.  In jumps around in a chronological sense, thereby notbshowingbin a cohesive way how improvisational theatre has developed.  There is a lot of text devoted to thevwork of Keith Jonstone, but his work is no more important than dozens of other writers; moreover, his importance is no where near as significant in the US as is the work of Spolin, Shepherd, Sills, and Close (and the rolenof IO and The Second City.

The article, in it's present form, looks like a hodge-podge of sentences and paragraphs from many authors with no attention paid to consistency.

A rewrite would also avoid some duplication.

How does one initiate such a process?  Who selects the person to take the first stab at it?  I would propose that Michael Golding of Los Angeles do the rewrite.  He has a masters degree in improvisation from NYU, personally knows many of the people who have created modern improvisational theatre (Shepherd, Sills, Close, Halpern to name a few), and is a professional writer (his latest credit is for writing the film """"David Shepherd: A Lifetime of Improvisational Theatre"""").  Any thoughts?""",0
"""

 Dark Energy, Dark Matter, MOND and still more """"Critique of the Universe"""" 

This goes to the whole question of the exclusive use of a single model of the universe that depends on the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. The consensus interpretation of the Lambda/cold dark matter model must clearly be flawed if it leads to the conclusion that the scientific method must be scrapped in order to save the model (ref). Dark Matter and Dark Energy are ad hoc """"add-ons"""" that are trying to find theoretical justification. Dark Enegy, in particular, is being called a supernatural or """"unfalsifiable"""" hypothesis because no experiment can possibly directly challenge it (ref), just like the existence of God hypothesis.

Heretofore, all hypotheses must adhere to the scientific method (ref), """"the SM"""". Now, in order to admit Dark Energy, cosmologists insist that SM must be tinkered with and an unfalsifiable hypothesis allowed for the first time in history. If we do this, the Pope can re-ascend to the Throne.

All of the indirect """"overwhelming evidence"""" for expansion rate acceleration and Dark Energy can be just as well applied to the concept that our inventory of matter and energy in our local universe is inadequate and that the mass of the global universe is at least 22.2 times as large as has been supposed (100%/4.5% = 22.2). The total mass of the universe has been and still is open to question. The Matter/Energy that we can inventory accounts for only 4.5% of the total needed to """"flatten"""" the anisotropy pattern that is seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation or """"CMB"""" (ref). This proposed revision in the """"total mass"""" and the General Relativity (GR) concept of the black hole hyperbolic field will save not only SM, but the Friedmann Equations and the FLRW metric themselves too! 

The """"inflaton particle"""" from which the universe may have sprung was the mother of all black-holes (MOAB). As such, it must have possessed an hyperbolic gravitational field that existed timelessly according to Alan Guth's quantum principles (ref). During the instant of inception of the differentiated universe that we can now detect, this hyperbolic field must have begun to degenerate. Space with time came into existence during this instant. The implication here of the prior existence of a sort of meta-universe is not explicitly acknowledged in any of the scenarios we read, but it is nonetheless an unstated assumption. 

This space-time bubble's surface traveled up the MOAB's hyperbolic field gradient at a velocity hundreds or thousands of times the speed of light. This is Allan Guth's """"Inflation"""". Matter/Light could keep pace with the inflation of space-time only as long as its temperature was several exponential decades of degrees Kelvin. As soon as Matter/Light began to condense and the fundamental forces began to differentiate, the inflation era ended (ref). The collapse of the infinite density hyperbolic field began. This hyperbolic field has been collapsing by means of a time-dependent process ever since. It is this ongoing transition from a hyperbolic black hole gravitational field to a parabolic Newtonian gravitational field underlying the global universe that is being mistaken for acceleration and Dark Energy (ref).

This is not speculation. This is not my personal idea. This is but one example of a different logical meaning of Allan Guth's inflation theory (ref)and General Relativity according to Schwartzchild (ref) and many others. When guided by correct meta-logic, mathematical physicists will be able to validate this or some other theoretical interpretation of GR, the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. Then, with the demise of Dark Energy and Dark Matter, the scientific method will be saved (ref).

Cosmologists are always wrong, but never in doubt. - Lev Landau (ref)""",0

Friedmans words are clearly quoted and clearly cited via the article linked to. A source you have removed for some reason. Do you have something to contribute from """"Blitzers side""""? Please, by all means include it. Is lack of something from """"Blitzers side"""" a reason to exclude citicism and delete a large chunk of the article? I dont think so. Unless you can actually defend your changes citing policy you will need to revert them. 

To clarify, yes, Near East Report is an AIPAC publication, as I said four days ago. Whether it was published by AIPAC in the 70s, I don't know, although it is likely. What we do know is that Blitzer started working for the JPost in 1973. He may very well have edited a version of """"Myths & Facts"""" in 1976, by the way, en edition of that book was published every two years. Plenty of journalists do outside work. Keep in mind that we are an encyclopedia. You need a reliable source thats says who he worked for and the dates. Pulling this information together from different primary sources is original research. You cannot quote somebody as calling Near East Report a """"propaganda sheet"""" any more than another editor can say """"Belfast is inhabited by """"drunken and violent"""" Irish people with the quote cited to Thomas Nast. You also can't cite three people attacking Blitzer's scholarship in Territory of Lies without any response from Blitzer or his supporters.  

Firstly, I wont respond to your silly example referring to where I live. Your racism is disgusting and reflects only on you but thats your problem.

Secondly, please dont further insult the intelligence of editors by implying that Near East Report was *possibly* published by someone else in 1970s. Blitzer edited the book ergo he worked for AIPAC, likewise he was editor of the weekly publication Near East Report into 1978. Source? The directoy listing showing his name listed as the responsible party at the weekly. He worked for them in 1976,77,78 regardless of whether you seek to portray that as """"outside work"""" or anything else. His name is on the front cover of the book as editor right? His name is listed in the weekly publication as editor right? Are those facts in dispute by you? 

Friedmans words are his own, you removed not only the quote whos inclusion you disagree with but all the other details. Fine, remove the quote, but removing everything else? Criticism of Blitzer does belong in the section detailing criticism. An automatic rebuttal isnt necessarily required if its a minority view and/or it cant be located.

Year of the Five Emperors
I've had to revert your group's changes to this article for various reasons, which I'll try to explain as clearly as possible. 

As the page topic is """"Year of the Five Emperors"""", the text should provide only as much biographical information as readers need in order to thoroughly understand the topic (in this instance, what happened in that year or during that event). I agree that some kind of potted biography is needed for each claimant, but a lot less than has been provided - we already have articles on each of them. The article should cover  (in other words, what happened that year, why it happened at all, who was involved and why, their fate, and (probably) the consequences of all this for the Empire and its people. Try to maintain a strong, sound and logical article structure, based always on the topic. 

Please also note our source requirements; modern scholarly treatments by specialists in the field are preferred over older treatments; both are preferred over primary sources (this is especially so when it comes to the notoriously problematic Historia Augusta, for example). Some online sources are OK, but take care to establish their authorship, credentials and scholarly standing. Generalised treatments (such as other paper or online encyclopedias, school textbooks etc., particularly older sources, will tend to offer no more than an outline, and may not reflect the most recent scholarly thinking on the topic. By the way, Wikipedia articles can't be used as sources; but their sources can, as long as they're sound; in that case, you'd not be citing the article but its sources (as above). Please also note our citation and style manual requirements.

"First, I did not change the name of an AFD. I changed the name of the article. Articles are open for editing during AFD, and people objected to the name. I improved the article by changing the name, which no one seemed to like. Obviously, one should then change the name of the AFD to correspond to the article. For you to call that disruptive demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of the process.  If I had changed it to something silly, that would be different, but I doubt there's an editor here who disputes that was an improvement.
Second, I did not attack Aaron in it, I described his actions. I factually said he did not do a, b, & c. I also described it as a preposterous attempt to circumvent standard procedure. It was.

 Edits with a seemingly personal agenda 

Dear Sir:

Recently you have made misleading edits that constitute vandalism on the """"Barlas"""" page on Wikipedia. To the ethnicity of the Barlas as being Turko-Mongol you added """"Persianized"""" - this is a general and ambiguous term and there is no way to verify such an assertion - you then footnoted it with a book on the Persians but never really provided the exact quote you are relying upon - first, I would ask you do that, and second, even if you can provide the exact quote from the book on the Persians, I suggest you examine the validity of such an assertion. 

Barlas is a world wide clan that was originally Mongol and then was Turkicized through intermarriage with Turks - Iran was one of many countries ruled by this clan and to use this simple fact to assert they were """"Persianized"""" seems inappropriate and misleading and an attempt at trying to reduce the authenticity of the facts on this page.

Also, how can you change """"Central Asia"""" to """"Greater Persia"""" when Central Asia is what exists in fact and """"Greater Persia"""" is just a concept or a term of reference and does not exist in fact?

I have seen your previous edits and it seems your efforts to change the ethnicity and culture of the Barlas clan are aimed at a personal agenda to contend, perhaps due to your religious inclinations, as has been unsuccessfully tried before, that the Barlas were associated with Persia. Sir, your words cannot change the truth and I would ask you refrain from playing with such things for personal motives.

 Promotional writing and non-free content 

The tone of this article is not factual and neutral, but comes across as a promotional brochure aimed at people who belong to to Lee's particular denomination or doctrine of Christianity. Cases in point: """"Lee knows that Christians lives are to be holy and should be empowered by the Holy Spirit"""",  """"Rev. Dr. Lee movingly testified to messages"""", """"...the fiery and explosive work of the Holy Spirit..."""", """"Blind eyes were opened to see and ears that could not hear came to hear"""" - those are a very few examples of utterly inappropriate and unencyclopedic phrases that abound in this text.  Add to this the fact that this article seems to make the claim that Lee can actually perform miracles of healing, in direct contravention of Wikipedia policies.  In addition, criticism and counter arguments have been removed or whitewashed, sometimes to the point of saying the exact opposite of what the sources state.

The article needs a lot of work by people who are not affiliated with Lee's organisation. At the moment, there are many editors who work only on articles connected to Lee and his work, and it seems probable that there is a strong conflict of interest here.

Another important issue is to do with non-free content. Bits of the promotional blurbs of Lee's books, and text taken straight from press releases, have been pasted into the article. It's difficult to find all the individual instances, because they crop up everywhere, and that's a very big problem. '''' contributions talk """,0

"Summary from the Source
I went and summarized the source in my own words:
Science shows that the Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago. The organisms that live on Earth have completely changed its air (atmosphere); this is called a biosphere. 71% of Earth's surface is covered in salt water oceans. Earth is the only place in the Solar System where liquid water is known to exist at present. The other 29% is made of rocky land in the shape of continents and islands.

Earth interacts with other objects in the Solar System, particularly the Sun and the Moon. The Earth orbits or goes around the Sun roughly once every 365.25 days. One spin is called a day and one orbit around the Sun is called a year. This is why there are 365 days in a year, but a leap day is added once every 4 years.

You recently deleted File:Nasrallah.jpg, citing this discussion.  I'd just like to know how one person saying the image should be deleted constitutes consensus on the topic, because I really don't think it should.

Additionally, deletion discusions are not votes and are instead determined based on the strength of the various arguments presented; in this case, I feel that the delete !votes were more grounded in policy than your own (no offense intended), as previous consensus in many discussions has shown that just because a free image of a person can't be found doesn't mean that one couldn't be made or that a copyright holder of a non-free image won't release it under a free license; therefore, it is replaceable, as Peripitus describes. – (T • C • L)",0

King Air article
Bill, sorry for not responding sooner to your question about the military versions of the 90, and the general length of the article. I've been mulling it over, and I'm still not sure what would be best, but I'm wondering about splitting the article into one about the 90/100 series and another about the 200/300 series. That, to me, is where the logical split is, in a number of ways. The 200/300 (including 350), went by """"Super King Air"""", and while there's a lot of commonality between the 90 and 100, there's much less so between the 100 and 200 (the exception would be the 90F which borrowed the 200's tail, but I wouldn't worry about that). Plus, the PT-6A engine comes in two """"families"""", the large PT6A and the small PT6A (# of PT wheels being a big factor). The 90/100 KAs use small PT6s, the 200/300 use large PT6s, so there's a natural split there. If we split the article there, each would have a fairly decent length, and could possibly be split further down the road if they continued to grow. Just some thoughts....  """,0

This reads to me as a staged bit of company hype until I see footage of a real vehicle and some third party confirmation of the putative statistics. This whole thing reads like a marketing ploy with Wikipedia furnishing the advertising medium. User:69.7.41.230

Seat-of-the-pants acceleration statistics have been reported on by several independent press reporters; see for instance this LA Times article by Dan Neil (including video) and this Forbes article by Elizabeth Corcoran. YouTube has even more video.  While independent test track information has not yet been published, this is to be expected as common practice for automobile companies during development of a new vehicle. It is unusual, however, for Tesla to allow so many reporters to ride in their 3rd gen evaluation prototypes (development vehicles).  The reported efficiency of 133 Wh/km, while quite good, is very much in line with other electric vehicles.  Similarly, reports of the energy (56kWh) and power (220kW) content of the li-ion pack are well within the range of other li-ion battery packs.  How might we improve the article to sound less like a """"marketing ploy""""?  

I agree that the article reads like an advertisment, the Models section especially, and as asuch I will add an advert warning to the section until the advert feel is gone.   

 That single comment is 3.5 years old and is no longer relevant. The article has gone through multiple revisions by multiple editors since that time.   

These revisions evidently did nothing to solve the adverts, you should know you have been editing this page for over 3.5 years.

 Some Issues (which I'm about to attempt to partially fix) 

1. The gold-leaf and quadrant electrometers are in a sense, also repulsion electrometers; they both work by measuring the repulsion of the same charge in one way or another.

2. My 1861 chem textbook uses the name """"quadrant electrometer"""" to describe a considerably simpler device than Kelvin invented. This device has an index which goes between 0 and 90 degrees (hence a quadrant) while Kelvin's device, while I don't fully understand it, had a drum split into quadrants. So I conclude that this is a coincidence. 

The best solution I can think of is to create a section of repulsion electrometers, and then describe the types individually in their own sections underneath, e.g. gold-leaf, Dellmann, Peltier, Bohnenberger. I will rename """"quadrant electrometer"""" to """"Kelvin's quadrant electrometer"""", and then put both his and the simpler one under """"repulsion electrometers"""".

Hopefully we can make this article clearer and neater.

From an admin , we cant expect such reason, you removed Propdelition tag without seeing its tag or the notices concerning no citation or references which are intact for years.

 District of Safed 

Hi, regarding your edit at Dallata.  Because there are quite a few examples of more than one village in Palestine of the same name, we usually identify which district of Palestine it was in (sometimes even in the article name). The unwritten convention among the editors who work on the village articles is to use the 1945-8 districts since that is what most modern sources use.  See Districts of the British Mandate of Palestine, last section, where you will notice that we should be calling them """"sub-districts"""" rather than """"districts"""".  Also, writing that a village was in Mandatory Palestine won't do, since that entity only lasted about 25 years but most of the villages were there for centuries.

Examples seem to show an increased demand where price is lowered... Though it's not hard to find examples where increasing the price has increased the demand and a good is seen as having greater value than it actually has. I think this was the case with BMW, certainly a car manufacturer, who saw sales increase when they put the price up.

There are also concepts such as 'the greater fool' where profits are the key drivers and people buy because the price is rising until such point as supply is limited by affordability, not real value (for instance stock market 'adjustments' where price is much greater than value) nor total quantity.

In those examples increased 'price' is not caused by lack of supply but supply by price.",0

Oh you dont say!! I think you will find it very clear from everything I have contributed towards on wikipedia that concerns this subject, that I am the one who has clarrified that it was a Muslim-Christian conflict. And no, once again, you are very biased, and lack alot of knowledge about your own faith. Yes, there were Europeans, the 'west', what were they then,?? Africans, Asians?? that part of the world is called Europe. The crusaders came from all over Europe, so get that right for starters. And let me tell you this, these muslims who were 'invading' Byazantinian lands, were the people of the middle east who were conquered by the byzantinians. These 'pleaing' byzantinians, along with the ROMAN catholics were all trinitarian christians, and remenat of the pagan Roman Religeon (due to the inevitable spread of true jesuit unitarian christianity, the roman empire found itself in a critical position and had to adopt the christian faith and embed it in their previous pagan beliefs, hence the celebration of sunday- rather than the jesuit saturday- sunday was tthe holy day for pagan romans. The cross, a pagan roman sign-never adopted by jesus. the fish, a pagan Egyptian sign adopted by the romans, the trinity, the whole tihing about the vatican in rome etc etc.)were massacring the indigenous people of the levant which they occupied, who were mostly unitarian sects of christianity, and the followers of the more accurate versions of the gospel (which weree written fairly shortly after Jesus's ascent-not the centuries old, heavily altered versions you follow). These Unitarians had prophecies in their gospels of  the coming of a final prophet, and the signs and times pointed to Mohammad and most of them adopted Islam, because they knew Mohammad was their prophet, as prophesized by Jesus. The byzantinians (romans) were killing them and there familys, and they were deemed by the church at the councils of nicea as heretics, so the mass population who were invaded by romans, were indeed monotheistic Unitarians. The Muslims liberated these people of the land from the tyrant byzantinians. Even under Islamic rule, the roman minority citizens were left to live in peace amongst the Muslims, and a testimony to this is the fact that these same roman minorities still live on in  the middle east.
Jerusalem was sacked ny the romans, and its people liberated by the Muslims.
And were YOU aware that the inquisition (which by the way you put it acted independantly from the church-stop lying, the church was the ultimate ruler as everyone knows, which murdered science and scientists and had complete control over everyone-as seen by the call to the crusades. You are an apologetic, not muslims, everything was done in the name of the church, why, even colonialists came into countries and plundered them with priests accompanying them)You claim it has nothing to do with the church-and I never said that the inquisition was called for by the pope, where did you get that rubbish from?? dont put words in my mouth-however, up until the 18th /19th century, the bodies and skeletons of muslims and 'heretics' killed by the inquisition were still hangig from the ceilings of churches!! The church is the one who deems people as heretics, and is the one who approved of the killings full stop. Please dont try to correct me before you yourself go and do some academic unbiased research like I did, most of my sources were non muslim sources that were ballanced. (obviously unlike you)
And about the pope issuing edicts against the killing of muslims or Jews, well what do you mean THE pope, dont you mean, A pope (there were many you know). And this is about the inquisittion and not the pope, perhaps a pope at a different time to the inquisition said that they (logically) shouldnt kill other people like barbarians, Im not doubting, you, but it would be helpful if you could mention the name. Again, dont go off the topic, this was about hte inquisition.
And yes, I bloomin love life under Islam, as a woman I feel liberated and free, and as an environmentallist and a concerned person for childrens rights i feel supported, and as a lover of logic and equality I feel I found the truth (there was a debate in the church at one point and they were discussing whether or not women were humans!!!!) If it wasnt for Islam the motor wouldnt have been invented (the crank shaft) tall buildings (dur to architectural techniques) education including higher education for all sexes classes and colours, merit was becasue of knowledge, and not wealth, and there is so much more that is owed to them, basically, we would have stil been living in huts right now if it wasnt for them, and dont forget that the romans forcibly converted us to roman 'christianity' when they invaded us.

It seems that every time i try to talk to anybody around here, things end up deleted or changed. Chronic problem. At least this time

get you to see the problems that exist? How about fixing the problems?

Your social experiment can't work under the weight of political warfare. Abuse is rampant, the abused have no real recourse. Gaming the system is too simple, and enough people are doing it that it is now part of what is simply required to be here.

zone.

What are you going to do about it?
My suggestion, as an Expert in Sociology, Psychology, Systems Theory,
Communications Theory, And Political Science is that The problem stems from the sheer quantity of ignorant pov warriors versus the smaller number of available experts, and the techniques and tactics that can be employed against reason, fact, knowledge, ot sense.
I see the same problem Larry Sanger Saw, But i know that the solution isn't to become elitist, it is instead to create interactions that are meritocratic instead of based in pack psychology and mob or riot group movements.

LOGIC, which is what ANY serious educational or informational
service has to eventually use, is the only solution to your
problems. Logic ends most of the tools used by pack psychology, ends psychological warfare tactics, exposes ignorance and lies and misinformation, as well as bad reasoning, and levels the playing feild enough so that an Expert has a chance to actually confront that mob.

Unless you ban me, or I am blocked, I'll continue to attempt to talk with you about this problem, and it will start to pop up in as many places as i looks like it needs in order to get the attention it deserves. Avoidance isn't going to solve the problems, and, to be truthful, blocking me is only getting rid of the one thing that could have bailed you out; A lucid whos Agenda is to help you write the best encylopedia ever; who nonetheless understands the facts of the entropy you are experiencing and who knows how to deal with it and what the solutions to those problems are.

It will be better for you, and for everybody concerned, if you adress
the problems, and work with those who are capable of being lucid relevant to those problems to solve those problems. Unless your goal
is to have entropy and pack psychology dominate the world, and to be yet one more example of how politics and pack psychology enforce intentional ignorance and doublethink propagandas.

Lets start with square one. Knowledgable experts ought to be able to as much as float an outline on a talk page without having it deleted by pov warriors whos agenda is to keep the conversation in drama.
People who are seriously abused by others ought to have realistic and swift recourse regarding that abuse. People should not be allowed to stack RFCs with their freinds. People should not be allowed to stack votes for deletion with their freinds. People should not be allowed to attack others and then cite them for personal attacks if they as much as respond with a simple mirrored reflection of the original attack. Pov warriors should not have pet rogue admins blocking people on trumped up charges to silence them
for making noise about serious abuses. Wikipedia should not be psychological combat. And Yet, it is.

Since it vanished into the ethers, lets recap the more angry
and to the point message you failed to answer.

It is a place notable mostly for what it conspicuously lacks.

I can cast some light on:

1. CZMarlin's contribution 

CZMarlin is a tireless promoter of AMC vehicles (he owns at least two and has a website dedicated to AMC products). As he knows, I have developed the view that he seems to use the project quite persistently as a PR medium for the defunct corporation and its products. It is, I believe, to this end that, it seems to me, he has habitually fought against sourced material that brings neutrality and balance to articles on AMC products, e.g. AMC Pacer, Gremlin etc.  

It is true that I was deeply frustrated by the apparent determination with which he misrepresented others’ contributions in order to justify their deletion, e.g. . I was also frustrated by his apparent insistence on idiosyncratic and erroneous interpretations of the English language, and also by what appeared to be deliberately erroneous interpretation of verifiable facts, e.g.   errors that cannot be permitted in an  encyclopedia.  

My sincere belief that English was not CZM’s first language arose from the manner in which he uses it and the difficulties of communicating with him. (Examples on request.) I disagree that I belittled him for it – as a non-native English speaker myself, it's not something I would do.  Indeed I offered to help him with the language (offer ignored) and told him he could seek help from WP volunteer translators, so that he could write in Polish (also ignored).  

True, I ridiculed him when his behaviour seemed so extreme as to appear ridiculous to me.  I should not have done so. But we get frustrated when we try to work with an editor who, it seems, demonstrates provocatively scant regard for factual accuracy, neutrality, balance and clarity of communication . Granted, I should not have let my frustration show. 

The 'known vandal' CZM mentions is in fact an IP address used by one or more people. The address had a history of vandalism. When I saw a constructive edit from it I tried to encourage the contributor in her/his constructive behaviour; and later suggested the sandbox for experiments:  , . My posts encouraged constructive behaviour. 

CZM's damaging claim that these posts encouraged disruptive behaviour is totally false. (This gives a flavour of the difficulties I had with him.) It also casts serious doubt on the reliability of his contribution here, and also on his good faith.

He implies that my use of the term 'AMC cuckoos' was insulting. Not so, as he well knows, because I explained it to him when he showed that he had misunderstood the idiom: I used the term in an edit summary to describe the long-winded and inappropriate descriptions of certain AMC cars that he had introduced  like cuckoos in a nest  into an article on a certain aspect of automotive aerodynamics .

My  'another sophomoric CZM error' was mischievous but (IMO) harmless retaliation for CZM’s previous sniffy dismissal of some Google research I had posted to a discussion, which he denigrated as 'sophomoric research'. He seems to have forgotten that.  

The reference to 'little fuhrer' is more serious, and I should not have used it even though it mentioned no names (so no harm done to CZM’s reputation). Why that particular metaphor? I’m afraid I regarded CZM’s approach to editing as uncollaborative and perfunctory to the point of being dictatorial; and ruthless in its uncritical promotion of AMC and its products.

2. Collect’s contribution 

Just as he could list my transgressions (""""I have a list of [Writegeist's] comments""""), so also could I recite a litany of his own. Meh. Tit for tat gets us nowhere.

However it is worth noting that an antagonism grew between us at the Sarah Palin pages when it became apparent to Collect that I disagreed with much of his input, whereas he had assumed from one of my earliest contributions there that I would be an ally (he left an appreciative note on my Talk).

 Importance of this dispute 

I think that when you have a subject as ideologically charged as this one, where the accusations and counter accusations are equally the product of political sympathies and ideological proclivities, the contestation of fact itself becomes more significant and relevant then the normative preference, i.e. an imaginary idea of a clear, defined and uncontested truth. (Not to suggest at all that all claims are thus equally valid) But even if some of the claims have been manipulated to suit a particular agenda, it is better that they lie ugly, contested, unsubstantiated and disempowered. It is a better reflection of the nature of this topic. In my mind it is irresponsible to try and figure out a depoliticized version of this issue as wikipedia editors are often compelled to do.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 85.97.118.71   """,0

 Northern Cyprus edits 

I will complement you on doing a great job updating and expanding many Northern Cyprus-related articles.

I oppose, however, to your sneaky removal of links to Cyprus / Island of Cyprus / Republic of Cyprus, usually replacing them with links to Northern Cyprus, sometimes even making double or triple links to NC to avoid linking to the island of / Republic of Cyprus. I also notice that all your newly created articles about places in NC do not have any mentions at all about  RoC, not even the de jure/de facto distinction. That is definitely POV editing.

I oppose also to your consistent removal of any mention of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, replacing any mention with """"the events of 1974"""" or your new favorite """"the hostilities of 1974"""". These euphemisms do not give any information to the user of Wikipedia, they only create questions: """"Which events?"""", """"Which hostilities?"""". You have also been removing many sourced descriptions of the local effects of the 1974 ínvasion. These edits are definitely disruptive POV edits.

In your edit summaries you never mention the removals and changes you do to the article content, you only mention additions of mayors, population figures etc., which are obviously good additions. The disruptive edits I have mentioned above are never mentioned (which is why I used the word """"sneaky""""). To make it even worse, you are using false edit summaries. When you remove a category you do not like with an edit summary """"syntax"""", it is not only disruptive, it is plain dishonest.

In a week's time I will again be able to edit regularly in Wikipedia, and I will then begin to revert your POV edits. In the meantime you could help, by reverting your worst POV edits. If not, the least you can do is to refrain from any more POV edits with dishonest edit summaries.

I really think that it would be possible for us to work together to create a neutral (WP:NPOV) presentation of places in NC, but that would require that you are willing to accept that your personal POV is not necessarily the only way to describe the world. Regards!   """,0

Should the British EngD be mentioned in the article as a """"professional doctorate"""" ?

A few English universities now offer the degree of """"Doctor of Engineering"""" (EngD), which, like the PhD, is also a research-based degree, but differs from the traditional UK PhD in several important ways. Specifically,

1) A PhD degree is normally pursued full-time by a student while in residence in a university department under the supervision of a faculty member. Accordingly, PhD-level research is more speculative/abstract in nature, with an emphasis on producing results that may be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and are of academic interest. 

2) The EngD on the other hand is normally pursued by a candidate while he/she works as an employee in an outside company. Most EngD research is carried out in a designated industry (as opposed to a university department or lab) and is jointly supervised by both an industrial and a university supervisor. Accordingly, EngD-level research tends to be application-oriented in nature and designed to meet the specific needs/interests of the industrial sponsor. EngD candidates are still required to produce original research that makes a significant contribution to existing knowledge on his/her field, but, in many programmes (AmEng """"programs""""), it is customary for EngD candidates to submit a portfolio of engineering projects in lieu of a longer monographic thesis to fulfil (AmEng """"fulfill"""") the requirements for the degree.

3) EngD programmes normally include a more formal coursework requirement than the traditional English PhD. It should be stressed however that many engineering departments in the UK (e.g. at Cambridge) now require that PhD students take lecture courses and their associated written exams in their first year in the programme. 

4) (POV) No matter what the Research Councils say, the EngD is still generally seen in academic circles as inferior to a PhD. For example, I doubt an EngD would be acceptable as a qualification for appointment as a Lecturer in a university, whereas the PhD of course is the standard qualification in England for an entry-level faculty position. 

Because of its industry-oriented nature, the EngD is normally referred to in English academic circles as a """"professional degree"""", even though it remains a research degree as emphasized above
(there are no """"professional doctorates"""" awarded in the UK by coursework only like the American J.D for example). 161.24.19.112  """,0

"I have just followed from your edit exchange on the article Blu-Ray Disc to find the exchange above.  Sadly, you appear to know little about the subject, and to be fair, it has become confusing because much of the terminology has become abused.

First, European Blu-Ray discs are not produced in 24p format.   That is almost exclusively the preserve of the American regions.  Secondly, the Blu-Ray format does not support the proper 1080 progressive high definition formats (1080/50p and 1080/60p (and I include the 59.95p in that).  This is because the data rate is not fast enough for these formats.  The European sourced discs that state 1080p on the packaging are discs produced from film originated material and is one of the abuses of the term progressive.  The term progressive strictly defines a video format where the lines of video information are recorded in strict numerical order, 

1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ... 1078 - 1079 -1080.  

Alternatively, there is the interlaced format which displays the odd lines ony first (odd field) and then follows them by the even lines (even field). (You probably know this already).

1 - 3 - 5 - 7 ... 1077 - 1079 - 2 - 4 - 6 ... 1078 - 1080

They are actually stored in the digital video frame the other way around due to the digital video format's origins in the NTSC world.  In true video source material, the even field displays a time slice that is 20 milliseconds later than the odd field and the two together give a comlete video frame.  This is also largely true in the Americas, except the even field precedes the odd field by ~16.6 miliiseconds.

There is a largish group of enthusiasts (if that's the right word) who have become somewhat anally retentive over the progressive video formats and who have convinced themselves that progressive is the only way to go.  The reality is that any improvement in the visual perception of the video is marginal at best and certainly not worth the doubling of the required digital data to support it.  But for them, everything has to be progressive.  I shall coin the word 'progressivists' for this discussion.

When film originated material is transferred to video in Europe, the film is run slightly fast by 4% which allows one film frame to occupy both the the odd and even fields of the video frame (known as 2:2 pulldown).  Thus the even field displays a time slice that is 0 milliseconds later than the odd field.  In order to satisfy the progressivists, the Blu-Ray producers state that such material is in 1080p format, but using something called a 'Progressive Segmented Frame' technique (though they don't mention that last bit on the box).  That is: that it is progressive video, but the odd lines have been recorded together and then they are followed by the even lines.  It is really interlaced video, but by the time the display device or the Blu-ray player has de-interlaced the video (it doesn't matter one jot where it actually happens), the result is perceptually indistinguishable from true 1080/25p video (assuming the deinterlacing algorithm works properly).  If watched on a CRT display then, of course, the video will be interlaced as there is no deinterlacing prior to display, but with that number of lines, no one is likely to notice (unless they sit inches away from the screen).  The description 1080p on the box is, technically at least, wrong but percetually the same as 1080/25p video.  The 4% speed up goes completely un-noticed especially these days when the sound is adjusted back to the original pitch - and obviously you hadn't noticed it yourself if you had convinced yourself that you were watching films at the original speed.

Once we cross to the Americas, different problems occur.  Obviously, running the film at 30 frames per second is not an option, so instead, film is converted to video by storing the same film frame on 3 half video frames, followed by storing the next frame on 2 half video frames and then repeating 3 - 2 - 3 - 2.  Thus 4 film frames occupy 5 video frames (the technique is 3:2 pulldown - often wrongly called 2:3 pulldown).  Properly deinterlaced, such material is perfectly watchable and the viewer unlikely to feel anything is wrong.  But the progressivists have decided that it is not the way to watch film material and have even invented faults to justify a move to a progressive format.  I have even seen claims (obviously failing to understand the technique) that movement in the resultant video is uneven in that it jumps 50% further every other jump due to the 3 half fields.  

The result was the 24p format.  The only problem with the 24p format is that if you try to watch it on a CRT display (and A CRT is still unbeatable for contrast and colour reproduction), the result will be unviewable to bad flicker - something that was known as long ag",0

"Educational Component 

The educational component of the People to People Student Ambassador Program is one of its most note-worthy aspects.  Students participate in a minimum of twelve hours of orientation meetings with their teacher-leaders.  During these meetings, students participate in practical activities including journal writing, role-playing, civic responsibility, and community service. Students are responsible for completing assignments and preparing projects based on research of the country or countries they'll be visiting.  In addition to attending these classes, students are also responsible for completing online courses for certification which include destination-specific information on government, history, culture, and geography.  High School credit is available through the Washington School of World Studies.  For an additional fee, high school students may elect to earn college credit through the Eastern Washington University.  As a classroom teacher and leader, I really appreciate all the preparation involved during the pre-travel segment of the program.  The selection process of students through three letters of recommendation and an interview session enhances the environment with a clear focus on learning.",0

 removing aircrash investigation additions and calling them spam en third class publications 

Someone (AndyTheGrump)is accusing me of putting information about aircraft investigations as third class spam mail on wikipedia. This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am a aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol International Airport Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1973) and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not everybody uses the metric system, there are problems in terminology, etc.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, some governments simply refuse to make reports available for international students and/or mechanics in aviation. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Because we (a number of retired pilots) are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large and after a certain time the publication is no more available, they also become too expensive for people in countries that are not so """"blessed"""" as Americans.  You should appreciate what we do instead of insulting us, we are simply acting on requests of the industry. You are apparently some kind of Johnny the Selfkicker.

Dear Arkaever, what you write makes absolutely no sense - and your spelling of """"hypothesis"""" with """"hi"""" at the beginning is the first hint that it is so.

Everyone who has ever visited places both in the continental climate and near the ocean must know that places near the oceans have much more stable temperatures (while the continental climate has much more brutal variations) because the relevant layer of water has much higher heat capacity than the relevant layer of soil. The water is circulating and can actually swallow or release the heat from up to hundreds of meters of the upper ocean pretty quickly; on the other hand, it takes years for the heat to get dozens of meters of the soil.

That's also why the continental ice sheets are much more variable - and much more important for the global variability of the climate - than effects that occur on the sea. They may appear or disappear mostly on the Northern Hemisphere. At any rate, the Milankovitch theory works, as settled in Roe's paper. You shouldn't try to promote your amateurish and scientifically meaningless opinions about difficult subjects on Wikipedia - opinions that, as you admit, are on par with creationism.

[page 33] Cowan's investigations at the Roger's Shelters (Po-26 and Po-27) and the Haystack Shelter (Po-47A and B) have provided ethnobotanical analyses of materials obtained under more controlled conditions.  Radiocarbon dates from the Roger's Shelters indicate the site was occupied between the fifth and seventh centuries A.D., and Cowan (1976:97-98) postulates a similar timespan [page 34] for the Haystack Shelter occupation.  Plant food remains from the site include six species of nuts (black walnut, butternut, hickory, chestnut, acorn and hazelnut), four species of fruits (pawpaw, sumac, plum and grape), and four or five possible cultigens (squash or pumpkin, bottle gourd, marsh elder, sunflower, and canary grass).  No corn was recovered.  Fragments of cane basketry, prepared bark, and cordage were also collected (Cowan 1976:87-101).

[page 36] Cowan conducted limited test excavations at two of the bottomland sites (Po-31 and Po-42) in 1974.  One of these sites (the Martin Site, Po-42) produced roughened surface pootery which is similar to ceramics from the Levisa Fork in the extreme Eastern Mountains (Cowan 1976:73-82)...In 1973, members of the Red River Historical Society and volunteers from the university of Kentucky, Department of Anthropology conducted excavations at Mf-32, a single-component Fort Ancient rockshelter site.  Materials recovered included corn husks, cordage, cut cane, two species of nuts, and shell tempered pottery, in addition to lithic materials.  The depth of the deposit (approximately 10-15 cm) suggested a relatively short-term occupancy (Cowan 1975:101-102).  Unfortunately, the materials from Mf-32 have not yet been analyzed and reported.

[page 50] This page notes that Cowan's 1975 survey, undertaken in response to changes in plans for the reservoir, gained stratigraphic information on a multicomponent Archaic site (Po-17) in the valley.  Cowan returned the following year to complete testing at Po-17 and Po-42, and to initiate excavation at Po-47B, a Woodland rockshelter site.  The data recovered from Po-17 confirmed Cowan's 1973 stratigraphic sequence and provided valuable information on the transition between the Late Archaic and Early Woodland cultures in [page 51] the Red River valley (Cowan 1976:ii).  Excavations at the Haystack Shelter (Po-47B), a Late Woodland dry shelter site, uncovered a large quantity of well-preserved organic remains.  Split cane basketry fragments, plant fiber cordage, leather, quids, paleofeces, and numerous plant food remains including both native and exotic cultigens were among the specimens recovered",0

I think the Wikipedia should allow information (articles) on governmental units to enable researchers on political systems understood the concept of political subdivisions of countries. The Philippines being a unitary state, needs more information on the Wikipedia as much as possible and other Wikis because these informations are not available in published encyclopedias.

As Wikipedia contributor, I myself believe that info like this should be enriched rather than tagged for deletion. Who knows? There might be some people interested on particular local government units. Barangay is the basic unit of government in the Philippines. No cities and towns will exist without it - that is how important it is!

Barangay Hilabago is one important, albeit a small LGU, that needs to exist on the Wikipedia not only because of its historical importance during World War II but its significance as a basic unit of government.

The single is also for sale on Amazon's German site amazon.de and as an used import release on the American and British Amazon sites.

Also missing from the featured artist-section are the European-only releases of Sting & Aswad's re-recording of """"Invisible Sun"""" and Corsican folk music group I Muvrini's duet with Sting on the french/english new verion of Fields of Gold.

 Sting & Aswad """"Invisible Sun"""", was released as a single from The X-Files soundtrack album and made the charts in Germany. Info about the release with pictures of the artwork etc can be found at Discogs (http://www.discogs.com/Sting-Aswad-Invisible-Sun/release/1429439)

None of these releases are listed on the discography of Sting's offical site due to the fact that these are not released by A&M; Records (it only includes Sting's releases by A&M; which otherwise is quite complete)
I personally have the CD-singles for """"My Funny Friend and Me"""" and """"Invisble Sun"""", and have bought them as new in record stores in Scandinvaia, which proves that they were released in more than just one or two European countries.

I added these four releases (with what is considered quite reliable sources/references) to the discography because they rightly belong there so don't remove these proper single releases just because you might have not seen them or because they were not released in UK.

Btw. I removed the credit for Twista from """"Stolen Car (Take Me Dancing)"""" as only the remixes feature TWista, not the radio version/single version or album version, I think you can agree on that one.

I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen.

 deletion of redirects per Wikipedia:Naming conventions (schools) 

The issue has gotten contentious for one redirect in particular for Uni High.  There's been an Rfd for days nowand I've said that I'd be fine with keeping it, but only if there was a particular reason to.  We are forming guideslines etc, and while a look at the ones in place helped form them, I'll definitely admit that I could have overlooked stuff.  But the current discussion has been going round and round and the person who wants the redirect kept is arguing two things (it seems).  One is that keeping the redirect will prevent article duplication.  And the other is that it will help people find the article.

In my point of view, both of these arguments make no sense, as the article in question was moved from name of school plus paramater to name of school plus different parameter.  There are half a dozen different paramaters that could be used easily, so the idea that people are going to naturally gravitate towards the one that did happen to exist and want to create an article there, or search that way doesn't make sense.  If the person really thinks that that's a problem, then they should have created other redirects from the other possible namespaces for the article.  If you could take a look at the discussionI'd appreciate it.  I may be missing something, we may want to change the guidelines per different things that have been raised (notability of the city was raised, which we don't outright address because I didn't think we would need to but we probably should).

 How to Get the Wiki-Astrology Page Back Online & Honest 

One of the best ways to get the Astrology Page back to good use was mentioned by Chris Brennan, who wisely thought that a Wiki-project on Astrology would help. I agree with Chris. Astrology is most likely the oldest, and best documented science in the history of humankind, leading to the invention of mathematics, medicine, and many other disciplines taken for granted by conventional science. Moreover, the history of astrology is also well-documented, even in the United States, where it must be remembered that it is an historical fact that the Founding Fathers of the U.S. not only practiced astrology, but used its principles to set, and then build Washington D.C., aligning the capital with the fixed stars in the constellation Virgo. The expert astrologers, and those with the knowledge base have worked hard, and seriously to improve the page; however, the arguments that seek to """"debase"""" astrology from a POV has disrupted the Wiki-Astrology page based on the failure to not accept historical facts while promoting a """"pseudo-science"""" viewpoint designed to blot out over 5,000 years of historical and scientific fact. A balance, with facts, surely can proceed, and Chris Brennan's idea of a project would help to combine diversifed views into cohesive subject matter that seeks to enlighten the mind, rather than to darken it. Welcoming views that seek to expand the knowledge base, rather than to shrink it through personal POV, is the best course. """,0

Pfortuny on Pfortuny's mediation

Apologies for the delay and for the following text which is far too long and I think out of place, but the discussion has led us here. By no means I intend my opinion to be regarded as more important than any other's, but for obvious reasons some people are expecting it. Here it goes. The history of this text is in  15:09, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

After reviewing the history and talking to , I have got the following vision of the facts (which is the basis for my opinion expressed below):
Alex's editions on the 29 were done without discussion on the talk page. This was clearly a serious mistake which led to the first catastrophe, but I think we may assume good faith here, at least ingnorance, not malice, especially if one follows the summaries, diffs, etc... 
Alex's editions on the 9 and 10 November were done using the talk page but he made edits before discussing them and, given the complete history of the article, the edits were too bold to be accepted without previous discussion; this led to their being systematically reverted (which is common use in the WP for that behaviour) and in the end to the blocking of the page. This behaviour was clearly a mistake of Alex's, and I put it to his not having read the complete history. While I am not excusing him, I do believe that most of the problems were a result of confusion caused by his Asperger's Syndrome.
Nobody can agree """"not to make unilateral edits"""" (Adam's expression) in whatever page for whatever reason, this is a bit too generic and has no deadline.
He is aware of the damages he may incur in (damages for himself) if he repeats the above behaviour.
Before Viajero's suggestion, Alex had told me he was going to """"try to stay out of Mother Teresa's page for a while"""". He has privately told me he is not going to touch the criticism section al least for a fortnight.
It sounds nice to be a mediator, but on the other hand it is a responsibility I cannot (I mean cannot, not do not want to or do not like to) take up for the moment.
If Alex behaves like he did on the 9/10 November, I will also agree to any rational punishment. I want to stress that I was in disagreement with most of his edits.
I do not think that Alex will cause any further problems.

Before stating my opinion, I would like everybody to know that Viajero's suggestion on my mediation was done without either mine or Alex's prior consent. He later expressed his concern about this to me. I feel it is only fair to mention it here.

Hence, my opinion is:
Unblock the page. If Alex behaves in a non cooperative way, then the resources of Wikipedia to prevent this non cooperative behaviour will be used, as with any other user.

But I mean as with any other user. If he were going to appear in the problem page, he has to be told in his talk page in advance; if he were going to be banned, then he has to be told explicitly in his own page and by a sysop, or whatever the standard procedure is.  12:35, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I have read the above and agree with Pfortuny.   13:14, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I had just typed out a smashing long post, then accidentally closed my browser tab...so I will save the civility protests and long explanations for another day.  Your proposed addition is mostly okay, and gives a good treatment to the question of how the word """"terrorist"""" is applied to the organization.  I would add the FBI website, and the fact that it was one of the organizations on the FBI's terrorism task force watch list.  There are plenty of categories, too many probably, available to help direct readers interested in the topic of terrorism to this article.  Category:Terrorism in America is one of them; the one you just added (:Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by the U.S. government) is another.  There is a huge BLP concern with branding living ex members as terrorists, particularly unconvicted ones who deny the charge.

"Propagandist movie 

This movie is the best example of how bad mouthing India gets you accepted in upper echelons of Indian power establishment. In a country where married men are more than twice likely to commit suicide than women and where domestic violence is literally legal against men (and not just by wife but by anybody who wife supports), this movie goes out of its way to invent an abusive husband and then justifies murder by his wife.

And it gets accolades as a 'thought provoking' piece and 'realism' by people who have no idea about real India.talk",0

"Thanks for your clarification. Though I still feel that your addition is problematic. One problem is the missing details for the citation, such as author, page numbers, etc. Another more jarring problem is that the narrative of your inserted text is quite different from the remainder of the section. Your added text is quite verbose and uses a lot of direct speech without adding much additional information. Note that this section is dealing with Sellers' personality and his struggles in very general way, and magnifying a small event like this gives it undue weight. So I would urge you to consider to shorten the text and merge this detail into the section in a way that conforms to the prose and amount of detail given in the text. Thanks!",0

 Spastic Cerebral Palsy 

 Discovery 
Cerebral Palsy was first discovered, and medically defined in 1861 by Dr. William John Little. http://cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/history-and-origin-of-cerebral-palsy/. 

Little attributed the disease to a lack of oxygen to an infant during """"abnormal forms of labor"""" resulting in a spastic condition. His work on the disease was so groundbreaking that it was first known as Little's Disease. http://cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/history-and-origin-of-cerebral-palsy/.

 Definition 
Cerebral palsy is a disease that effects the brain and nervous system. The disease can be divided into various subsets, including spastic cerebral palsy, dyskinetic cerebral palsy, ataxic cerebral palsy, hypotonic cerebral palsy, and mixed. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001734/

Spastic Cerebral Palsy is the most common form of this disease. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001734/. It is distinguishable from other forms of Cerebral Palsy in that sufferers display stiff, jerky movements, and have hypertonic muscles. http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/spastic%20cerebral%20palsy This differs from Non-Spastic cerebral palsy, which causes decreased, or fluctuating muscle tone. http://cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/types/#cm

Spastic Cerebral Palsy can itself be divided into unique categories.
 Spastic hemipelegia
Only one side of the body is effected in spastic hemipelgia. 
Spastic dipelgia
2 limbs are effected in Spastic dipelgia. 
Spastic triplegia
3 limbs are effected in Spastic diplegia.
Spastic quadripelgia
All 4 limbs are effected in Spastic quadriplegia.

This is a very simple non-issue. Bagramyan enlisted into the DRA army and fought within its ranks in very crucial (and famous to Armenians) battles against the invading Turks. When you join an army, you are going to fight by its side which Bagramyan did, especially during that time when the Turks were a few km away from Yerevan. The battles (especially Sardarabad) were battles that would determine life or death of the newly established republic. What he joined, became or did after or during the fall of the DRA has nothing to do with what he did prior to it. The DRA's """"brief experience of independence"""" does not disqualify Bagramyan's service to the country and to its survival.
 
Also, """"Unless you can provide factual information that he was a commissioned officer in the DROA, I would have to assume that he supported Communism, or at least Socialism"""".

"Edit request on 9 April 2012 

The article states that only one Libero player is allowed per team.  However, Beginning in 2008 for FIVB competitions, and beginning in the 2011-2012 for USAV competitions, two liberos are allowed per team, although only one may play at a time.  In fact, FIVB rules _require_ two liberos to be designated if a team has more than 12 players on the roster.

FIVB refernce:  http://www.fivb.ch/thegame/TheGame_VolleyballRules.htm
USAV reference: http://usavolleyball.org/news/2011/03/09/usav-rules-commission-meeting-highlights/41322

The article also states that the rule allowing Liberos to serve has trickled down to juniors competitions.  That is not entirely true.  USAV rules do not allow Liberos to serve in any sanctioned event, although AAU Volleyball does allow Liberos to serve.  Many USAV regions allow Liberos to serve in events that do not serve as USAV National qualifiers.

Hi Colin, it is good to hear from you!! I have had a lot of real life stuff piling up lately and haven't had a lot of time to contribute lately. I took a look at the Rubella article. According to several articles I was able to dig up, epidemic Rubella has been eliminated from the US.  (by Stanley  Plotkin no less) and . This article is also quite clear on the matter. Whether this woman really had rubella and where she got it are not clear from the """"podcast"""" and neither is a Podcast a reliable source. I guess  what I am saying is that I think RS must trump unverifiable trivia at every turn. Would you like for me to change it, or post a comment on the talk page?

Oh polio, my dear friend polio... I am not sure what to do with her. I think that the recent changes Marco made have really helped, but I am not sure that it fulfills the 1a requirements? I would like to take her to FA at some point but I am really busy right now, maybe in a few weeks I will take it to task, so if you might have a chance to look at it and give me your thoughts that would be quite helpful. 

I dunno what happened to Marco?? (Picturing my self wandering around a swimming pool with my eyes closed here) I will give an email shout if I don't hear anything soon, just to make sure he hasn't given up or anything.

It doesn't matter who published the papers: the underlying content is primary material. For example, there have been similar issues regarding the works of Henry Miers Elliot, who basically reproduced ancient Indian texts. I know some members of the Seely family, as it happens, but diaries, letters, office reports etc are not reliable sources. Someone needs to write a book about them, not a book containing them. Furthermore, Raj sources generally are not deemed to be reliable, and especially not for matters of caste and history. - Sitush (talk) 

""""(The above is classic Sitush)""""

MY COMMENTS REGARDING SITUSH'S REMARKS

Sitush you are an ass. I do not know who let you loose on Wikipedia, NCRT textbooks are writtin from the sources in the India Office Archive. Every historical work including that of Seely depends to some extent on primary sources that work has been published and the authors of the Singahi article have cited from it. These are spurious and non academic grounds of objecting to the article. Its just making mischief, I invite anybody from a higer academic background to examine all Sitush Sitush (talk) edits.

Examining Sitush|talk]]) edits all over Wikipedia as I have done establishes he is a menace and taking wikipedia backwards. Sitush I suspect you are just a 14 year old kid treating wikipedia as a toy.

1) when their homestate can be ascertained, what about links in the state articles to """"notable Eagles from x"""" or """"notable Scouts from x""""?
2) when the stub mergers will start going through, it says """"Please request a page move on Wikipedia:Requested moves if you cannot do so, but please do not just copy and paste the contents (doing that destroys the page's edit history)."""" How do we get it to merge with the history intact?
3) we need to define what is keepable versus mergeable. My vote is a paragraph or two are stubs and therefore mergeable, a three or more paragraphs makes a page and is definitely a linker.

""":Kleene (re his (1952) Introduction to Metamathematics) would disagree that metamathematics isn't a topic for mathematics. But Minsky (1967) seems to agree with you, never mind he's not too convincing with his """"intuitive argument"""" using appeals to """"intuitive arguments"""". In his discussion of """"an effective procedure a.k.a. algorithm"""" (his definition, in fact) he says the matter is subjective:
""""Different people may not agree on whether a certain procedure should be called effective. Perhaps there are processes, we might suppose, which simply cannot be described in any formal language, but which can nevertheless be carried out, e.g., by minds. One might even argue that those important, but still mysterious, functions which make minds superior to all presently known mechanical processes must, by their intuitive nature, escape any systematic description.

""""Turing discusses some of these issues in his brilliant article, 'Computing Machines and Intelligence' [1950] .. they amount, in my view, to a satisfactory refutation of many such objections."""" (p. 107)

Minsky goes on to state:
""""One cannot expect to prove Turing's [his name for the Church-Turing] thesis, since the term 'naturally' relates rather to human dispositions than to any precisely defined quality of a process. Support must come from intuitive arguments..."""" (p.108)

Boolos and Jeffrey (1974, 1999) are more constructive:
""""Although this thesis ('Church's thesis') is unprovable, it is refutable, if false. For if it is false, there will be some function which is computable in the intuitive sense, but not in our sense. To show that such a function is computable in the intuitive sense, it would be sufficient to give instructions for computing its values for all (arbitrary) arguments, and to see that these instructions are indeed effective....To show that such a function is not computable in our sense, one would have to survey all possible Turing machines and verify (by giving a suitable proof) that none of them compute that function.... Then if Church's thesis is false, it is refutable by finding a counterexample; and the more experience of computation we have without finding a counterexample, the better confirmed the thesis becomes."""" (italics in original, p. 20)

""""Thus, the sun always rises because the sun has always risen."""" Truth by enumeration: animal logic. Bertrand Russell would have a field-day. At least Boolos and Jeffrey offer us a """"road map"""" of how to go about approaching the problem. But they fall into the same trap: they are asserting that if a computational procedure isn't mechanical then it must be intuitive. Say what? that the world of computation is divided into two mutually-exclusive sets: """"the intuitive"""" and """"the mechanical""""? Sure sounds like dualism to me ... intuitive 'minds' with 'souls' vs 'brains'made of gooey mechanical stuff ... interesting... most (but not all) philosphers of mind have given up on 'souls' ... maybe here is how one disproves or proves dualism? To wit: 

What would be interesting would be if someone could prove that the truth of the Thesis is formally undecidable in any construct whatever, """"intuitive or otherwise"""" forever unknowable to man or machine or God. One little [dualism] difficulty: what the hell does 'intuitive' really mean? [maybe that God is punching holes through the 5th dimension into our 4-D space-time, and is seeding minds with """"notions"""" (but not mechanically altering them in the process)?] 

I would call this sort of discussion a 'foundations of mathematics' debate, and therefore an open topic in some domain or other. Whether its 'philosophy' or 'foundations of mathematics' I don't know. I think they are the same.  wvbailey

In Sparing Ishadrian
[This discussion has been  transplanted from another user's talk page.  I have opted to reply to sentences as they appear.  My replies are in [green]. Sorry SD/WP.]

I don't know why  and  are spending their time arguing on your talk page. Neither Wayne or PresidentitstVB have submitted any strong reliable source that claims Punch wasn't a slave, sentenced to slavery, or wasn't enslaved.  [I agree that it is possible Punch could have been made """"subject to a superstition, passion, etc.,"""" and thus, enslaved, according to the definition of the word at the time.  I have stated ad infinitim et nauseum that he was not in any way made a slave, when viewed through any lens of the time, no matter how many oxymoronic historians state otherwise.  Slaves were specifically identified by the edicts of 1618 (as """"slaves to the Colony""""), by the slave traders and, most significantly, by the slaves themselves, especially those who converted to Christianity as slaves on board the early 17th C ships for the sole person of not being treated as slaves upon their arrival in the new world.  I'm tired of trying to argue the facts with a brick wall, except to ask you, , if I were to write what two other, reliable sources had considered in publications...  """"Scoobydunk is a brick wall,"""" would you be able to find two reliable sources, which specifically stated, as if to state the obvious for no apparent reason, """"Scoobydunk is not a brick wall?""""  I rest my case.]  They've also failed to provide any reliable source to claim there were slaves recognized and officially documented by a legal institution before Punch.  [Go ahead.  Do what  did at 5:36 PM (EST) on July 31st 2012, just make that leap of faith and write it!... (over and over again). [WP:OR]  After all, you have already said you removed it in response to my objections, so why should I be surprised, looking at the article's history, that you wouldn't continue the """"flip flip flam?""""]. Wayne thinks this quote from Foner supports his argument but it doesn't because Foner is specifically talking about the institution of slavery and when historians consider the institution to have originated. I've already supplied a quote from a strong reliable source by Vaughan that further substantiates this point:

""""On the first pointthe status of blacks before the passage of the slave lawsthe issue is not whether some were free or some were slave. Almost everyone acknowledges the existence of both categories by the 1640s, if not from the beginning."""" Alden T. Vaughan. The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 97, No. 3. July,1989.  [It is well known, , that slavery existed long before Punch's case - it was documented in Massachusetts (in present day Somerville, I think), in the Sugar Islands (the English colony of Barbados, primarily), from where a number of our first black immigrants emigrated, and most notably, on the slave ships departing West Africa, from where Punch himself is alleged to have come.]

So, even though historians may differ on when the institution of slavery started, Vaughan clarifies that """"almost everyone"""" recognizes the existence of both slaves and free blacks by 1640, if not, from the beginning of the colony. Wayne is trying to use his OR interpretation to pretend what Foner says contradicts what numerous historians have said about Punch, and it doesn't. He's failed to refute this fact and has repeatedly ignored this point made",0

"In Japan, Nobukatsu Fujioka, a professor of Takushoku University, mentioned, “Many translated books are published in Japan but Iris Chang’s “The Rape of Nanking” is not published. Because, it has so many mistakes that no publisher could have handled it. The photos are all false, and not a single picture was an evidence of the ‘Nanking Massacre.’ Not only that, her description about Japanese history is filled with absurd mistakes. For instance, she wrote that the Japanese military strength before the end of the Edo era (1603 -1867) had not exceeded the level of sword, bow and arrow (in fact, Japan was the biggest producer of guns in the world already in the 16th century). More than 100 such rudimentary mistakes were found in the book, and even if the book is published in Japan, no Japanese people could bear reading it. A left-wing publishing company tried to publish it with notes annotated by translator, but she refused it saying, “How impertinent.” Sad to say, the Americans trust such a book and are making movies.”
 
Shoichi Watanabe, a professor emeritus of Jochi University, mentioned, “Before World War II, a false document called the Tanaka Memorial was made in China.

The American President Roosevelt, senators and congressmen read this forgery, and believed the lie that Japan had a malicious intention to take over Asia and the world. That became a cause for the US-Japan war. It is said that after reading it, Roosevelt decided to defeat Japan entirely. Iris Chang’s ‘The Rape of Nanking’ is the same.

Current Squad
I propose redoing the current squad list a bit (for all South African teams). During the first half of the year, the top players will play Super Rugby for the Bulls; during the second half, some of them will play for the Springboks. I suggest we list all players in this section that are contracted to the Blue Bulls, but also indicate if they play at national team level, at Super Rugby level, at Currie Cup level or at Vodacom Cup level only.

With the current format, I think the only way possible would be to have some kind of indicator. Something like:

Props
  Dean Greyling (NT)
  Rayno Gerber (SR)
  Rossouw de Klerk (CC)
  Basil Short (VC)

Hooker
  Chiliboy Ralepelle (NT)
(NT) Represented South Africa in 2012(SR) Represented the  in Super Rugby in 2012(CC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Currie Cup rugby in 2012(VC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Vodacom Cup rugby in 2012

The indicator would show the highest level the player played at during the season and players would be sorted by position first, then this indicator, then surname.

However, an alternate representation could be:

 PropsNameNTSRCCVC  Dean Greyling                          Rayno Gerber                                      Rossouw de Klerk                                  Basil Short                                                 Hookers  Chiliboy Ralepelle

This could again be sorted by playing position, then level played, then surname.  Footnotes can be used if a player represented a different Super Rugby franchise than the main one affiliated with the union, etc. A template (which is a slight variation on {{rugby squad player}}) can be developed to simplify this.

Hello Zinnober, i don't quite understand this remark. Theer is nothing strange in providing the link to the german article (incidentally written by me), because, as the latest example Ettore Bastianini tends to prove, english speaking wikipedians seem to deliberately ignore other languages (), and alos because Petrov is indeed little known and bears a very common name, like John Smith, if it were. He was a very fine singer though, as the external link on Petrow will show. You should do something about Alain Lombard ((de), (fr) as well, he was a very famous French opera conductor and director in the 1970s, before sliding slowly down until being completely forgotten today. Cheers,  

Zinnober? Who? A mistake? At any rate the Opera Project page really isn't the place for leaving unexplained, cryptic links to foreign Wikipedias. Please respect the way the main page is formatted. If you want to say something to members of the project then use the Talk page. In any case if a singer is little known, except to you, then the thing to do is to start of the article yourself. The point of the 'Can you help' section is to suggest names that other people are likely to be interested in. It's not for some form of personal POV promotion. Regarding your point about English-speaking Wikipedians, has it occurred to you that a lot of them can't speak foreign languages?  -

About the other point  neither do i speak japanese or finnish, but whenever i write an article, i provide the links - if available - to those Wikis. It's not a matter of knowledge, it is - i am afraid - a matter of will.

Parkwells, yes, I went to the source you referred/linked to regarding other visitors to Monticello and they had this to say: These family members are not mentioned in Thomas Jefferson’s Farm Book(7) as being visitors to Monticello (The Farm Book does not appear to be a log of visitors, but lists an accounting of his plantations, e.g. livestock, land, crops, costs, and slaves.) 'Not a logbook of visitors.'

 IN DEFENSE OF THE JENNIFER O'NEILL ARTICLE, AND A NOTE TO ALL READERS: 

IN DEFENSE OF THE JENNIFER O'NEILL ARTICLE, AND A NOTE TO ALL READERS:

     This article has been """"tagged"""" at its beginning since one single Wikipedia editor,MikeWazowski, believes it to be objectionable and defective in three particular respects.      
     First, he finds the article to be defective in HIS opinion and reasons that it """"...relies on references to primary sources or sources affiliated with the subject, rather than references from independent authors and third-party publications."""" It should be noted that this article does contain some references to Jennifer O'Neill's 1999 autobiography Surviving Myself, which was published by William Morrow and Sons Publishing, New York. Apparently, MikeWazowski  does not consider one of the biggest publishing houses in America to be a reliable third-party publication source. The total absurdity of this position speaks for itself.
     Additionally, under Wikipedia policy guidelines, personal and official websites CAN be used as a source and as a citation.  See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Using_the_subject_as_a_self-published_source
     Secondly, MikeWazowski finds this article defective in that in HIS opinion this article contains  """"...wording that merely promotes the subject without imparting verifiable information.""""  The factual material in this article is accurate, and true and correct WITH citations.  MikeWazowski offers his conclusory general opinion that this article is simply Jennifer O'Neill (self-)promoting  without citation to a single example of it in the entire article.
     Third, MikeWazowski find this article defective in that in HIS opinion the article contains improper references to """"self-published sources.""""  Once again, he apparently consider her autobiography which was disseminated by a third party publishing house, William Morrow and Sons, New York, to be an """"unreliable"""" """"self-published source"""".
     Finally, the validity of these negative criticisms must be viewed in light of the source of the accusations in the case.  The reader only needs to go to the user talkpage for MikeWazowski to find it is filled with questions from numerous other editors to explain his edits, strike-outs, and deletion of entire pages and articles, which he simply totally ignores.  It is also significant that MikeWazowski has been invited to make corrections to any material he finds objectionable, but has refused to do so. 
      This fact can and should speak volumes, more than any words.   """,0
"""

(deindent) Not even wrong only if you don't understand what he's doing. These are all standard problems for the many millions of people who have tried to make sense of infinite arithmetic at some point in their lives.

The number  ...9997 in Archimedes' system is also known as the number -3, which almost is the """"largest prime"""" in Ludwig's order on the Plutonian integers. You would think ...99998 might be the right one, but that's -2, and it is clearly divisible by two. So maybe ...9997 should be thought of as divisible by three, but dividing by three is different than dividing by two in base-10, because two divides 10 and three does not. So maybe that's a self-consistent definition in a 10-based infinite arithmetic with the order he chooses. Maybe not. I don't know, but neither do you, and to pretend otherwise is insincere. It's not incoherent, just original, and incomplete. The methodology is obviously many, many, painstaking infinite digit calculations, with the extra burden that the rules keep shifting whenever he finds an inconsistency. 

The reason he claims transcendental numbers are incomplete is because, if you accept that the integers are Plutonian, the real numbers are only """"finitely"""" wide. Normally, a real number can be thought of as a map from Z->digits, giving it's digit sequence. Unfortunately, Plutonium's """"Z"""" is just as large as the real numbers, so that a real number is really only a sequence of digits, because a sequence in this view cannot be viewed as a map from Z-> digits. In this view Z is larger than any sequence (the integers are """"uncountable""""). So the real numbers have """"gaps"""" which would be filled by reciprocals of infinite integers. But large integers don't have reciprocals in Plutonium's system, because he can't make any sense out of bi-infinite sequences:

Numbers like ... 999123.3333..... are not allowed because you can't do multiplication digit by digit.

So he doesn't think of the real numbers as containing the integers, he has two classes of numbers the """"Adic integers"""" which are infinite to the left and finite to the right, and the """"real numbers"""" which are infinite to the right and finite to the left, and it is illegal to add an adic integer and a real number.

The reason Archimedes Plutonium keeps working on the Riemann Hypothesis is because he feels he can say something new about the distribution of primes because he has knowledge of some infinite ones. This is because he can ask questions like """"if I choose an infinite integer at random, digit by digit, do I get a prime number?"""" Those sorts of questions have analytic counterparts about real numbers (complete numbers really). He probably feels the twin-prime conjecture is false, becuase, what's the chance that the infinite integer ....321113 and ....321115 are both prime? He also probably feels that an infinite even number can never be the sum of two primes. These last two statements are both based on my own thinking. He might thinks that there are very many primes at infinity, I don't know for sure.

Look, I am not saying his mathematical musing are not cranckish. But recognize that Archimedes Plutonium is to cranck science as Isaac Newton is to mainstream science. He has seen futher than others even though he stands on the shoulders of no-one. """,0

Neither does Dmitry Medvedev, Shimon Peres, David Cameron, Stephen Harper, Julia Gillard, Bronisław Komorowski, Jalal Talabani or dozens of other world leaders. How about some consistency... B.

 CNN Article - Got some citations for you. Please Help Me with the Unreliably Sourced Statement 

Hi. I saw your comments on the CNN talk page in which you claimed - in response to another user's claims that CNN had a liberal bias - """"Please add citations to back your claims. Avoid using weasel words when making claims."""" Well, here are some peer-reviewed, scholarly articles to back that claim:
>Jeffrey N. Weatherly, et al, “Perceptions of Political Bias in the Headlines of Two Major News Organizations,” Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics (2007) (12), 91 at p. 97 (finding that “Overall, participants . . . rated the headlines from CNN as significantly more liberal than those from FOX News. . . . CNN tilted more to the left than did FOX News. The conclusion that CNN’s headlines were perceived as more liberal than FOX News’, rather than FOX News’ headlines’ being perceived as more conservative than CNN’s, is supported by the finding that overall, the headlines from FOX News were rated slightly on the liberal side of neutral. If FOX News’ headlines had been perceived as biased toward the conservative viewpoint, then the overall ratings should have exceeded 50 percent.”)
>Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, Harvard University, & Project for Excellence in Journalism, “The Invisible Primary – Invisible No Longer: A First Look at Coverage of the 2008 Presidential Campaign,” p. 32  (noting that “The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates—by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral.”)
Please note that at the beginning of the CNN article (fourth paragraph down), the following statement appears: """"Among the general public, CNN has a more centrist perception.” The source for this proposition is FAIR, FAIR being a “progressive media criticism organization” whose “target invariably is bias on the right” . Needless to say, FAIR is not a reliable source. Will you please help me to get rid of this statement on the CNN article?

When the word """"Catalán"""" appears for the first time. In 1115, mentioned by an italian cronist.
When Catalonia became really independent?. By the Treaty of Corbeil, in 1248 when the French Monarchie gave up his rights on the Marca Hispanica castles.
Where was the idealised hero of Barcelona Wifredo el Vellosos born  in France, in Carcassone.
Was Roger of Lauria, the """"great catalonian hero"""" catalán. Not at all, he was born in Lauria (Italy) and served the King of Aragón.

Were there a Principado of Cataluña?. No, never. It is a Prince of Gerona, but never was Cataluña a Principado.
Stop trying to be what you are not. You may be proud of some other things, but neither you have ever been a Kingdom, not a Principado, nor you have had a clasic literature in catalán.
Catalán is a dialect steaming from latin, exactly the same than castillian, provenzal, italian or valenciano. The difffrence is that, while Valenciano had a dictionary  (Liber Elegantiarum), clasic romans (Tirant lo Blanch), traslations of the Bible to Valenciano (Bonifacio Ferrer), etc.. (ALL THEM MENTIONING BLACK ON WHITE THAT THEY WROTE IN VALENCIANO LANGUAGE), the Catalans had nothing, and this is way the catalans desperately need to try to absorb the Valenciano, becuase in catalan there is nothing to show.

Poorly written Native American section

I want to lay out the major problemsin terms of structure and clarityafflicting the Native American controversy paragraph. As I show below, this inept writing serves to obscure the controversy surrounding her claim to Native American ancestry, which was the most-covered issue in her 2012 Senate Campaign.  

Topic sentence

Competently-written paragraphs have clear topic sentences that state the main point of the paragraph. The """"topic sentence"""" of the current, incompetently written paragraph on the Native American controversy is as follows: """"In April 2012, the Boston Herald sparked a campaign controversy when it reported that Association of American Law Schools (AALS) directories from 1986 to 1995 listed Warren as a minority professor."""" 

This topic sentence is unclear; a reader who reads it would not see what the controversy was about. Being listed as a minority is not controversial. The issue is that Warren 1) listed herself in a 2) minority-recruitment directory for law schools, on the basis of 3) undocumented claims to Native American ancestry. A competently written topic sentence would convey those three main points. Here is an example of such a topic sentence: """"In April 2012, the Boston Herald sparked a campaign controversy when it noted that Warren had listed herself in a directory of minority law professors, used by law schools for recruitment purposes, despite the fact that she lacked any documented minority ancestry."""" That competently-written topic sentence states the controversy in a nutshell. 

I am willing to entertain any number of alternative topic sentences, including those that are unduly favorable to Warren. (I've given up on truly achieving NPOV for this article.) But I am not willing to abide unclear writing.   

'native ancestry'

The current paragraph states that Warren's """"opponent Scott Brown speculated that she had fabricated a native ancestry to gain advantage in employment."""" At this point, the paragraph has not stated that she claimed to be Native American, so it is not clear what type of ancestry the term """"native ancestry"""" refers to. I have tried to replace """"native ancestry"""" with """"Native American ancestry,"""" but have been repeatedly reverted.   

'Brown attacked Warren's ancestry'
The current paragraph states that Scott Brown issued attack ads that """"referred to Warren's ancestry."""" Whether made out of incompetence or malice, this statement constitutes a BLP violation. The statement indicates that Brown attacked Warren because of her ancestry or race. In reality, he attacked her for (allegedly) lying about her race to get ahead in the employment market.   """,0

Alright. First to your analysis. Information darwinism is the opposition to pig-headedness. Bring me the right arguments and I will be convinced - as anyone should be. But failing to do so you cannot convince me. You cannot convince me by begging, threats, bullying, bribing and whatever else you can think of. Only the argument is what counts. What's """"right"""" is not defined by the mainstream opinion. If 2000 years ago, people largely figured slavery was the right thing, or that the earth was flat, or that violent computer games turn people into mass murderers, that doesn't make it anyhow right. The truth is not found by a demoscopic process, but instead, by an organic, darwinistic process that Information darwinism tries to understand and act in accordance with.

I do consider your thoughts on the subject flawed on a deeper level. Part of our problem to communicate is certainly because of the limitations of language. When we use words, and you understand certain words to have a different meaning than how I understand them (e.g. """"Force"""") then we can not engage in a proper dialogue without first sorting out the terminology required. So if you do find that I use a word in a different way than how you would use it, or anything else """"weird"""", request from me a definition of the term. This is purely the linguistic barrier that must be overcome.

Now to some items that I seem to have brushed over:

The data suggest rape victims suffer more psychological trauma than other victims of assault. 

What data? By what standards? Someone beaten into a bloody pulp, robbed, or whatever, may well suffer more severe psychological trauma than someone who is victim to """"rape"""" by lax standards. These are problems rooted in terminology. If you want us to waste literally weeks to figure out the truthfulness of the statement """"rape victims are off worse than regular assault victims"""" then I have to say, no thanks. Because as a categorical statement, I can tell you right away - that is false.

You claim to want rape treated simply as assault in one instance and then go and suggest it should be a special form of assault. (which it is)

It is a (special) form of assault. That does not mean it needs to be treated with different standards than other, specicific (! better terminology?) forms of assault. Assault with a gardening rake is also a special form of assault, that doesn't mean it has to be treated fundamentally different from assault with a pitchfork. Again, terminology appears to be the problem.

Having rape as a separate category of crime allows for special systems to be in place for victims and court systems.

This is not something that I have """"brushed over"""". That is what you appear to be in favor of. I disagree strongly. If someone's victim of a criminal offense, he should not be treated """"specially"""" - that is, not like other victims of criminal offenses. Otherwise you are just asking for rape victims being ridiculed by society / police / legal system while non-sexual assault victims get treated fairly. I claim that only if there is no legal difference between sexual assault and non sexual assault, that sexual assault victims (and perpetrators) can be treated fairly as everyone would wish.

Who do you actually propose giving these weapons to?

How exactly is it my job to decide who should get weapons? I would assume, similiar standards to car ownership and gun ownership should be applied. Both cars and guns are extremely dangerous in the wrong hands - lethal weapons you might say - but both serve an useful purpose: Security and Transportation. I do not think that anyone should be denied the right to own a handgun. And I certainly do not credit a state institution with the rights to decide who gets to own one and who doesnt. But what exactly are you asking me for? Elaborate the legislature of my dreams? I don't see sense in asking me that.

Well, there you have it. Basically all of the issues I have """"brushed over"""" in your mind come down to linguistic issues, terminology and the such. The answers are irrelevant as they can never be given without a ludicrous amount of detail given to the questions. I've known this - This is one of the underlying problems that you have - You fail to identify different uses of terminology and resolve them accordingly. But I would suspect that we have even deeper still disagreements on very many things than just the attitude of resolving conflicts of terminology. This is why I suspect your methodology of thinking is deeply flawed - rather than my own. And that is why I tried to tell you """"You first need to get your shit straight"""" before we can argue on actual subjects like rape legislature and social consequences thereof in a productive manner.

I assume you will misunderstand many of the things I said in this post right",0

  Dear Administrator,
 this morning I edited Derrick Bell's page and added a link from a NYT article that state that one of his famous essays, The Trade Spacers is considered antisemitic by many people.  A few hours later, the addition was deleted.  I posted it again, and noticed that another user did the following:  
 19:14, 8 March 2012‎ HJ Mitchell (talk | contribs)‎ m . . (14,795 bytes) (0)‎ . . (Protected Derrick Bell: Violations of the biographies of living persons policy

I found this action abusive as Bell has been dead for months.  I proceeded to go to this user talk page and posted the following:
   I find it very interesting that what you continuously delete is the comment that Space Traders is considered an antisemitic essay, even though there was a link to the original article from NYT where it was discussed and prominent Professors like Dershowitz have discussed the antisemitism in that work. There is no vandalism involved and to be honest it is arrogant and totalitarian to just lock the page under false pretenses because you disagree with people's philosophy. The reason that people have started shunning Wikipedia is exactly attitudes like that to prevent a free flow of facts. If someone had written about the opinions of the faculty that Bell left the deanship at Oregon Law School because he was going to be fired since he spend all the time lecturing away from the school, I could understand that. But there are articles about his antisemitism. Bell's page does not even include his racist comments about Clarence Thomas, """"The choice of Clarence Thomas replicates the slave masters' practice of elevating slaves willing to mimic the masters' views."""" Also, Prioryman, name calling people you disagree with """"dunderheads"""" really diminishes Wikipedia and perpetuates the impression that most administrators are bigots.

The user not only did not have the courtesy of replying to my comment, but deleted it.  I posted the following later:
9 March 2012 (UTC)Dear HJ, do you represent the Wikipedia censorship brigade? I do not usually engage in conversations here so please let me know what I did wrong and you deleted my comment that there are NYT article's about Bell's antisemitism, as well as questioning why you locked the page since Bell is DEAD. I am a simple person, the type of people that Wikipedia was supposed to inspire to all contribute but totalitarian behavior like the one yo have exhibited both at Bell's page and here are what sours people with Wikipedia. Is not it bigoted behavior for Prioryman to call people that have opposing views """"dunderheads""""? I am sorry but ypur behavior, as well as prioryman's, along with your sarcastic tone in history is what diminishes Wikipedia and makes you equal to the totalitarian freepers. The facts are the facts. Is not the Gray Lady a sufficiently legitimate source?

Then that user """"pressed the bell"""" so I will be blocked. I may have been naive and thought that senior members in Wikipedia have these talk pages to discuss the issues. I was not trying to harass or attack anyone.  To the contrary, I have been totally respectful of everybody. However, if the behavior that I encountered today is the typical behavior of the administrators/senior staff, then it is really sad that this great endeavor has degenerated to  a site where only political correct speech is allowed. Or it may be because HJ lives in England where free speech is not allowed. As Americans, that's one of our liberties that is cherished and should be defended. Free speech is what makes us different from Europe and has allowed intellectual thinking and academic research to flourish, instead of remaining stagnant as it happens in Europe.  I am really surprised by this whole behavior. Is this high school, or what? We are all adults and we should engage in conversation, not call mom when we do not like something. My ten year old does this, not an adult.""",0

 I disagree that Wikipedia is """"soft"""" on pedophiles. In fact, pedophiles are the only people not allowed to edit the """"encyclopedia that everyone can edit""""; that's a simple fact.

 By the way, though the very incarnation of evil, Hitler was a masterful, brilliant leader. Most of the most notorious bad guys in history were. That's part of how they could accomplish so much and still be so evil. Kinda sad when you think about it...

"""

 General editing practice - not about eu-FEDS 

I know I just said """"keep it on the article talk page"""", but I'm going to respond here separately on a couple of things that don't bear directly on that article, to avoid cluttering up that space with things that aren't useful to other editors.

Have you in fact read the Wikipedia guidelines? I'm not trying to be snarky; it's an honest question, because you seem to have a few misunderstandings about the process here.

First, if you feel that anything in an article is inappropriate, whether it's the original text or a recent change, you can edit it. You don't have to ask me to """"reverse the changes"""". There are still rules of editing etiquette that apply, such as not just ping-ponging changes back and forth (see WP:3RR), and being willing to discuss differences of opinion on talk pages like this. But no one owns the article - not me, not you; no one has veto power, except for administrators; and there's no reason to ask anyone in particular to make changes for you. It's not as if I wiped out your text forever: it's all in the article history, which is pretty easy to use.

Second, WP articles are not to be written based on what you or anyone else may think are """"very logical reasons"""" to support a theory. It is fine to explain a particular person's or group's point of view on the subject, pro or con, as long as it's attributed clearly; but the encyclopedia itself is not in the business of saying what makes sense, and the purpose of the talk pages is not to argue about whether a theory is correct. Debates that might be very productive in the pages of a scientific journal are less so in an encyclopedia. This is particularly important when the theory has not yet reached wide acceptance as a scientific consensus - and I don't think you're claiming that it has. That is why I don't think the link from, for instance, SIV was appropriate; by stating that argument in the voice of the encyclopedia itself, it made it sound as if most researchers agree that this is a likely explanation. Again, see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view - one of the absolutely crucial WP rules.

Third, on a more trivial note, it is basic WP etiquette to log in under your username before you make edits or comments (so people can see who is doing what); to use the standard """"~~~~"""" signature for your comments; and, when responding to a specific paragraph on a talk page, to indent your response immediately below it with """":"""" rather than copying and pasting the previous comment elsewhere.""",0
"""

 Census 

I noticed you have reverted some population numbers citing no source.  While they definitely need a source, the census numbers are available at http://factfinder2.census.gov.  Rather than revert to old, outdated information, why not simply add the new source?  It's going to be a generic source anyway because the new FactFinder2 site doesn't allow you to bookmark the pages, so you have to find the page you want every time.  As for the New Albany article, I'm not sure what the problem is with either source you removed.  """"ThisWeekNews"""" is a local newspaper website for that area (see Contact Us); it's not like city-data.com or another site that merely collects stories or data from somewhere else, so it seems to fit reliability to me.  Interestingly enough, if you go to the bottom of the main page for that site, there is also a link to county-level census data from the Columbus Dispatch.   """,0

"""==Expanding sections==
Hello, I was wondering if there were some users out there that could maybe assist with the expansion of this Kingdom Hearts article. I've been spending the past week trying to cite and expand sections as best I can, but I've run into a few walls that I was hoping others might be able to help with.

The development section is missing information on any actual development of the game itself. There's some info in the Kingdom Hearts (series)#Development section, but it isn't cited. If anyone can find some developer interviews about the game that could be sourced, that would help expand that section.

The manga section is missing information on the Japanese publication/serialization.

There are a few statements that I tagged as citation needed that I wasn't able to find any sources for. Admittedly, I wasn't specifically looking for those information, but nothing came up in my general searches.

I'm currently trying to find the proper in-game dialog to cite some of the information in the setting and story sections. If any body would like to help, it would be appreciated.

One last thing, if anybody can get information from or has the Kingdom Hearts Ultimania, Kingdom Hearts Ultimania Revised Edition, and/or Kingdom Hearts Series Ultimania α ~Introduction of Kingdom Hearts II~, that could help expand and source the """"Development"""" and """"Versions and merchandise"""" sections.

I'll keep trying to find information as best I can, but I'm having a hard time finding the appropriate information in English, and my Japanese is limited. Any help would of course be appreciated, but if the list above can be addressed, I think it would greatly help in getting this article to """"Good Article"""" status and hopefully eventually """"Featured Article"""" status. ( )

GameFAQs has a script and journal text. I can't help you much on the other stuff, as most of the interviews I find are only relevant to the later games and aren't sourced very well. I commend you for your efforts to make a good article.  

Thanks for the game script link, that made getting the dialog much easier than trying to transcribe it from videos. I tired to find appropriate citations and I feel that the general story is cited well-enough, but others may disagree and add as they see fit.I found a little bit of info for some things and added a reference for one item needing citation, but am still looking for the others. After looking at the Kingdom Hearts#Setting section, I think it may need a rewrite. I think the people from the peer review will say that it is too much like game-guide information instead of encyclopedic material. I'll try to paraphrase the information there in a separate edit to make any reverts easier, in case other editors are unhappy with the result. ( )
Great work overall. On """"Setting"""", I wrote that section to emulate the style of Final Fantasy VII's section, but I don't mind your complete rewrite.  

Thanks for the copy edit, I wasn't too happy with the rewrite I did, it looks better now. I edited the """"Reception"""" section to create a table of the ratings so that way they weren't just listed one after another. If others think that it takes away from the article feel free to revert it.I'm thinking of doing a rewrite of the """"Characters"""" section, the first two paragraphs read more like gameplay information. There is also no mention of the villains. I'll do it in a separate edit again, in case it doesn't turn out well. ( )
Wow, finally some work being done. Thanks, Guyinblack25, for initiating this. I've had this article on my """"To FA"""" list for some time but I never really got around to it. Anyway, I think I'm going to give it a thorough copyedit before adding new stuff.  

Thanks. Please do, because I keep finding grammar edits or weird sentences after some of the rewrites I've done, I try to remember to fix them but they slip my mind. If you're looking for new content to add, there is obviously the list above, but I also think the introduction could use some expanding if the article is to make further. After you made your revisions to the article, perhaps we should send it to the peer review to see what else can be done. ( )

A poor start, sorry. The author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table. First of all, no common two-nations table is possible (patent nonsense). Second, I object the following:
the passage from the Russian table speaking of the Kievan Rus. As someone suggested earlier, that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between Kievan Rus and modern Russia. This is the main disputed claim (commented enough in other articles), unacceptable for me and several other Ukrainian and Belarusian users
Regardless of any """"Ukrainian military"""" table, none of them may include the Red Army. This army was not only irrelevant to any of Ukrainian states (with very formal post-WWII exception), but also significantly anti-Ukrainian. For instance, Red Army units widely participated in war crimes against Ukrainian population and anti-Soviet guerillas. Creation of the """"Ukrainian"""" table here has been a mere discussion trick not supported by all Ukrainian users. For instance, see earlier AlexPU's passage on """"trading the truth""""

Speedy deletion of Wei Weiguo
 A tag has been placed on Wei Weiguo requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

WP:OVERLINKING policy on Wikipedia:Generally, a link should appear only once in an article, but if helpful for readers, links may be repeated in infoboxes, tables, image captions, footnotes, and at the first occurrence after the lead. If an article of 1,000 lines has a link repeated on line 600 there is no objection to keep te second link. A link repeated three times in the same paragraph is just plain overkill. Any undesirable future edits (removal of templates) should be adressed by closely monitoring your watchlist, not placing an excessive amount of duplicate links.
 ...is to keep everything in a format that is uniform with everything... In my opinion, that's just impossible. Imperial versus metric, inch versus foot and inch, alphabetic versus historical order, etc. Using other units for Railgauge templates than its corresponding categories and article titles makes it harder to recognise a particular Railgauge when editing or reading text, especially for people accustomed to metric systems.

The Handbook of Data on Organic Compounds, Third edition (Ref. 7) and the Combined Chemical Dictionary (Ref. 8) were important sources. Other useful sources of physical property data on organic compounds are listed in Refs. 9-19.  The values in the table for the normal boiling point and the melting point that are accompanied with uncertainties (in parenthesis) have been critically evaluated using the NIST ThermoData Engine (TDE, Ref. 20), designed to implement the dynamic data evaluation concept (Refs. 21-24).  This concept requires large electronic databases capable of storing essentially all relevant data known to date with detailed descriptions of metadata and uncertainties.  The combination of these electronic databases with expert-system software, designed to automatically generate recommended property values based on available experimental and predicted data, leads to the ability to produce critically evaluated data dynamically, 'to order.' The uncertainties listed are combined expanded uncertainties (level of confidence, approximately 95 %) representing the most comprehensive measure of the overall data reliability (Refs, 25-28).""""
So this suggests that some temperature values in the table are automatically derived but as I say, the """"25"""" or """"2.5"""" is a raised, reduced-sized font, not parenthesized.

Note that if the page is an appropriate topic for an article, it would take normal English name punctuation, which means the middle initial would take a period, i.e., Robert A. Foster.  

Deletion of International Association of Physics Students
Hello! You deleted the article for the International Association of Physics Students based on copyright infringement from the webpage iaps.info. It did seem that way, as the article was mostly copied from iaps.info, but it was done by the Executive Committee of IAPS, so we would like to ask you to reinstate the article. If it is needed we can put a statement on the homepage allowing wikipedia to copy written content from our page or something like that. Thanks!—Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 
Hi P.O.E. I have taken the liberty of adding a section header to your post and adding your signature; on talk pages (but not in articles), you should sign your posts so that people can follow who wrote what.Regarding the above page, there's a few matters you should understand. We cannot use copyrighted text simply because we have been given permission. Instead all of our text must be freely licensed so that our end users can take the material and use it themselves under our licenses. Please see Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials. The upshot is that for us to use the material—which means allowing our readers to use it and modify it even for commercial purposes—we have to have a verified release of the material. To do that, you can follow either of the methods listed at the page. Specifically, please look at the subsection of the page entitled Granting us permission to copy material already online.If you do that, it will take care of a first hurdle but I don't think you should bother because the text itself is not appropriate for an article it its current form. This is an encyclopedia. Can you imagine a proper encyclopedia articles saying things like """"We support our members...""""? What you should do is start from scratch and try to write a proper encyclopedia article that cites to reliable third party sources and contains neutral language. ([[User tal",0

 Not happy 

I am not happy with the tone of this comment, """"You seem to be confused"""".  
Firstly, are you seriously saying that as """"Product Manager, VisualEditor team"""" you are completely unable to give a useful answer to a question about what the plans for mathematics rendering are or what progress has been made against those plans?  Does mathematics rendering really have nothing whatsoever to do with Visual Editor?  Or is there some other reason why you prefer not to answer the question?
Secondly, if you wanted to be helpful, instead of airily alluding to """"the volunteers who maintain that extension"""" you might have said who they are.  Who are the people to whom, in your opinion, I should address that question, please?
Thirdly, if you really wanted to be helpful, and I am finding it hard to avoid the conclusion that you do not, you might even have volunteered to pass the question on to the approriate people rather than batting it back so unhelpfully.
Once again, if you engage constructively with the volunteer mathematics editor community, it is likely to prove of benefit to the project.  So far I'm seeing less of a serious attempt to engage and too much petty point-scoring.    """,0

If I called someone a """"hag"""" or """"on their death bed,"""" then you would have a point. But unfortunately, nothing occurred here except your inability to properly manage your job at Wikipedia. Your ignorance of my attempts at mediating the arguments over the Caisson (Asian architecture) article and past attempts in helping Mattisse over drapetomania and psychiatry is disappointing. I would hope that someone of your position would accumulate a background of knowledge before taking such drastic attempts of warning and blocking other members. Also, your arbitrary decisions while ignoring evidence of the other party's violations is repulsive for me to see on a site such as Wikipedia.

the information i edited comes from my personal relationship with the living person.
all published sources that your information comes from are no longer accurate.
i checked the BLP page and the verifiability standard makes the edits i am trying to put through difficult to impossible.
because you are a far more experienced editor, i ask you: how do we work through this impasse?
  
Unfortunately, what you're describing is original research, which is against Wikipedia policies  especially in regards to biographies of living people.  So, you'll have to find a published, reliable source that has this information in it to add it to the article.  Finally, it sounds like you have a clear conflict of interest, so you may wish to avoid the article altogether. dude?/dude.

"Hi Osmond, Please understand, I really like your images. I'd love to have all of them added to articles. I think the collection itself is notable and may merit an WP article itself. But WP is a sometimes difficult place to get started contributing because they have so many different guidelines and different editors interpret them different ways. WP requires that when images are contributed the contributor has to be able to demonstrate that they fit the open source or Creative Commons licensing policy. 

 Because you are the uploader of the images, your simple declaration of their provenance, that the images are all pre-1923 and are of the people you say they are, may not be sufficient to meet WP guidelines. I truly believe that many of them in fact are of the individuals stated. The likenesses are very clear, though in a few instances, less so. I'd really like to help you get the images accepted as valid. They are a wonderful contribution to the historic lore about the individuals who they are supposed to be pictures of.

 I'm sorry, I'm not near Kearny, Missouri this week, or I'd love to see the collection. Is that where you're from?

 I'm not the final arbiter of all of this. I suggest we get some input from other editors on how to validate that the images are genuine and their provenance is proven. To start, this will probably require you to provide some third-party sources to establish that the images were taken before 1923, or proof that the studio on the image closed before 1923, or other evidence. Then you will have to provide some third-party opinion that the images are of the individuals taken. Or you'll have to make available other evidence that the person's names were written on the images. The articles you named may be helpful if you can provide source info, links, or publication info. 

 I'm totally on your side. I'd like to find a way to establish the authenticity of the images. But you also have to understand that as the owner of the images, if you can clearly establish the authenticity of the images, you could be greatly rewarded financially. So you're not a disinterested person when it comes to proving the that pictures are of the people you say they are. Because this is a complex issue, due diligence is required.

 Give me a day or two to explore the proper way to get other editors input into this discussion. There's a formal process for this kind of thing and I'm not sure what it is. —  (talk to me) (what I've done)",0

So  I'm sure you're a really nice guy, but it looks like you're adding the tags not because of the the article needing a cleanup and reorganizing but just because the color scheme of the column boxes are not the color scheme of original boxes and are matching the Roc Nation colors and of the logo.

That is just plain out bias it not my fault that other people do not do this when creating a record label singles discography, which they can and you have not seen one with a color scheme on them. All I have done is put the 3 basic colors Black, Red and White of Roc Nation on a original Wikipedia column to distinguish it from other record label singles discography and the other names of the artists that are on the article, because the article would grow as those and more artist release more singles and songs, which makes it appropriate and not inappropriate as you have stated for you reason of adding cleanup/reorganize tags. Once again all I did is add 3 basic colors to the original columns Black, Red and White which anybody can do on any other record label discographies on Wikipedia, but I may have been the first to do this new color scheme styling of a record label singles discography that does not mean you just add tags that are not meant to be on a specific article that is formatted, organized and written like any other record label singles discographies on Wikipedia and is fully verified.

What constitutes vandalism is the repeated removal of large sections of text- multiple paragraphs at a time- from sections such as """"Background"""". Furthermore, it would be more appropriate to move the two languages you continue to cite to an """"Administrative Languages"""" blurb, and include the rest of the languages beneath that in a blurb called, """"Other Languages"""", or something to that effect.

Test
Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s–1970s was a group retrospective exhibition of social documentary photography held at the Art Gallery of South Australia from 28 May to 1 August 2010.Art Gallery of South Australia Exhibitions Candid Camera website

Candid Camera had its roots in Six Photographers, a groundbreaking exhibition held in Sydney in May 1955, which concentrated on what was still a relatively new development in Australian photography and featured the work of Max Dupain, David Potts, Axel Poignant, Gordon Andrews, Kerry Dundas and Hal Missingham.Robinson, Julie """"Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s–1970s"""" Art Gallery of South Australia exhibition catalogMcDonald, Patrick """"The Way We Were"""" The Advertiser, 20 May 2010 AdelaideNow websiteNewton, Gael """"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988"""" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055) The work of the first three of these artists is also represented in Candid Camera. Six Photographers, an artist-initiated show that featured 200 images at a time when exhibitions of personal photographic work were rare, was regarded as sufficiently influential for the Art Gallery of New South Wales to commemorate it with a show of the same name featuring the same six photographers, more than 50 years after it had first been presented.Newton, Gael """"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988"""" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055)Newton, Gael """"Silver And Grey: Fifty Years Of Australian Photography 1900-1950"""" Angus & Robertson, 1980 (ISBN 0207141096)Art Gallery of New South Wales Exhibitions Archive AGNSW websiteAllen, Christopher """"Decisive Moments"""", The Australian, 27 February 2010 The Australian website This second version of Six Photographers featured 29 images, many of them shown in 1955, and concentrated on works from the same period (the late forties through to the mid-fifties).

Candid Camera, while about half the size of the 1955 Sydney exhibition, covered a significantly wider range of artists and looks not just at the foundations of Australian social documentary photography but at the era that curator Julie Robinson clearly regards as its golden age – the fifties, sixties and seventies.

In line with the statements issued by the six photographers group, Candid Camera featured “images which appear unposed, spontaneous, or with their subjects captured unaware”. Though the majority of the photos in the exhibition (more than 80 in total) were taken in Australia, images by Australian photographers working overseas were also included.Allen, Christopher """"Unguarded Moments"""", The Australian, 17 July 2010 The Australian websiteEmmett, Patrick """"Candid Camera"""" ABC Television interview, originally broadcast on Stateline, 28 May 2010 ABC website Subjects included youth subcultures, newly arrived migrants, nuns, a number of prime ministers (though not all were in office at the time of the photo), musicians such as Bon Scott of AC/DC, and ordinary people in everyday settings: at work, at the beach and at bus stops.

Photographers represented in Candid Camera included Max Dupain, David Moore, Jeff Carter, Max Pam, Robert McFarlane, Mervyn Bishop, Rennie Ellis, Carol Jerrems and Roger Scott and a number of others. Of those named, all have work held in the permanent collection of National Gallery Of Australia. Mervyn Bishop is the only Aboriginal Australian to have been included, and though his work has primarily been in New South Wales, Robert McFarlane was the only photographer to be born in South Australia. In this last regard, Candid Camera was very different to Century In Focus, an earlier large-scale photographic survey curated by Robinson, which dealt only with images taken in South Australia.Robinson,",0
"Who has told you that you have to share the titles to modern states? And stop with this FIFA thing, they just mention the titles in the confederations' pages, since no Czechoslovakian or USSR confederation exists anymore, but this in not an argument for naming Slovakia and the Czech Republic as two of the European champions. On the other hand, UEFA (which runs the tournament) lists the winners as they are with their old names and if you look at their page they don't name any of the current states successor of the former. Additionally, you are the only one in the history of the template that you insist on this version and you have reverted all the other editors and you don't take part to any discussion. You don't own any article to be against to the other's common opinion. Czechoslovakia and USSR were the champions and you have no right to add Slovakia or Russia in the template, since there is no need to do so, just like you did in Germany, where it should be a reference like that you have added.

2. I would stay with """"Academia Gustaviana""""; this is really how it was called, and the Charles addition only obscures (cf. Piirimäe & Co.)

3. I would always transliterate Jurjev, both in German and in English; why did you change it to Yuryev?  The point is, in almost all literature on the field, and especially on the imprints of books that are likely to be read (Mattiesen, Acta et Commentationes etc.), it is spelled Jurjev, and thus people would look for that.

'Fraid not. This used to happen a while back; either pages for both British English and American English would exist, or more often editors would fight to move a page from one to the other. In June 2005, the Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee ruled that """"when either of two styles is acceptable, it is inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change. For example, with respect to British spelling as opposed to American spelling, it would only be acceptable to change from American spelling to British spelling if the article concerned a British topic."""" So since an enterprising Brit got there first, American English words like millimeter and liter redirect to the British English equivalent, but the opposite is true for colour or carburettor.

In the case of geologic map, an American was the first to create the article, so you have to edit that page. However, here's a few suggestions of what you can do:
The text in bold in the opening line should reflect the title of the article. Therefore, since geological map redirects to the page, you can change the first sentence to read """"A geologic map or geological map is a special-purpose map made to show subsurface geological features.""""
If there's a difference between U.S. and U.K. maps, I'd split the two into separate sections after the opening paragraph, and detail the differences for each (re-ordering the page as I'd done with this edit). If there's no difference, I'd just remove the specific references to the United States as being unnecessary, and expand on what's there.
You can also provide links to British geological maps if such a resource exists, as has already been done for USGS maps.

An explanation of the style ruling can be found at Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Disputes over style issues and Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English, or if you're really bored you can read the original case at Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Jguk, which concerned and edit war over the use of BC or BCE for Biblical dates.

"""As the Chinese Civil War ended, the communist party took control of Mainland China and founded the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. The Kuomintang (and the Republic of China) retreated to Taiwan. 
Though fighting, including the invasion of several coastal islands by the Communists (with both successes and failures), the bombing of Shanghai and other coastal cities by the Republic of China Air Force, as well as a guerilla campaign waged by remaining Kuomintang forces in southwest China, would continue for the next several years, by the time of the Korean War the lines of control were sharply drawn: the Communist-led People's Republic of China government in Beijing controlled most of mainland China, while the Kuomintang-led Republic of China government, now in Taipei, controlled the island of Taiwan, some surrounding islands, and a number of islands off the coast of Fujian. This stale-mate was enforced with the assistance of the United States government, which, after the start of the Korean War, changed from a policy of abandoning Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang regime to the Communists, to protecting Taiwan against an invasion from the mainland, in the First Taiwan Strait Crisis.
Until the 1990s, both governments contended to be the sole legitimate government of China. With the fighting largely over, the major battleground became the diplomatic. Before the 1970s, few foreign governments recognised the People's Republic of China. The first governments to recognise it as the government of China were Soviet bloc countries, members of the non-aligned movement, and the United Kingdom (1950). The catalyst to change came in 1971, when the United Nations General Assembly expelled representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek by refusing to recognise their accreditations as representatives of China. Recognition for the People's Republic of China soon followed from most other governments, including the United States. The Republic of China continued to complete with the People's Republic of China to be recognised as the legitimate government of China.
Since the 1990s, however, a rising movement of for formal recognition of Taiwanese independence has made the political status of Taiwan the dominant issue, replacing the debate about the legitimate government of China. One significant opinion in Taiwan is that the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are both sovereign, thus forming """"two Chinas"""", or """"one China, one Taiwan"""". The current administration of Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian subscribes to this theory, and accordingly has largely abandoned the campaign for the Republic of China to be recognised as the sole legitimate government of China. Instead, it is campaigning for the Republic of China to join the United Nations as representative of its effective territory - Taiwan and nearby islands - only.

I concur with the above analysis, as I have already said before. The crux of the above issue simply refers to the fact that Nicky Bird wrote that in Beever's book """"Statistics proliferate, and are unverifiable"""", and the text inserted into the Wikipedia article said that this same estimate """"has been questioned by Nicky Bird"""". As noted, at one point Nicky Bird's article was directly quoted so that readers could understand his viewpoint in his own words. YMB29 could possibly have been sanctioned for many things, but I still can't understand how an indefinite ban for misrepresentation was justified. I wonder if YMB29's ban can be reduced to """"time served""""?  """,0

I do agree with you, KimvdLinde, on ClothesFree being unacceptable.  Worse than being commercial, to me, is that it is a fad.  It's also saying what the movement is AGAINST instead of what it's FOR. It's also a euphemism for people too prudish to say out loud NUDE or NUDITY.
But then naturism and FKK are euphemisms, too, which encylopedias should avoid.  That's why, even though culturally I fit in more with """"naturists"""", I prefer the word nudist.  But I don't want to try to force the heading """"Nudism"""", by itself, on an unwilling group of Wikipedians.
The near perfect solution is the heading Social nudity or Nudity, social, isn't it?  Not a euphemism.  Even though it's not part of everyday speech, everyone instantly understands it, even quicker than they understand """"Citrus fruit"""".  My second choice would be Nudism, naturism, public nudity, and related practices, but that's a bit awkward.  """,0

 VfD on Jews by country 

This has not yet been submitted, and John would wig out if I submitted it myself. But I suggest you discuss this with others ASAP. I submit for your discussion with others that the author has little regard for misrepresenting the reliability of his figures, that the article gives a inferior knowledge than the Jewish population article does both of current and pass population tends. That the title is questionable in its honesty because as he shows at the top of the discussion page, following his prevuious pattern he should have used the less offensive title Judaism by country. And finally, the figures which he has published do not come from the listed reference pages as he infers but have been generated by himself by multiplying the est. 2005 populations by the rough percentage numbers for the countries.

As an example, being Australian I checked his figure for """"Australian Jews"""" in his words. None of his references give his figure of 100,452. Nor do any of the reputable sources pretend to give percise religious numbers to six or eight digit accuracy. In fact, checking the references you quickly discover that the 2001 Australian census gave the figure of 84,000 people who marked Judaism as their religion. That all other real estimates are based upon adjustments to that figure, as is discussed on this page I found by a Christian Research Association. I finally did a Google searchon his claimed figure to discover that Wikipedia is the only publication claiming such a figure. So I finally submit that this article relects badly upon Wikipedia and adds no meaningful value beyond the fine work already done in Jewish population. I am afraid this is seems to be another example of where this author has misrepresented certain details to create the illusion that he is scholarly NPOV author. 17:32, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0

Well, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:

In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. 

[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, """"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."""" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” 

Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. 

In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  

Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. 

If you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? 

I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? 

Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2",0

 And Now For Something Completely Different... 

I know you watch at least the Manson girls' articles, and I've dabbled a very little bit on them tonight. More so on Tex Watson, I revised some of the language as it pertains to conversion to Christianity. It seems like on criminal biographies, whenever this is mentioned, it has been worded as """"claimed to be a born-again Christian"""", but on non-criminal articles, it isn't couched in skepticism. I considered this, and I'm thinking that the """"claimed"""" wording adds a level of POV/judgment to the statement that wording of """"reported"""", """"wrote"""", """"published"""", etc., does not. I tried to reword it to lend a more neutral tone. Does this ring true to you?   """,0

"Sorry im not that knowledgable about that. What has been on the news this last month has been that sectors of the commuter network (the suburban train network) are being closed to convert them to the high speed network which will connect to guadalajara, im actually a bit confused and frustrated about this myself. And about the Priesmangoode design, what happened is Siemens original tender in the competition was the Velero, however it was given little interest due to lobbying by the Japanese with the E5 which at that point seemed like it would for sure become the winner. And Priestmangoode is only a designer so the need an actual manufacturing firm if they want their concept to come to life. They tried to interest other firms in Britain with the design but that didnt go anywhere. The Mexican transportaion secretary had already stated in the very beginging that a double decker system was preferable and since Siemens Velaro was pretty much already out of the compettition Siemens took back it's tender. Siemens then jointly (with priesmangoode) presented the concept to the Mexican transportation secretary that it could jointly manufacture the double decked Mercury design. But what really is the main aspect of why Siemens bid will probably win is because they are wiling to have the rolling stock fully manufactured in Mexico. This was in the July 2008 issue of Ferrocarril. In the end no real progress was really made in the final selection because then the Japanese and the French gave the same offer of manufacuring the trains in Mexico after Siemens came up with the concept so we still have to wait till 2011 to find out who wins / 69.235.193.67",0

Comments from an EVDL member
I'm forwarding these comments from an EVDL member:
 In the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:WPEVStartRun.png image, the relay is called Ry RL, but down in the text it's referred to as Ry RS.

 Just a question:  in the first part of the article, it talks about how the car should operate like an ICE vehicle, requiring the key to be turned to the Start position.  But then later in the article, it talks about breaking people of the habit of the pressing the accelerator pedal.  Maybe I'm one of those operators of older vehicles talked about, but I still press the accelerator when I start my car, whether it's fuel-injected or not.  So it seems like in the same description, it's trying to make the car start like an ICE vehicle, and yet not make it start like an ICE vehicle.

 The rectangular area called In Cab confused me.  At first, I thought it was some special kind of component.  Then I came to think that, no, it's not a component at all; it just represents """"somewhere inside the cab.""""  I think this latter view is the correct one, but I'd like text and/or picture to make it clearer.  I'm also not sure what the short blue wire between """"Run Buss"""" and """"Run:"""" is for.  My guess is that it's for other systems that are activated only when the ignition state has been latched, but the text doesn't make that clearand this also added to my confusion about the In Cab being a component.

 I don't know what this means:  """"The run buss is grounded when not in the run state, allowing additional interlocks to be included in order to ensure proper shutdown.""""   Where would these additional interlock be placed?  How would they ensure proper shutdown? 

 Finally, I had to think about diode D1.  When the key switch is in the Start position and both relays are enabled, there will be 12V on each side of the diode.  Therefore the diode won't conduct, since one side isn't lower in voltage than the other.  When the key switch is then returned to the On position, the Alarm-Start Relay will open, removing the +12V on the negative side of the diode, so the diode will start conducting, thus keeping the Latch Relay energized.  Is that correct?  If so, maybe an explanation could be added to that effect for dummies like me.  If not, then perhaps add a description of the way it really works.

Thanks for your good work here (That's for YOU, not me).  Hope this helps. - Bill Dennis  """,0

"Plan Avila ==

Any honest discussion of the 2002 coup needs to include coverage of Plan Avila.  The page on wikipedia for the plan itself is rather sparse, and has been subject to repeat removal of any mention of Chavez in the past.

Basically, Plan Avila was a plan for the military to maintain order in Caracas.  Issued once before in 1989, it led to possible thousands of deaths.  Chavez ordered Avila again in response to the protests, and military commanders refused to carry out, sparking the coup.

Failing to keep everything up-to-date
Hey Guys,
I seem to notice that we I'm absent, NOT all of the stats, season summaries for teams, etc. are staying up-to-date. Take for example Richmond, their season summary has not been update even since I been overseas in Europe. I mean that I feel stressful that I'm the only one updating Collingwood's season summary and nobody else. Also with season summaries, I want to discuss with all of you about how if we should have ALL of the season summaries in either a list or Template:AFLGameDetailed form (I might already dicuss this here).  Another problem is that Wikipedians has been updating articles in various formats in which it really annoys me when I update stats myself. e.g. With the Win/Loss table, I seem to notice that some Wikipedians have NOT bold the margin e.g. """"Port Adelaide 138"""" rather than the preferred format """"Port Adelaide 138"""". I notice that one lazy Wikipedian has decide to only update the Win/Loss table for their favorite team () rather that both teams ( and ). I mean the whole idea is to keep the article up-to-date, it is? Speaking about updating in various formats, I seem to notice the ladder progression gets messy and untidy all of the time. I means that we should discuss this problem together on this page and settle down on ONE simple format that all of us Wikipedians can follow. One Final thing I want to talk about in this is NOT changing/removing that already occurred in the past, I mainly notice that with the Win/Loss table were vandals keeping removing the bold text with home teams and sometimes with the Ladder were people make up they own stats. Its drives me insane and people must start looking at the Ladder on the offical website here in order to update the Ladder on Wikipedia. I hope that you fellow Wikipedians take me seriously on this issue as I am finding it stressful enough updating many stats myself.
Thank you for your attention.

Thanks for asking.

AdultVest has a history of self-insertion in various articles, so when I saw this firm again inserted into inappropriate articles, I presumed it was advertising. If your sincere intention was to improve those articles, then you have my apology.

Your contribution to the Sex industry article seems to describe the company while shedding very little light on that article's topic. As this firm seems to be an investment novelty, neither representing a trend, nor having its own significant influence on the industry, a paragraph in that article gives this business undue weight. It's a gratuitous mention, regardless of the reason for the insertion. This is the reason AdultVest is removed from that article.

The inclusion of AdultVest in Socially responsible investing is even less relevant. Obviously there are many trivial examples of investing that might be considered not socially responsible, and the inclusion of AdultVest is both questionable as an illustration, and violates WP:NPOV in the presumption that the sex industry is particularly opposite of social responsibility. The best examples are ones that need the least amount of argument that they are in fact exemplary.

If you wish to contest the inclusion of """"numerous references"""" to other companies in either of those articles, I would recommend you take it to the article Discussion pages. Your objections to those companies is not a rationale for including AdultVest. I hope this makes sense and seems fair to you.

 Botswanan (2) 

I was trying to find a way of editing the table on the right but couldn't find a way to do it. The use of words such as Botswanese or Botswanan is offensive and inaccurate. Can someone please edit the right table and write 'Motswana' instead of 'Botswanan' for Demonym . Also, our national language is Setswana not Tswana . Maybe someone could make these corrections!—Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 
Thanks, I've done the first.  

It's unfair to call it 'offensive'. This is just how language works. In English the language is also called Tswana, and it's not 'inaccurate'. We don't call Latin 'Lingua Latina', and French 'Français'. The prefix is an aspect of Tswana grammar, which we are not using. And Tswana has its own word for 'English'. One thing though: how would you distinguish between a Motswana (person from Botswana) and any member of the Tswana ethnic group - one fifth of the people of Botswana are NOT ethnic Batswana (many are Khoisan, white, other Bantu tribes...) and about 2/3 of ethnic Batswana live in South Africa. This justifies a word 'Botswanan', whose meaning is at least obvious to any English speaker, and will continue to be used whether the Batswana it or not. And the Batswana can continue to call English by their name for it. It won't be considered offensive or inaccurate.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 41.185.138.65   """,0

 A response to """"For the attention of the IPs inserting the 'racism section'"""" 

I inserted facts documenting instances of named sources accusing Catherine Glick of racism.  I'd like to take a moment to address comments in the """"For the attention of the IPs inserting the 'racism section.'""""

Please do not misinterpret documentation of allegations of racism for allegations themselves.  The section inserted, apparently subject to some controversy, is """"accusations of recism.""""  In that section, the accusations of racism that several writersEileen Read, Alex Pareene, and Paul J. Balleshave leveled at Caroline Glick are documented.  Properly, no opinion or point of view has been expressed in the """"Allegations of racism"""" section as to the veracity of these allegations.  

1.  I therefore cannot understand why documenting such allegations could be considered controversial, let alone """"potentially libelous"""" as you say.  The documentation of specific allegations of racism by named sources need only prove that such allegations exist, not their veracity.  Documentation of written defenses of Ms. Glick's work are solicited and in fact highly encouraged.  

2.  I apologize for linking to www.youtube.com.  The link I should have used was the one from Ms. Glick's homepage.  That link is at: http://www.carolineglick.com/e/2010/06/we-con-the-world-the-gaza-fl.php

3.  I never claimed to be other than a single user even though, incidentally, all of the contributions to the """"Allegations of racism"""" section are not mine.  

Incidentally, if it matters, I for my part am a fan of Ms. Glick's work and do not believe that she is a racist.  I contributed to the section to advance the Wikipedia mission to provide a forum where issues of public significance can be documented in a way as to provide reasoned information to the public.  one of Ms. Glick's detractors, Eileen Read, wrote an article in the Huffington Post accusing Ms. Glick of racism and asking that she be fired.  The article is making rounds all over the internet and has likely been read by hundreds of thousands, if not many more.  It'd be a great shame from my perspective if Ms. Glick's career suffered as a result of such charges (since they are, in my own personal view, baseless)such charges should be documented neutrally and weighed against the writings of Ms. Glick and her defenders, aiming only to inform the public, which can then decide.  When I inserted a reference arguing that Ms. Glick's positions are """"not racist"""" but """"common sense,"""" it was taken down by those same persons invoking BLP standards and undue weight.

"The following policy is given in Wikipedia:Verifiability: ‘articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy’. On the other hand Wikipedia:No original research states ‘Examples of primary sources include... ...original philosophical works...’ and ‘Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation’ it also states at the end of the paragraph ‘Appropriate sourcing is a complicated issue, and these are general rules. The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages.’
The above enables me to derive some conclusions: 
What is mend by “third-party sources” (WP:V) is not exactly the same as “Tertiary sources” (NOR). If the policies do refer to the same they contradict each other, which probably is not the case. I think “third-party sources” are, placed in context, ‘other sources than Wikipedia itself and its editors’; this would make sense, given what follows directly after the line containing “third-party sources”: ‘Reliable sources are necessary [...] to substantiate material within articles...’
Vassyana said ‘Reliance on Rand directly is a NPOV concern...’ it is now clear that it is of no concern at all. Yes ‘an interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source’ but when the text of the citation speaks for itself no further interpretation is required. She also said ‘there is absolutely no need to rely heavily in any way on the primary material’ which is still argued, in contrast I say there is absolutely no reason not to rely heavily on the primary material.
The arguments pro primary source material have, as of yet, not been given a response; the focus was on the demand to have (mainly) third-party sources. In the proper context primary sources are third-party sources, fulfilling the demand. Again ‘The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages.’ Let’s now focus on that.",0

 Edit disagreements  

Where are you getting the figure range for '300-3000' from? I couldn't find these figures in any of the sources you cited, unless you're estimating based on predictions from the article.
Abu Omar al-Shishani is not the chief in command of both Iraq and Syria. This is ridiculous. I don't know why so many people believe this. I suspect it might be becuase he is so prevalent in the IS propaganda that he is somehow the Islamic State's version of Napoleon Bonaparte. I cannot find any reputable source claiming he is anything more than a field commander in northern Syria. He doesn't even feature in any IS leadership hierarchies, which are almost exclusively staffed by Iraqis who have been in the organisations since the early-mid 2000's. When the former commander of the IS Military Council passed away in June 2014 (Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi), Iraqi secutyi forces found some memory sticks and a laptop containing the following leadership information currently pieced together by western analysts. Note how al-Shishani doesn't feature in any of them, save one which turned out to be incorrect. Here they are: , , . Here is the false one which showed al-Shishani succeeding al-Bilawi as the IS military chief of the Military Shura: . However, it was Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, another IS Iraqi commander who had been in the organisation years before al-Shishani had joined who succeeded al-Bilawi as the Chief of the Military Shura. He is shown in the graph as Adnan Latif Hamid al-Sweidawi which is his real name. You never see the upper echelons of the IS hierarchy, the ones who actually control everything. They are not shown in IS propaganda. They are clandestine, mysterious, shadowy figures. Only the pawns are revealed.
You keep stating that Jamaat-ul-Ahrar have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. This is just not true. You might get this impression becuase they broke away from the TTP or the Pakistani Taliban, which swear allegiance to the head of the Afghan Taliban Mullah Omar. But the spokesperson for Jamaat-ul-Ahrar stated that they pledged allegiance to the Taliban leader . The leader of Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, Omar Khalid has strong ties to Ayman al-Zawahiri and Al-Qaeda, a nemesis to the Islamic State. 
You state that Abu Sayyaf have sworn allegiance to the Islamic State, however, the man who swore allegiance to them is not the groups leader, so it is unclear whether or not he is representing Abu Sayyaf or a splinter faction. 
You write that Ansar al-Islam is an Al-Qaeda affiliate, but I can find little to no proof affirming this position. The leadership of Ansar al-Islam have rejected the notion that they swear allegiance to al-Qaeda, despite collaborating with their affiliates, such as the al-Nusra Front.U.S. terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna in January 2003 however disagreed with Krekar and affirmed links of Ansar with al-Qaeda: “Ansar al-Islam has links with al-Qaeda – in fact it is an associate group of al-Qaeda”.]. The U.S Defense Intelligence Agency seemed to have affirmed this when they wrote """"Ansar al-Islam is an independent organization that receives assistance from al-Qaeda, but is not a branch of the group.""""DIA, Special Analysis, July 31, 2002, cited in Postwar Findings about Iraq's WMD Programs and Links to Terrorism and How they Compare with Prewar Assessments, pg. 71.""",0

Honestly, I don't know the source, but this is true.

As a former communist I am concerned about any attempt to re-build that movement. Furthermore I am not a member of the pro-life board anymore and have not worked for Campaign Life since 2001.

It has been stated in the press that the homosexual man beaten in that park was in fact participating in questionable behaviour in that park that media admits is frequented by gays.

I have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic, after intervention of Töbel, here it comes:

 Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]

I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. 
I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. 
I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. 
Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. 
If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. 
So do the wisest, just shut up! 
It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. 
All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. 
Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. 
I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. 
You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. 
As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. 
They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. 
So if I take the name """"anonymous"""" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.

Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? 
It is all a lie. 
How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? 
It isnt equality it is power struggle. 
It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. 
WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!

HA HA! 
Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. 
Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as """"logic"""". 
For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first. 
I speak 9 languages: 
English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek!

5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm. 
As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero, maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US, but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages: english german and spanish, at age 13, we have to chose another one, and choose between english german, spanish italian russian, from age 15, when we begin graduate school, we have to take another one, and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american, and a dialect or local language, and can also take hebrew. 
2 to 3 languages are part of the compulsory pensum. 
I also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia, and english dialect spoken in India. 
That was for learning",0

What would you do ? Xerox pages of a book I, unlike you, read 2 years ago ? And which proves-what ? That in Starčević's political career the term """"Slavosrb"""" was used exclusively for enemies (as he saw them) of Croatian independence ? The main """"Slavosrbs"""" were Strossmayer, Germans, Hapsburg monarchy, and the so-called """"Khuen Serbs""""- the Serbs living in Croatia and affilliated with the  hated political regime of oppression. How come that vast majority of political representatives of Serbs in Croatia, more than 98%, had been, during the most oppressive period in the 19th century,  collaborators of Khuen regime ? Truly-these Serbs (or Orthodox Vlachs who nationally """"awoke"""" as Serbs in mid- and 2nd half of the 19th century) had fully deserved the """"Slavosrbs"""" tag in Starčević's lingo-unlike the descendandts of Orthodox Vlachs who were Starčević's followers (Stjepan Miletić, August Harambašić, Dušan Kotur, Dušan Vlaisavljević, Milan Ogrizović,..). No one can rationally deny anyone's ethnic affiliation, this is certain. The fact that Starčević did this to the descendands of the Orthodox  Vlachs is not a sign of political wisdom, or even ordinary logic. But, it must be underscored that he reacted to the denial of Croatian ethnic affiliation promulgated by Vuk Karadžić's pan-Serbian ideology. And this must not be forgotten: who had begun with this game of denial ? Who wanted another people's extirpation ? Whose idenmtity was forged, among other things, upon cultural theft and misappropriations ? Who spoiled the well ? http://www.hic.hr/books/greatserbia/

however much i respect your views, a redirect to the clairvoyance article  would however be entirely meaningless... one is not exchangeable for the other...  like cheese isn`t milk etc.....

covering the groundwork general background to establish a context for understanding extra sensory phenomena in general needed to be done  and it might as well happen at the Clairsentience page for now.....  

the reason i did it there was because fundamental doubts were being expressed about my earliest article`s conents were concerned implicitly announcing that the background for understanding extra sensory phenomena in general had not been done.... which was  ... as remember saying to you a few weeks ago   the frustrating context which motivated the writing of the second article with all of its references to the background research of brennan , lylle , mckenna , bohm , wilber , sheldrake   etc......because this background had to be established before any specifics about clairsentience could even be begun to be aproached  ....... thus the many weeks days and months of toil which has been endured to even get this background matereal into a wikpedia format and guidlines shape  ......  all of which criterea have been met  .... or at leasst  were until the finished product was mindlessly deleted...

the new additional altered states matereal  was a tentative beginning into finding a context for tentatively describing the specifics of the clairsentience phenomena itself...

but , agian it was trashed with no thought or care.... 

Redirect

I didn't redirect the article. What I said is that it probably should be. I'm happy that you're getting in there and editing and learning the ropes, but my personal opinion is that it should be redirected, and that is based on the idea that what's there is mostly about alternate states of consciousness and reality, and not really about the extrasensory clairsentience. I don't think there's enough published material to write an article just about clairsentience and that it should just be a subsection of ESP or another page. 90% of the clairsentience article was laying the groundwork for a state of reality where clairsentience could be real. That's fine, but it had very little had to do with clairsentience itself. The content about altered states of reality, etc. should probably go in an altered states of reality article instead of this particular article. I didn't, however, redirect it.

From the Place formally known as the Honey Moon capital of the world, comes a strangely melodic sound.

No this is an ever changing sound, one that will make you both want to punch a baby in the face, while singing it a sweet sweet lullaby as it drifts off to sleep. This sound can be collectively referred to as I’ve Got Gloria, a band that is set to take charge of the Niagara pop punk scene.
For years, I’ve Got Gloria has been revamping, rearranging; honing its own sound if you will. Making the progression away from its post-core beginnings in favor of a more female friendly, get your panties wet, rush the stage/strip us naked and have your way with us type of sound. Having shared the stage with the likes of From Man In Ghost, Ten Second Epic, The Midway State, Tonight Tonight, & Everlea, has only added to the ever growing list of influences making our sound that much more distinct. The band has quite literally been Rebuilt, as the name as well as the subject matter of their debut EP describes. With new ideas in their arsenal, and guns blaring, I’ve Got Gloria is going to be around for a very long time, get use to it. 

I've Got Gloria is a pop punk band from Niagara Falls, Ontario. The band consists of five guys Josh Dekker, Antonio Cirillo JR, Jeremy Morocco, Nicholas Plati JR, and Jason Golden. 

Their First EP , """"Rebuilt"""" was released in August 2012. The EP was the end product of years of creating music finally recorded! The band plans to tour in MAY 2013, and plans to release a full length album, spring/summer 2013!""",0

"Security in Ubuntu 

Apparmor is only configured to protect the printing system by default, I think that if they want to get preachy about security, then the place to start is the 14 or so vital, critical, system daemons that can obliterate the system if a malicious user is able to usurp them, Red Hat, Fedora and security conscious distributions actually protect their users with SELinux, which isn't completely worthless, as AppArmor pretty much is.

Case in point, you write a profile in AppArmor, I come along and symlink the resource you're trying to protect, and BAM, I have just rooted your box...AppArmor is as much protection from being hacked or from a malicious local user, as putting a wet paper bag over your head while a nuclear bomb is going off.

Another thing Noobuntu is infamous for is crippling SU (substitute user), sudo on a server is unwieldy and selling sudo on security is basically snake oil, Ubuntu sets you up with root-like permissions anyway, and doesn't make any attempt to tech you how to limit other users access to the system appropriately.

"Help clarify an artice: John Stark 

I was looking for information on John Stark and came across a confusing section. In the part about his early life, there is a paragraph that reads:

On April 28, 1752, while on a hunting and trapping trip along the Baker River, a tributary of the Pemigewasset River, he was captured by Abenaki warriors and brought back to Canada but not before warning his brother William to paddle away in his canoe, though David Stinson was killed. While a prisoner of the Abenaki, he and his fellow prisoner Amos Eastman were made to run a gauntlet of warriors armed with sticks.

The problem is that there is no mention of who David Stinson is, only that he was killed. I see that an edit you made (10:57, 2006 January 25‎) removed some clarification on him, instead identifying Amos Eastman as the fellow prisoner. As you have better knowledge on the subject, can you please put back some info identifying him? (or possibly remove the unclear info??)

Hey there, I'll be glad to clarify what I mean. There are a few problems I have with the site, and not in and of itself (actually, it looks pretty good and says the same things I would say). First, it appears to be a fan-site, which is not considered reliable enough for use as a source in Wikipedia. This also includes for external links, as the usual case for someone posting such a site here is to promote and drive traffic to it.

"states 

Courts: I have been putting all articles dealing with state law and state courts and their judges under the 'foo law' sub-category for each US 'foo' state.  This at least puts everything involving law and its administration in one place.  While the courts are of course part of 'government', in some states their articles were so dominating the government category, that the executive and legislative articles were losing out.  I can certainly see putting a 'see also' notice at the top of each 'government of foo' category to point to the 'foo law' category. 

Communications: Communications, of course, encompasses media, and also telephone (area codes) and mail (zip codes) and internet, etc.  I see no differenece to be made at the US level versus the state level.  Not sure that media is of such overwhelming 
importance at the state level, however, that it needs to be in multiple places or at the state level.

 Reply Dear you are right in your argument.

The User   Walkie-talkie is coming out with some crasy arguments that there is nothing even to discuss about the """"Terrorist category"""". I don’t know whether he is thinking Wikipedia should be monopolized by the fascist Sri Lankan killers who are some or other way marginalizing the Tamils in Sri Lanka since the independence. He is talking about commonsense. I don’t think so even he has an iota of that.

If Anton Balasingham could be named as the chief strategist and the chief negotiator or the apologist of one of the most barbaric terrorist groups, what about the following atrocities against Sri Lankan Tamils since the independence by the Sri Lankan State. 

          Genocide '83

        TABDisappearances & Extra Judicial Killings
       TABRape & Murder of Eelam Tamil Women

       TABWar Crimes: Sri Lanka - the Record Speaks....

       Media & the Tamil Struggle Selective Reporting, Disinformation & Murder of Journalists

TABSRI LANKA ACCUSED AT UNITED NATIONS

State Terrorism in Sri Lanka

If you go through the above incidents you will come to know they are many times worse than the highest number of suicide attacks which were targeted against innocent civilians by the LTTE.

I couldn’t understand what is the importance of that banning in 20 countries when hardly most of the countries civilians had not been killed by the LTTE attacks and the LTTE's activities are expanded into those countries only to the extent of fund raising from the expatriate Tamils.

He was the political adviser not the adviser to LTTE leader to carry out suicide attacks or to scheme military activities.

Composing the LTTE leader's annual speech or representing LTTE doesn’t qualify him for the """"Terrorist Tag"""" at all.

Why the talks failed every time was mainly the hardliners in the South and not by any of the Tamil groups or LTTE.

It is so stupid expecting he definitely knows all the crimes being carried out by the LTTE when he was utilised by the LTTE only at theoretical level and for negotiations.

I don’t know why that particular wikipedian feels sorry for him. For what?
Here anyone can comment independently and dragging a wikipedian to discuss with some other wikipedians is not acceptable. Then he can come out with his opinions here.

Blueboar, you cannot be that naive.  I suspect that you have realised that you have stepped over the mark.

By even suggesting, in a widely read public forum such as this, that the GLdF is an irregular Grand Lodge is the vilest and most vicious attack that any Mason can make upon the Grand Master, officers and members of any other Masonic jurisdiction, and it is unforgiveable.

Your Grand Lodge does NOT state anywhere in the public domain, that the GLdF is an IRREGULAR Grand Lodge and I challenge you to demonstrate to us where yu say it does.  Not your word for it, a reliable source i.e. The Grand Lodge of New York itself.  Prove me wrong, I won't mind.

What is clear is that The Grand Lodge of New York is bound by the policies of The Conference of Grand Masters of Masons of North America which has specifically removed any claim to be the arbiters of Masonic regularity, quite rightly, and good on them.

Take a look at their 2007 and 2008 reports.  They are on their website and in print in black and white.  Incontrovertable historical evidence.

And then you come along.  And you arbritrarily vilify The Grand Lodge of France and The Grand Lodge of All England.  Bear in mind that I have been, and we are, in contact with the Conference and its Commission on Information over these very issues.  They have graciously received our submissions and their statements have been carefully worded accordingly, to include ALL Grand Lodges throughout the world.

This is their and your current OFFICIAL policy:

2007: """"It must again be stated that the Commission does not determine the regularity of a Grand Lodge; it only evaluates the facts available to determine if the entity meets the standards for recognition, as adopted by the Conference of Grand Masters of North America, and reports those findings to the member Grand Lodges of this Conference for their use.""""

2008: """"We must state again that even though a Grand Lodge may practice regular Masonry, we only determine whether the Grand Lodge meets all the standards for recognition, as established by this Conference.""""

Not our words, or the Grand Lodge of France's words, their words.  The Conference of Grand Masters of Masons of North America (including the Grand Master of The Grand Lodge of New York) is NOT the arbiter of Masonic regularity - OFFICIAL POLICY.

This is an encyclopedia.  There is NO place for personal prejudices and political edicts from any partisan Grand Lodge, yours or ours.  History rises above that sort of thing.  If you want to express political opinions then write a book and publish it under you own name, but don't call it history.  History is neutral.

We can cooperate on the history of Freemasonry on Wikipedia, but we must first agree to eliminate partisan politics or it is a complete waste of time.

By the way, the """"Antients"""" Grand Lodge, properly named The Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons According to the Old Institution is the UGLE.  Please read The Charter of Compact 1813; it is quite specific on this matter.  Enough said.

And in your version of French Masonic history you have completely ommitted to mention our Lodge which was instituted and based in Paris c.1718 but certainly no later than 1720.  You probably don't know about it, but it is this sort of ommission which may be rectified if you calm your passions and your prejudices and get down to the serious business of reporting Masonic history.  It is a very big, and I believe important subject which is not served by insisting on UGLE political correctness.  The UGLE is NOT Masonic history, it is a small part of Masonic history, and in this case represents a minority of Freemasonry in France.

And finally, I can assure you that the Grand Lodge of France couldn't give a fig for the opinions of the UGLE.  Do you consider, even for one second, that if they were the least bit concerned about what the UGLE thought of them that they would have entered into a formal Treaty of Amity with the Grand Lodge of All England?  You must think about what you are saying before you blindly leap into expressions of baseless opinion.

 A lot of points to respond to.
Aleenf1 - you once again ignored the fact (or are being misleading intentionally) about national titles.  On Wikipedia pages, we use China, Laos, Palestine, Iran, etc. when those are NOT the official IOC designations.  Not only are those now the official names, those are not even the official IOC designations.  Yet, we still use them without question.  It is only with the situation of Taiwan that you make an issue of it.  I am not even proposing the sole use of Taiwan, just it's mention as a parenthetical.  Otherwise, I insist that you use People's Republic of China, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Islamic Republic of Iran, Palestinian Authority, ETC. as those are the IOC designations for those countries.  THAT is where your hypocrisy lies.
Rebskii - People SEE Chinese Taipei, but they don't know it is Taiwan.  Why do you think one of Taiwan's gold medal winners had to declare before the international press in Athens, in English, """"I am from Taiwan.""""?  It is because there is much confusion among people.  I spoke with a couple of Australian baseball fans who made the trip from Australia to see the 2006 Intercontinental Cup here in Taichung.  They didn't know that Chinese Taipei was in fact Taiwan until they started making plans for the trip.  It is not even universally known among sports fans, much less the general public.
As for the domains of Taiwan, Orchid Island and Green Island, among others, are historically linked with Taiwan and have long been administratively a part of Taiwan.  The only counties that are not historically part of Taiwan are the tiny islands with some 10,000 people off the coast of Fujian which produces none of our athletes.  Taiwan is the commonly used phrase on the street domestically, not ROC and not Chinese Taipei.
We are not bound by the opinions and illegal claims of barbarous dictators in Beijing.  
If you look at the good article guidelines, one of them is that the article should provide appropriate information for people who are not necessarily familiar with the subject.  Simply stating Chinese Taipei does not meet that standard because few people know what it is.  A simple parenthetical (Taiwan) beside Chinese Taipei accomplishes one of the standards of good article writing with very little trouble.
Again, if you insist on ONLY Chinese Taipei because that is the IOC designation, then use all of the other IOC designations for the other countries I have listed above.

BARBARO

I left some comments on F550's talk page. I think how Wikipedia has treated this F550 and the Barbaro family was unfair. I also noticed that this individual seems to have just tried to edit his name out of those two bogus societies, which seems fair to me, and Wikipedia editors keeps bringing it back. It seems like Wikipedia's disregard for others is very cruel. just my thoughts 

I also left some comments too on genio or ganios talk page too 

 Excuse me Gustav, your contribution with adding San Francesco della Vigna was actually not correct. I left a comment for you on Giano's talk page. I think everyone is desperately trying to piece inconsequential tid-bit in hope that something resembling an article might show up. The original version I saw a month ago was just fine and accurate.

Gustav, I just had a chance to look at the history of the Barbaro family page. Why was the article listed as the """"TRUE BARBARO FAMILY ARTICILE..."""" removed. That is the one that should be the official Barbaro family page. It has excellent Zorzi sources and clearly is structured in a not only a factual way, but also a way that captures the true spirit and soul of the family. This aricle that you have replaced it with is crummy.

Why isn't this page flagged """"under construction"""". You gotta be kidding me if this is the official article that is constructed for the great Barbaro family. Please say it isn't so. This has got to be the worst article I have ever seen on Wikipedia. This thing stinks! Usually articles this dinky are flagged as stubs asking for people to expand on them. I think it is time to admit Gustav that you are out of your league. Clearly the person that constructed the former Barbaro family article was an Art Historian that new this family and proper sources well. 

 
 HYPER-INDIVIDUALIST@YAHOO.COM IS IN ON THE HOAX!  

This hyper guy is in on it with Tiki-two. They planned to damage the Barbaro family page all long. First they started bogus societies which they knew would lead to the family page being destroyed. They planned it well. Tiki used the same company computer which would discredit the family's input and this hyper guy stayed out from editing so he would seem clean. But how come the conversation on the secret society talk page is only between Tiki and Hyper. Even his tag looks suspicious, """"Hyper-individualist"""". Watch this guy very closely. I think the Barbaro family needs an I'm sorry. Because I noticed that whenever it seems like the Barbaro page was going to be restored, than all of a sudden Hyper jumped in with Hoax Hoax! Very sneaky and well timed Hyper. I see what is going on. How can anyone discredit all of the evidence that was given in supportfor the family. I get you Hyper. You were the straight man and Tiki played the opposite role, but you are both as guilty-without any doubt! This guy just magically comes across an ebay purchase out of the blue from ebay back records. Yeah right-Ok Hyper!

 Proposing renaming and new article draft 

Over the last couple of months I have produced a new draft of this article, working on behalf of New Leaders. The organization asked me to write an updated draft, better reflecting their new name and current programs and bringing the article into line with Wikipedia's guidelines. The most immediate issue with the current article is that the title is now incorrect. The organization has recently been renamed to """"New Leaders"""" and is now no longer """"New Leaders for New Schools"""". Due to this change, I believe that the article should be renamed.

I recognize that since I prepared my draft on behalf of New Leaders, I have a conflict of interest. So, before I make any changes, I'd like to ask that other editors read through my draft and my explanation here, and offer any feedback they might have. 

There are a number of problems with the current article, not least that it is rather promotional in tone. It seems that this has attracted the attention of editors in the past, as you can see from the warning tag. However, despite the warning tag, and the discussion that was opened by NDSteve10 on the Talk page (see above), there hasn't really been any improvement to the article in the last 12 months. No editors responded to the Talk page note, and only a few edits have been made. In fact, little has changed with the article since it was originally created in December 2009. 

The article currently has few citations, less than half of which are reliable secondary sources. The introduction doesn't adequately summarize the article, and certainly does not give a real sense of what New Leaders does. The most problematic sections are What it does and Educational impact, both of which are written in a promotional tone, especially the latter. In addition, the """"What it does"""" section is outdated, since the organization has since introduced new programs and initiatives. Meanwhile, the """"Educational impact"""" section provides a lot of detail, but would be better presented using Wikipedia's summary style. The information provided is cited to New Leaders' website, but makes no mention that the source of the claims is the organization itself.

I would like to propose a new draft of the article that addresses the issues with the current version, which you can view in my userspace:User:16912 Rhiannon/New Leaders

This is an entirely re-written article, using reliable secondary sources as much as possible, with new section headings to provide readers with a sense of the content at a glance, a new introduction which properly summarizes the article, and an infobox with all the key information about the organization fully up to date. The """"Creation and history"""" section now includes details of the organization's founding and expansion up to the present day. The descriptive information about New Leaders' has been removed, as this is more relevant in the new """"Function"""" section. The information from the current """"What it does"""" and """"Educational impact"""" sections has been rewritten under a new section heading of """"Function"""", which includes the organization's mission, its programs and its results. This section provides details of all the organization's current initiatives and an overview of the impact of these programs. I have retained the sections on """"Geographic reach"""" and """"Executive team"""", but updated the information in each and added citations. 

While I have put much effort into writing this from a neutral POV, I appreciate that due to my COI it may be that other editors have some changes to suggest. I welcome any productive feedback on the draft and my suggestion to rename the article to New Leaders. Please let me know if you have any thoughts or questions. Thanks,   """,0

Actually, to my knowledge one of the core teachings of the Vedas is that one has to experience higher states of understanding.  They can not be taught (though a teacher comes in handy at many points in the process to guide one away from misunderstandings).  In the Hindu worldview, of course, it might takes many lifetimes before one is at a stage capable of experiencing the higher states, but still...  the fact that you may spend your whole life devoted to a given teacher is not a goal in itself, but merely a step towards the eventual experience.

Developing your user page - it is easy
Wikipedia is a megalopolis and like in any city, interactions are very important. I recommend that you develop your user page so that people who visit your page may know your interests and share in them. It could be a single line telling others of not only your name but what you like or a complex page with every single thing that interests you on it. This is a great way of building up work groups that facilitate the sharing of expert knowledge on articles, talks etc. Happy building!!!   →  talk 

Become a great editor through diligence
Being a member of  the welcoming committee on Wikipedia I encourage you to help Wikipedia in any way you can to 
increase human knowledge. If you have credible information about a topic with verifiable references please feel free to add to that topic. If there is no article on that topic, why not start it, with time others will add to it and it may even make the featured articles list. By doing this, I have been able to make over 11000 page edits in both new articles, article improvement etc. Furthermore, I encourage you to aim to be a member of the  autoconfirmed users 
[] group as this will greatly improve your Wikipedia 
experience. You can do this by making at least 10 credible edits on Wikipedia and remaining on Wikipedia for four (4) days. Check out this page for tips.  →  talk 

Adding media to  articles
Media files, be it images, drawings or sound files are an integral part of Wikipedia's articles. They apart from enriching articles, make them more credible too. You can add media files to both your new articles as well as once you are editing. To do so you can search for it on wikipedia:commons or you can either upload the image if you have it using this file uploader or [commons uploader]. Please be informed that you must provide accurate information about the file being uploaded since they are reviewed and if if is found that the license given to the file is false, it will promptly be deleted.   →  talk 

Spotting bad edits and vandalism
As you age on Wikipedia, one thing you will come across and probably address will the issue of bad edits or vandalism. There are several ways of 
spotting them:
by reviewing articles on your watchlist regularly and looking for bad edits
verifying new changes to pages and articles
If you happen to come across a bad edit you may:
ask an editor you trust to review the work for his/her inputs
you can rollback the change if you have credible information that the edit is indeed bad
request that the necessary change be made on the article's talk page.
Whatever you do, please be very careful about the changes you make, for a rule of thumb, discuss issues you are not sure of first before making changes.  →  talk """,0

This is difficult, because I never learnt all the different names for the parts of English grammar when I was in school: only how to use them.  

Taking the commas first, strictly speaking you are possibly correct in that they could – or even should – be used in the places that you indicate.  However, stylistically it is very bad to split sentences up into very small bits unless absolutely necessary, and it is much better to have a flowing sentence than to implement punctuation that makes the prose harder to read.  

With the """"Churchill devoted his time to educating himself"""" sentence, another way of putting it is to say that he allocated all of his free time to educating himself: if you used 'educate' it would indicate a future goal, not an on-going condition—there wasn't a point at which his education would be complete.  From the website you supplied, I think this page might help at 'Using Other Tenses in Conjunction with Simple Tenses'.  

Hope this helps.  On the other hand, I know that sometimes I make things more complicated than they actually are.   """,0

 Founded when? 
I'm confused.
The Washington Times article says that the company was founded in 2000 with Lance Buttiglieri.
The original Shocker Toys' website About page said that Buttiglieri joined the company in 2004.
The Record article says that the company was founded in 1998.
This interview http://www.comicreaders.com/modules.php?name=News&file;=article&sid;=803 says 1999.
The Shocker Toys' website About page now says 2000.
Another interview http://murdershow.net/2008/06/30/geoff-beckett-of-shocker-toys/ says 2000.
And another interview http://www.comicbookbin.com/shocker01.html says 1999 again.
This sayshttp://www.alibaba.com/member/shockertoys/aboutus.html 2004 as an LLP.
This press release http://express-press-release.net/25/Shocker%20Toys%20Heralds%20In%20The%20Age%20of%20the%20Independent%20Comic!.php says that Shocker Toys LLP was founded in 1999.
This article http://www.poeghostal.com/2008/03/5-questions-with-geoff-beckett-of-shocker-toys.html states Shocker Toys was """"registered"""" in 2001.
From the same site, different article http://www.poeghostal.com/2008/02/the-saga-of-shocker-toys.html, it's back to being founded in 2000.
This wiki article alone has 2 different founding dates, 1998 and 2000.

This is very basic information.  All of it comes from Geoff Beckett directly through press releases, interviews, or his own website.  Why do the dates keep changing?  Can any information provided by a citation that has Beckett as it's primary source be considered reliable when he changes his story constantly about something as simple as this?  What is the policy of dealing with information that comes from a person who just doesn't get things right very often?  From the numerous announced release dates that have come and gone with no actual product materializing, to not even getting the founding date of his own company correct, it seems that Geoff Beckett should be considered at least somewhat unreliable whenever he states anything.    And so, can references like the  Washington Times and The Record articles be considered sound when they are going off nothing more than what Geoff Beckett is telling them?    """,0

""""Comment on content, not on the contributor"""".  Speculations about other editors' teaching careers or nationality do not help improve the article.  Comments on other editors' perceived levels of expertise in a different area do not help improve the article.  In this context it may be helpful for you to review Wikipedia:No personal attacks policy on derogatory comments.  Comments on other editors' style improve the article only insofaras they are relevant to the material actually added to the article.  If you find that material is dry, then improve it, or suggest improvements.  Deleting material you do not like the style of is much less helpful than disucssing and improving it. 
This is how I would propose to lay out material on a subclass of semirings, in this case complete star semirings.  Firstly, define complete semirings and star semirings, each with a set of examples  Finally define complete star semirings, again with a set of examples.   In this case continuous semirings are closely related to complete semirings, so it makes sense to include them: an additional motivation here is that this emphasises the relationship between partial orders defined on the semirings and the star structure: for example, Conway uses the order approach to prove Kleene's theorem in his 1971 book.  Of course there are choices here.  For example, should the examples of complete star semirings be introduced early on, or only after the last definition?  There's no right answer to that.  I would like to see examples of a concept which are not examples of the richer structure, folloewd by examples of the richer structure.  Examples of continuous semirings would have been helpful, but as some editors have said, there is no deadline.  In my view, a definition without an example is hugely preferable to no definition at all: the reader in search of information will still be able to see what sort of thing it is and find references to further resources on the subject.  That, it seems to me, is what an encyclopaedia is for.
The current state of the material seems to me to be intended to do one thing only, which is to introduce complete star semirings in a way which makes the star operation as close as possible to the traditional Kleene star.  This is not the only approach.  A reason for the axiomatisation and separation out of the various properties is the entirely reasonable mathematical activity of finding out which of the properties of the Kleene star derive from what assumptions.  On the way, various structures of interest emerge, and various theorems are proved about the relationships between them.  That may not suit the point of view that star semirings are """"really"""" or """"completely unsurprisingly"""" the original formal languages: but that's only a point of view; it isn't correct, or at least, isn't the whole truth; and it isn't helpful to the reader of the encyclopaedia.

Double Standard reloaded
Who is interested in debating and who is not?
Who is interested in developing the article and
who is interested in freezin it to death, including using threats and veiled censorship in the form of selective double standard applying of internal rules?

After all, it never too much to remind that:
an editor besides not been unwilling or unable to counter argue, over a year and a half, he also have done baseless statements about editions done by me in a certain rude tone,
During all this time, I have responded to him in the same mode, but especifically to these assertions,
not having any left unanswered, unlike him...
...and only me is who was warned and blocked
Curious...
  

""""Summary of operations""""
To the newcomers in this discussion and also to the selective forgetful ones:

See above The heart of this Case;
As well as the sections Spurious Quotations, Once Again, and sections Warning to Judge by yourselves II in my Talk Page;

To note that 
1) from grammatical objections to the size of version that I propose, no one objection was left standing and even so it continues to be reversed, 
even taking into account that the present version: 
incurs spurious quote in the 1st paragraph, 
too detailed and redundant information (for an article that are supposed to be short...) on the 2nd paragraph, 
and incomplete besides be longer, vague and non neutral in the 3rd...

2) How not to think in double standard when:

The last disruptive revertion, besides be longer than the version I propose, was based entirely on incorrect inferences and historical misconceptions as I shown above (again... See above points A to E in """"Once Again"""" section ) that were related only to the 2nd paragraph (of the version I propose);
and that
No word was uttered against or about the spuriousness that was purged of the 1st paragraph, as well as against or about the 3rd paragraph, that according to some editor (Ctr F on word """"solid"""" to see above, on the discussion about grammar in the """"Once Again"""" section), was """"pretty solid""""...

And even so, the revertion was done...

So, I again ask you all:

1) Is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances?

2) In the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral, which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime (monarchical, military, etc.) whatever be?

Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???

3) Which group of honest editors, ladies and gentlemen, who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?

I was very unfairly treated, please help me, here is what happened. I tried to post this at the debate but my voice has been strategically silenced so I needed to ask a friend to go there and ask for help.

The True of this story
 
After having heard many users (if in true are many and not a few posing as many) asking me to see it from Wikipedia's point of view or even from other user's point of view, I will give here my point of view, lets see if someone has the courage to say he/she understands and the determination to stand out of the crowd.
 
I was having a normal quiet Wikilife since a few weeks ago, I joined groups, I edited and was collaborating in the whole goal of Wikipedia.
Yesterday, I had a disagreement with user Durin at the talk page of user Demon, about the validity of existing a category for users who have chosen to be nice to newcomers
One hour or less after, user Durin """"coincidentally"""" """"finds out"""" that the humorous pictures I uploaded to my page, all of which were my work and in good  tone, are (or so he said) in other places in Internet 
I was told and was written since the first log by user Durin that I """"believe that I can download artwork from Internet and have rights on it""""
I requested immediate preventive deletion and I declared that the work is mine
I asked user Durin to tell me who and where is using my work, that is, where he saw it
User Durin said that the artwork was deleted and that is all, the matter was closed
I informed user Durin that I needed to know where he saw my work so I could take legal steps against who was using my artwork
User Durin said (absurdly) that I was threatening him with legal action
I said in more than one message that the legal action referred to whom, when and where was using my work, not to him
User Durin started to say that I was harassing him
Some of Durin's supporters (who some may be alter egos) showed support at his talk page and mine
I decided to see who was user Durin and read his works
From about 30 or more articles authored by user Durin, I tagged four of them because missing references and citations
Durin and supporters (some of who may be alter egos)claimed harassment
I spoke about the problem on the phone with the Dean and she advised me to let go and to contact e-pol.org, an agency that has helped them previously on matters regarding copyrights violations in the Net.
I followed advise, handled the editions of those articles to other editors for avoiding conflict of interests and wrote a polite message informing user Durin that I had abandoned my query with him even if he did not provide at any time who or where my work was used, I added recognition and 
apologized for rudeness and also that then I left the matters in the hands of the recommended agency and that unless he wanted to help, he didn't need further involvement given that the agency would sort out who is using my work.
User Durin misunderstood my message and panicked (by reasons only known to him) and """"retired"""" from Wikipedia informing so at his page. Also please be aware that reading user Durin's pages, he has been """"threatening"""" with retiring for a good while, seemingly using this situation in good timing.
""""Coincidentally"""" an administrator's attention was called by the issue and blocked me for legal threats (please keep in  mind that these existed only in the interpretation of others of my words and not in precise wording and less in my intentions)
I requested unblocking and I was requested to prove that no Wikipedian or Wikiorganization was involved in any legal action
I asked the agency I reported the case to, to please inform Wikipedia about their no involvement, they did so clearly saying that the case is against sites using my work and neither Wikipedia nor any editor is involved in the case.
Far from the block be removed, the administrators not only left the block in place, in spite of no legal threats existed, but also questioned the existence of the agency handling my case
In the most """"interrogation"""" or better said """"organized crime"""" fashion, I received administrator's messages that I must tell who they are or I will remain blocked. It seems no longer the block obeys to policies about legal threats.
User Durin, while """"retired"""" and showing so at his page, left messages in the blocking discussion page (my talk page) warning administrators to not lift the block (curious retirement)

The place to talk about this is on the massacre talk page but I think you should read the archives to this page very carefully because the problem with the word massacre is exactly the same as with the word WP:TERRORIST a word with intrinsically negative connotations that are generally applied to the actions one's enemies and opponents.

Do you think we should have a page on """"Carnage"""" and """"Bloody slaughter"""" as well as massacre? If not why not?

I would go through others but lets skip strait to the categories you have suggested. For example there is a strong case for saying that many massacres are not """"Human rights abuses"""" because the term is attached to many events that are not, or were not human rights abuses. For example there is nothing in the dictionary definition that stops any mass killing within the laws of war being described as a massacre but that is not a human rights abuse, or are you going to make up a roll you own definition?

 A Third Way 

Ok, I'm starting to see what you guys are saying. However, to be honest I don't think this article is really about the brand. The first sentence of the article is about the brand, but most of the article is about the product(s). I mean, the section on """"connectivity"""" is clearly about the connectivity of the various iPod products themselves, and not the brand. So here is what I propose: zero article in the lead (and anywhere else where we are talking about the brand), but normal usage throughout the rest of the article, where appropriate. So """"The iPod is associated with one host computer,"""" would remain the same since it's talking about the product and not the brand. This way we can maintain a grammatically euphonious format throughout, and not have to awkwardly restructure sentences to stay in line with Apple-speak. Basically my fear was that this page would end up sounding like the iPod manual, which, to anyone who has read it, is clearly super-weird.
And for the record, I am writing this on a MacBook, I have two iPods, and I love Steve Jobs. But I love the English language more.

"What Is Multiculturalism? 

http://internationalpoliticalissues.blogspot.com/2011/07/what-is-multiculturalism.html

July 28-2011.

What Is Multiculturalism?

Definition: The doctrine that several different cultures (rather than one national culture) can coexist peacefully and equitably in a single country. Therefore, these types of societies can also be described as Plural societies/cultures. Then what does these types of societies have to do to ensure that all ethnic/cultural groups get along well, without strife, hatred, partisanship, or stereotyping? 

If the concept of Multiculturalism is truly going to work for the benefit of the entire commonweal, then the national policies must ensure there is equity in economic opportunities, job opportunities, educational opportunities, and the acquisition open to all. Political affiliation and association allowed to all, freedom of the press, TV, Internet, radio, and other media to all, and judicial representation or habeas Corpus for all who need or seek it.

All Are Supposedly Equal Except Others?

In some societies if you are not a member of the major ethnic or racial group, then you are socially, politically, and sometimes considered a second class citizen. This is overtly and covertly enforced via educational quotas, regional developmental quotas in funding programs, that cater to those second class citizens, and are treated socially as inferiors.

In the EU, and most of the other European countries currently, there is a growing trend to see all immigrants, especially Immigrants Of Color, Arabs/Muslims, as a threat to the stability of those countries. Some states within the union have already legislated against these immigrants, specifying that they wear certain attire in public places, or state owned institutions, and seek to integrate into the mainstream culture in order to be accepted.  

Right Wing Fanaticism:

This idea promulgated by the above groups, that Whites/Caucasians are the only ones who are qualified to occupy Europe is gaining momentum. And that all foreigners to the European hemisphere are not welcomed to reside therein, without the expressed permission of the state concerned. Exceptions are those on holiday, diplomats, and other technocrats that are allowed to reside therein. And marriage between Europeans and non-Europeans must not be allowed or permitted.

How do we find reliable sources that makes this kind of distinction?  I contend that for nuances between terminology of this nature, it is virtually impossilbe to dig up RS that explicitly supports your position.  I challenge you to find something that spells out what 'seems to us' to be the case.
 PBS&Shuki; - I think it's fair to ask """"can you provide """"a number of sources that makes the distinction"""" between """"occupied territory"""" and """"military occupation"""""""".  But, at the same time I think it's equally fair to say """"can you provide a number of sources that says the two terms are the same?"""".  I think as PBS is suggesting a change from the historical norm, the onus of proof is on him. 
 One final point (apologies for overly long posts); PBS keep in mind that there are undoubtly """"legal"""" definitions for both these terms, but there are also definitions that exist in the public phsyci.  Wikipedia should try address both of these.   """,0

 Verifiability 

Hi Flexme. You said...

SingKong ... this issue of quoting sources giving reliablilty of information ... it seems sensible at first ... yet it is wildly out of control ... check out the comment on the updraft page where it is said to be an expensive way to produce windpower (it might be expensive , but this is NOT the way to show it) ... this is simply a website quoting the media who quote someone's offhand comment - possibly out of context ... this is not reliable! Or another ... the floating chimney, as jdh saw it was totally misguided (though it may start a similar but sensible design in sci fi novels) Similarly, if i was to """"publish"""" my results of my analysis that is at present on my talk page and in the tower discussion page on ANY other website, even on my own yahoo freesite, then my results would suddenly become verifiable!!!!!! this is out of control. i read wikipedia a lot and find it a wonderful source of info, i had no idea about this shambles behind the scenes. when i first started editting i assumed that wikipedia itself was a nice central location to bring my ideas so they could be verified in some sense, but it seems that if you feel you know something then in fact you are best off going ANYWHERE other than wikipedia!? bizzarre!Flexme 

I understand the frustration - I had a similar reaction. But keep in mind, this is an encyclopedia written by many people, and it's the concept and practice of verifiability that stops it becoming a shambles. This can be quite frustrating for someone who knows their material without necessarily having sources at their fingertips - however, I do believe it's essential.

I met a guy in Nimbin a few months ago, who complained that he'd edited Wikipedia 4 times, and had been reverted each time. He was putting in his own ideas... but he was in a very different category to you. This guy appeared to be mentally ill and believed in all sorts of bizarre conspiracy theories. Now, if there is no test of verifiability, it can make things impossible for other editors, as it may not be obvious, from looking at the article and history page, which editor is a genius, which one has a PhD in solar power generation, and which one has been getting their ideas from conspiracy rags and voices in their head. (Not to be harsh to the mentally ill - but you see that it's a problem.) To demand a level of expertise of editors would be to drastically restrict the effectiveness of Wikipedia, and cause endless arguments about who is best qualified. Using the principle of verifiability, however, makes it much easier to maintain reliable articles.
 
I should add - verifiability doesn't mean you must have a source before adding something. However, it must be something that can be verified, and it is hoped a source will be added later, at least. I sometimes even put a  tag (citation needed) after material that I've written myself. 

If one person publishes an analysis on their website, that's not necessarily notable, but if editors judge it to be useful and suitable they could include it. As odd as this seems at first, it's better than putting one's ideas directly into Wikipedia, as the source is now very clear to any reader and is open to checking and comparison with other views. Also, being on an external site, the Wikipedia article doesn't automatically have to endorse that view, but can present it as one viewpoint, if that is appropriate.

I suppose one of the keys is that Wikipedia is not trying to be the reservoir of all human knowledge - though it may come closer than anything else to fulfilling that purpose, through extensive linking to other sites and sources. 

I've gone on much longer than I planned. Hope that makes sense - feel free to comment or ask further, on my page or on a relevant talk page (e.g. at the Wikipedia:Community Portal.  tc """,0

 The Code  

I completely agree with the guy before. the codde you have here is innacurate and is not even close to as long as it should be. i stronly state that you should change it to this exact code because it is 100% true and has been depicted. 

""""The demon scrolls tell of a warlock that will come to save our people but I wouldn't rely too much on the scrolls. They also say that rabbits are the supreme beings and that the best cure for a sore throat is a poultice of dung and old socks. Hence trust the scrolls at your peril. There are however a few basic tips for survival in a demon tribe that might be helpful if you were a human say and had never actually met a demon before. Which is unlikely to say the least. If you were human you wouldn't be able to read this in the first place. 

So. Demon survival tips. First, never stab a demon with his own sword. This is the ultimate insult and will result in a vendetta that could go on for generations. It is fine to stab a demon with your sword - he will congratulate you for managing that - but only poor warriors lose their swords and then get stabbed with them. If the opportunity arises give it a miss. Second, demons have a pretty comprehensive system of sign language in which buttock slapping features heavily. It is very important not to slap the wrong buttock. Never slap someone else's buttock unless they stab you with your own sword, that is considered very bad manners. And learn the difference between the left buttock slap and a right buttock slap. If a passerby aims his buttocks at you and slaps the left one it means that there is a full moon due that evening and he hopes you will join him for the traditional hunt. If he slaps the right buttock it simply means that you remind him of his right buttock. You can see where the problems could arise. Finally, never sneeze into your fist. Always allow the sneeze to run free into the air. Medical demons assure us that the sneeze comprises of millions of tiny flying demons that zoom around the earth until they can find a human to land on. When they alight on their host humans they hack into their scalps with tiny axes causing terrible headaches which make the humans easy to defeat in battle. So when a demon sneezes immediately slap your right buttock in the direction of the sneeze so that the tiny demons can pass on the message to the human they land on.""""

Greetings Mikhailov, Thanks for the welcome and your generous suggestions! I particularly like the four waves and will incorporate that in my modus operandi. I wish I had more time to edit, although that is not my calling, yet I'd love to help. Here I am just trying to keep my two Cuba books (I'm the author) in the further reading sections... Yes, another self serving bastard. For me it is difficult to stay on top of this alone. I do have several questions that you certainly could answer, yet if you will is another matter entirely. 

1) When there is no further reading section, should I A) create one or B) add the information in the reference section (I feel that may be a faux pas)or C) do something else like ... run Forrest run? 
 
2) Unfortunately I have not had anyone write a bio for me... yet. I'm afraid I am responding at a poor time because while I usually dominate Google searches with my books, interviews, and my Blog at Sulekha, at the moment I am a distant second on the first page. Sadly, I share the name of Charles Spencer King with the inventor of the Range Rover.... This confuses many a seeker as you might imagine. Regrettably, Mr. King (the other) died in the last month, and that has thrown the proverbial monkey wrench into the rankings (Addendum: I assure you I am alive and well).

    I would love to at the very least get into the Disambiguation section, however I am afraid I would need a bio for that.... Am I correct? 

 3) For some reason my ISBN does not seem to work here despite the fact I am on everything from Amazon through the Library Thing....and everything between. Odd, yet I would be delighted if at the very least I could get this to go to either the individual page at Amazon or the title page ( this one:)    http://www.amazon.com/Charles-Spencer-King/e/B002ELIWKI/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1

However you created conflicts only when your contributions were concerned, because you just cannot accept the idea that your holy edits wouldn't stay on WP. 
I'm not reverting """"any change made by anyone"""", I am removing content that has nothing to do on Wikipedia, such as unsourced opinions and original research. Each time I'm removing something, it is always perfectly justified according to the WP policies and guidelines. However, each time you start an edit war, you're just unable to find anything to substanciate it, other than personal attacks. By the way, contributing to an article in any way, either by actually writing quality content (ie content that meet the requirements from various policies) or by removing the content that doesn't correspond to the WP standards, is work. So yes, I have worked on Eva articles. 
So, you are the hothead who throws childish trantrums each time someone """"dares"""" to touch your Holy Writings, and who yell at me instead of trying to discuss with civility and to actually try to justify your edits. 
Concerning your nonesense about """"authority"""", as Dandy Sephy reminded you, """"consensus isn't require to write things, and things being changed is what wikipedia is about"""". 
Moreover, there is no need of consensus to remove obvious policy violations either (such as original research, unsourced opinions, etc. That is, everything I have removed from your contribs). 
On the contrary, as it is stated in WP:V, """"Any material lacking a reliable source may be removed"""". I know very well what the next part of the sentence recommands, but it only highlights the fact that there is no need of discussion, only that the editor wanting to re-include the content has the duty to find a source, and not endlessly argue that editors should be allowed to write unsourced OR.
There is also the Jimmy Wales quote: """"I can NOT emphasize this enough. There seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative 'I heard it somewhere' pseudo information is to be tagged with a 'needs a cite' tag. Wrong. It should be removed, aggressively, unless it can be sourced.""""
So if you're not ready to accept that anyone can remove your edits, you should not contribute.
What you're saying is indeed utter nonesense. Nowhere in WP is it stated that I would need your approval before removing your contribs (whether I'd just be wanting to replace them with something entirely different, or they'd be blatant policy violations), and indeed Wikipedia is not going to tolerate policy violations just so that some contributors could maintain their grasps on articles and their pride. When I remove content, it is always according to the most basic rules of WP so there's no discussing it. It is not authority, it is applying the rules of WP, and I can't see why they wouldn't apply to you.
By the way, you're reproaching me a so-called """"authority"""", but it doesn't seem to bother you to reinsert your content back into the article without any discussion of without any justification concerning the various policies and guidelines. You should not give lessons about authority in these circumstances.
In conclusion, your multiple and failed attempts at article ownership have only slowed down improvements, as your silly argument is doing now. You'd better either start showing you can write the actual quality content that you're boasting about, or stop whining.  

So everything you're saying is utter nonesense.

Thanks!
for the *. NawlinWiki (talk) 

My pleasure. I think I have to apologize for subjecting you to the diatribe it engendered but, as I think you might agree, it tends to prove the point in an ironic way. I just looked at your talk page and decided that the minor whining *I* get from new page patrol is relatively polite compared to what you seem to have attracted  hence the *. Accounting4Taste:talk  
NalinWiki, you deleted my article while I was still writing it on the basis that it contained """"no references whatsoever"""" but allow your own article to stand even though it contains """"no references whatsoever"""". Please, please explain how your point been proven in """"an ironic way"""". Go ahead. Explain it. All I have seen so far from you is reckless deletion of other people`s work followed by pathetic back-slapping from like-minded wreckers. If you are going to have a dig at me, why not do it on my own talk page? You weren`t shy to destroy four hours of my work, so why be shy now? Kont Dracula (talk) 

I think you've confused the two of us; I must take credit for some statements that have apparently offended you, having signed them, so feel free to express yourself here about them. If you want the contents of an article that was deleted, in order to work on adding citations in a """"sandbox"""" page, you can either ask me or another administrator for assistance. If you have any other questions about Wikipedia policies, I'll be happy to direct you to the relevant pages. And if you'd like to work on contributing to Wikipedia in a worthwhile way, in accordance with our policies, I think everyone here will try to assist you. Accounting4Taste:talk  
No, I haven`t confused anything. There is not very much to confuse between you two drones anyway. I see that you are not very good at answering specific questions about specific articles. Evidently, you feel much safer describing deleted articles that you have not even read as """"steaming crap"""" than you are actually discussing the actual merits of said articles. A really positive, worthwhile contribution there. Is that the kind of """"contribution"""" you want me to make? Hardly surprising that you prefer the classic politburo repsonse of """"directing me to the relevant"""" regulations rather than discuss the merits of the case in question. Yet you have the arch hypocrisy to highlight the """"assume good faith"""" legend on your page.

Well I do have some questions about wikipedia policy, as you mention it:

1) Is it an acceptable practice for a wikipedia adminstrator to delete articles which are in the very process of being written without consultation or clarification on the basis that they do not contain references when the very same administrator has himself posted less relevant articles which do not contain references himself?

2) If the answer to the above is yes (and I have to conclude that it is, as that is precisely what has happened) would it be fair to conclude that wikipedia administrators feel themselves above and not subject to the same criteria for notability and verification as non-administrators? After all, my article contained no references and was deleted. NawlinWiki`s contained no references and was amended when I pointed it out. Please refer me to the relevant pages. Kont Dracula (talk) 

1. Yes, to the first part of the question; administrators can delete articles without consultation or clarification. Articles that are being considered for deletion are assessed entirely on their own terms, and not with reference to any other article, so comparison of your article (which I have read) with any article created or edited by anyone else is not a relevant consideration. You can read the relevant policy at WP:WAX. 
Well I didn`t expect you to be so candid about it. So you believe that it is entirely acceptable for an administrator to completely ignore the very regulations that he is so dogmatically enforcing onto others. You still haven`t referred me to the """"relevant"""" page on that one.

But no, you have not """"read"""" my article because it was in the very process of being written when it was deleted. I am sure that there was a great deal of improvement that it required. There were some slightly whimiscial and humourous details which were possibly not appropriate for a wikipedia entry. It wasn`t perfect. You see, that is why I was editing it and indeed still writing it.

Of course, in reality we know that you have not actually expressed your own opinion. You were pretty forward with your opinion the other day though, weren`t you? You described other people`s articles as """"steaming shit"""". Now though, you are not quite so forward with your opinion. Instead, you try to retreat behind """"guidelines"""" """"r",0

If we consider this, in the Americas case it should be South America and not Latin America.
Second case, Mexico has a great GDP but in overal terms GDP is not the only factor, we should consider military, power projection and foreign policy. Mexico has a ridiculous military and projection power and politically is a subalternous nation to the USA

Oh, what a mess. Multiple formats bedevil the writing of a logically-structured encyclopedia! I can see valid arguments for maintaining (although how much that needs to be done is moot) different chronologies for UK and US releases, because of the various Columbia chop-ups that were released in the early years, but trying to keep them in step is an arduous task. Most Beatles albums tend to be listed in order of their UK release (which usually preceded other locations), and that, per WP:ENGVAR, should IMHO be the norm as regards principal chronology. There's no issue with listing colonial releases in the main article, but little to be gained in having separate articles. As regards this one, as far as the UK is concerned, it was a double EP, and I see no problem in describing that initial release as an """"album"""", for simplicity's sake, and all variations should follow from that. However, this article is but an outpost of WP:Beatles and perhaps some wider input would be useful. andemu """,0

"Old Stagecoach Trail and Old Santa Susana Stage Road 

Got ur message/question.  I think you were encountering a situation where the NRHP name in our LA list was a red-link and was different than the name of a pre-existing article on the site, and you handled it correctly by revising our list to keep showing the NRHP name (as it is a list of NRHPs) while wikilinking to the pre-existing article.  And you added the NRHP infobox, keeping the NRHP name there (as it should be).  Further, I edited the article intro to mention the alternative name.  And further, i created a redirect at the NRHP name for the site.  I think we talked about how to do redirects a while back....

It would have been similar if the problem had been we had created a new NRHP article already, before finding the pre-existing one.  Then I would have supported merging our material into the older article, and converting our new article into a redirect to the older one.  That gets to the same result as above.  

In mergers, I do think it is courteous to merge the newer article into the older one, so that the older history of edits stays with the article.  Even if the newer article name is better, because the merged article can be moved with its entire long history to the newer name, after.

As for the Izetbegovic article, he: 1) removed historical information (the original birth country), 2) changed """"Bosnian mujahideen"""" for """"Arab Volunteers"""" when there is already an article on the former, 3) removed two """"citation needed"""" notices, 4) removed a quote by Richard Holbrooke, US Envoy, about the issue of the aforementionned Bosnian mujahideen, 5) Added """"Serb Nationalists"""" as those who petitioned the ICTY to indict Izetbegovic so as to make it seem unjustified when in reality he died before the investigation ended.

I have tried to discuss these issues on his talk page but he does not wish to participate in a dialogue and simply reverts my edits. I don't wish to get into a full fledged edit war and that is why I would like an administrator to take a look at the issue. Thank you in advance for your help! )""",0

Hey, I got your message. The image you uploaded is A.) Not a great representation of how his dress defines his character, and B.) Very weak fair use rationale. The only reason Rachel has a promotional image is because of the fact that it represents her character. In fact, the only reason Kurt and Rachel have non-free images is because of the fact that their wardrobe can at times define their characters and a free image wouldn't represent that as well. The promotional image you uploaded only shows him with a fancy tie and regular dress, which would be equivalent to one that was deleted previously. The image could easily be substituted with one of the free images of Chris Colfer at the Wikipedia Commons, whereas the screenshot is depicting a fancy coat, tie, etc. that Kurt is regularly seen in.

Don't canvass other editors who agree with you.
Don't give up when people disagree on a specific proposal.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST & NEUTRAL POLICIES OF WIKIPEDIA

Dear Wikinews, Wikipedia  since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such. 

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete """"when in doubt don't delete"""" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.  If you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop telling the public to follow standards which are double standards and more..  Does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this?

You're not even Maltese, how do you expect to correctly edit a page about a person who's only notable in Malta? Sure, you can rely on articles you find online, but as you may have noticed, pretty much all the media is against Norman Lowell and his party, for obvious reasons. There's even a website dedicated to """"spreading the true agenda"""" or whatever  . But of course, everything you read is only partially factual and mostly biased... and rightfully so, but such information has no place on wikipedia. Perhaps you'd be interested in writing a """"criticism"""" section? That would make more sense.

On a side note, regarding the banning of Norman Lowell...it is well-known in Malta that Lowell was banned from the media, but unfortunately I could only find one source stating that. The person interviewed in the article is the editor of one of the most popular Maltese websites, www.maltafly.com, on which Lowell has been frequently made fun of.

"It is just like synthpop being a precursor to techno. Synthpop is white music whilst Techno is black music. Radio Babylon is dub, it provides typical dub technique (small room/overreverbed room), and the only thing it can be called 'dnb' for is the combination of percusion with k-s-k-s-.. rhythm, which is hardly an invention of MBM. Four arguments to Radio Babylon opposition are:
MBM is an experimental band. (there has been already noted somewhere that Kraftwerk's 'Radioactivity' was once 'recognized' a first dubstep track by some)
Dub is a genre of vast (Can you definetely state no simillar dubtrack has been written just before /or much before Radio Babylon?)
MBM's track isn't related to Rave, as Dub (or reverb technique) isn't related to Rave
Two years passed till another tracks of jungle have appeared if Radio Babylon is considered a first track.

Arguments in favour are:
MBM are British, so they are connected somehow to British Rave scene.
Track's rhythm is quite a simillarity with jungle music rhythms.

Second argument is like 'drumfunk was created in the times jazz/funk drum improvisations appeared (20s to 60s)'. The first argument is weak without the second one.

One more argument that MBM's track is sampled in some jungle tracks as a straight shortcut to jungle music roots according to creators of those tracks. But it is quite a pov argument.

I don't know the roots of Rave, the scene was dominantly white, and the guy who brought acid house to UK was white too. But who started using 45rpm breakbeat over 4-tofloor is enigma to me personally.

Black music may be considered a 'racial term', therefore i think you'll enjoy more politcorrect one: 'Pop music genre created by black people of African/Carribean (may be also Indian) origin'. I asure, no one here wants it to start any racial war.  82.209.225.33",0

 Wow, look at that evidence, Betacommand king of wikidrama and his mentor and a single user accusation and I'm permanently blocked? 

""""New"""" user IP69.226.103.13 (talk · contribs · deleted contribs · logs · edit filter log · block user · block log) seems to be singlemindedly Wikihounding me at my AfD nominations (and only my AfD nominations). I find this behavior harrassing to me, and disruptive to the AfD process. Can anything be done? Abductive (reasoning) 

    I have also noted the curious behaviour of this IP and I endorse the concern of the complainant. Xxanthippe (talk) .
    I must also agree that the behavior of this user concerns me. They have been very aggressive and almost disruptive when relating to bots and bot policy, the user in question is also threatening to go to arbcom over comments that I made regarding the fact that they needed to read specific information. they claimed that I had said that they could not read, making my informative comment into a personal attack. This behavior is on going and log term. I suggest something be done in order to address the issue now, before it has a chance to get out of hand and become a larger issue in the future. βcommand 

        Just as a point, the user in question is NOT apparently interested in discussing his own disruptive behavior: see [116]. I think that there is also a very good chance this is not his only account. He showed up, fully knowledgable in Wikipedia editing, less than 2 weeks ago. Jayron32 

    I would concur in the conclusion that IP69.226.103.13 is not her with forthright purposes, having seen his behavior at WT:BRFA and WP:BN. Given that he is opposed to discussing his behavior, any objections to an indef block? MBisanz talk 
    would recommend a CU then indef of all related accounts too. βcommand 

I first became aware of this user (as an actual IP editor) during the cleanup of the anybot mess; it may be that people involved in the relevant WikiProjects know more about him. This person's IP seems to change frequently (I've seen edits from 69.225.5.4, 69.225.5.183, 69.226.111.130, 69.226.106.109, and 69.226.103.13 apparently from this same user on WT:BRFA in the past 5 or so months), and I guess he eventually created this """"IP69.226.103.13"""" account to answer concerns over that; at times he still neglects to log in. I have no indication as to whether he has other accounts or just extensive experience as an IP user. I know of at least one short civility block for this user, although I don't recall the specific IP. In general, I've found the user helpful when not overreacting to various issues, which unfortunately does occur rather often. I'm not sure whether an indef would be a net positive for the project or not. You'd have to identify and examine his contributions under his various IP addresses to get a full picture. Anomie⚔ """,0

Hi Heah, 

Thanks for your reply.  First, I wrongly assumed that Jossi had started the deletions.  He just joined in and was the one who reported me for reverting.  I didn't know that there was an edit log that tracked all activity but someone showed me afterward.  I still maintain, however, that these deletions were indeed acts of vandalism.  They weren't corroborative edits, that's for sure.  They were, as I said, wholesale, repeated deletions of original text.  You speculate that the problem might have been my lack of citations but, in this case, I can assure you that's not the problem.  Jossi's full aware of the fact that both Geaves' comments and Rawat's own contradictory words (in his letter inviting his followers to the Millenium festival) are proven and accurate.  Here's a link to the Geaves' article:

Footnote 5 is the one where Geaves' relieves Rawat of any knowledge or responsibility for the Millenium hype.

And here's a link to the letter Rawat himself wrote which clearly puts the lie to Geaves' revisionism:

The Wiki rule about vandalism states that most is dealt with by fast reversions.  However, it doesn't say that persistent efforts in this regard may nonetheless violate the three-reversion rule and trigger blocking!  It does seem a little Kafak-esque, don't you think?

Finally, on the more general complaint I have about Jossi Fresco, I do invite you to take some time, if you would, and review his editing of the Rawat articles.  He is a paid web guy for a person who is most certainly a cult leader, a man who still has many, many followers who believe that he is God in human form.  Jossi is adept at using Wikipedia to ensure that the articles never truly capture the story of the man.  The fact that he's a Wikipedia administrator is worrying, in my opinion.  18:13",0

No, no. Only birds sing without any sort of political campaigning.

So, I think he would be more than pleased to answer what are his views on homosexuality and whether his songs can be interpreted by gay teenagers to mean that they should fight for their freedom to express their sexuality, especially when he says: """"Young man control in your hand / Slam your fist on the table / And make your demand / Take a stand / Fan a fire for the flame of the youth / Got the freedom to choose"""" and things like that.

"2004 Bonnie? What about Charley? 

I recall Hurricanes Bonnie and Charley hitting Florida within a day of each other, and both of them passing off the Jersey Shore a few days later.  It was the remnants of Charley, not Bonnie, which brought the heaviest rain to the Jersey Shore on August 15th, 2004. Bonnie might have spread some light rain a day or two earlier, I don't specifically remember, but Charley passed off our coast as a 40 mile per hour tropical storm. I remember this clearly because the most intense wind and rain were far ahead of Charley's center, and when the center was closest, there was no rain or wind to speak of onshore, mostly offshore. Earlier that day, Charley had been a Category One hurricane off of South Carolina, and a day or two before that, a monster Category 4, hitting Punta Gorda, Florida. Later that season, New Jersey got rains from the remnants of Frances, Gaston, Ivan & Jeanne. Jeanne was the strongest, and brought the most intense winds of that season, although Charley was far wetter. I will try to find sources to back this up, but I have followed every New Jersey tropical storm & hurricane since 1976, and work in the Office of Emergency Management. Some of the worst conditions I've ever experienced were during the passage of Tropical Storm Ernesto in 2006, because the wind and rain lasted a long, long time: about two days, with frequent gusts near hurricane force, even over that threshold just south of here..  Floyd, Bertha, Gloria and Belle were  stronger, but they moved faster. My community, Seaside Heights was in the direct center of 70 mph Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999, with a dead calm lasting about an hour, sandwiched between periods very, very wind conditions. Hanna in '08 was the biggest wimp of all these storms: a bit of rain and wind, but mostly hype.

I looked up the history of Bonnie and Charley from the National Hurricane Center.

Bonnie, http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2004bonnie.shtml? passed east of the Jersey Shore, and probably did bring light rain, but it was not memorable

Two days later, on the 15th, Charley, http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2004charley.shtml?  did the same, but in a much more dramatic way.

I am going to add this to the page. Thanks.

Hey, . I really appreciate the excellent work you have done expanding Cuisine of Cambodia. The article looks much better now than it did a couple of weeks ago. I just wanted to tell you a couple of things. The beautiful image of num bachok, that you have been trying to add to the article is taken from this site .

The second thing is that I've edited out two lines from the article about people in Phnom Penh. your text said:
""""Many of the Khmers who knew how to cook authentic Khmer cuisine before the civil war were killed during the Khmer Rouge Regime. Very few Cambodians know how to cook real Khmer cuisine. If you visit Phnom Penh today, the Khmer 'food' now tastes more like Thai because the people of Phnom Penh came from refugee camps so did not know the real features of authentic of Khmer cuisine.""""

The first part maybe true - because so many people were killed during the KR regime. However, the next two lines are only an opinion (and probably not true) so, I have removed them. If you can find a reliable source that says those things then you should add the text back to the article with a reference to the source.

 Yet my last sentence in my foregoing post is perfectly veridical. Even now Jeffro77 (and you) are unaware of the illiterate nature of his edit even though I reproduced it for him (from the """"Existence of God"""" Talk page): """"The Deutsch citation is entirely correct, and the quoted text is available at the linked article in the citation. Failing to use the exact citation supplied by you is immaterial."""" But as anyone who is literate can see, his citation is incorrect: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""".

 """"Chapter 14"""" of what book? By whom?

 Nor did I ever call anyone at Wikipedia a bully. That's a false claim by you. You therein protest too much (cf. Hamlet, Act III, Scene II, line 240).

 As well, I don't merely make charges, I prove what I state. Jeffro77 and Ilkali both repeatedly made false claims regarding the subject for which there is no excuse due to the information being readily at hand within either the subsection under question itself or in the hyperlinked Wikipedia articles. Neither of them knew the slightest thing about the Omega Point Theory other than that they knew that its author maintains that it physically proves God's existence, which was all it took to rile them up. While lacking knowledge about a subject is not itself an error, what is completely uncalled for is to have vociferous opinions on an issue while remaining in that state of ignorance.

 That's the current state of this matter. Those who have repeatedly shown a willingness to make factually false statements on the matter, and whose ignorance regarding the subject is nearly complete, now have their illiterate and clownishly censorial, and indeed illogical, edit showing.

 Regarding the illogic of the edit, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he deleted mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

 So by Jeffro77's own words, he must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted mention of this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

 Jeffro77's edit is so ridiculously biased and illogical that it's a sick joke.74.4.222.208  """,0

{{unblock reviewed|1=Sorry for my blurb here, I went in detail elsewhere. If an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology, they will notice that I've been patient while I had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. That creates a very stressful situation. Please see here for outside opinion. I did not use the same kind of language against Hrafn, and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while I added content to the article. I was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it, even before the AfD process. I noticed it was a stub and started to add content. How am I being disruptive to other there, when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? I even listed 30 potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. Others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be """"an editor of astrotheology"""" and *add content*. Hrafn, on the talk page, even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. It is obvious he was against something, but that something wasn't me like he thought, and he couldn't believe otherwise  or choose not to. Somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment I got from Hrafn, to where Durova stepped in and it went directly to ArbCom. She did ask about PastorDavid, but I looked and I left evidence on AN/I of why I didn't accept his offer  that is not a refusal to dispute resolution, that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an AfD. I felt another mentor/mediator, would be best. (Personal attack/comment redacted by   ) If you look however, I did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to Hrafn about RS/N over the Physico-Theology book... he didn't answer at all to that question, but he went on to despise me instead with more """"egregious misintrepretations."""" As for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that Durova noted, those weren't because of disruptive editing. I never caused anybody to leave wikipedia. If you seriously think I did, it would be more appreciate if you mentioned that evidence to support it than just baselessly blame me. The previous mediation was recommended by a mentor, (Comments redacted by   ) I hate the show the mistakes she made also, we aren't all-knowing saints of wikipedia policy from day one. Why did she even bring it old beginnings back up? The computer science related one was dealt with differently since it was called unfair why I got blocked before. After unblock, the consensus continued , and it still sustains today. If I truly was trying to disrupt like Durova claims, don't you think a intentional disrupter would stalk her and revert her edits and such all along. (Comment redacted by   ) It would be a test to see if she requests unblock, but since she made it clear on my talk page she never want to see me again, I really doubted her olive branch. I deleted a section here on my talk page of her """"vanish"""" forever bit. I simply did not reply to her, (Comment redacted by   ) You can argue all you want that I changed the section title, which policy does allow for neutral view, (Comments redacted by   ) When ArbCom said this is obvious, I truly don't think he meant to block me... the obvious answer is let the community help  offer to help mediate. I saw absolutely no other offer to help mediate besides PastorDavid's. However, I sent an e-mail to ask her """"why... why.. why..""""... but now she is calling it """"obscene,"""" and offers to show it to any admin. If you read it(Comment redacted by   ) Like I said on AN/I...|decline=reason — Not only has the user not apologized for obvious bad behavior, but has offered further attacks and emails with multiple four letter words (the G-D word primarily) to his opponents.

"so all that needs to be measured is their importance; and since it tends to be men that like to assert just how big and important they are, the only dispute that remains to be settled is whether to measure volume or length. Unfortunately, taking the arithmetic mean of these may produce different winners (if you are unconvinced, compare the hypothetical data sets of {2,2,2} and {1,1,3}). However, in a flash of inspiration, I've realized that so long as you take the geometric mean both results will always agree! (Hey, not only do you get to argue about naming disputes, you get to learn some maths, isn't Wikipedia educational?) Macedonian on the other hand will require me to measure neither length nor volume, but genuine Macedonicity. To this end, I could travel around all areas and entities that have been declared by either side to be truely Macedonian, and measure the Macedonicity of men's penises using my special patented Macedonicitymeter. The risk is this won't be perceived as neutral, because the losing side may claim that I have been measuring the wrong kind of Macedonicity. The important point here (I think there is actually is one) is that sometimes it's not importance which is at the heart of the dispute, but historical and moral rights to claim the name. It's easier when the other side isn't still around (I dread to think of the rows we'd have if the Albania in the Caucasus was still around to claim the name!) but if it is, arguing about how big and important both sides are is going to help even less.

"/f/ in Georgian? 

Hi.  Do you have a source for your addition to the Georgian language page where you said that ფ is pronounced as /f/ when it corresponds to an /f/ sound in loan words from Greek and other languages?  It was (and is) my understanding that when foreign words containing /f/ are incorporated into Georgian, the sound is spelled as ფ, and the ფ is pronounced normally (as /pʰ/).  For example, პროფესია (profession, occupation) is pronounced /p'rɔpʰɛsia/ (not /p'rɔfɛsia/).  As far as I am aware, /f/ is not a separate phoneme in Georgian; rather, it occurs only as an alternative pronunciation of ვ before unvoiced consonants.  Admittedly, I only know a very small amount of Georgian, so I am not in a position to put myself forth as any sort of authority on this.   (talk · contribs)",0

"""please research into feminist periodicals on superiority ==

Feminist newspapers and booklets may have reported, quoted, or published well-known feminists as proponents of superiority or supremacy (likelier the former), particularly in the late 1960s and the 1970s. Many such papers had largely local circulation in various locales with some copies arriving nationally and some are available now in microfilm in libraries (at least, Bell & Howell published Herstory: Women's History Collection (microfilm)). Best wishes and thank you very much.   

 please research What Women Wanted, in Stanford Observer 

A specific source on superiority that I don't have is Freedman, Estelle B., What Women Wanted: Varieties of Feminism in Nineteenth-Century America, in The Stanford Observer, Jan., 1978, perhaps pp. 3 & 7 (The Stanford Observer published by Stanford University & since renamed Stanford Magazine or The Stanford Magazine (news.stanford.edu)), which is cited in Offen, Karen, Defining Feminism: A Comparative Historical Approach, in Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, vol. 14, no. 1 (Autumn, 1988), p. 125 n. 12 & 139 n. 43 (pp. 8 & 22, respectively, in PDF viewer software) (JStor or JStor's stable URL, both as accessed Aug. 28, 2010, 2:48p) (author was of Institute for Research on Women and Gender, Stanford Univ.). While Stanford University's library probably has this on hand, it appears to be rather costly to get a copy, and, as far as I know after checking WorldCat.org, no copy is near me. I hope someone has a copy and can edit the Wikipedia article accordingly. It is also very possible that the superiority referred to has nothing to do with women governing whole societies, but perhaps is only about a """"moral"""", biological, or essentialist claim to superiority and not governance. Best wishes and thank you very much.   

 please find critiques of supremacy generally 

Criticisms of the superiority or supremacy position are implicit in most equality claims, but they probably should be articulated. At the moment, I don't think I have them (except for what I've already added to WP plus some to come on matriarchy). Preferred are two kinds: those by feminists (there's probably a passage in an interview of or an article by Betty Friedan, for example) and those by antifeminists (although some likely exaggerate and conflate all of feminism with superiority aspirations and object to the whole, rather than state a specific objection to superiority per se). Best wishes and thank you very much.    (Corrected the syntax of the first sentence to conform to that of the next sentence: )

 whether Les Guérillères community intended as relatively modern 

I think Monique Wittig's Les Guérillères, the 1969 novel, was meant to be relatively modern or futurist, and thus so was the proposed female state. This is suggested by the words """"rifle"""" and """"bullet"""" in the novel (Wittig, Monique, trans. David Le Vay, Les Guérillères (1985, © 1969), op. cit. (cited in the draft), p. 141 (""""rifle"""") & p. 132 (""""bullet"""" & """"bullets"""")), in contrast to an existing interpretation of the fiction as Amazonian, probably meant in a sense other than ancientness. The ages of the English words rifle and bullet, about 2–3 centuries (per Shorter Oxford Eng. Dict. ([4th ed.]), could be irrelevant if her original French words, whatever they were, were old enough and meant ancient weapons or weapon supplies used for war. To avoid this factor being deprecated as original research from a primary source, is there a secondary source about the feminist state's intended time frame other than 1969?

 News suppressed on Wikipedia http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

RexCurry.net is the historian who made the following discoveries covered elsewhere and on Wikipedia:

1. The USA’s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html

2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html

3. The Pledge’s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist.""""
http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html

The Pledge is part of the USA’s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.

As a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.

Government schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.

Most comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their """"Nationalist"""" and """"New Nation"""" magazines, the """"Nationalist Educational Association"""" and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book """"Looking Backward"""" was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.

In the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.  

After segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.

Bellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, and he preached what he called """"military socialism.""""  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.

The Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the """"Wholecaust"""" (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers'",0

Aegean Macedonian is a subgroup just like Greek Macedonian, or Bulgarian Macedonian is. I believe Aegean Macedonian should have their own article if the other two subgroups are allowed too.",0

"Thank you for your kind offer Reinyday. I accept. Admittedly I am very new to Wikipedia and am learning as I go. In my opinion, this will eventually become the most comprehensive and definitive Sweetest Day article anywhere. Contrary to what many may think, I am not anti-Sweetest Day. I simply believe Americans have a right to know the real history of what they are celebrating when it comes to holidays. The Herbert Birch Kingston Story of the origins of Sweetest Day is a verisimilitude, meaning it is very similar to the truth but not the exact truth at all. In fact, the dissemination of this story by Hallmark, American Greetings, Retail Confectioners International and countless other promoters of Sweetest Day is a form of mass deception and market manipulation. It has been going on for 85 years and has resulted in billions of dollars in revenues for these companies. But at what cost? America pays the cost of Sweetest Day in credibility, a trend which must be reversed if we are ever to win the hearts and minds of the world again. 

Please allow all images to remain in the article (unless they do not comply with Wikipedia standards). More will be uploaded soon! Also, please do not add any of the verisimilitudes currently used in the promotion of Sweetest Day unless they are characterized as such. Thank you again Reinyday! Robb",0

""": Yeah, well I enjoy ranting but have gotten to do ever-so-little of it thus far on Wikepedia because of the whole infernal """"Wikiquette"""" thing. I couldn't resist the opportunity to indulge a little. ) Here's the dilly (or part of it) on dopamine, melanin and Parkinson's. Dopamine and melanin have very similar structures, and dopamine metabolism produces a form of melanin called """"neuromelanin,"""" which is different from eumelanin, pheomelanin, et cetera, but still certainly a melanin. Neuromelanin gradually accumulates in the neurons of the substantia nigra throughout a person's life. Kids have very little, elderly people have lots. When people get Parkinson's they start losing their neuromelanin, and their SN goes pale. The fairly recently-published histology and pathology books I'm using just take it for granted that the loss of neuromelanin is basically a side-effect of dopamine depletion. But I may have been a little too confident in assuming that that's the final word. I just checked the National Library of Medicine website and a bunch of new research is turning up more immediate connections between neuromelanin and Parkinson's than had been suspected. Also, it looks like they're also getting promising results in studies on therapies that involve endocrine manipulation of neuromelanin. Still, all of this specifically involves neuromelanin in the dopaminergic neurons of the SN, and I haven't personally learned, heard or run across anything stating that there is any connection whatsoever between skin melanin and Parkinson's. But I guess the take home message for me is that there is more going on here than I realized, so I can't write off the possibility that there is alsothough I can't imagine howsome emerging connection between neuromelanin/Parkinson's and a person's skin melanin levels. Anyway, as you say, this article is about melanin generally, not just skin melanin in humans, so regardless the Parkinson's link is legit.  19:57, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

All these MBT's including the Merkava, can fit aboard the C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster air transports to be airlifted anywhere on the globe. The Merkava Mk 4 has a 1500hp GD833 Diesel Engine and additional armor, especially up top, for urban battlefields. Ever been to the Holy land? You get all types of terrain there, not the stereotypical desert/arabian landscape that is always seen on TV. There are forests and swamps in Israel, and up north the terrain is especially rough and it snows too. What consensus are you talking about? Israel has had more battlefield experience with the use of armor and armored warfare in general than any country on this planet. The weight of the Merkava Mk 4 is approximately the same as the M1A2SEP. It has more crew protection than the Leopard tank and has an active self-defense system. It also retains the 60mm Mortar which can be fired under armor. BATTLEFILED MOBILITY of the Merkava series of tanks is better than both the M1 and the Leopard. It is true that both tanks are faster than the Merkava but the Merkava was designed with emphasis on crew protection, survivability and firepower, over speed. The Merkava is more survivable in a firepower-saturated environment meaning it can go places the M1 and Leopard cannot. For this reason the Merkava has more freedom to maneuver, which gives more options to it's operators and commanders, and allows more aggressive courses of action. The enemy cannot simply deny areas to the Merkavas by firepower, meaning the Israeli tank has better battlefield mobility than the Abrams and Leo 2.",0

I am firmly keeping the subject: there is no error what so ever in the Bogdanovs book and in their thesis, there is no attempt on their part at lying or at making a bluff out of science, there is people who pretend to be what they are not and pretend to detain evidences of something they barely understand, and who constantly insult the Bogdanovs and anyone who do not have the same opi8nion as they have, who insult the Bogdanovs famili, teachers, physical appearence, life, friends, constantly and in many forum of the internet.
This person is YBM and his associate are: Romnulphe, Voyer, rayon-z, and Max, and their name are to be followed every time YBM appear on a site about the subject.
There is plenty of links about it.
The Bogdanov have already discussed and rediscussed each and every point of the list of so called errors presented by those pseudo scientist, and have proven them wrong and other scientist have intervene too to explain how it had to be understood in theoretical physic, but yBm keep using them as if Igor had never argumented against it, and even do it in a way as if it was because he couldn't argue against it, even a fiew blog after he had got an all explaination about it.
It just doesn't make sens.
He always provocate people by personnal attacks and then reproach them to don't stick to the subject.
Thats a clear line in all his appearences on the net.

Words of Encouragement to user """"Damemk"""" in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda
Damemk, You have come to the same conclusions about Bulgarian 19th Century Nationalistic Propaganda on English Wikipedia.
User:Laveol is one of the most prominent editors on Wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about Republic of Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Language|Culture|Sports and what else not.
He is spending a lot of time working on his cause, pushing Bulgarian Nature in the articles of the domain of Republic of Macedonia.
How far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at Wikipedia:WikiProject_ROMacedonia where he has listed himself as a member.
So just my few words of concern for the Macedonian Articles in English Wikipedia, and the great damage done by User:Laveol and other users with the Bulgarian and Anti-Macedonian Propaganda.
Hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in Republic of Macedonia the things will go in right direction: Removing the Bulgarian Propaganda from Macedonian articles, cleaning them of false fabricated information, and giving the facts to the world, and the views of the Macedonian Science and sources.
I don't have much time now, but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals.

I am expecting that this user """"Laveol"""" will continue with the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of Republic of Macedonia, simply because he is able to, and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda.
Ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the Facts about the Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Lanugage|Culture|Sports.

Damemk, I hope you write something here, at least to show that User_talk:Damemk and User_talk:Ejanev is not the same user.    

Some insight into my user name Ejanev
The only user I am using to contribute to Wikipedia is """"Ejanev"""". It is composed of the first letter of my name """"Emil"""" and my last name """"Janev"""".
User """"Damemk"""" is a separate user. Probably that user name is comming from """"Dame"""" - a Macedonian First name, and """"mk"""" or the code of """"Republic of Macedonia"""".
It does happen that I am from Canada. I was born in Republic of Macedonia and have lived there until I moved to USA first and Canada before more than 3 years.

And yes, having all the false information from the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda ( originating from the 19th century ) and having it into 21st century to be used to negate the Macedonian Nation and all it's attributes by users as """"Laveol"""", is the reason of some of my editing actions in Wikipedia.
I am not the only user/editor from Republic of Macedonia or with Macedonian origin that has the same views for this Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda, that already is infiltrated in the Macedonian articles.
You can watch the contributions of Special:Contributions/Laveol and see that more than 50% of his actions are engagement in negating the Macedonian Nation and its attributes.

"""
Actually, I don't think it's particularly 'enlightening' at all!  First, the essay implies that a person may be inclined to view a number of edits as coming from 'the same person'.  I view that implication as an example of a 'straw-man argument':  A person builds up an (intentionally weak or flawed) argument, solely for the purposes of knocking it down.  That's not particularly enlightening, except that it reveals that people generally have more luck knocking down a position if they've built it up, specially, just for that purpose.
I view the matter more as an example of a commonality of self-selection:  Consider that if you're at the top of El Capitan (natural rock pillar), you will find (generally) two types of people:   1.  Very rich people who can (and do) hire a helicopter to fly there.
2.  Very capable, enthusiastic, and competent rock climbers.
In other words, you don't find there many people who are both poor and handicapped, merely because of where you happen to be.  (and, if you're actually there, chances are that you, too, are either rich or a very good rock climber.  Wikipedia is, quite likely, a 'magnet' for 'control freaks'.  (and others, obviously.)  I've read comments that some editors make tens of thousands of edits.  While I could say, """"Get a life!"""", I don't view such enthusiasm as INHERENTLY bad, wrong, or a problem.  But, I think there may very well be an ASSOCIATION between OCD-type (Obsessive-compulsive disorder) editing, and 'control-freak' behavior.
There are other clues that must be considered.  A person who is acting out a 'control-freak' fantasy, wants to control as much as possible.  Apparently, WP has made it quite easy to 'revert'  to a previous edit.  That ability is not NECESSARILY bad (against vandals), but it implicitly encourages a kind of 'all or nothing' reaction:  If a 'control-freak' wishes to manipulate, as much (and as many) as possible, it's far easier to simply 'revert' ALL of an edit, rather than (carefully and selectively) remove ONLY as much of a 'problem' as actually exists.  Ever heard an old saying, """"When the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to treat all problems as if they were nails.""""  One of the most 'inefficient' routes, from the standpoint of a 'control-freak', is to actually stick around and dispute the propriety of the original edit, and the characteristics of the 'control-freak's actions. 
A 'control-freak' gets his jollies, most readily, by UNdoing what others have done.  (The 'control-freak' feels, explicitly or implicitly, that he doesn't have to 'justify' the status of the article BEFORE his victim's edit!).  If the 'control freak' must actually distinguish between 'proper' posting and 'improper' posting sections, he becomes far less 'efficient' at manipulating others.  (He must spend far more 'valuable' (in his not-so-humble opinion) time READING, and distinguishing, rather than merely reverting!   Consider a hypothetical 'war' between a person who is making a 'house of cards', and another person who views it as his task to impede the first:  The latter person needs merely show up for a second or two, every few minutes, and knock down the 'house of cards'.  Minutes or hours of work is gone, in a moment!  VERY 'efficient', from the standpoint of the 'control freak', but not for his victim.
 Worse, if the 'control freak' must first obtain a CONSENSUS (something which WP ostensibly requires) he is powerfully impeded from excercising his 'control-freak' tendencies.  (I am not considering, here, raw 'vandalism', of course:  Very arguably, it SHOULD be easy to completely revert actual, genuine 'vandalism'.)  It is not surprising, therefore, that 'control-freaks' are far more likely to simply revert ALL of an edit, QUICKLY, preventing consensus, and refusing to justify it in any actual discussion.
Thus, I notice that (in, so far, every case), every 'drive-by deletion' to which I have been a victim involves a person who REVERTS ALL of my edits (Check!), and not merely a portion of them (Check!) and who does so VERY quickly (Check!), who prevents any sort of consensus from forming (Check!), and who doesn't bother to stick around to debate the propriety of the original posting, or the 'freak's' abrupt erasures (Check!).
  Aha!  Things are getting quite clear, at least from the standpoint of the 'control-freak' in question.  But why should a flock of others try criticize the victim, and NOT the 'control freak'?  Is it because I think 'they're the same person'?  ('Straw-man argument')   Noooo!  Consider another saying, """"Birds of a feather flock together"""".   If there were only a single 'control-freak' in the world, nobody else would have any motivation to assist him, or to help victimize his victims.  But there are many 'control-freaks', and each understands that if ONE 'control freak' gets impeded, prohibited, or criticized, or exposed, the next one COULD BE THEM!  After all, I",0

 Korean articles 
I put this on Shabby's talk page and I thought you should check it out as well:

Hi, I noticed you were taking part in the discussion on the Talk:Hwang Seong-gyeong page. I think Bethereds behaviour is ridiculous and something needs to be done to stop his ownership of these pages. He said that he would """"change the pages back until the end of time"""" as he thinks he is right in removing any Japanese reference from """"his"""" Korean pages. There are many reasons why Japanese katakana should be included in these pages (the obvious being that the characters are created by a Japanese company and that every other article includes it bar the few Korean characters). Is there any way to call a moderator or administrator to this debate to stop Bethereds reverts? He seems to have no proper reason as to why he is omitting the information other than he believes Korea is better than Japan (I've read his user page and looked at his previous edits and he seems to be doing anything he can to promote Korea over Japan). Does he not realise that in these games, even Chang and Kim (from KOF) speak in the Japanese language and have never even uttered a Korean word? We need a vote or something to put him right. Thanks.

That is NOT RIGHT AND YOU KNOW THAT!

 POV concerns 
I'm not (yet) going to put the NPOV warning up, but the statement """"Maher is also fair to his conservative guests"""" is getting dangerously close to POV, since I'm sure many conservatives would disagree with this statement. 
Whether conservatives, liberals, or little green men would disagree with that sentiment does not make it POV.  It is, instead, POV in its own right as it's a judgement that a wiki editor made on their own.  It's someone's take on the show, which may indeed be 100% true, but we're also abutting the area of No Original Research here.  If we were to make a general statement about conservative guests being defended by Maher, I think we're on safer territory as it's generally true and easier to verify.
My point being, if you want to add a POV tag, do so.  Your first inclination is probably correct.  Just please cite your reasons here and we'll get a discussion going on how to fix specific issues you bring up.   08:48, 29 August""",0

He comes from a pre-internet age and few digital sources are around. He shares a similar story to Robert Johnson in the USA where he was never professionally recorded. The other matter is that despite evidence being given of well respected sources, these particular admins have repeatedly attacked and vandalized his entry.

"Vandal  

Dear WP Sysop CambridgeBayWeather,

, an ordained teacher of the Hamsa Yoga Sangh cult has been creating havoc for the past weeks by relentlessly inserting the name of his guru, his guru's book, quotes from his guru's book, and external link to their website on the following articles Kriya yoga, Mahavatar Babaji, Nath, and Adi Nath when the majority of the editors (actually all of them) who are experts on the subject agree that his guru is illegitimate, his inserts does not enrich (add anything substantial) the already existing articles, and only aims to promore the personal interest of their organization.

This  wants to turn WP into a propaganda material for a highly questionable (possibly harmful) pseudo-Hindu cult while pretending to be an impartial concerned Wikipedian who only wants to enrich it. The situation is really bad. He has just been banned but as soon as he gets unbanned he begins to relentlessly vandalize the pages with irrelevant and immaterial cult propaganda once again.

It is futile to try and protect the integrity of an article when someone like this person , like the Energizer Bunny, keeps on reverting them and gets away with it without being taught a lesson.

To see for yourself that Hamsacharya dan is really an ordained teacher of the cult he keeps on inserting to the articles and not just a concerned Wikipedian with no alterior motive, please see the following website [List of Authorized Teachers] and scroll down a bit for Hamsacharya Dan Kogan.

WikiAfrica is pleased to invite you as a self-declared African Wikipedian to evaluate the Africa Incubator. WikiAfrica has created the Africa Incubator to support and assist new authors, as they create their first articles and learn the ins and outs of contributing to Wikipedia.

The Africa Incubator is a ‘soft landing’ for new authors to develop articles that relate to Africa. It assists them in becoming compliant and knowledgeable of Wikipedia principles and rules. Based within the Wikipedia framework, the Africa Incubator is fully interactive and enables feedback, assistance and forums.

This is where we need your help! For the Africa Incubator to be successful, it needs the intervention, interaction and experience of Incubator Mentors. We are looking for a pool of active experienced Wikipedians to consistently participate in ’owning’ the Africa Incubator. Incubator Mentors will assist new comers through the editing process. They will also help test and expand the Africa Incubator, and will play a vital role in encouraging newcomers to be Wikipedians for life 

Please visit WikiAfrica Incubator  to give us your honest feedback and evaluation. 
WikiAfrica is a ground-breaking project that is designed to Africanise Wikipedia by generating and expanding 30,000 articles over two years. Find out more about this project here WikiAfrica. To get involved, contact Francis [wikipedian@wikiafrica.net]

Oxonian2006, my tone may sound a bit out of control but I'm not. Issues like this one are very important to me due to my own family history. Now, going further into your comment...unfortunately the knowledge of the occupation of Poland is not as universal as you may think. To many """"the Nazis"""" does not mean the Germans as you suggested. Poland was not occupied by the """"Nazis"""" who came from """"Greenland or Mars"""" or """"Nazi allies"""". Poland was occupied by the Nazi Germany or German Army (Wehrmacht) and at the beginning of the war also by the Soviet Union or Red Army. There were no other German allied troops occupying Poland unless you count Italian, Spanish and other Waffen SS troops marching to the Eastern Front. """"The German-led Nazi occupation"""" you suggested is also incorrect, there was no such thing. Half of Poland was incorporated into the Third Reich with their citizens either murdered or expelled into the """"General Government"""" which was created and %100 controlled by the Nazi Germany, nobody else. 
Therefore he """"Nazi"""" is NOT a perfectly good word to use in this case and never will be.
Now, about the Polanski who in your opinion is not a Holocaust survivor. Well...he escaped the Cracow Ghetto on the way to the extermination camp. He would be dead otherwise. Then he barely survived hiding at sympathetic to him farmers barn avoiding the Germans who would kill him immediately if found. Every Jew hiding outside the Ghettos was immediately shot by the Germans. His rescuers and rescuers family was also killed.  I don't dare to suggest that you did not know about that. Every Jew who survived the war in Poland is a Holocaust survivor and it does not matter if he managed to survive Auschwitz, Cracow Ghetto or by hiding in the forest. They all survived that hell, so did Polanski.  """,0

"Hello, could you first of all, stop the editing of Ministry of Communications to Ministry of Communications & the Arts (MICA)? As explained, its incorrect to refer to Ministry of Communications as MICA or even the present-day Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI). 

About the Mission & Vision. The Mission was in the previous version, but it's not quite correct. Hence the update to align it more closely to the actual Mission & Vision of LTA as an organisation. It's not considered as plagiarism, because it is what it is. It's not about the source (website), but it is the actual Mission and Vision of LTA. For example, if it were a School's Mission and Vision, you'd also listing the actual Mission and Vision as it is stated officially. And that would not be plagiarism.",0

Doug: Are you the judge of whether Watson or anyone else claiming to be the 2nd Coming of the Christ is or is not? No, you are not! He has produced 7 cutting-edge theories and has presented some of them at a major NASA conference. I see them at several locations around the Internet when googling: 7 Seals revealed. They certainly may be questioned as to whether they are correct, but as of now, they certainly have not been proven wrong! I've read them and have concluded that they explain the prophecy of the Revelation better than anyone else; better than anything else on this page. Note: The book Soul Survivor has now proven reincarnation as has the work of Dr. Ian Stevenson at Univ. of Virginia and Dr. Brian Weiss author of Many Lives, Many Masters to name just three examples of many.

I would never waste my time harassing others like he's doing, unless I had alot of time on my hands. I'm going on vacation soon, so hopefully when I return, he will have cooled off. Nobody here needs to be disrespected. 
And, no disrespect to you or your american way of life, but I notice that americans on wiki think they should be right about everything. That's not right. There are other voices who contribute to wiki too and should be able to correct an article without reprimand, disrespect, or having their material (even with reliable sources) suddenly deleted, just because their info deviates from the american point of view on wiki. And then when people provide the info and sources, they get laughed at and harassed about it. That's not right. This behavior motivates others to not look at americans in a good light. I wish people in general were in control of wiki. Sadly, it seems as though the american voice is the only voice that controls and matters on wiki. Anyway, that's my two cents for what it's worth.",0

 Category Junk 

Mae West was many things, but there are some inappropriate categories listed.

1. Listing West as an """"erotic dancer"""" needs some justification, including within the article itself.  Other than performing a notable """"shimmy"""" at the beginning of her career, she isn't known for this, and the article doesn't mention any other instances.  In that case, she is no more an erotic dancer than Elvis Presley or Liza Minelli, maybe less so than Marlee Matlin now  none of whom are listed as erotic dancers.

2. """"Nymphomania"""" redirects to hypersexuality, which states, """"The consensus among those who consider this a disorder is that the threshold is met when the behavior causes distress or impaired social functioning.""""  Even the first line of the article uses the description """"debilitating"""".  West's sexual activity did not and was not.  Like other sex symbols of popular culture (e.g., Clara Bow, and you can probably think of some others), West was promiscuous and had a huge libido.  But they chose an industry and a role where those are NOT debilitating.  

No distress and no impairment means no nymphomania.  Listing her there needs support, especially a clinical diagnosis, or it needs to be removed. 24.63.96.35  """,0

 Thanks, but not quite my point. I'm questioning whether it shouldn't provide an automated edit summary in order that page watchers can instantly identify what the change was when there is nothing detectable. Deleted, undeleted, page protection, upping page protection, etc. is obvious. Reviewed (where there is is no change identifiable even in as much that the page history fails to show any activity) is irritating to very active contributors, such as myself, who suddenly receive multiple change notifications where no change is listed and no edit summary is provided. I am simply suggesting that page curator provide a simple summary ('Reviewed' springs to mind!) as do all of the other tools commonly used here.   01:07, 22",0

"actually, capacitance per say is not a problem, so long is it, along with the inductance (and resistance) of the coaxial cable, results in the correct impedance (75 ohms for AES/EBU). It is the impedance that matters, not the capacitance. Failing to match the impedance (which would happen if you cut the capacitance without a corresponding increase in the inductance) will result in poor performance. Get the impedance right and the only limiting factor will be losses in the dielectric and increasing resistance due to skin effect as the frequency goes up. Even cheap TV aerial coax has a performance vastly superior to plastic optical connects.",0

A tag has been placed on Austin turner, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Pearse in his address to his court martial and his prediction of future events in history would no doubt contrast Edwards assertion - When I was a child of ten I went down on my knees by my bedside one night and promised God that I should devote my life to an effort to free my country. I have kept that promise. First among all earthly things, as a boy and as a man, I have worked for Irish freedom. I have helped to organize, to arm, to train, and to discipline my fellow countrymen to the sole end that, when the time came, they might fight for Irish freedom. The time, as it seemed to me, did come and we went into the fight. I am glad that we did, we seem to have lost, we have not lost. To refuse to fight would have been to lose, to fight is to win, we have kept faith with the past, and handed a tradition to the future… I assume I am speaking to Englishmen who value their own freedom, and who profess to be fighting for the freedom of Belgium and Serbia. Believe that we too love freedom and desire it. To us it is more desirable than anything else in the world. If you strike us down now we shall rise again and renew the fight.

"Well there's been a lot said, if I can just address Kolzene's point first. I don't quite understand your suggestion that the article needs to be split into 3 different ones, what would these different articles be? Firstly let's just overview what is already in place, we've got this article: Technocratic movement (and the sub-articles like Technate, etc.), we've got Technocracy (which is just a disambiguation page), Technocracy (bureaucratic) and Technocrat (derogatory). Then we have Network of European Technocrats, which is part of the broader Technocratic movement. So what you're saying is we need a Technocracy Incorporated article, specifically about that group, detached from the main article in the same way as NET? Well, I suppose that could be done, but remember that that article did already once exist and was then merged with this one. What would this article contain if all the Tech Inc. stuff were taken out and put in a different article? I have to say, I think further splitting of the articles will only create an even more confusing array of definitions for readers. Perhaps we should think about reformatting the above articles into a more reasonable arrangement. The article Technocracy used to be a lot bigger and gave more info on the different groups and definitions of the term, but it was recently trimmed down to something very small, (which I was against doing BTW). So to start from the beginning, we have the word Technocracy, which has acquired many different meanings, one meaning being a Bureaucratic oligarchy of Scientists, this is addressed in the Technocracy (bureaucratic) and Technocrat (derogatory) articles and isn't really relevant here. The other meaning, the one we are concerned with here is that used by the Technical Alliance and Tech Inc. and subsequently adopted by several other groups in 1930's. Then NET, which was essentially a direct branching from Tech Inc., just in Europe, but has adopted it's own ideas, some of which are different to Tech Inc's. I don't really know what is the best way to proceed yet, but I don't think anything should be split or deleted without a lot more discussion.",0

This article seems to have improved from its first review significantly. Most problems are resolved, such as the sub-par prose, which is now very well readable. Some comments on the issues raised in the first review:
 the period dealt with spans approximately mid-2013 to September 2014. This is an indication it may not meet criterion 3a. - As far as I can see, there is not a lot more to say about this young lady so far. While taking in interest in people who are famous because of their parents and because of who they date eludes me, it is no reason to fail criterion 3a.
 Daily Mail may not be a reliable source - There are a couple of references here that could be argued do not come from what is usually considered reliable. However, it is accepted in """"tabloid"""" topics to include """"tabloid"""" sources. Otherwise, Wikipedia would only consist of articles on people The Guardian writes about. Yawn!

However, these things should be adressed:
 Nowhere does it actually state that Wright and Penn are famous actors. That is however necessary, because otherwise one might easily ask why this person deserves a Wikipedia article in the first place.
 The archive links in the references are inconsistent. The style you should use is the one in reference #1 (Link to original page, publiser, archived from and then """"the original"""" as the link). This can easily be achieved by using the cite web template.
 However the first reference is not a good example alltogether, since it makes no sense that the page is from July 28, 2014 and it is stated that it was retrieved on July 19th. Please look into this.
 You might wanna find a better source for the Elvis and Nixon film. Maybe this one even though it is certainly not perfect as well.

No, they certainly do not have a copyright on the flags. They cannot stop anyone producing a very, very close imitation of their drawings. But following the blazon—emblazon argumentation, they may have a copyright on their particular rendering of a flag, even if the flag/blazon is PD. I think the issue is similar to maps: the geodata is PD as bare facts (well, for the time being at least), but a particular map drawn from that geodata is copyrighted. We may draw our own maps, but we cannot copy someone else's copyrighted map.

Besides, I take the liberty to not support either side here. As I wrote above; I did not tackle the issue until now, and I don't feel I know enough about the issue to give an opinion with confidence. I just think that it is well possible that they do have a copyright on their images.

Except maybe in the case of very simple designs (three differently colored stripes, for instance) where indeed a """"no originality"""" claim might be valid. But for more complex flags, that argument breaks down. AFAIK, identical blazons have been rendered quite differently throughout history, e.g. with animals shown in a more """"classical"""" or a more """"modern"""" style. Take for instance Image:Kent Flag.gif. The blazon is """"Gules a Horse forcene Argent"""". Now look at the COA shown there, at our flag, and at the renderings on the website of the Kent County Council... I think they all comply with that blazon, but are all different and IMO show enough creativity and originality to be individual copyrightable works.  """,0

"""Answer to the questions:
Does it still form H2, or more complex compounds?
Does it form compounds with any other elements?
What are its density, melting, and boiling points?
What does it take to convert it back to hydrogen?
Miscibility in solvents?
1) In addition H(1/n)2, where n is an integer > 1, representing the fractional state of a given hydrino pairing, it forms more complex compounds such as hydrino hydride crystals.
2) Hydrinos being a gas, there is no specific density it may have. Detecting the boiling point and melting point of hydrinos requires cyrogenic cooling or exotic pressures. The formation of hydrinos results in increased temperatures. It is unlikely that BLP will place measurement of boiling points and melting points ahead of understanding the catalytic processes which may form hydrinos in the first place.
3) High energy radiation
4) Miscibility is a property that occurs between two or more substances. Hydrinos, being a gas with an effective cross-section much less than ordinary than hydrogen, would be highly immiscible with most substances due to a much greater ease in passing through matter, in such a manner that it will easily escape into space.

 Guidance from Administtrator, October 1, 2010
Just reviewed the Irving article, again.  Notability addressed in the first seven footnotes.  Will move it back into the mainspace unless you have additional concerns.173.59.205.137  
 I think it's ready to go; also see on Cmagha's user page that others have reviewed it positively.  What are the remaining objections, and how do we appeal if there are still objections?  
 Here is the page, Spartaz, if you need a refresher:

Take it to DRV please.  Humbug! 

 Administrator Guidance to Editor, July 11 2010 
Copied from Spartaz User page:
The Irving article has been noticed on the WikiProject New York page; some helpful comments sent back.  Did not receive notice on your G4 decision; we will be asking to move the article back to mainspace shortly.  Thanks for the aid.   
 No. Unless you have addressed the significant issues concerning allegations of misrepresenting sources and the contention that all of the sources are tangential or trivial then this isn't going back into mainspace.  Humbug!

 Since we are citing the Constitutions definition, it is of fundamental relevance to state that Sikhs did not accept the Constitution itself.

[Moved post from Sarah down to proper chronological space; it interrupted my unblock request subsection placed chronologically before it above.   ]

As one of the victims of your repeated and persistent personal attacks and false accusations, I don't think that you should be unblocked early because I feel that a message needs to be sent about your continued personal attacks, blatant violations of AGF, CIVIL and NPA, which are even prominently displayed on this very talk page in your lengthy commentaries about Orderinchaos in particular. I have tried to stay away from here since the ANI was closed, but as you continue making accusations and comments about me, I must say that I consider your comments to be personal attacks and I consider the post that Gnangarra linked to in particular to be defamatory and libelous and I feel that you should agree to refactor those comments, and the other personal attacks you made about editors on ANI, as I see has also been previously suggested by Shell as well. The """"do not edit the archive"""" notices in the ANI archives are designed to prevent people from continuing discussions in the archives, rather than to prevent people removing defamatory material. You claim that you've been """"slandered"""" (actually libeled). I believe everything I have said about you has been absolutely true, however, if I have inadvertently made a mistake and it was pointed out to me, I would redact it. Unfortunately, every time I have interacted with you you have made demonstrably false accusations, accusing me of doing things I had clearly and provably not done at all and so I am rather reluctant to believe that I have posted something factually untrue, but I am quite prepared to go back and re-examine my comments and refactor if I have made a mistake. When you wrote these offensive and defamatory comments about me, I had been deliberately trying to refrain from saying very much on the ANI due to your previous hostile reactions to me and had actually made very few comments, only responding to people who were confused or misunderstood and thus your accusations at that point in time were totally over the top and unfair and did not measure up to the evidence of my posts. Additionally, you are completely anonymous and not known by your real life identity, whereas I have spent most of my time on Wikipedia editing under my full name and am well known and you yourself have even commented about knowing my full name, so I find your comments and accusations defamatory to me in the real world. I feel you should agree to refactor your personal attacks against, not just myself, but others too, and I must therefore support previous requests for you to refactor these personal attacks and false accusations. Please also note that BLP applies to all pages on Wikipedia, not just to articles, Wikipedia:BLP#Non-article_space, and so if you persist in keeping your personal comments about me, a living, known and identifiable person, I must once again for the nth time insist that you provide verifiable proof supporting your allegations and accusations because you are in violation of BLP.

I agree to some of your claims and appreciate your suggestions but I would like to point out that you have removed literally all statistics and some of them are clearly appropriate.

You can find such comparisons in almost all economy section of country articles, such as that one in Portugal. In other words, some comparisons are appropriate and should not be completely removed. As I say, you reverted all of my edits, so I did agree with some of your edits, which I left out or reworded in an appropriate manner. I do agree with the picky statistics, and removed comparisons in industrial outputs. For all comparisons made, I included reason why it is made, so it is made clear that it is not a POV. Some of your claims are vague, such as """"due to its healthy manufacturing base"""", which clearly points to original research. You have also removed the IMF forecasts without a valid reason, which is clearly appropriate to show where S Korea is heading right now and useful in demonstrating the speed at which it is growing. I do agree to the technology section and removed some comparisons. My point is that you can't remove all the statistics just because you/or some Wikipedia readers think it is making comparisons - achievements should be recognized and the best way to do so is through comparison.

See 2000 Amarnath pilgrimage massacre

The cave is situated at a place where Kashmiri extremists have been very active recently and thus the pilgrimage is under the constant threat of terrorist attack. However, many pilgrims still continue to brave the attacks and visit the shrine each year. There were a number of terrorist attacks in the recent past and dozens of pilgrims die in them every year.

Hello. Your account has been granted the """"reviewer"""" userright, allowing you to review other users' edits on certain flagged pages. Pending changes, also known as flagged protection, will be commencing a two-month trial at approximately 23:00, 2010 June 15 (UTC).

Reviewers can review edits made by users who are not autoconfirmed to articles placed under flagged protection. Flagged protection is applied to only a small number of articles, similarly to how semi-protection is applied but in a more controlled way for the trial. 

When reviewing, edits should be accepted if they are not obvious vandalism or BLP violations, and not clearly problematic in light of the reason given for protection (see Wikipedia:Reviewing process). More detailed documentation and guidelines can be found here.

If you do not want this userright, you may ask any administrator to remove it for you at any time.    """,0
"I have read the books, which did nothing to convince me of the author's point of view, but that is not the reason for removing the paragraphs.  The reason was, as stated above, that the removed paragraphs violated Wikipedia standards.  If you wish to provide a link to the books so that readers can access them, that is fine.  However, it is not fine to have material that is original research, nor is it fine to have material that includes ad hominem attacks.  This is an encyclopedia that has particular ways of doing things.  If you wish to draw attention to Scott's work, why not establish your own web pages about it?  You could do a Wiki entry about Scott himself, but remember that Wiki entries need to be neutral and factual, rather than polemical and expressing opinion.",0
"Relations to Kathy Beale 

I would like to begin by apologising if I have upset and annoyed people. That has never been my intention, my only intention is to contribute towards Wikipedia and improve articles involving subjects which I am particularly interested in. However, just because I have been blocked for my actions, that will not stop me from standing up for what I believe is completely right and trying to forge a consensus on facts which I believe certain editors are deliberately ignoring.
I will start with Kathy Beale and why she should be included. Those of you who have been watching EastEnders for a very long time will recall, that Kathy had a major involvement in the Ian's custody case. I will use a few sources:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Fs3VfLUeY&playnext;=1&list;=PL1B973079416F2056&feature;=results_video
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ar2iQeDmwM
- These links is Kathy's direct involvement in trying to rescue the Beale kids from Cindy Beale.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CvgCs5c_Vw
- This link shows that Kathy was involved in the storylines regarding Lucy and Mel Owen, often having to look after the kids when Ian was very depressed - a very important storyline.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSIxlVYDaT8
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx9tCFTWP0Q
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kyf5XoJl58
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP1nY3upeXc
- These show Kathy's strong involvement with all her grandchildren - Lucy, Peter and Steven. She even had to go to court for them. All of that is aside from the babysitting, family meals, Christmases and her death which had an effect. I will make my edit, and I hope afer watching all these clips, people will come to realise what I mean and what we can come to an agreement. I'd go as far as to argue that Kathy is more involved to Lucy's storylines, than Bev Williams - in fact that is a fact. So let us all take stock.",0
"""

 Blanco, Hitler and Mussolini 

Just some small factual stuff, in the section Spain After Franco, it is said that Adm. Blanco was killed by a car bomb, but he wasn't, the ETA had instead placed a bomb in a tunnel underneath the car and exploded it as Blanco drove on the street above.

Also, in the section Relationship with Hitler and Mussolini, it says: """"While Franco ruled undemocratically, he seems to have reluctantly accepted that Spain would be a democracy after his death."""" This isn't true at all, the only reason Franco worked with the western democracies was because Spain was in dire need of the supplies they could provide for Spain's weak economy, and later on, during the 50's and 60's, it was because Franco's advisors realized the need for Spain to take place in the burgeoning international economy. Franco was a devout enemy of democracy, and thought throughout his entire life that it would lead to anarchy or communism.""",0

 Theoretical justification for our tax system? 

I added this sentence to the lede...

""""The two main theories of taxation are the benefit theory and the ability to pay theory.""""

...which ‎Guest2625 removed with the explanation that this entry doesn't contain the """"terms"""" used in my sentence.  

There's a theoretical explanation for the world's current tax system...either that or we're all crazy.  If you're saying that this entry doesn't at all discuss the theoretical basis for our tax system...then clearly that's a problem.  You don't solve that problem by removing the one sentence that does mention the justification for our tax system...you solve it by creating the section that does provide the justification.  In order to do that...you first have to review all the references that I added to the benefit principle entry.  If you're not willing to make that effort...then please don't edit this entry. 

Having already read through all those reliable sources and many many many more...here's my take.  This paper...The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure...by Paul Samuelson has been cited over 5,000 times.  It provides the definitive theoretical justification for our tax system.  Samuelson's argument was that the benefit principle had a very limited scope because of the preference revelation problem...a problem which tax choice effectively solves. That's it...that's our tax system in a nutshell.  That's the bottom line that readers should not have to wade through miles of minor details to find.    """,0

 Unblock request

 In reply to the gravedancing involved and as of yet unpunished Arctic Kangaroo, my edit was: """"This user has continued to prove my estimation about them totally correct, on their talkpage, they are acting as if they did not know this was gravedancing, so I will follow through on my promise to create an account from this IP when the block expires tomorrow, and I will have them dealt with for their obvious trolling, distruption and bad faith.""""
  This was my first unblock request, the text of which can be seen above. 
  This was a message I left to  after he had closed it, by mistake. My edit was: """"I didn't realise you had already closed the discussion before adding my last message, I should have been more careful and checked first. Kind regards""""
  This was the comment I made to Arctic Kangaroo. This is the only edit which matches the accusations laid against me by JamesBWatson when he unfairly declined my block request, the comment was as follows: """"Users like you are the reason why I decided to leave here about 5 years ago. I cannot believe how utterly rude and disingenous you have been. You only took that user to wp:ani because they refused your help. Then you allowed their messages to be deleted which quite clearly show they are willing to undergo teaching, but because it wasn't from you, you didn't like that did you? Without a doubt the removal of barnstars and reaction to the welcome message was beyond the pale, and should have been dealt with by a short admin block, but your dishonesty surrounding this matter is utterly repulsive. I am very, very tempted to create an account just to have you dealt with for your actions"""". I fail to see how this was any worse than what gets said and ignored by many other editors, but I apologised for it and made clear that I understood why I was blocked, which guidelines I broke and that I accepted my mistake. 
  This was the last comment on the ani debate, and the one for which I apologised to Thumperward because it was posted after he closed the debate. The full post read: """"What should you have done?

At that juncture, you COULD have advised him about how to contact uninvolved editors, but instead you chose to take it personally and spite him by taking him here. As for """"rudely"""", would that be like launching an edit war on his/her own talk page?""""
  This was a comment in the debate. It reads: """"I'm not commenting """"on behalf"""" of anyone, I'm just trying to come to terms with why this situation devolved so rapidly. I wasn't aware that IP's were forbidden from contributing here? Or are you trying to suggest some sort of ulterior motive?

 Couple of Qs re notability 

Hi """"Chris"""",
Just seeking information generally. Firstly on Tonbridge Angels' page you amended the criteria for former players to exclude captaincy, and on Margate's removed the section altogether. I'm afraid I missed the earlier section on Margate's page, my mistake. However, """"duplication"""" apart, am wondering about your reasoning of """"vague/dubious"""" as these criteria are ones I have seen on any number of non-league club pages or why the section was not deleted after the earlier addition of Barry Thornley (not by me!) which created it (the section)? On the Tonbridge page I am wondering at what level captaincy would be valid, as once again this criteria appears on numerous pages. Thanks for any info.. Regards.   """,0

 Evidence Redux 

I'll be frank.  The blocking of  came a bit late for my taste.  However, he was found to be in violation of the 3 revert rule, and to again quote the policy which ironically Malke was threatening people with and was himself found to be in violation of:

"""" A bright line exists on edit warring, known as the three-revert rule (3RR). If an administrator has not acted already by this point, then action is very likely, especially if a report is made to the noticeboard. Policy forbids edit warring generally, and editors may be blocked if they edit war, with or without breaching 3RR. """"

I commend  for taking the actions he did.  The subsequent complaints Malke made, and his promise to cease his activity in order to get unblocked a few days later, are a matter of record on his user talk page.  Malke has since deleted the notifications, but they are viewable in his talk page history, and make interesting reading.

After Malke's block on August 19, 2009, I decided I needed to take a step back.  For the past ten days I have busied myself with other Wikipedia subjects.  I now return to this page.  I suggest we talk a bit about what happened, and I also suggest we take a look at what happened here this month, edit by edit.  It continues to seem clear to me that Malke was editing with obsession towards an agenda; his obsession got him in hot water with the admins.  Soon, Wikipedia policy is going to change, as many here know.  I'd welcome some reasonable discussion, and renewed work on the article.   

On closer examination of the history pages of the main article, it appears some of Malke's biased edits, through sheer volume, are still in effect.  I propose going through every edit of his, see exactly what changes of his have survived, and put back all relevant, sourced material.  Once that is effected, we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements.   

Having just returned to WP from an extended absence, I am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article, but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave WP more than a year ago. I recognize Malke's concerns. Material that is added back should strictly follow WP:BLP, ie., it should be directly relevant to Rove, not defamatory, and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources.   

Malke's concerns were one thing, his methods another.  Admins blocked him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule, but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material, and as the admins noted (to quote directly from Malke's talk page history, since he has since, for obvious reasons, deleted all reference to his blocking):

   
   
- *An impartial administrator just did; I don't know you from Adam, and haven't so much as looked at the contents of your edits; all that matters is that you broke WP:3RR, and received a short block for it; if you want to be unblocked, all you have to do is agree to stop edit warring, regardless of whether you think it is justified or not. :==( o ) 

'''I highly commend the admins, and urge others to support their work. These admins had not been involved here previously; they took firm, direct action on a disruptive editor, Malke, who was judged to be making """"untrue"""" statements regarding his efforts.  I again suggest we move past this period of turmoil and examine what changes were made to this article by an editor whose tactics earned him a block and who, in my view, obse",0

Regarding """"wars argument"""" - thanks, I will do that soon.
Here is my thinking, Krugman's criticism is mentioned 8 times in a article. It is intellectual dishonesty (and one  of character) to loudly criticize one school of thought and than refuse to even debate for an hour with an actual austrian economist; where he has debated with politicians """"to boost his book sales"""" in his own words. So if his critic is in any way or form relevant, why not settle it once for all and end with austrians, or if he doesn't want to lose his time on irrelevant things, he has humanitarian incentive (or why call out austrians in a first place?)...  So all in all, it comes to this, either criticizer and critic is irrelevant and should be deleted, or what is in my opinion far better solution, this discrepancy should be there for readers to know and decide for themselves. This could be done in one or two sentences, just a note that he refuses the offer of debate from 2010 although 105 000$ fund for Food bank New York was established; + a link to site.

In fact, I just saw a map shown on TV of Afghanistan on the new English al-Jazeera channel, and it showed Pashtuns covering the same area as the one above. Perhaps this disturbed you for some reason but it shows what's out there in the western area of Afghanistan. If you keep removing my map I will bring an administrator to help resolve the issue.

What evidence is there that anti-Irish sentiment existed amongst the European aristocracy?

"The same could be said that as the president of an organization that is openly biased against breast implants, you're understandably against them.  I am all for voicing your opinion about what you believe in, but it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia entry.  As an objective third party, I can most definitely say that the current iteration of the article is quite biased towards the associated risks and not the device/procedure itself.  As a relatively new Wikipedian I came upon this article to see what all has been written about a subject I've been curious about for some time now, what I found was an article that has been butchered by people with agendas.  Why is it that an overwhelmingly large portion of the article is about the risks of Silicone breast implants when most implants used today are saline?  Why is there absolutely no information about why women get implants?  I would be more than happy to help expand these subjects but I believe it will be quite pointless until those with agendas have moved on, or take their discussion on the controversy of breast implants to the proper page. aktornado",0

I have deleted a long section on the biblical mentions of the Philistines. There's nothing inherently wrong with using the bible as a source, but it has to be done with care, and via reliable secondary/tertiary sources, and that was not being done in this section. The dangers of an approach like this can be seen in the failure to place the Genesis Table of Nations, for example, in context - it was treated in the 19th century work as if it were to be dated from the 2nd millennium, when in fact modern scholarship is just about unanimous in putting it in the Persian period.

 What is a """"scalar force""""?  

At the start of the current article there appears a list of pointers to other article, and the last item on the list says """"For the scalar force that appears in polar coordinates, see the article on polar coordinates"""". I checked the article on polar coordinates, and the word """"scalar"""" doesn't appear there. So, what exactly IS a """"scalar force""""? And why does the article point to another article for explanation of something that isn't even mentioned in the other article? Surely something is amiss.63.24.61.29  
Of course, you are correct in pointing out the absurdity of a """"scalar"""" force. This pointer should be removed altogether, but I have only edited it to remove the absurdity. The history of this article shows that this pointer was a concession to a long, drawn out battle that apparently exhausted all parties and led to this compromise.   
Any single dimension is a scalar- a scalar is simply a single number. There's nothing absurd about a scalar force any more than there is about a scalar acceleration. What is 9.81 m/s^2?- () WolfKeeper (Talk) 

I don't understand the """"corrected"""" version. The acceleration component that it refers to (i.e., the one that arises in stationary polar coordinates) is explicitly described and given the name """"centrifugal force"""" in countless reputable references, including:

(1) """"An Introduction to the Coriolis Force"""" By Henry M. Stommel, Dennis W. Moore, 1989 Columbia University Press. 
(2) """"Methods of Applied Mathematics"""" By Francis B. Hildebrand, 1992, Dover, p 156.
(3) """"Statistical Mechanics"""" By Donald Allan McQuarrie, 2000, University Science Books. 
(4) """"Essential Mathematical Methods for Physicists"""" By Hans-Jurgen Weber, George Brown Arfken, Academic Press, 2004, p 843.

 This has been pointed out previously, with the relevant quotations. I don't think there can be any dispute of the fact that this particular acceleration term is indeed among the terms that are called (in contemporary reputable sources) centrifugal force. Needless to say, it's entirely a matter of convention as to what names we give certain terms appearing in certain equations, but since Wikipedia articles are supposed to reflect verifiable facts from reputable sources, I can't see any justification for excluding this particular fact from the article. I think any discussion of the contemporary (let alone the historical) concept of centrifugal force is incomplete if it doesn't include this. 

There are also other concepts that go under the name """"centrifugal force"""" but that are not yet mentioned in this article. And conversely, there are lots of things discussed at length in this article that are only indirectly related to the concept of centrifugal force. I understand that much of this material has been added as part of a tutorial on general physics being given to placate some of the editors here, but ultimately I think it detracts from the readibility and relevance of the article. 

Overall I think the present article has evolved into a lengthy set of notes that various people have made as they clarified in their own minds certain aspects and implications of the centrifugal force, as they responded to challenges from certain other editors. Sort of learning on the job. That's a commendable exercise, but it doesn't make for a very coherent article, and frankly, the",0

"The name is familiar, but I don't actually have any copies of it. It would be good to add Japanese sources to the gaming articles to expand their reception sections because the inclusion of sources from different nationalities helps to reduce systemic bias and POV. Naturally English Wikipedia will use mostly English-language sources, and naturally there are a lot of high-quality English-language RSes, and these are sufficient to demonstrate a game's notability, etc., but high-quality or major non-English and multinational sources would address Wikipedia's second pillar by reducing or eliminating cultural biases in the reporting. It sounds to me like reviews from GAMEST would be a great addition to Wikipedia for this reason.
For articles on games created in non-English-language countries, I think it's also very helpful for a full grasp of the topic to include reception from the originating culture. So in my view, reviews from Japanese sources like Famitsu or GAMEST should be used to expand the articles on Japanese games whenever possible. (And similarly, reviews from French magazines would be helpful for French games, and Russian magazines for Russian games, etc.). I have heard that Famitsu is considered Japan's premier video game magazine so I think that its reviews for Japanese games are particularly helpful, and I have been adding them to gaming articles recently, but thanks for bringing my attention to GAMEST too. If I happen to pick up any copies of it I'll try to add reviews from there as well. Cheers, -",0

Lone boatman, it is you who have willfully and repeatedly violated Wikipedia's policies by making entire changes to the 'eternity clause' article then threatening me as usual. And you ask me now to stay """"cool"""" as you continue to manipulate editors and possible administrators to cover your wrongdoings. Oh, I am staying """"cool"""". You know full and well that I am staying """"cool"""". If I was not cool I would have deleted your last changes. It is you who made the last changes, not me. Hopefully, administrators will see through your manipulations and make the right decisions. Clearly, you wanted a """"concensus"""" and several other editors suddenly turned up for te first time.

___________________________

JanetteDoe, You are right that the referenced article in National Review is about not changing the fundamental principles of democracy, not a """"constitution"""". And this is why I have a BIG problem with Lone boatman and the three other """"editors"""" who suddenly showed up for the first timee and agreed with Lone boatman. Lone boatman does not want the word """"democracy"""". After I accused him of synthesizing he then took revenge by changing the entire article into a catch all international page in which he redefines 'eternity clause' as a """"term"""" used internationally instead of the colloquial description specific to Article 79 paragraph (3) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. This page was part of the German law page specific to Germany, not an international one which is already covered under a Wikipedia article entitled """"entrenched clause"""". Lone boatman added the additional international data at the top of the page only to cover up the 'eternity clause' article. And again he focused on the word """"constitution"""" at the top of his change. And when I told him he had wrongfully duplicated the """"entrenched clause"""" to pursue his use of the word """"constitution"""" (which I had previously told him Germany does not have), he then added """"Basic Law"""" to his change to make it appear that he is not politically motivated with his changes. Then several editors suddently showed up for the first time and one of them deleted the entire 'eternity clause' article, leaving only what Lone boatman had put in at the top. Wikipedia is apparently no place to safeguard an article, even a properly referenced article, which the article was. And it was not a personal essay on a statute, as I have been accused of. It is an important historic prohibition placed in the Germany's Basic Law regarding the protection of Germany's new democracy.  """,0

{{unblock|That is absolutely false. I absolutely did not """"make a personal attack"""" on you. Dishonestly claiming a false pretext to block me is a reprehensible abuse of your authority. Since the stated reason for this one-week block is wholly spurious, absolutely false, I demand to be unblocked immediately.

Not only did I never make any """"personal attack"""" against you, admins will observe that I actually thanked and praised you for intervening, which I also did in my private email message to you. This pretext for a one week block is absolutely spurious. You're making a minor disagreement on a tangential point on the Talk page into something personal and abusing your authority.

As for your comments on the Talk page:

 I never accused you of making ad hominem arguments, I asked you to calm down  WP:DISENGAGE.

I was never not """"cool"""" to begin with, so it's unnecessary to tell me to """"calm down"""", """"cool down"""", etc. Moreover, you said to me: """"I see some efforts being made to try to work out the differences, they will not be worked out if you resolve to not negotiate and dig in your heels. Respectful discussion free of attacks is the best way to do this ..."""" This implies I had made """"attacks"""" on people in lieu of trying to negotiate a solution reasonably. But like I said, and as you seem to now acknowledge, I never employed any ad hominem arguments (i.e., """"attacks""""). Moreover, any administrator can go to the Talk page and see for themselves that I've gone to extraordinary lengths to negotiate a reasonable solution with other editors.

 You can be right about something and still be wrong  META:DBAD.

I don't know what it is you think I am """"right about"""" but still """"wrong"""" about. But you seem to be implying I'm being a """"dick"""". I challenge you to present any quotes from me evidencing your implication that I've been a """"dick"""", i.e. by making """"personal attacks"""". You'll find you are unable to do so.

 You have engaged in a level of rhetoric that has created a hostile atmosphere (WP:CIVIL), you refuse to relent from your positions and you attack the positions of others with walls of text and barbs (WP:DBF). You've had editors ask you to calm down and you've had admins ask you to calm down and yet you've attacked anyone who has asked you to  WP:NOTTHEM.

Again, this is a false characterization. Every response of mine to others arguments has been to address the facts and logic of their arguments, as I am doing here with you. I have in no way been uncivil either with you or the other editors engaged on the Talk page. I have discussed diverging views and made numerous concessions to others on the Talk page in order to come to a consensus. My replies to others on their positions have consisted of substantive responses on points of fact and logic, never """"personal attacks"""" or """"barbs"""" (""""walls of text"""" might apply, as I've gone to extraordinary length to outline my own views and to support my own arguments with facts and logic).

 # """"Unhelpful"""" is not a word.

Thanks for the correction. I'll reiterate: """"Kindly quote me where I ever employed any ad hominem arguments, as opposed to addressing the facts and logic of the argument(s) put forth. You'll find, Wgfinley, you're unable to do so. So kindly refrain from suggesting otherwise. It's not helpful. Cheers.""""

Incidentally, it is apparently this comment you here regard as a """"personal attack"""" against you. Any other admin can see for themselves I did not attack you here. On the contrary, I merely observed here that you had characterized ME as making """"attacks"""", when I had never done so. You're making this personal and abusing your authority.

 This is the first thing you posted immediately after your previous ban expired (WP:NAM) followed by open questioning of your ban even being valid, it appears you need more time to cool down, 7 days should do.

You have not substantively addressed even a single point in my argument why my previous ban was wrongful. Yet you block me further on an even more spurious pretext  this time an absolutely false allegation that I attacked you personally. Other admins can confirm I never once did so.

 If you come back from this block and engage in more vitriol here again I'll have no choice but to take further sanctions and ban you from editing or discussion on this article per WP:GS.

On your further mischaracterization of any of my remarks of mine as """"vitriol"""", see above.

I would request that whatever admin makes a decision on this that you please substantively address my points here. The stated reason for my being blocked for 1 week is that I made a """"personal attack"""" on Wgfinley. Admins will find that I have never once done so. This block is therefore inappropriate and an abuse of authority. As such,",0

 The precise definition of race is under dispute 

I wrote this to help spread understanding, please make sure to read the definitions of outcrossing on the link.

There is a lot of misunderstanding of genetics and further there is a lot of misinformation that people spread because they WANT you to think that there is no difference between peoples for a political or social agenda, that does not make it so. Humans share 98% of our genetic code with Chimpanzees, yet that 2% defines our differences and is important as is the difference in the human population, no matter how small the difference.

There are obviously differences in the expressed traits between Asian, African and Caucasian. These are different types of humans, if you choose to call the a race/breed or type it's up to you and it's immaterial. My argument has always been that racial diversity should be preserved which is a more neutral position rather than promoting that race mixing and interbreeding is somehow positive.

You and many people that listen to pop culture may think that by interbreeding you are helping humanity and there are lots of myths about how you will create better offspring; offspring that have the best of both parents. This is just a myth told by people who, are trying to say that people are equal, if different. Yes, people are people as Americans we believe that all people have certain inalienable rights but the best position for humanity is for each of the races to exist, separately to be the best we can. If you truly understand the advantages that diversity offers you will agree too.

I personally breed horses. And this is where I'll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic """"learn to breed"""" guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.

What Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it's very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake. You can't through bad human crosses in the trash like you can with corn.""",0

"""==GA Review==

Lead
Built in 1910, it was also the Los Angeles Fire Department's headquarters until 1920 and the residence of every fire chief from 1910-1928. - this can be reworded: in it's current state it does not flow, maybe Built in 1910 as the Los Angeles Fire Department's headquarters until 1920, and serving as the residence for the department's fire chiefs - or something like that.When it opened, it spawned a political firestorm due to the ornate interior and expensive imported materials used in its construction. It has been called the """"Taj Mahal"""" of firehouses. - these can be made into one sentence somehow, as they are closely connected.
I feel the lead should give a brief/short reason why the station was close and what is the current state.

Controversy over the station's cost and extravaganceonly 26 feet (7.9 m) wide but 167 feet (51 m) long. - long? is this talking about length in height or what?The main floor was an arcade stretching from Fifth to Winston Streets with stalls for ten horses, repressed vitrified brick, walls of white enamel tiling, and pressed steel ceilings 21 feet (6.4 m) above the floor.''

Other
There is no explanation as in why it closed. That is one main reason that needs to be elaborated.
I feel the sections could be named and organized differently, like so?

===Construction controversy===
===Operation===

"2012 suburban service reduction 

The May 2012 timetable brought a reduction in the stopping service between Marylebone and High Wycombe/Princes Risborough, with the result that stations such as Denham currently only have one train per hour in each direction off-peak, where previously they had two. In the midst of the mid- and long-distance service improvements as are already mentioned in the article, I feel this ought to be commented upon. At the time I thought it was a temporary measure and that the ultimate aim was to improve the suburban service (longer platforms, higher frequency, stops at both South Ruislip and West Ruislip, trains with faster acceleration – in short, something approaching an Overground-style service), but, as of May 2014, that hasn't happened and despite all the excitement about the Mainline service to Birmingham, the service has worsened significantly for the short-distance user. 92.40.248.181",0

Handle in text:  It is not clear exactly what the alternative  to this RFC proposal is, or what a """"no"""" or """"yes"""" might yield,  so I will spell out what I see here as the best solution. I agree with Gamaliel and Nomoskedasticity that this is a BLP issue and that using """"Filipino"""" alone is utterly unacceptable and POV.   I do think """"Filipino-American"""" correctly describes the subject of the article, and is not an indication of citizenship, but rather it is a demographic description which could accurately be used.  However,  per TheRedPenOfDoom, and MarkBernstein, I think that this may be best handled as Bbb23 and Seb suggested - and how the lead is now worded - which is to not use either identifier in the first sentence, but instead unpack it, spell out in more detail the actual facts in an NPOV manner, in the lead and in the rest of the article which the intro summarizes.  This works and does not take sides in the serious BLP issue.  We further make clear how Vargas self-identifies, which I think is important here, without having Wikipedia editors take a position. As MarkBernstein said, we are not required to indicate nationality or citizenship in the first sentence or anywhere, and TRPoD is right about disclaimers etc.  -sometimes it is best to go at it from a different angle. We also had the same kind of issue at - believe it or not - Bee Gees where there were warring factions who disagreed about whether they should be called English, Australian, or Manx; we handled it by leaving off the nationality, and the wars stopped.   So, I support this wording: Jose Antonio Vargas (born February 3, 1981) is a journalist, filmmaker, and immigration activist. Born in the Philippines, and raised in the United States from the age of 12, he was part of The Washington Post team... etc.  /talk """,0

Re Talk:Dinosaur """"Another error""""
I'd respond to your query instantly except that I'm not going to make life easier for those (not you) who have twice reverted my edits to Dinosaur - if it were not for the reverts I'd have quietly corrected the item. But I've noticed your much more friendly and co-operative tone in our few discussions and the many well-earned congratulations in your Talk page, and I'll be very happy to co-operate with you on any other article if it is appropriate.   

Re Physiology of dinosaurs I'd be happy to contribute. I think I already suggested that the warmblooded/coldblooded debate should be a separate article - in fact Physiology of dinosaurs started life as """"Warmbloodedness of dinosaurs"""" and I was fairly happy that it was coherent and well-structured after my last edit under that title (although of course there was room for improvements). Physiology of dinosaurs looks the kind of article that will spawn further """"more details"""" articles as we find more material.

Re your suggestion of a """"Dinosaur behavior"""" article, I agree the relevant section of Dinosaur is getting too long. But I suspect (totally off the top of my head) that there's too much variation for one article when you consider differences in: time (150M years); size; lifestyle (predator / scavenger / browser / grazer); environment; and specific clades (although clade may not be a helpful grouping, look at lions and tigers). My inclination (off the top again) would be to handle this aspect bottom up, e.g. """"behaviour of dromaesosaurs"""", """"behaviour of large tyrannosaurids"""", """"behaviour of Jurassic sauropods"""", """"behaviour of large late Cretaceous ceratopsians"""" (bound to be different from that of smaller, earlier ones because the big, late ones had horns). Even working out how to structure a set of articles on this topic probably needs input from people with knowledge of specific groups / periods. But I'm game for it, as I think structuring a large set of related articles is a current weakness in Wikipedia (I'm involved in an attempt to remedy that in 1 subject area, History of IBM mainframe operating systems, see the Talk page). 

Re the conflicts, see User talk:Philcha#Dinosaur (period concerned is Jan - Mar 2007) and Talk:Dinosaur#Corrections_urgently_needed (21 Nov 2007). That's twice I've corrected errors in the article and had my edits reverted. In the earlier instance I pointed out the errors on Talk:Dinosaur and other defects and balance issues in Oct 2007 and nothing happened for 3 months. So I edited in Jan 2007 and my edit was reverted almost instantly. My current impression is that a certain clique thinks it owns that article and would rather revert edits not controlled by them than see the article improved by someone who's not a member of the clique and / or who (in the earlier instance) interprets Wikipedia guidelines differently from them. The more I look round Wikipedia the more places I can see where I can contribute, so I don't have time play games with such people.  ([[",0

Just because something hasn't attracted criticism doesn't mean it can't be improved on. YLee's edit makes the summary more focused and fluent. I do find one problem with itthe reduction of the special effects passage. This now reads in its entirety: """"Douglas Trumbull and his effects team were given carte blanche to meet the December 1979 release date."""" Though not inaccurate as a discrete fact, this rather misrepresents the history of the film's special effects work. While some reference to the previous work should be restored, I'd also argue for recasting the sentence to eliminate """"the December 1979 release date."""" The beginning of the very next paragraph states that the film was """"[r]eleased in North America on December 7, 1979."""" This sort of close repetition should be avoided, especially in the lead summary.

The one other point I could see as significant enough to restoresomewhat abbreviatedis this: """"The film came together only days before the premiere; Wise always felt that the theatrical version was a rough cut of the film he wanted to make.""""

Blame homosexuality, the Vatican's second in command claims.""""
2)  http://onfaith.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/guestvoices/2010/07/catholic_churchs_issue_is_homosexuality_not_pedophilia.html   """"I maintain it has been a homosexual crisis all along. The evidence is all on my side, though there is a reluctance to let the data drive the conclusion. But that is a function of politics, not scholarship.""""  Bill from the Catholic League so I think from an objective POV we can say that it has been a crisis of homosexuality with a few other contributing factors but that Celibacy, and Seminary training were not one of them.

I mean that is quite a strong assertion to make don't you think?  the idea that you can blame an institution like the Catholic Seminary for a series of generalized horrific crimes.

"""confess (even though I agree with the author that abstance doesn't work) this article is very POV, toward a liberal side. 

It's not POV if it's true

Just because there is controversy over a subject does               I LIKE WAFFLES                    not mean that a NPOV gives equal weight to both sides. If all (or nearly all) studies on a subject support one POV (as is clearly the case with abstinence; see Sex Education) , then while we should note that there is a controversy there is no reason not to write the most objectively true statements we can about it.

To say abstinence doesn't work is POV. In fact, studies have suggested that abstinence education does work. Abstinence education, for example, has been successful in Uganda. The Family Research Council has a few studies on this issue. Sure, the FRC is a conservative think tank but that doesn't mean its findings don't have validity or merit.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 154.20.204.92   

 Law Section needs work 

The section on laws appears to be complete rubbish.  I've attempted to rewrite it to make sense and be somewhat meaningful but it needs references, timeframes etc.  Who says that laws like this only reduce teenage pregnancy by 0.92%?  When did Texas pass its law?  Is it still valid?  What does the Texan law state are the punishments for teen-teen sex?  Give a case history where the punishment was as unequal as this article says.  What has been the effect of this law?

The original section said something about many goverments, states etc trying to pass these laws but they got killed(?) because of something to do with age of concent laws and human rights.  Give specifics.  Cite a Country/other body (and date and preferably leader of government) which tried to pass these laws and what happened.  Where such laws have been repealed give good examples.

Personally I'm tempted to remove the whole Laws section pending something more meaningful being written.  I'd fix the section myself but I don't have any information on what laws have been passed in this regard.

 Abstinence section 

The absitnence section is still suffering badly from POV problems (both before and after an extensive editing in the last two days).  The discussion of the debate about education belongs in Sex education, particullarly as this is very US-centric at the moment and there is a section there for that (it may be broken out to it's own article as well).  I've tried to edit the article on the whole to improve POV, but some help is still greatly needed  

Added UK-specific details
I've added quite a lot of UK stuff to the article: perhaps someone from the US could add some more detail about contrasting US policies? I've tried not to touch the bits about the causes of TP, so I hope the new stuff's not too POV. I've also deleted some stuff about marriage - I couldn't see what it added.  I'm really up for doing some more work on this article, if someone wants to get in touch to discuss some of the issues.   

Under 19
It may seem illogical, but teenage pregnancy is only considered as such if the mother is aged 18 or under at the time of conception, hence """"under 19"""" not """"under 20"""" - government interventions in the UK and elsewhere take this age bracket as the location of the """"social problem"""" to which this article refers.  It's not a copy-editing mistake, so I've reverted the previous change.  I'm also interested in the comment that """"the term used to apply to girls under 13 becoming pregnant"""" - I've never heard it used in this way in the UK, could you enlighten me? Thanks.   

I wish it was 21. I don't think it's possible to be ready for parenthood nowadays at that age, espeically with the rising cost of living. I also think that technically nineTEEN is still a teenager. They are also young adults, but they are still a teen. Most 19 year olds probably won't consider themselves teenagers and THAT is ok, but they are technically still that..a teen.

Hank Williams didn't listen to too many of their records. He was a country boy and was influenced by swing music, yet he recorded pure rockers. Country music played as much a vital roll in the formation of rock n roll than black music, no matter how some people wish to deny it. Bill Haley, The Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly and many more of the greatest rockers had their roots in country. Chuck Berry was also influenced by it and , if he had been white, would have probably been seen as Country, rather than R&B.; Elvis is allowed to be called """"The King"""", just as much as, say James Brown is allowed to be called """"The hardest working man in showbiz"""", you don't see people who dislike him throwing everything but the kitchen sink in to try and make out it was a """"marketing"""" ploy and their favorite artists worked harder.  02:29""",0

"""== Liquid Fire ==

Daria Huerta invented Liquid Fire. The term """"liquid fire"""" was created in 1960 and the product was invented in 1940. Liquid fire helps burn off blemishes such as warts, boils, and blisters. It is used in many dermatologists around the world. It was also used in construction work to help get rid of walls. They would rub the liquid fire on the wall and let it burn the wall down. Daria Huerta was one of the world's most smartest women of her time. She also created common things such as the coffee cup, pillow, and the sink. The product went into stores in 1961. It was sold at stores like Walmart, CVS, Wallgreens, and Pharmacies all over the world. It was originally called """"Fire in the Water"""" then they started calling it what it truly is """"Liquid Water"""". Liquid water sold for $10.00 per box. Each box contains 7 15x10 jars full of Liquid Fire. Daria Huerta created the Cark. She was playing around with genes from a shark and a cat one day. A year later she created a mutated creature. It was half shark, half cat. She then released it into the wild in 1990. The Cark started destroying the whole ecosystem. They had to destroy the Cark which took about 5 years. In 1995 she then decided it was time for her to quit science so she became a seamstress. She was playing around with yarn and discovered a thin piece that had ripped off which she then used to clean her teeth. This was called floss. In 2000 she created flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and wintermint. Huerta died in 2001.

 Colorado balloon incident 

Greetings. I reverted your addition of a news photograph of the Colorado balloon incident balloon. Unfortunately, Wikipedia's use is exactly like the commercial use for commercial news photography. As the template you used states: """"Use of historic images from press agencies must only be used in a transformative nature, when the image itself is the subject of commentary rather than the event it depicts"""".  It's intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image. 

Even ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography: Wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because non-free media compromises the freely licensed status of Wikipedia. Refer to the first rule at WP:NFCC; non-free images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible. There were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike, almost any would do for the purposes of the article. Wikinews claims that the balloon was low-flying and that photographs were captured by area residents.  

The best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one. The effectiveness of such a place holder will probably diminish over time as the attention on this incident dies down. I've been checking flickr and other photo sites but have so far come up dry, though sometimes it takes a little while for people to bother uploading their photographs.

I hope I haven't given the impression that I do not appropriate your contributions to the article— as I do, especially your efforts to use even and neutral language in the face of a media environment eager to describe the parties unfavourably. Thanks for your contributions!   """,0

As about the Google search, I have been told about references to Z++, mostly in European forums etc. In some cases that I became interested, I had to use a translator (I was shown how to do that) so I could see what was being said about Z++. Unlike you, those folks had looked at the Z++ syntax chart and were discussing its features.
About the use of .h and namespace, your are making a big guess about Z++ without first trying to understand what Z++ is. You are wrong in guessing that Z++ is an extension of C++, the way C++ extends C by porting Simula classes. No, there is no chance of confusing Z++ files with C header files. The notion of namespace is quite extensive in Z++. Please read more carefully before commenting.
You are wrong in guessing that Z++ is in competition with C++. It is not, nor I care what C++ can or cannot do. However, in order to provide a perspective for illustrating ideas, one has to make references to other known implementations. C++ is such a minimal subset of Z++ that I can simply use C, Simula, ADA, Eiffel and APL in order to provide context for understanding the contributions of Z++ to software development.

The link you provide states that """"45% of the rail market in Sweden is privatised"""" that therefore makes saying """"Rail transport in Sweden is privatised"""" a falsification if more than half of the entire market is still owned by the government. It doesn't matter whether the rail market was """"liberalised"""" into different companies under state ownership e.g. SJ, something cannot be described as """"privatised"""" if it retains a majority of government ownership, because it is therefore nationalised, the opposite of privatisation. To describe the Swedish rail market as privatised and then list a state owned company which comprises it in the very same sentence is nonsense and this is exactly what you have written.

""""Rail transport market is privatized and companies include SJ.........."""" - In this sentence you have made it sound as if SJ is a private company which is untrue, since if the person reading clicks the SJ hyperlink, they will be taken to an article which states unambiguously that SJ is a government owned enterprise.

A much better thing to do would be to explain that the majority of passenger transport by rail in Sweden is operated by state owned companies such as SJ as well as the government run Lokal Trafik in place within each of Sweden's Län such as HallandsTrafik, Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, SkåneTrafik etc. etc. etc. and THEN to explain that some sectors of rail transport are privatised such as the transport of cargo. This would therefore align the content of the article with the reference you presented above, which states that the majority of rail transport in Sweden is still government owned (with 45% being privatised).

Since judging by your other edits you are a right winger with a serious beef against anything government owned, you could then satisfy yourself by writing that state owned SJ isn't the most efficient of rail networks, something which a lot of Swedes themselves agree on as far as I have seen. In my own experience delays are common and travelling with SJ can be expensive.

Already about 25 years old when she caught young Christopher’s roving eye, her mother was glad enough to have no more convent bills to pay, and as son-in-law to secure an up-and-coming young man of gentlemanly manners, who asked for no dowry.

Morison did not find anything related to FIlipa's dowry AND the truth is that Filipa’s mother was NOT paying any “convent bills” because Filipa was so privilegded that she lived at the Monastery of Santos belonging to the elite Military Order of Santiago where she had ALL EXPENSES PAID, as a """"Comendadora"""" just like her cousin ANA de MENDONÇA (King John II's Mistress) and her aunt VIOLANTE NOGUEIRA (nanny of King John II's aunts) and even participated in the management of the All-Saints """"Comendary"""". Morison even invented that his “Colombo peasant” was an up-and-coming star, a prodigy as if the mother-in-law, Isabel Moniz, already knew in 1478, only 2 years after supposedly washing ashore penniless (and not able to speak Portuguese or even Italian) that the wool-weaver was going to be a famous STAR in 1493. FURTHERMORE: Filipa's marriage in 1479 HAD to be AUTHORIZED by King John II who was MASTER of the Comendadoras of Santiago. Contrary to what Morison and his supporters of the wool-weaver tale wrote of this fantasy marriage, it was impossible for Filipa Moniz to have married a non-noble two-bit weaver the likes of that Genoese Colombo who had supposedly washed ashore only two years prior from parts unknown with no money, no education, no ship nor even a job in that closed high-class society of Portugal—a noble society so restricted that the Captain of Madeira actually arrested his brother's noble widow for marrying a Nobleman below her station.(1) There is NO DOUBT that Filipa’s husband had to be her equal in social stature and not any wool-weaver. The whole tale invented by Morison of a peasant marrying a Noble Portuguese Captain’s daughter is a perfect example of how inaccurate have been the history books on the history of Admiral Cristóbal Colón.
The motivations that bring an author to take such wild liberties with the truth are not intended to be dealt with in this book, however it is something that should alarm all readers because the established pattern had always been one of accepting the """"myth of the Genoese weaver"""" and then twisting the known facts to fit into that tale while at the same time discarding important facts that deny a peasant birth for the discoverer..... Don Fernando Colón who wrote that his father was of noble lineage and not a peasant laborer form anywhere as others were: """"Falsely calling him a craftsman ... [as such the Admiral] would not have learned so many letters or sciences ... especially the four main sciences ... Astrology, Cosmography, Geometry and Navigation ... The admiral was a man of letters and of great experience, and did not spend time on things manual or on mechanical arts.(2) Today's investigations and scientific research confirms that Don Fernando Colón was right and that his father could never have been the wool-weaver Colombo, or Pigeon but was instead a Kõlon, or Member of some special noble family.""""

"""== Blood fetish ==
Regarding blood fetish: please don't suggest to people that:
 - a common way of finding out whether a person would be safe to engage in bloodplay with is for them to go to their local blood donation organisation, who check blood if it is safe and contains no diseases before it will be stored.
Using a blood donation organization as a proxy STD test is highly irresponsible; if the testing is not 100% perfect (and in never is), and the person trying this is positive (and presumably anyone who is considering doing this considers this to be entirely possible), they will almost certainly (because of pre-test blood pooling, and the very large blood volumes involved) infect one or more unwitting third parties with a potentially lethal disease.

Instead, they should get tested at their local sexual health clinic.    

People just wanting to make sure are no more likely to have an STD than other first-time blood donors.. I don't see your point: If that kind of carelessness goes on things would happen *anyway*  (Α⇔Ω ¦ ⇒✉) 

It's reasonable to assume that people who take part in high-risk activities are at higher risk than other members of the population. In epidemiology terms, it's assortative mixing among people with high risk tolerance; people who take part in one high-risk activity are more likely to take part in others, including taking part in these activities with multiple partners; and no, you can't trust your partner who tells you """"I've never done anything like this before, either"""". Consider the outbreaks of HIV in the regularly-tested adult movie industry; this in a population that take part in high-risk activities, and yet are all tested monthly.   

Hmm I guess that makes sense, kinda

I would be interested in reading if you feel like creating articles for """"assortative mixing"""" and """"risk tolerance"""" maybe  or   (Α⇔Ω ¦ ⇒✉)

I'm not familiar with the article or the subject of its concern, but I fail to see how saying """"X does Y"""" constitutes an actual endorsement of Y.  If such a method is indeed commonplace then, regardless of the advisability of such method for practitioners of said activity, it should be included as part of the article on that activity.   

Karada, I think you miss the point here.  Just because certain behavior is inadvisable does not mean Wikipedia should not state that people engage in it (if indeed they do) and describe it.  Certainly, the encyclopedia should not ENDORSE it (but then again, neither should it endorse anything elseNPOV and all that), but simply stating that it happens and describing what it is hardly constitutes an endorsement.  If we were to remove all content that describes inadvisable behavior, then we would also have to remove Collectivism, Fascism, Socialism, Christianity, Communism, Totalitarianism, Anarchism, Democracy, New England Patriots, Detroit Pistons, and Houston Astros.   

It's also worth noting that there are some bloodborne diseases that we can't yet test for.  (Prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease comes to mind.)  In addition to spreading these diseases to one's blood play partners, one would then potentially infect one or more innocent bystanders each time one donated blood.  Most jurisdictions also bar donations from individuals who have recently (in the last 12 months) come in contact with another person's blood.  Lying to the nurses when they ask about this stuff could conceivably make you civilly and/or criminally liable for any morbidity or mortality resulting from a tainted blood donation. (talk)

Hi, I see you have changed infoboxes for Beverley & Market Weighton to infobox settlement.

For those that are coterminous with a local government district (which are usually large cities / unitary districts or equivalent—such as Liverpool, Leicester, and Bristol), please use Template:Infobox settlement.""""

As for as I can determine we should be using the UK Infobox for these places not the settlement box.

  

The coat of arms added to the infobox for Beverley is not current and so should not be in the article as far as I can see.  

 Edit war and the three revert rule 

May I make you aware that the three revert rule prohibits users restoring material more than 3 times in a rolling 24 hour period. You appear to be engaged in an edit war at Beverley and are not contributing to discussion but enforcing preferences upon articles that others object to.  |  Talk   

I had a right to remove this as you do not have a consensus. Four editors have commented they do not want that infobox, whilst you have continued to revert to it. I will be reporting you for breach of 3RR (despite a warning), which may see you loose your editting privlidges. I'm also displeased with your edit summmaries and comments on talk pages which appear to be disparaging.  |  Talk   

I've reported you for 3RR. However, at this stage I must also express my concern about your comments at Talk:Market Weighton and your edits to Manchester which are incivil and distruptive respectively. This does nothing but harm Wikipedia and harm your reputation.  |  Talk   

PS please re-read WP:UKCITIES (not WP:CITIES as you keep referring to). Manchester has the distinction of being a local government district, whereas Selby etc do not. UKCITIES states that local government district ONLY should use Template:Infobox settlement. However, don't take this up with me, please resume debate at Talk:Beverley to achieve a way forwards.  |  Talk   

I think at this stage you're likely to incur a much greater block on your account as well as bring more attention to your editting style. Remember, do not distrupt Wikipedia to make a point. Your edits to Manchester are not in good faith and starkly so (you are gaming false claims of consensus). Have you not considered what maturity and respectabiliy level appears? I do not believe you are being conductive to the good of the project and I suspect you would agree. Why not rethink your approach?  |  Talk

"Please do not remove this as it is sourced documentation.  It is here for those who want to know more about the TIGHAR organization you so whole heartly promote.  It is by author Mike Campbell.    

The TIGHAR-Nikumaroro Fiasco
Two years of speculation and hype came to a numbing climax on
March 16, 1992, at the National Press Club in Washington,
D.C. At a crowded news conference receiving national TV
coverage, Richard Gillespie, executive director of The International
Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery [TIGHAR], unabashedly
announced that the Amelia Earhart mystery “is solved.”
Since early 1990, following the group’s first excursion to Nikumaroro,
a 3.5-mile long coral atoll in the Phoenix Islands, about 2,100 miles
southwest of Hawaii and three hundred miles south of Howland Island,
the national media had touted TIGHAR’s theory that Nikumaroro could
be the final resting place of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan.
The “evidence” Gillespie presented included a battered piece of aluminum,
a weathered size 9 shoe sole labeled “Cat’s Paw Rubber Co.,
USA,” a small brass eyelet, and another unlabeled heel the group found
on Nikumaroro during TIGHAR’s highly publicized return there in
October 1991. These items, elaborately displayed and labeled in a glass
case, all came from Earhart or her Electra, according to Gillespie.
“There may be conflicting opinions, but there is no conflicting evidence,”
Gillespie said. “I submit that the case is solved.” Gillespie then
bit his lip and looked down at the floor — a curious yet revealing display
of body language for someone claiming to have solved one of the
20th century’s greatest mysteries.
Gillespie and Patricia R. Thrasher, TIGHAR’s husband-and-wife
team, theorize that through a navigational error, Earhart and Noonan
overflew Howland Island and landed on a reef on Nikumaroro during
low tide. There they died of dehydration a short time later. The plane,
they said, was washed over the reef when the tide came in and now lies
under 2,000 feet of ocean.
The April 1992 Life magazine featured a six-page spread penned by
Gillespie, who cites Navy pilot John Lambrecht’s July 9, 1937 report:
“Signs of recent human habitation were clearly visible [on
Nikumaroro], but “repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any
answering wave from possible inhabitants.” Gillespie called this report
“hugely significant” and “tragically inadequate. What had not been
done in 1937 had to be done now. We would have to search
Nikumaroro.”
Gillespie credited two retired military aviators, Tom Gannon and
Tom Willi, of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, for the theory’s origin.
“Using celestial tables, Gannon pointed out that on the morning of July
2, 1937, the rising sun would have provided the precise line of position
Earhart said she was running,” Gillespie wrote in Life. “By flying
southeast along that line, Noonan could be sure that, even if he missed
Howland, he would reach an island in the Phoenix group in about two
hours. Clearly it was the safest, sanest course to follow. I traced the line
on the chart and read the name of the island: Nikumaroro.”
This supposition was convincing to some, but Devine wasn’t
impressed. “There is considerable information in Gillespie’s rendition that
can be faulted,” Devine writes. “One example is his attempt to foster a line
between Howland Island and Nikumaroro. He presents Earhart’s last message
as ‘We are on line 157/337 ... We are running on line.’
Earhart never reached Howland Island. Earhart never
saw Howland Island, therefore Howland Island is not a reference
point for a landing on Nikumaroro. Earhart’s authentic
last message received by Coast Guard personnel on board
the Itasca, and recorded by Commander Thompson, related
no reference point: ‘We are on line of position 157-337 ...
We are running north and south.’ Earhart was not flying east
toward Howland Island or Hawaii. She was on a course, a
compass course or line of position 157-337, which terminates
on the island of Saipan.1
With Our Own Eyes
– 163 –
– 164 –
Earhart was not adept at navigation, and may have stated
her reading from a pocket compass she carried on her person.
She was probably and almost certainly stressed by ensuing
events, especially if Noonan had been rendered unconscious
during the almost disastrous takeoff of the overladen plane.
If Noonan had not been incapacitated, I assure you that he,
one of the best air-and-sea navigators of that period, would

 Wikipedia lying liars & their lies...  http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America.",0

 """"disputed"""", """"Judea and Samaria"""" and other such nonsense 

This revert violates multiple policies and guidelines. To begin with, there are an abundance of sources that clearly say that the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights were occupied in 1967 and remain occupied to this day. The usage of """"disputed territory"""" is POV, it reflects the extreme minority view that these territories are not occupied and disregards the overwhelming majority of sources that say that it is. This is the chosen language of the right wing of the Israeli political spectrum, and it is not in compliance with NPOV to use it in the encyclopedia's narrative voice.

"I am blocked for making personal attack, i wonder what are these  , , , , last one is an abuse. the statement in question was in response to a threat by the same user, Renee, , which was noted as something which could escalate into legal threat by another user here , my response that the concern person appears to be mentally unstable  or a paid member of the group, was based on my short discussion with her, about a topic, i noticed that she did not wanted any information to be presented on wikipedia, about that particular group, taking help from admins who have declared their WP:COI .

Other user's also noted that Renee's approach is threating . My stand is not restricted to any particular group or person, but my concern is more about the direction wikipedia is moving into, as noted before, the talk page of the concern topic is now deleted, my objection remains same, there was a link on that page, which pointed towards previously deleted article and i noticed comments from 4 member's only, one was user:Jossi who has admitted that he is on pay role of prem rawat second was from User:Bksimonb who works in PR team of brahma Kumari, both of these user's have admitted their direct involvement with the respective groups, third person was User:Reneeholle, fourth user was Don. Renee has not admitted her paid involvement with this particular group, but her edit behavior clearly showed the same, Moreover there is NOT A SINGLE NOTE FROM ME ON HER TALK PAGE as i simply ignored her threating messages, which were moving more towards legal threat, as noted by more then one wikipedia editor.

I suspect her paid involvement with the group, while we were working on a temp page, about the subject, (on advice of another admin User:Will_Beback), and there one statement was made that there is dispute between two groups, and reference given was court docket, (which was taken as it is, from wikipedia's french twin of the subject). She removed the dispute section from temp page and stated that judgment is in favor of one party, and reference given was some blog !! Giving reference  of a blog, after removing a court docket from a temp page, indicates some problem, or something fishy. This heavy biasing and attempt to reduce information from wikipedia is harmful for future prospectives of wikipedia project, As the talk page which i am referring to has already been deleted, so there is no trace of that particular discussion left, if this tendency of curbing information from paid member's of corresponding groups is not checked, it may lead wikipedia into a wrong direction, or may be in that direction which is not intended.

My direct involvement with article's is bare minimum, mostly i am on talk pages, discussing the matter and letting informed people make the edits once it is agreed. Regarding calling a group a cult, is something which is based in WP:RS if there is a reliable source which refers a group as cult, I write honestly that the group is cult, as per this particular WP:RS and hence respective member's are referred to as cult member's.

I did not filed any personal attack request at notice board, for all the abuses made against me, for the simple reason that i believe that editor's are free to make comments whatever they feel is appropriate, even for abuses that were placed at either my user page or talk page, i have never taken the matter beyond placing the link for the same. 

But I am surprise to see that a comment in response to statement made on my talk page, by another user, about first user, can tantamount to personal attack, given the fact, when it is made for a genuine concern that the said thread appears to be legal in nature. My statement was either she is a paid member or mentally sick as i could not find any other reason for such threats when t",0
"Clean up/Update page

I am not disrespecting the page or the promotion, nor am I suggesting for anything for deletion, but I believe that the page can do with being updated to the same layout as similar pages use, like having all of Cage Warrior's events put into a organised box, which shows what event it is, where it's being held, when is it being held etc. References are also needed for the information on the page to help back up the page's defence if it were to ever be nominated for deletion, as there have been problems in the past of even major MMA promotions, such as Bellator and the UFC have had pages merged and even deleted. Also current champions needs to be updated, as I don't think that part of the page has been changed since I first noticed it back a few months back. Also some of the champions also have poorly laid out pages, again something that actually needs to be updated otherwise it may face deletion. I will offer my assistance by doing the first thing I suggested and put the events into a box to clean that up, after then it's up to someone else to tidy the rest of the page.",0

"""-A VERY DISTURBING STATEMENT

Well, I don't know if you really mean to give a full picture of the case, but we could include this one:
 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm
 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/
 
Who are the web site of Jean-Pierre Voyer, a kind of model person for mister Messager/YBM, and who spred a quiet special form for ideologie, which goal is to play with words and how to defend and argue about things who do not exist, how to play with words and """"fuck others"""" as phrased on his web site, and essentialy, how to display a superior attitude in order to effectively use the communication on internet to their full interest, by using the circumstances frame of the dialogues. This include displaying lies as being facts with such a forcefullness as to convince others.
It is called: postsituationnisme, ideologie who is followed by YBM, together with a sympathie to the 3rd reich, and a, by some, called pseudo-Hégelianism.
YBM run his forum where he defend the man and his positions, with as much furore as he dispells those of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
You will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of """"mass communication"""" and a weapon to convince anyone of anything.
 
I am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle.
 
I hope you will excuse my very late assertion or révélation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years.
Actually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
 
No need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed.
 
Why so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met?
They were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions.
 
I consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J. Baez paper on the subject if it hadn't been for Messager and Voyers' questionnable work in the name of very questionnable motives, all accomplished to serve a completely useless ideology.
I think that this will teach us all a lesson regarding objectivity and our hability to evaluate a given problem properly, and to be able to use our sense of sceptisisme ans sound judgement.  On a more general way and even more central here, our power to distinguish between agreeing to a given opinion based on facts, and being manipulate in doing so for all the wrong reasons.
 
This information compleete the picture and gave it its true mening, even if it is by showing how meningsless a huge part of this affair was.

"""One of my friends, whose father was second senior commander in the Israeli Intelligence Service and involved in the Raid on Entebbe Airport, is now a senior Minister in the Israeli Government. I've instructed them to find and kill the people named below and Mr Ken Winn-Pope who has tried to have me killed several times and told thousands of lies about me. Mosaad don't mind the real Al-Qaeda helping them to kill these satanic monsters they agree they are the common enemy not the Americans, Moslems, Christians or Jews. I want them dead their head blown off their shoulders or burnt to death for what I've witnessed they've done to Thai people. My friend Ronnie in the Israeli Government has known me for about nine years, they will be killed that is 100% guaranteed http://thailand.ahrchk.net/takbai/ part 3 ... some of the people in this film were friends of mine, 150 young men in total killed all innocent people killed by Shinwatra_sylvester-Napier-Cowell's satanic mafia... they were there thinking I was going to arrive to get rid of the problem (the satanists) but I did not know they'd gone there to wait for me... they've killed most of my friends in Thailand most are now dead.

I have met a group of the real Al-Qaeda terrorists in Asia about two years ago and told them who had lied to them about the Americans and how they'd been tricked and brainwashed, the Americans are not satanic. Ive given them the names of the people that terrorised my life and asked them to kill these people who are satanists which includes a man called Winn-Pope whom I believe lied to my wife to turn her against me. Bob Craig-Wood is another name they've been given as well as the Shinawatra-Sylvester family all of whom are satanists. These families kill children and young people to get rich. I was physically (many times) and mentally tortured in Thailand due to their lies http://thailand.ahrchk.net/takbai/ part 3 this is the work of The Shinawatra family (former WW2 Gestapo families descendants who claimed to be Thai by stealing other people's IDs)... they've killed many thousands of Thai children during the past ten years many many many and tortured many young innocent people to death in the most unimaginable tortures you could never believe someone could think of using, very very very evil... They strapped one girl under a truck then drove it flat out down a highway to petrify her into submission/obedience, others they did this to were petrified to death, very very very evil creatures never trust the Shinawatra Sylvester mafia and their associates Ken Winn-Pope aka John Berisford aka Richard Irwin and he's also claimed to be me.... he is one of the people that helped arranged the game of """"rape"""" in Bangkok many girls their lives ruined by this game an absolutely terrible man.. there have been several cases where they wired a 18-23 year old man up to the mains electricity and electrocuted him for up to nine hours with the cables connected to his private parts, I heard one time this happened and searched furiously to find out where they were doing this in Bangkok. I also heard them torturing very young children physically torturing them for many many hours.. so do not think I am a bad person asking for these satanists to be killed unless you do not care about children and young people who've done nothing whatsoever to deserve to be tortured (there is no justification for torture)..

I lived in Thailand for many years and believe The Spirit World exists... I have witnessed many sureal and extraordinary things happening, sadly some very very bad things... If you have a problem in Barbados then advise your police about my comments below it may help all of you solve the problem..... The British do not understand that Satanism exists nor do they understand The Spirit World exists and is used by satanists (Home Sapiens Satan) to harm (Homo Sapiens Human) human beings. It is not unlawful to kill satanists they are no different to a dangerous rabied dog, therefore it is not the crime of murder or manslaughter to kill them. You can train dogs to """"sniff out satanists"""" just like they can detect drugs.

What you cannot do is pretend that the UN itself favours territorial integrity over self-determination, when the exact opposite is the case.

As you are well aware, Gibraltar, as a colony is not a part of ANY other state, therefore cannot affect the territorial integrity of a state of which it does not form part.

Ignore that, I was looking up something using Twinkle (an automated script) and I didn't intend to tag the article. Anyways, I think I've replied to everything, and I think we're pretty much agreeing on most things. As for any strife between UKRD and SABRE, I'll just state that there's been plenty of ill-will and bad feelings between UKRD and USRD/CRWP, more so with USRD. Several editors, spearheaded by Jeni, have taken any opportunity at international collaboration and problem-solving as an opportunity to claim anti-American sentiments and scream that we're anti-British. (That's why I commented the way I have about SABRE, because I truly want to cover the group in an appropriate manner, but I don't want to be accused of being anti-British.) I'm sure they feel the same about us in reverse. For the most part though, UKRD is pretty quiet and inactive these days, CRWP (Canadian Roads WikiProject) is a bit more active and USRD is quite active. We're in the middle of a stub-reduction drive with the goal to expand 2011 stubs in the year 2011.

Leaving out Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa for a moment, do you mean that you doubt he received recognitions such as this? You seem to be making the point that because you cannot find these recognitions in the press that they are somehow forgeries or myths? Hey, they ain't the Nobel Peace Prize but they are not fake. You seem to be mixing up three issues; 1) whether Hubbard led an extraordinary life and 2) whether he received extraordinary recognition as a humanitarian and 3) how Scientologists generally regard Hubbard.

The main thing here on Wikipedia is that we cannot have original research which means that information cannot be added unless there is a respectable source to back it up, such as a website, news article, etc.  Just because someone read it somewhere or saw it on TV, doesn't mean it can or should be added to this encyclopedia.  Also Wikipedia is trying to clean up its trivia sections, because for the most part this type of information is not notable enough and it tends to be random.  These trivia sections also tend to be just lists of random information, which Wikipedia is not.  I would recommend that you just let it go, as more than likely, in some time (hopefully sooner than later) all this trivia information will be removed or added into the articles.  I hope you keep on editing though and try to make sure that you stay away from trivia, and to always source your edits.  Thanks!

 About Operating Mode? 

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am so sorry to bother you, but I've seen your post on Processor Register, the original text is copied to bellow

| IA32e || 8 || 8 || Early concept of EM64T, coded name """"Yamhill"""". the register were extending from 32 bit to 64 bit. unlike x86-64 this design do not come with additional general purpose register(r8 ~ r15)and lack of 64 bit MMU and address mode. support 32 bit address mode with PAE for maximum compatibility with legacy application. early Prescott, Tejas and Timna were the only implement of this ISA and later is replaced by EM64T.

That is so interesting and amazing. Besides, I wonder the information on Operating Mode. Is the original IA32e mode a sub-Mode of protected mode or a new mode like it in AMD64? Does the original 32-bit protected OS need to be changed from the scratch or just provides extension support for those new introduced 64-bit instructions? That is most amazing thing for me.

I am sorry to bother you, I was just a computer science student when I knew it and I am merely a computer hobbyist right now. Thank you with my best wishes.   """,0

 Terminology 

They are substantives derived from the French verb """"tracer"""", which normally means """"trace"""",[9] or """"trail"""" (as in """"he escaped without a trace"""").[10]

The """"trail"""" bit, along with its explanation, doesn't seem to make much sense to me. The verb """"tracer"""" is commonly used in French slang to denote fast movement. In the lexicon used in footnote [9], the most accurate definition would be II A 3: """"Marcher vite"""", (""""walking fast"""")and """"filer"""" (""""to go fast""""). This is consistent with most of the synonyms of """"tracer"""" that denote movement, such as """"aller très vite""""  or """"courir""""  .

It ties in with the fact that parkour is described as """"moving around obstacles with speed and efficiency"""".

And finally, it also corresponds to the article about """"traceur"""" on the French site: """"tracer au sens familier de se déplacer à vive allure""""

Well, let's try again (one more time).
Re """"""""commonsenual"""" = WP:OR. Regardless of sui generis it has all the characteristics of belligerent occupation (Glantz et al.)"""" """"Commonsensual"""" is not OR. Occupation sensu stricto is something quite concrete, and it is regulated by various international conventions. For instance, Guggenheim lists three different forms of occupation, and one of them refers to something quite unique. Therefore, we can speak about the """"occupation sensu stricto"""" and """"occupation following an armistice"""". That is what I mean under """"commonsensual"""" occupation, and that is how a reader will understand it.
Re belligerent occupation, I do not deny the fact that some sources do describe it in this way; however, other sources (majority of sources) use different terminology. Therefore, the reference to one more source that uses the terminology you like does not change a picture much. I propose to present both viewpoints - you reject the very opportunity that a second viewpoint exists. Therefore, it is your arguments that do not hold water.
Re Malksoo, please, re-read his works again. And, since both you and I can draw different conclusions from different pieces of Malksoo's text, below is a quote from his own explanation of his own position, made specifically for us:
"""" The Baltic Sattes were occupied in June 1940 and annexed (incorporated) by the USSR in August 1940. Thus, both occupation and annexation DID happen. The fact of annexation - and that the USSR proceeded with its policies from the presumption that these territories were its own, not occupied - changed the nature of the occupation, if not in terms of law than at least in terms of political realities. For example, when 1980 Moscow olympic games took place, the olympic regatta took place in Tallinn. This cannot be a typical occupation situation.However, it is important that the article would make clear that in the eyes of the predominant Western opinion and post-1991 restored Baltic States themselves, the Soviet annexation remained illegal. In this sense, illegal annexation equals extended occupation and the whole debate is a pseudo-debate. The annexation - since it remained illegal - did not create any extra rights to the annexing power, the USSR. If the article makes that aspect clear, I would be perfectly fine with the title of the article being changed to """"Occupation and Annexation of the Baltic States"""". In fact, I would recommend such change because it takes more precisely (closer to the facts) into account the complex nature of the Soviet rule in the Baltic States.""""
What else do you need? Malksoo clearly says that in the case of the Baltic states both occupation and annexation took place, and we can speak about continued occupation in this sense (but not in others. P.S.) llegal annexation equals extended occupation. In other words, we can speak about occupation in a context of the state continuity of the Baltic states, and I never argued against that. Again, what synthesis you accuse me in?
Re """"there is no bridge between the Baltic and Soviet/official Russian positions; there is no in-between or continuum of scholarship, it's one or the other;"""" Wrong. There is a Baltic position, position of different foreign states (which was different from state to state and from time to time), positions of scholars (western, Baltic, Russian), Soviet positions (different during 1950s-70s and during Perestroika) and official Russian position.
Re """"From Glantz to Malksoo, a belligerent occupation."""" Glantz is an authoritative expert in the military aspects of the WWII, not in the legal aspects; Malskoo does not consider Soviet intervention in 1940 as a military operation at all. The only aggressive step, according to him, was a naval blockade.
Re """"Baltic citizens became a lower class as their homelands were """"colonized"""""""" Probably. However, other sources tell that the real economic and political situation in these republics were much better than in other parts of the USSR, hence extensive influx of migrants. Was it possible if they had a colonial status?
I expect you to treat my arguments seriously.  """,0

Q.  How are the barrels rotated?

A.  The rotational force is delivered by two hydraulic drive motors operating off of both main aircraft hydraulic systems (A+B).  The motors deliver their torque to gearbox in the Hydraulic drive assembly.  This in turn delivers the force to two drive shafts.  The forward one goes to the rotor assembly on the GAU-8 itself, while the second delivers it's power to the ammunition drum.

Q.  How long is typical spin-up time?

A.  While the system is capable of operating at 4200 rounds per minute, it is limited to 3900 while installed in the aircraft.  Since the GAU-8 has 7 barrels it needs to spin at 1/7th of the firing rate.  Basically since it's rotating a touch over 550 rpm the spin-up time is almost instantaneous. 

On another point the statement on the gun gas on affecting the engines is complete rubbish.  During the firing of the GAU-8 the engines ingest so much gun gas that the engine igniters (think super spark plugs) must fire to ensure a stall does not occur.  The engines also will ingest so much soot from the firings that they need to be """"water washed"""" (have water and a mild cleaning solution misted into the engines while running at approx. 80% power) periodically to remove soot from the blades.  Anyone who has had to clean an A-10 will tell you the gun gas goes just about everywhere aft of the nose.""",0

"""==Ongoing issue==
Several editors have expressed concern at your edits to the Spirit of St. Louis article. Reviewing the case, I agree that the edit seriously skews the statement to a non-neutral point of view. The difference between """"first"""" and """"first solo"""" is a very major one, IMHO, and cannot be allowed into the article as-is. Alcock and Brown clearly make the first non-stop flight, by removing the word """"solo"""" you are creating a false statement in the article. This is a serious problem.

I see several attempts to discuss the matter both here on your talk page and in the Talk:Spirit_of_St._Louis talk page, but I have seen no responses from you to date. This is another important wikipedia policy; change is fine, even radical change, but if it results in controversy you should address the concerns. Simply put, you have not done so.

Do you have any evidence that this is indeed a new editor and not just 303 abusing the right to vanish?

And what evidence do you have not to AGF?  There are 3,000,000 people who have contributed to wikipedia. If indeed 303 has returned, on what basis do you make an accusation of abusing a right to vanish?  He left in good standing and would therefore not be evading a ban or block. Keep your speculations to yourself, please.  
Considering that you banned me for two consecutive periods of 14 days after speculating that I was a sock puppet of a retired German I think I'll ignore your advice, Tyrenius. Just look at the text, spelling mistakes and context of User:Brixton Busters (first?) edits and tell me again that I should assume that this is a genuine new editor.

There was absolutely nothing wrong with Gaimhreadhan's tone in the referenced diff, he was respectful and discursive. Frankly, Domer48, you are continuing with the same insulting behaviour you use elsewhere. I am just composing my responses to the Arbcom you are disrespectfully ignoring by bulk-editing the Great Irish Famine article, and I will also be drawing to their attention this disgraceful and harassing comment you just made.  

I'm going to move this thread to User talk:Brixton Busters where that (brand new?) editor can then comment on whether they have recently edited on WP using a different user name. If the references to 303 are summarily removed again, I will take it as a strong confirmation that my assumptions (made on the basis of textual and contextual analysis) are correct.

I don't see anything wrong with letting bygones be bygones; what would be wrong is giving an experienced and knowledgeable editor (now using a different user name) the same latitude and licence we would give a newbie.

 Goodbye everybody 

And what on earth is wrong about this article, specially if settet back where it originally belongs?
I do not accuse people to be socket puppet, I do not insult them with harsh and very illustrativ words, I do not call their articles for garbage or for saying nothing usefull, or for being idiots, nor ignorant, nor do I pretend that they do not contribute with anything on the talk page and never did, nor do I revert other users contributions, as YBM and rjb specially and mainly, as well as some other new users on the page like Maru that night and previous days did, and som other users belonging to the same side of the story.
If I had to be banished for that so had ybm and rjb and maru too and for a much longer period of time and their text to be removed, in fact all of them that night, as they didn't say much else but cynical and fruitless comments on other people works and destructiv critiscism who wasn't justify.
I tried more than 4 times to make them come v´back to ttheir mind and to sopt healding oil to the fire, but it didn't helped. They just had too much fun harrassing users all around the talk page, unpunished.
An objectiv analyse of the page will not only take much time but will most certainly show how true what I state here is.
There is a text that I do not found, an article with the copy/paste of the writting exchange between me and mister Jean Pierre Voyer, where he clearly stated his doing in this affair and his cooperation with YBM in the making of falsification of evidencies, and his arrogancy and proudness in doing so, added some discrepencies in his words and a major amount of respectlessness, and you have the picture of the person behind this all story.
I also received private mails from a mister Rupley, who is (which is) the name of one of YBMs' web site with plenty of litteracy of the kind of Voyer, and with links to Luven, also an ybms' website of the kind. It does not concern the Bogdanovs affair, but concentrate on the theories who corroborate the making of such a fake story and its justifications in doing so.
It's a hobby of some sort, like some like Shakespeare or a special branch of philosophy or politic or a sub for us mostly unknown special branch of a political - philosofical - opinionated - with social ramification kind of organisation, touching a very small group of individuals inclosed in their believes. 
There is plenty of the like all over the world, their reason for adding to those ideas are those people life and choices, which I do respect, but in that case, those idiosyncrasies (thats my own choice of denomination and not theirs)are being punched ininto the reality of a lot of people and involved real ideas.
I think of course about the balancing act of inplanting those high flying ideas to the reality of the thousands of internet users by imposing their vues inthis Bogdanov affair. By vues I do not mean the apparent version of the fact given by YBM about the validity of the actual thesis. No. It isn't what it is about. It is more complex than that. It is about playing with people reactions in a situation of confrontations and playing with lies. Creating stories, ideas, like gossips who have no bund in the rality but who will nonetheless create a reaction in the people who are witnessing it at the time, and build on further from those reactions, and add more and more stuff to keep the tension and the artificial affair going on.
It might not be as complicated as it sounds to bring those ideas to live, as it very quickly get a dynamic of its own who keep repeating itself, if some element are implemented along the way.
It has roll this way for 2 years now, and the scenario are pretty much the same from a Forum to another.
One can see the same scenarios coming up, the same elements who keep coming back, the same strange behaviours at odd time, and the same surprising reactions when prooven wrong: a war take place, fill with denials, wild accusations, insults, personnal attacks, anything goes type of scenarios, with a lot of drama and tension in it, and many people getting injured, and leaving too. 
mostly those who came with the unbeatable arguments as I saw it so many times on fr. physic, from june to november 2004.
Looking at it after without having a part of it, give the priviledged view of the whole thing in a very short period of time , in one view, and here all those flaws are very obvious and it seems estonishing that nobody noticed it at the time. The game is very clear that way, and it was clear for me that there was something wrong going on, something who wasn't right, a mismatch. 
And i seek after what it could be.
It was evident that the main person involved didn't have clean floor in his bag, and that he was hidding something but also that he was clearly lying and very """"good"""" at it, very good",0

""":::* I'm not using jabs or insults of any kind.  """"Greek-centric"""" means """"centered on Greece or concerns relating thereto"""". That's an accurate description of the view that things relating to Greece use words (in English) derived from Greek-language Hellas on the basis that Greeks themselves prefer this term. If this were a discussion about Germans wanting everything about Germany to use Deutsche in English too, that would be a German-centric concern (i.a. a concern centered on Germany, Germans, and their preferences).  NB: I actually know Germans who insist that we should stop saying """"German"""" and """"Germany"""" (and that the Spanish should stop using Alemán), and everyone use """"Deutsche"""" and """"Deutschland"""", so, no, it is not a red herring fallacy at all, but a comparison chosen carefully (though not carefully enough; see a bit later). Your own counter however, is a straw man fallacy; no one said anything about transliterating vs. not transliterating, so the """"Ελλάς"""" argument is a complete non sequitur.  I do agree that Hellenic is an English word, and concede the point that the Deutsche comparison wasn't very apt after all; I was focused more on the situational than linguistic similarity when I chose it.  A better example would be expecting our articles about Japan and the Japanese to use Nippon and Nipponese to better match the native name of the country; these are in fact words in English. It would actually make  sense to do that than to do what's been proposed here, because """"Nipponese"""" has no confusing alternative meaning, unlike """"Hellenic"""" which commonly, probably  commonly, refers to ancient Greek culture in English, not modern.  —  ☏ ¢ ≽ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ≼

As you can find out that any good thing which comes from India is not real Indian / Aryan / Hindu but is imported from outside to India and we Indians are basterd offsprings from that .No new to we!! The great Alfanso Mangos are not local from Konkan region but are brought to India by the Portugies and such other numerious theories put in this new world firstly by the British and later by Amiricanus. Brother Iranians i have read little history of Iran. As we all know that originaly all Iranians befoure the birth of Islam were not muslims but Aryan as the word Iran itself stands for littrley as the dewwlling of Aryans outside mainland India. And what happned when the Arabs now converted to Islam attacted to Iran ?? Were the gret Iranians who now boast that they are the creator and founder of this wrestling art able to protect the own country and ther religion ?? No!! No!!. And to escape from this attct wher the Iranians flead ?? Even to China !! O.K NOW TELL ME WE Aryans/ Marathas / Hindus / Indians fought 1000 years to Islamic invision and reuled and 200 years of British rule and now where are we and where are those grate Mughals/ Brtish / Afghans/ Pakistanis/ Turks / ETC . Thre truth is that we Aryans / Marathas / Hindus / Indians not only surveyed but overcome this invision and eat those invaders and will eat in feauter. We were succesful not only to get freedom but also keep alive our Arya/ Hindu religion along with our gods , traditions , educations such as Ayurveda , Yoga . Dance , Music and all other properties.
I dont want to get involved in to more discussion because i am alone and in my surrounding neberhood yor fans and brothers are present. I am awere of this fact as anyone can gess from the present condition of India.

2) The objection that the WWF wrestling in the world is facke , circus and not worthy to call as real wrestling and those who perform it as wrestler. Yess. I do agree. I have seen those WWF entertienment on cable TV sINCE 1992 and from the begining i was desliking to this Americanus beggares play. But in reality in my surrounding i have observerd great wrestlers and seen how much respect our Maratha society gives to these wrestlers.The traditional Maratha wrestling and wrestler has many sides and aspects , i will discuss it later but any way one can understand it if he is clever.Allthough these Indian wrestler are not successful in international competations such as Olympics , But if you see the ecomomic and weather conditions of India you may find the answer.In our Maratha society wrestiling is a good social title and way of life such as Docters and other professionals.   I use to workout and do exircise when i was in school and college and aimes to earn great body. I never exirsised in traditional Indian mud wrestling gym but in western kind of modern gym and before that some traditional exirsises and other like cricket , boxind etc.
I am owner of good body and realy have loved and perpormed workouts so i belive that i have right to say somthing about wrestling.
3)  As we can see now that the western world is now accepting the importance of Ayurveda and othe Aryan traditions and properties so in neare feature this Aryan art may see good days ans enriche the humanity.",0

 Frat Pack 
The Frat Pack is a 1990s-2000s era nickname given to a group of male Hollywood comedy actors who have appeared together in many of the highest grossing movies since the late 1990s, including Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, and Steve Carell. It was coined by USA Today in a story from June 2004.USATODAY.com - Wilson and Vaughn: Leaders of the 'Frat Pack' Before USA Today dubbed this group the Frat Pack, Entertainment Weekly referred to them as the """"Slacker Pack,"""" but this term is rarely used.  Meanwhile, EW had earlier used the term Frat Pack to describe Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Edward Norton, and Ryan Phillippe, but this usage has not been seen elsewhere. Since then, EW has dropped the """"Slacker Pack"""" term, and also began referring to the group as the Frat Pack .  The name is a take-off of the Rat Pack, a nickname given to a group of entertainers in the 1950s and 1960s combined with the shorthand term for a college fraternity, a reference to the group's popular film, Old School. In December 2007, Italian cinema magazine Nocturno published the first 70 pages dossier completely dedicated to the Frat Pack phenomenon.

 The Pack 

The USA Today article which coined the Frat Pack term listed Jack Black, Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and brothers Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson as members of the group.  By 2006, Steve Carell was also included in the Pack when USA Today published another article.  Carell claimed membership when hosting Saturday Night Live. Though he did not use the term """"Frat Pack,"""" he did say he was """"one of those guys now"""" and specifically referenced Stiller, Vaughn, Ferrell, Owen Wilson, and Black.

A year before citing Carell as a member, USA Today tagged him, in addition to Judd Apatow, Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Mindy Kaling, Nancy Walls and Leslie Mann as the Frat Pack's """"Junior Varsity."""" USATODAY.com - Carell just wants some love Kaling and Walls haven't been as associated with the group elsewhere, but Details Magazine has cited Apatow (in addition to directors McKay and Phillips) as """"The Frat Packagers"""",The Power 50: DETAILS Article on men.style.com while Paul Rudd was cited as a Frat Pack member in the New York Post, among other publications. In an interview with The Advocate, when questioned if Knocked Up will officially welcome him into the Frat Pack, Rudd speculated that he is a """"pledge"""" that hasn't """"been initiated yet into the brotherhood."""" Issue Number 980 | Big gay following: Paul Rudd | Advocate.com  

The members of the Frat Pack often work with certain directors multiple times. Wes Anderson is a college friend of the Wilsons and directed them in both Bottle Rocket and The Royal Tenenbaums (which also starred Stiller) while Todd Phillips directed both Old School and Starsky & Hutch. Adam McKay directed Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.  Judd Apatow is the writer/producer of several Frat Pack comedies including Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. He made his directorial debut with The 40-Year-Old Virgin starring Steve Carell, and followed up with Knocked Up starring Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd, with a cameo by Carell. Apatow was also a cocreator of ''[[The Ben Sti",0

"By going through the websites I was capable of establishing a final evaluation for all the websites. I noticed that all four of the websites have a dark background (dark gray) and a light font on the writing (white). This makes it easier and clearer for people to read. Also, enlargement of the font would have made it more improved. In my opinion, leaving the whole text in all the websites in a normal font and not an italic font would be much more readable particularly to old people, and people who have sight problems. In addition, while looking into the data in the websites, you can clearly notice the politeness of the text which makes the websites suitable for people from all age groups. From searching the websites, I have observed the fact that there are completely no advertisements or commercials which help the reader to realize that the websites are reliable. Hence, some of the data entered in the websites are taken from unfair sources. For example, Graham Browely is the ex manager of the band, thus, he is expected not to be supporting the band and imply negative points concerning their new album. Also, Mike Jones is the current manager of the band; it is predictable of him to pronounce all the positive points about the band for the sake of advertising their new album. All websites are provided with quotations that are told by important people. It is essential for people who are interested in the subjects of the websites to also be interested in what important people have to say about the issue. This helps provide people with what they are looking for. I could not help but notice the link added on the end of the page in Mike Jones’ website which works perfectly well. This link is helpful for all people who are fans of Mike Jones and it leads them directly to his personal profile. Graham and Mike Jones’ websites show the date. It is apparent that Mike Jones’ website is more up to date than Graham’s. It is essential for a website to be up to date to stay interesting for the people viewing it. In my opinion, the most suitable website is the Joan Hoarse magazine website. The only thing that is missing is the date. The date gives the readers the feeling of loyalty that they are reading something that is new and interesting.

This statement is incorrect. The Executive Order that Bayh passed did not require employees to join the union, nor were they ever required to join. Also, the order was passed in 1990 so it is pretty much factually incorrect. Here is the link to Executive Order 03-35, which reprints the original executive order and extends it during Kernan's governing time period. They were required to pay at most 85% of union dues due to courtcase Nass v State, which I am also including a link to. However they were not technically members of the union simply covered by their collective bargaining agreements.

 Problem with the Fundamentals Discussion - This Was Already Erased Please Investigate

Hello, My name is JohnHistory. I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume """"Good Faith"""" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume """"good faith"""" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.
I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.
I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.
Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not """"assuming good faith"""" or """"positively contributing to the consensus"""". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for """"Making a point instead of wanting to edit"""". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the """"TALK"""" page says no writing will be allowed that involves """"general discussion"""" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts. Additionally, the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or potentially scandalous to the President o",0

Show 'n' Tell

A question for   It may seem an odd question to WP purists, but considering the importance WP places on reliability of secondary sources, why does WP not require a same or similar vetting process of its editors, particularly those who seem to speak only for themselves?  The entire concept of requiring contributors to discuss/argue with a username is absurd in its most basic interpretation.  For all I know, I could be spinning my wheels fighting for accuracy with a demented, mind game-playing geek living in inner Mongolia.  It is imperative, in my mind, that those who demand respect offer up some sort of evidence, as I have, of their actual ability, credibility, reliability, accountability...  their authority to control.  If it's required of the sources, it should certainly be required of those who quote them and write about them.  Similarly, how do I """"call for consensus?""""

CONCLUSIONS 

Fibromyalgia is a clinical syndrome... Medicines that affect pain perception, sleep, and mood have been useful and should be integrated with activity, exercise, and educational programs. Most patients with FM observed in tertiary referral centers report little change in their symptoms over time. The outcome is directly related to psychosocial factors, including past and current psychological distress and work status or disability issues. As with any chronic illness, patients in the community do better than those observed in specialty clinics. Ten percent to 30% of patients describe being work impaired from FM. Physicians should discourage inactivity and disability because, if these are prolonged, there is an adverse effect on prognosis. Finally, patients have found a diagnostic label to be reassuring, and the diagnosis has decreased costly testing and health care use. ...

Reply: I added another, different, quotation from the same article that helps firm up how Russell felt on the subject. I  believe this added material compliments rather than hinders the presentation; it makes it more conclusive. 

My statement that Russell never suggested organized prohibition on using blood represents the conclusion of a Modus Tollens argument. However, rather than speculating about what Russell did or did not suggest, my statement should have read that Russell never organized a prohibition on using blood among his fellow worshippers. 

Modus Tollens would have us accept that had Russell, as president of the Watchtower organization, organized a prohibition on using blood among his followers then we would have seen organized prohibition on using blood among his followers. Since there is no record of such an organized prohibition among Russell’s fellow worshippers then the Modus Tollens argument form has us conclude that Russell never organized it. The underlying premises of this particular argument are 1) that Russell applied his presidency and that 2) his fellow worshippers acted on his presidential initiatives. There is ample evidence that Russell applied his presidency, and that his fellows acted on it. Hence, it is not my opinion that Russell never organized a prohibition on using blood among his fellow worshippers. Rather, it is a logical end to a valid argument form based on evidenced premises. 

For the time being I have removed the statement about Russell and organized prohibition on blood under his presidency. If you dispute the validity of what I write above then please offer logical refutation, keeping in mind that logical constructions and conclusions are not at the mercy of preferential outcomes (i.e., private opinion). I make the latter comment only to demonstrate my commitment to logical conclusions is above my commitment to any personal opinions I may presently hold.

RfC: The Correct Name Of The Video Game (Independent Of The Article's Title)

Foreword: as the section's title indicates, this matter is completely irrelevant to the title of this Wikipedia article.

The concern right now involves the correct title of this video game. One position is C: The Contra Adventure, the other is simply The Contra Adventure. The latter is supported only by the assumption that the large """"C"""" in the game's packaging case and manual is nothing more than a """"logogram"""" and not part of the actual name.

There is weighted evidence that supports the notion that the official name of this video game is C: The Contra Adventure. Here is a sample of reputable sources, out of a pool of several:

http://ca.ign.com/articles/1998/09/17/c-the-contra-adventure
http://www.amazon.com/C-Contra-Adventure-Playstation/dp/B00002STIG
http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/196860-c-the-contra-adventure

http://klustr.net/contra/games/
https://contrapedia.wordpress.com/c-the-contra-adventure/
http://contra.kontek.net/games/games.htm

Further, the other games in the Contra series have a similar design to the name on their packaging:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_III:_The_Alien_Wars
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Hard_Corps
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Legacy_of_War
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Shattered_Soldier
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Corps:_Uprising

They are universally and unanimously accepted as having the colon and the text that precedes it in the official title.

The strongest evidence that supports the title of C: The Contra Adventure is present directly in the video game's instruction manual, on several pages:

I just wanted to thank you very much for you input in the ANI discussion about vocal ranges. It is a very frustrating issue because it affects literally thousands of articles. You are the first person in the dicussion to understand and address some of the big concerns I have about what Tribal44 is doing. The problem is so widespread now (because it involves so many articles) that I don't even know where to begin to try to get the mess cleaned up. I'm sure her initial intentions were good when she thought it would be a good idea to put singers' vocal ranges into their articles, but when editors started reverting over and over again, and she kept reverting back, she obviously realized there was a problem. I can't get her to understand that even though a particular fact can be sourced, doesn't mean it's worthy of being included in a Wikipedia article. (However, many/most of her sourcing fails the reliability test.) Since this involves a huge number of articles, and not just a couple articles, how do you get Tribal to stop doing this in articles?

 Commercial Variants of Rogue in Japan? 

In 1991, there is """"Fatal Labyrinth"""" (Genesis/Megadrive, 1991) which could be considered as the first commercial variants of Rogue (because it took a lot of ideas from rogue with some extra features) but it's not so good and successful.

""""Fushigi no Dungeon"""" series (starting from """"Torneko no Daibouken"""" in 1993) themself are the most successful titles in Japan and start the trend of Japanese console roguelike games.

Fushigi no Dungeon have much tighter game balance, so that the challenge level is just right. Some role playing games (such as Climax Landers and Evolution) have also imported some roguelike concepts (primarily the randomly generated dungeon), but honestly not to any satisfactory effect, since the randomly generated dungeon plays little significance if battles take part in a different environment (namely, the orthodox RPG combat engine). Without its effect on playability, a randomly generated dungeon would in fact feel featureless and boring.

How they can be the variants of rogue?
- Feature one class which is warrior-type or Jack-of-all-trades. Supernatural powers are rely on items.
- Simple stats.
- Dungeon theme is a lot like rogue.
- Item sets like Potion, Wand (or rod), and Scroll. """"Furai no Shiren"""" also add Pots which are work as containers or item manipulating tools.
- ETC.

Like any great leader Catherine realized in order to become a major player in the European trade industry she must spread her empire far beyond its limits. Although she knew the implications if she were to fail she advanced on. She defeated the Ottoman Empire, which was said to be the Turks greatest loss. She expanded her country more than 200,000 miles, giving her empire more ties to European art and culture.
Catherine often referred to herself as the “despot of enlightenment”, this was due to her on going pursue of knowledge for herself and for her country. She did this by writing a series of educational manuals for the Russian youth. Although this was an important accomplishment in itself her greatest educational contribution to Russia was the Smolny Institute for young noble women, which became the most profound school of its time.
Catherine was a patron of the arts and obtained an enormous collection, which is known as the Hermitage collection occupied the entire Winter Palace (Residence of the Russian tsars). Her influence became so wide spread that many various French writers wrote about her. Including Voltaire, calling her the “Star of the North” and “The Semiramis Russia.",0

, I really don’t care whether this article states that the suspect origins are Sino-Korean or not (largely because I think the theory is a whole bunch of Korean nationalist propaganda). However, if you’re going to edit the article, at least use grammatical English. Instead of writing:

Write:
On the other hand, some scholars have suspected that the real reason for the refusal may be Japan’s worry about the possibility of finding evidence of the Japanese imperial line’s suspected xenogenesis therein.
“Xenogenesis” comes from “xeno-”, a prefix meaning “foreign” or “alien” (like the “gai” in “gaikokujin”), + “genesis”, meaning “origin” or “creation” = “foreign origin”; it is mainly used in biology to mean something different, but I think the rarer usage will be understood here.  12:15, 1 February",0

Moving the page is not really worth while, but a recognition of the alternative name in the text seems to make sense to me.

On the subject of the proposed merge with ancient egyptian multiplication, the two techniques, while relying on the same fundemental mathematical principal, are very different in practice. These multiplication schemes are specifically about practice, not theory. The people that use/used these techniques use them empirically.

 Skepticism regarding the existence of ISIS 

Hi there.  Perhaps I'm behind the times though I do try to keep up with the """"news"""" and with """"global"""" events, but, I get the feeling that ISIS does not really exist.  Just as there is an excellent chance that Al-Qaeda does not really exist.  I was especially inspired to post this comment when I saw in the first paragraph of this article use the neologism """"jihadist"""".  It doesn't take much brain power to know that there is no one in the world, besides maybe a few deeply stupid solo acts who keep up with thew western media, who refer to themselves as """"jihadists"""".  That is a habit of english speaking people to combine two words from different languages -in this case, arabic and english.  Similarly, there is no centralized organization known as the Taliban, no organization or action known as """"Islamist"""" no organization known as al-Qaeda.  Notice also, that even the purported mission of """"ISIS"""" is not Islamic in its nature.  I know what folks want to ask: then how is it that words like jihadist, islamist, taliban, al-qaeda, and ISIS exist?  Its called orientailsim.  The Palestinian scholar Edward Said wrote extensively on the history of english speaking people, and other imperialists, who purposely attack and misrepresent Muslim peoples.  It started with the Crusades.  I don't mean to be a no it all, but ought we just believe what we are told?  Is there a way to find empirical evidence that they do exist?

"The very reason why there are only 52 bits used for addressing in PAE mode is that the very first 8086 processor using segmentation to address physical memory, where segment register such as CS is 16bit but referring 20-bit long segments after shifting 4 bits to the left. Keeping this schema, if there were 32bit real mode, then 20 bits (used for referring segments) + 32 bits (base address) = 52 bits (for logical addresses). But this is not the truth, but just a guide to draw the reason why. In Intel64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, it says M is an abbreviation for MAXPHYADDR, which is at most 52, where M is used in PDE, PTE and PPDE without further explanation. But I don't believe, for AMD64 architecture, that would be the extreme limit for the physical addressing. If further AMD64 processor gets rid of legacy mode completely, then there would potentially 63bits for addressing physical memory rather than 52bits, like it in Itanium architecture. That might be wrong, but just put a stop to end this topic.",0

Dear Woolworths Foundation Board of Trustees,

As you requested, here are the faculty recommendations regarding the qualifications of the Umbridge Twins (Mike and SB_Dolores) to assume the duties of Headmaster here at Woolworths School of Political Dramaturgy.

We were especially impressed by the recent production in which the impressionable young students of Woolworths School of Political Dramaturgy were inducted into the long-forgotten practice of employing Parliamentary Bill of Attainder.  The symbolic allusions to the Trial Scene from Alice in Wonderland was an especially brilliant maneuver.

We are confident that, with the Umbridge Twins in charge, our students will quickly learn all the well-known hoary practices from the rubbish heap of political history dating back to the Forgotten Realms of Hammurabi.

And, at the end of the term, all the students are cordially invited to Go Jump In the Lake.

"To ERS and others. I think LK's frustration appears to stem from a personal belief of injustice in that he believes the link to templars.org.uk website is being removed with an inconsistent approach to the Wikipedia policies. This article does contain links to other websites that contain a great deal of unchecked or unverified information and it appears that he seems to want a level playing field. But I have emailed him privately to ask that he puts his position a little more diplomatically and I will the first to edit or scorn any more sarcasm. Equally, having looked at the history of changes, Elonka does need to show some consistency here and apply these hard and fast rules to other links if appropriate. That inconsistency could easily be interpreted as a personal grudge, hence the obvious friction. The question of external links is quite clear in Wikipedias's policies. If a site offers reliable resource material or is a good point of reference that is relevant to the article, then it can be included in line with those polices. I have briefly read the history section of LK's link and it does appear to be good information and is also well set out. It is neat, tidy and well formatted. This does perhaps seem curious to LK where some of the other links here have all sorts of advertising pop-ups and ticker-clickers with an obvious advertising and revenue bias. You state that you want proof of the charitable nature of the site but has that also been queried of the other sites that are plastered in adverts? Again, consistency needs to apply to prevent stoking of the fire. I will therefore check the Charities Commission entry for this organisation and see what their accounts say. That will clearly show if the management of the organisation is drawing any financial gain which would put in a clear COI position if added in by him. But, does that totally exclude a site if it still provides good reference material. One could argue that Microsoft's website should not be referenced from the article on Windows as it is a clear commercial entity. LK has pointed out Elonka's own entry page, but perhaps not in a very complimentary fashion. On that page she has included links to her own site which does feature an advertisement to her book. So I come back to the level playing field issue. If you want to play referee you have to enforce the rules to both sides or one side will feel rightly peeved. I review and edit history books for a living especially those in this sector of interest and I am particularly noted for the integrity of data and cross-checking references. Elonka has stated that she objects to the link on the basis that it is not reliable, although there is no further detail as to what precisely. Therefore I will offer to read the entire website, especially the history section in detail, and see if there is anything factually incorrect, controversial or just plain stupid. Maybe one solution would be to generate a totally separate article on modern orders. But the fundamental matter is still whether the website is a good reference point. If it is, and the history details concur with published knowledge and this article, then it probably deserves its place.  Maybe even more than some of the other links here that, perhaps, have not been subject to such a review? I don’t know because I haven’t read through those others. To be frank, it is quite silly that so much effort has been expended on this personal battle between the two of them and this debate over one web link. They could both contribute a lot to make this article a potential featured article. Who knows, they might even become best of friends in developing a fantastic article on a subject that we all enjoy. I will help out with proof reading and trying to make some of the writing flow a little better if that's okay with everyone.",0

So why is this stuff in here?  Well some guy haxed her emails and cell phones - just like he did with 50 other celebrities.  He haxed and stole all kinds of extremely sexually explicit photographs.  So now the haxer dude gets caught and the Fed want a 60 year sentence.  But they back down to a 6 yr one.  But, the random haxer dude has got to pay Rene, my sweet, dear, poor Rene over $76,000 in """"restitution.""""  This is for about 20 pics of Rene stuffing a dildo in every hole of her body.

The Feds worked on this case for nearly a year and talked to more than 50 haxing victims.

But you, Mr. Random Dude, by wandering in here on a drive by and white washing, you denigrate Rene's status as an innocent victim here.  You are telling the world that We - Wikipedia - could careless about how you have been so wrongly injured that we are just going to bury the truth like it never happened.

This event was an extremely signifant event for her and her life will never be the same afterwards (or, it won't be the same till she cashes her $76,000 check, eh?).

So, Mr. Random dude white washer, what have you to say to justify your actions?  Oh, and please don't come back with some kind of lame responce like, """"Well, I have been here longer and I am going to throw my Wiki weight around and you got to do what I say because I am King of the Wiki Hill here or I will ban you, etc., etc..""""

A hell of a lot of work went into putting all this stuff together, research, finding sources, making links, and proof reading.  Until some, I've got a job and I have a life.  So this took a lot out of my family time cuz I wanted my first major contribution to look good.  Until Mr. Random Dude came by and screwed it all up.  >:{    """,0

 OK  
Regarding your recent message about """"Naked"""", my edit is based on the character's arguable status as an anti-hero. It becomes apparent to me that Leigh's intention was to portray someone who, while probably hailing from a higher academic milieu or background (whether conventional or self-taught) uses his eloquence and education in an deliberately overbearing manner. You cannot deny the fact that the film clearly passes judgment on the character on this and other levels. I just wanted to summarize this in a few words. 
  

Most of the already-existing text (e.g. terms such as """"reckless"""" or """"egotistical"""") would also qualify as non-neutral if subjected to a thorough scrutiny.   

Thanks for the reply. I'd suggest finding references for any further changes you wish to make to the article. I also suggest raising any questions in article talk regrading other changes you propose.   
I'm not going to enter a futile edit war just for the heck of it, especially now that your attention seems to be fixed on my particular edit for this particular article, but I cannot leave this unanswered. There are no references for most of what is already written about this film in the wiki page. I'll say again: if we were to subject this to the same level of scrutiny all along, the summary for the film would be """"A human male flees Manchester for London and has conversations, and some intercourse, with a few characters, gets beaten and leaves"""".

Have it your way, I have other things to pay attention to. And please keep these interchanges in your own talk page.   """,0

 Firstly, it isn't up to me to do your research for you. It's your information that you seem determined to insert prominently near the top of the article, so the burden is on you to provide proper cited sources for it. I already made my contribution: I prefer to just jettison the entire paragraph, as I already did, or at least move it somewhere much lower in the article. Secondly, some of the stuff you just mentioned are still various rock critics giving their own opinions of """"obvious"""" influences. To say """"Coldplay is influenced by Oasis"""", we need a source with an actual band member stating words to this effect. Thirdly, why is it so important to you to devote so much time, space, and effort to Coldplay's influences, and why is it important enough to be so near the top of the article?  """,0
""" (UTC)

This debate is essentially about what can be stated unqualifiedly as fact. The consensus definition of fact is """"something that can be demonstrated to be true"""", in other words, """"something based on empirical evidence"""". I think that most dissenters would acknowledge that their views are not by this definition """"fact"""", that is, they would not claim that their views are """"built on empirical evidence"""". Frankly, the definition of fact is very much linked with the definition of science, as the goal of science is the establishment of fact. Thus, statements about which there is no fact-based debate, such as the roundness of the earth, can be stated as fact. Non-fact-based dissenting views can be stated as dissenting views, preferably in their own articles to avoid confusing the fact-seeking encyclopedia user.
The alternative, as far as I can figure, is to not state anything at all as fact, which would make Wikipedia a useless hellish cauldron of boiling fat. As one who believes that Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia, this isn't a very attractive prospect. If anyone can think of a different way to determine what can be stated as fact, go right on ahead.   07:41, 29 January 2006""",0

Here's the simple steps to get K delivered to your home:

1) Setup a hushmail.com email address
2) Contact globalpharmonline@hushmail.com and let him know what you want.  Here's the K they have along with prices. Make sure you tell him you want the brand Indus. The other brand they have sucks.

Ketamine 5000mg bottle $180.00
Ketamine500mg Inj 10ml Rotex Germany$25.00
Ketamine250mg Inj 5ml Indus $15.00
Ketamine 50mg Inj 2ml Indus $5.00

The 5000mg bottle = 10 (10ml) viles.  That breaks out to 5 grams powder. One 10ml vile breaks out into half a gram of powder.

It's real easy to get the liquid into powder if you don't know how to do it.  Just put it on a plate and boil water underneath it until it evaporates, then you'll be left with the powder.  You can also put the liquid on pyrex in the oven.  Be careful not to heat the liquid anymore than once it's gone otherwise you'll burn your shit.

YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION

This is the most """"contructive"""" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.""",0

Speedy deletion of Sandycove waterpolo club
 A tag has been placed on Sandycove waterpolo club requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

First, the dust cover is not a part of the source (it wasn't written by the authors) and is irrelevant and not usable as a reliable source.  A case could be made that the reference made above was to the entire group of adults, and two of the five were unlicensed (the """"therapeutic"""" foster parents), but they are not the subject of the present controversy.

Second, Ponder was licensed, and the fact of her licensure has been verified by the book. Continuing to refer to her as unlicensed is false and should stop.  Ditto with Jeane Newmaker who was also licensed (as a nurse) and was being used during treatment as a """"co-therapist"""".

Third, both on page 28 and 44 of the source, the meaning of Watkins's unlicensed status was discussed and placed into the proper context I described before.  To take the term out of context and describe Watkins simply as unlicensed is to deliberately mislead and misinform the reader; her legal culpability and professional status was much more nuanced than that.  I grant that extensive discussion of the meaning of being """"registered"""" to practice psychotherapy in Colorado would be awkward in an encyclopedia, but if the term is used, then such a discussion should or must take place to properly inform the reader.  It is avoided, however, by not mentioning it out of context, which is what I've been doing by removing the references (which are wrong in the case of Ponder in any case).

Fourth, mentioning the licensure twice (and indisputably erroneously in the case of Ponder) is gilding the lily, especially when I came up with a reasonable solution for the second mention (i.e., using the defendants' surnames) instead of characterizing them.

Fifth, the way is """"unlicensed"""" is used in this article is unjustifiably POV. No justification for inclusion of this characterization has ever been tendered.

 logic, please: the primary reason to date for retaining this picture is NOTCENSORED; that is a misapplication of policy if the image has no encyclopedic value, therefore IAR is applied to remove that reason, which allows for removing the image as unencyclopedic.  Editing policy only applies if (again) the content has encyclopedic value, which is exactly the point I'm disputing.  and last I checked (if this were a vote, which it isn't) the RfC was 9 to 6 in favor of removing, though some of the 6 in favor of keeping put a lot of effort into rationalizing that result away.
 Repeating myself yet again: you are not going to win this debate by quoting policy at me, because I can quote policy just as well as you can (possibly better).  you are not going to win this debate by using insulting terminology like 'scraping the bottom of the barrel'.  I know how to deal with pointless rhetorical snark, and it doesn't phase me in the least.  you are either going to have to give a reason explaining why this content is valuable - which would be the decent thing to do - or else you're all going to have to stick to the current practice of bullying and edit warring to keep the content in.  I'm happy to discuss the matter if you choose that route, I'm sanguine with (and capable of) refuting all of your policy misconstruals, and if you want to go the other path I'll see if I can get some other reasonable editors to come and help me remove it unreasonably.

Consider also for a moment the ubiquitous discrepancy between police and protestor attendance estimates at political rallies.
IMHO attendance figures should be removed unless they are verified by a reasonably independent source. Alternatively, it should be highlighted that these are figures directly from the Catholic Church.
Interestingly, it would be quite easy for the Catholic Church to provide official pilgrim numbers, as they are required to register their attendance.",0

"What I consider a fact, I do so on a scientific basis. There's nothing to be gained nowadays by clinching on to the insane idea that the Apollo hoax was for real. It stands in the way of actual moon landings. For now, before we can actually attempt landing something on the moon we have to take the needless detour of explaining to all and sundry how Apollo was a tragic hoax. We could have maybe actually landed people on the moon in the late 80's or something had it not been for the persistent re-circulation of this chunky piece of baloney called the Apollo missions.

May, who had never been to America, invented a hero named Old Shatterhand, a white man who always won his battles with Native Americans, defeating his enemies through sheer will power and bravery. Young Hitler read and re-read every one of May's books about Old Shatterhand, totaling more than 70 novels. He continued to read them even as Führer. During the German attack on the Soviet Union he sometimes referred to the Russians as Redskins and ordered his officers to carry May's books about fighting Indians.

The time, space, causation, change and eternity articles do include sections on philosophy, but it is embarrassing that the only comment on Asian thought on these matters I found was one sentence in Causality. Consequently, a reader of this article would find little of help in those. Moreover, this article does not discuss the philosophy of time, space, causation, change or eternity in any significant detail. But, I would support linking to those articles once they include significant Asian philosophical content. But, even then, the link should be to the philosophy section, not to the top of the article. I didn't find anything on philosophy or religion in universe or mortality.
time
space
causation
change
eternity

What should be linked Major connections with the subject of another article that will help readers to understand the current article more fully:
Vishwanath
Kashi
Shiva
Ishwara
Manisha Panchakam But only if the article is written promptly.
Nrsimha
Kali
Laksmi

Also, some articles have charted like Double Rainbow (song) and Choose Your Battles by Perry or Carmen (Lana Del Rey song) and Money Power Glory by American singer Lana Del Rey are only provided by some of the albums information, reviews and sources rather than independent sources about the song itself, etc. Some of the articles I made, like """"Too Far"""" and """"I Don't Need Anyone"""" feature info about being released promotionally through radio airplay and proposals of being an official single.

 imho, activity diagrams are one of the diagrams provided by the UML which is an OMG standard, not related to Utrecht university definition, though it may seem similar on the surface. But there are many variants of these diagrams (e.g. workflow diagrams, workflow nets and even some dialects of Business process modeling are graphically similar) the definition given here is not 'activity diagrams' which is sort of a reserved keyword for the definition of OMG. So, moving the text to Process-data diagram seems a very good idea and would satisfy me fully. Or even leaving it where it is in metadata modeling if that is the term they use to refer to this kind of models, and removing the redundant text from metamodeling page as I initially suggested (hmm, took out my hatchet and did it!). I think what went wrong is the interpretation of the discussion at the top of this discussion page: people were complaining that metamodeling page was polluted by Utrecht definition of the term, and that by 'squatting' the term, some information on the more generally accepted definition of the term ended up on this [metamodeling technique] page. But I think the more generally useful info was extracted from that page already. The merge was suggested as a way of providing an example """"provided it is very clear this is not the definition of metamodeling"""". To conclude if the page metadata modeling contains the description of this modeling formalism, I suggest we cut it from the text of this page, and maybe just add a """"see also"""" pointing to the other page.

 Project News
 The LGBT Portal has once again been revamped and a work rota started. Efforts towards Featured Portal status are slowly coming together.
 The assessment system has been a great success, we have tagged over 4000 articles! Please tag any LGBT related articles you come across by adding {{LGBTProject | class=}} to the talkpage. Please see the Assessment Department for how to assess an article according to the grading system.
 The Translation department has changed its focus, to LGBT articles about non-English topics and people on which there may be more information on the relevant foreign Wikipedia. Please add your name if you are fluent in any language other than English.
 Jumpaclass is picking up slowly, with nine people having entered. With over 2000 stubs we need to improve our article quality. Please sign up and get it going! Challenge another user to see how far you can jump a stub!
 There is an ongoing discussion about the current LGBT categorisation system here, here, and  a little bit here. A special page has now been set up here to deal with this.
 A Watchlist has been set up to monitor controversial and/or highly vandalised articles. It can also be used for article disputes, just add a note explaining the nature of the dispute.
 With the influx of so many active members, there is now enough support for a LGBT studies peer review, which may be found here. It's in the beta phase at the moment, so bear with us if we make any mistakes. Feel free to peer review any articles you have been working on.
  It was agreed this month to start reducing the uses of the Notice board, as many members felt that it was not effective. An open tasks template has been created, bringing together important announcements, FAC/FARs, Peer reviews, XfDs, the COTM, and requested articles. You may desire to [ watchlist] it. A Deletion sorting subpage is also now working to bring together XfDs - this should be bot-driven, but we have not currently tagged enough articles to make this fully automated, so please update the list with any LGBT-related XfDs you come across.

More thoughts
Hi KW - I noticed this thread whilst I was on my wikibreak and since I didn't have sufficient time/internet access, I made a note to comment. Before I begin, I'd like to apologise for the accusation of harassment, whilst I was feeling harassed by your comments I believe I over reacted due to the off-wiki stress of moving house. With that agreement above, I'm hoping we can move on. I'm hoping to get RfA Reform wrapped up 2012, there's been some very good research done, a few very resonable proposals which will be brought to the community to decide on them (even if I don't personally agree with them). 
You mention above that the RfA Reform project is dead without an an article writer as a leader, though you and I disagree on what constitutes an article writer, I would love to see one of those names helping in the project - even as co-ordinator. However, since none of them has shown any interest in RfA Reform and they are all busy with other things, I'm not going to hold my breath. Please do feel free to nudge any of them though - I'm sure a comment from you would go down much better than one from me, since I haven't interacted with any particularly. 
As for the unsavoury behaviour towards editors, I am actively trying to minimise this. For example, Keepscases, I did much research into his questions in the last quarter of last year, who removed them, how they were answered and so on. I don't believe I published it on wiki, though I could dig it up for you. From that, I came to the conclusion that Keepscases questions were not a major issue - and discussed that with a few of the editors who had issues with that user. I don't believe there has been any comments regarding Keepscases since, though I know there are still editors who are unhappy with the questions at RfA.
Regarding Malleus Fatuorum, I do endorse a topic ban from discussing administrators, as I believe that would remove the majority of problems and would be a much better solution than a blunt instrument like a block. Unfortunately, that does mean also topic banning him from RfA, which is a pity because his votes generally appear to be well worded (it's the comment's outside the votes, and the comments at WT:RfA which are problematic). In any case, that's a personal opinion, which I've explained with evidence at the the ArbCom case. If ArbCom choose to disagree, I'm not going to persue that further. 
All in all, I'd love to see RfA Reform actually improve RfA - I'm not 100% it can, because of project wide failings, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to try. I'm hoping to do some work improving the de-sysop process too, I'd like to see a more clear system there too. Finally, would you mind laying off the """"RfA Deform"""" comment? It belittles the project and only serves to make things more difficult, you are the only editor who uses that phrase - so I'd appreciate it if you could drop it.  · (talk) """,0

It happened so long ago and the situation was SO complex that I think no one really remembers completely correctly what happened. As far as I remember, it went something like this: the owner of Chernomorets Burgas bought Conegliano German (a team from a village next to Sofia) and for various reasons (mainly to get the Burgas team into a higher division without going through the proper means of actually gaining promotion - which is the same as what happened when Akademik Sofia swapped divisions with Vihar Gorublyane, actually, as well as a bunch of other teams such as Pirin Blagoevgrad) merged the two teams, which ended up being called """"Chernomorets Burgas (Burgas)"""" in Group B and """"Chernomorets Burgas (Sofia)"""" in Group A. Then a whole bunch of other stuff happened at the same time such as Burgas municipality founding their OWN team (which they called """"Chernomorets (Burgas)"""" - note the punctuation in all three cases); then a bunch of business deals went down whereby Neftohimik Burgas (which had since been renamed """"Naftex"""") got merged with Pomorie, then that team got merged with one of the Chernomorets'es, then the other Chernomorets remained as the """"official"""" Chernomorets, but still there was some dispute over players/grounds/finances...then that eventually merged with the first chernomorets; then the Sofia Chernomorets went back to being Conegliano German, then the Neftohimik fans formed a fans' club Neftohimik which began at the lowest level and... in short - before 2000 there was a Neftohimik and a Chernomorets in Burgas, and after 2010 there is a Neftohimik and a Chernomorets in Burgas. And between 2000 & 2010 a whole bunch of weird&random; stuff happened that I just don't know how to coherently explain. I reckon they can simply be mentioned in the Chernomorets Burgas and Neftochimic Burgas 1986 articles as something along the lines of: """"various business dealings led to the formation and dissolution of several clubs including """"Ch.B.B"""", """"Ch.B.S."""" and """"Ch(B.)"""" and, ultimately, led to the current state of the team"""". Or something equally inane. I dont know... Basically, both the old Chernomorets's and Naftex are now merged into the current Chernomorets, while the current Neftohimik is a fan's club. got it? -)    """,0

Very clever, Creutzfeldt, though to first hold forth with strong opinions on something you quite evidently knew absolutely nothing about, and then, after a cursory skim, to blather your opinions for a lot longer, seems out of character for a supposed expert in """"mathematical logic"""" (a claim of yours I find very dubious), not to mention someone trained by """"the Jesuits"""" (I hope you're seeing a counselor). Moreover, you can't even apply your """"logic"""" consistently  Apparently, it seems quite reasonable for a 9/11 Conspiracies encyclopedia page to discuss, at length, claims about a remote-controlled rocket having hit the Pentagon, and other unlikely scenarios for which there is a complete """"absence of evidence,"""" than for this espionage puzzle, for which there is some evidence, and an interesting flurry of mainstream media attention, but not yet enough evidence for a firm judgement. It would be good someday to have a proper explanation about the """"Israeli art students"""" mystery, and not just your peremptory and prejudiced dismissal of it as """"fucking bollocks"""" (I guess the Jesuits trained you in that particular science).

Anyway, I don't really care what you think, and I'm not even a zealous or crazed proponent of the """"art students"""" theories. I just thought that it was something interesting to consider in the 9/11 context, something requiring clarification, something that merits, at the least, a bit of consideration.

, please, just think about what you're saying here. Let's take this by the numbers:

 Firstly, quite frankly, I am dissappointed that you saw no reason to act in the face of the diffs and information I posted at User talk:Black Kite . Your suggestion that HighKing should """"step back from this type of edit"""" is, quite frankly, going to be ignored, again, as his edits on The Automobile Association showed. His admission that he has a problem sounds depressingly familiar. After 5 years of being unable to contain this problem himself, and in the face of overwhelming evidence yet again in this case that it still exists, then coming as it did off the back of yet more of the usual erroneous defences, duplicitous denials and improper deflections, is surely wholly unsatisfactory.
 's close was both abusive and counter-productive. He closed a perfectly valid complaint, based on completely irrelevant reasons, namely my 'status' (further below, and on his talk page). If I had not pressed him about it on his talk page, he wouldn't have even bothered to notify you about it, and you would never have even heard about 's actions at The Automobile Association.
 Your charge of harassment is frankly ridiculous - all I have done with this account is make factual statements about HighKing's current and past behaviour, which you yourself have just repeated today, is still problematic. I am obviously not the IP user he was edit warring with, I never engaged with HighKing, I never reverted HighKing, I never threatened or personally attacked HighKing. All I did was comment on the situation in a factual manner, in the hope other admins would take action in your absence. If me making this sort of contribution spoils HighKing's enjoyment of Wikipedia, who the hell cares, quite frankly? It's simply not harassment. If HighKing was to turn into a model editor tomorrow, then he'd never hear me talking about him ever again. That's not harassment, it's practically the job description of a Wikipedia admin!
 Your block for evading scrutiny - it is entirely pointless. Enforcement of WP:SOCK long ago stopped being about what's good for Wikipedia in many instances, as this block shows. Whatever my history, whether this is a legitimate or illegitimate alternate account, whether I'm blocked or banned, whatever, there isn't a single thing that I could possibly be hiding that would make the edits this account performed look any less valid to an outside observer. Nothing that might be or could be revealed about me, would change their meaning or relevance, and it certainly wouldn't make them any (more) true. The idea that only established can be implicitly trusted to tell the truth on Wikipedia strikes me as extremely dangerous, a view no admin should be seen within a hundred miles of holding, let alone repeating.
 Taking 3 & 4 together, there was absolutely no preventative purpose to this block, and so, it it is entirely without grounds in basic policy. And on the issue of basic points of policy with regard both the socking and harassment charges - you don't even know for sure if this is an illegitimate sock. You don't know if I have a regular account, or if I'm blocked or banned. You're just guessing. For all you know, I might be using an undeclared alternate account because I myself might have previously been the victim of harassment from HighKing, and so I would have a perfectly legitimate reason to hide what my 'regular account' is when commenting on him in future. And given the fact that, as this block shows, being critical of HighKing is seemingly enough to get someone tarred with a charge of conducting a """"long term campaign of harassment"""" without any actual evidence whatsoever, then it would be entirely understanable if an editor in good standing would not want to expose their main account to that sort of smear, as the price of simply commenting on HighKing.
 To expand on the socking issue - rather than being an """"inappropriate"""" use of a sock, when it comes to HighKing, I think its self evident given his past, using a sock when commenting on his behaviour at a venue like ANI is highly appropriate, as it removes his ability to do what he has often done in those situations, namely trying to deflect attention from his own behaviour by talking about what the people reporting him have done, whether it is even relevant or not, and indeed, whether it is even true or not (his habit for example of makin",0

 Some minor revisions to the 1st paragraph of the """"Definition"""" section. 

An obviously jumbled word somehow crept into the beginning of the 2nd sentence of the paragraph:  """"The formula useoefficients of price elasticity....""""  I put in a proposed revision.  

I also changed """"quantity"""" to """"quantity demanded"""" for the sake of clarity and completeness. It's crucial that the definition be as precise as possible in emphasizing that PED is concerned only with changes in quantity demanded.  (Elasticity is one of the most difficult concepts in micro for most beginning students and for other potential readers/users  WP's """"customers""""; they tend to get confused by the slightest ambiguity about which quantity we mean.  An ounce of emphasis here doesn't preclude such confusion, but it can help avoid a pound of it.)

In addition, I added """"services"""" to the definition as a token reminder that PED, as well as the laws of supply and demand, apply to both goods and services.

The only other noteworthy revision was to the beginning of the last sentence in the first paragraph to place more emphasis on the PED for the most typical types of goods and services.  Although the Giffen and Veblen exceptions are interesting, they are almost negligibly rare anomalies compared to the overwhelming number of typical goods and services governed by the Law of Demand.  (That's why it merits the rare status of a """"Law""""!)  The exceptions deserve discussion eventually (in a later section), but I think this introductory paragraph would be strengthened by giving them only the briefest possible mention in passing here.  Instead, this paragraph should focus attention on the crux of the issue that readers need to remember (the """"take-away""""), namely:  because the demand for most goods and services obeys the Law of Demand, their PED coefficients will always be negative.  

Again, elasticity is one of the most difficult topics at the introductory level of microeconomics.  It doesn't serve this section or the article well to risk distracting students and other readers from the main point too early with such minor exceptions, however interesting they may be to the intellectually curious readers. Once we've made the main point as clear as possible, then devoting some time to the exceptions is much less likely to cause confusion or ambiguity.
  
I have one more suggested revision along this line for the paragraph, and I'll return to it as soon as time permits.

I made a few other copyedits were purely minor, e.g., deleting an occasional unnecessary word to polish the prose just a bit.

 The page User talk:Singingdaisies is a redirect to the page , which places the notification on the redirect target if the user talk page is a redirect, and in this case the redirect target was a user page. There are currently five user talk pages which are redirects to your user page. You might wish to change those.

I think the distinction is between a 7 main bearing six and a 4 main bearing six, in that the former gets crankshaft whip under control and gives you more potential for high-end horsepower, which you can exploit with an easily added overhead cam or two.

 Edit request on 24 January 2012 

I'm requesting that the Charles Manson article be edited to reflect the fact Manson ALLEGEDLY believed in """"Helter Skelter"""" but this has NOT been confirmed by the man himself. As a matter of fact, Vince Bugliosi stated in a recent interview that """"Helter Skelter"""" was NOT on Manson's mind and the killers had the instinct in them already to commit the murders. This interview can be found on """"YouTube"""" and is what I consider to be a total contradiction to Bugliosi's past claims. This is how I feel the following article sections should read:

{Manson allegedly believed in what he called """"Helter Skelter,"""" a term taken from the song of the same name by The Beatles. It was said Manson believed Helter Skelter to be an impending apocalyptic race war, which he described in his own version of the lyrics to the Beatles' song but this is debatable since Manson never publicly confirmed anything of the sort. According to prosecutor Vince Bugliosi, Manson supposedly believed his murders would help precipitate that war. From the beginning of his notoriety, this connection with rock music linked him with a pop culture in which he ultimately became an emblem of insanity, violence and the macabre.}

{Helter Skelter
Main article: Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)

For some time, Manson had been saying that racial tension between blacks and whites was growing and that blacks would soon rise up in rebellion in America's cities.[29][30] He had emphasized Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination, which had taken place on April 4, 1968.[23] On a bitterly cold New Year's Eve at Myers Ranch, the Family members, gathered outside around a large fire, listened as Manson explained that the social turmoil he had been predicting had supposedly also been predicted by the Beatles.[26] The White Album songs, he allegedly declared, told it all, although in code. Furthermore, it was said he maintained (or would soon maintain), the album was directed at the Family itself, an elect group that was being instructed to preserve the worthy from the impending disaster.[29][30]

In early January 1969, the Family escaped the desert's cold and positioned itself to monitor L.A.'s supposed tension by moving to a canary-yellow home in Canoga Park, not far from the Spahn Ranch.[2]:244–247[26][31] Because this locale would allow the group to remain """"submerged beneath the awareness of the outside world,""""[2]:244–247[32] Manson called it the Yellow Submarine, another Beatles reference. There, Family members prepared for the impending apocalypse,[33][34] which, around the campfire, Manson had allegedly termed """"Helter Skelter,"""" after the song of that name.

By February, the so-called """"Helter Skelter"""" vision was complete. The Family would create an album whose songs, as subtle as those of the Beatles, would trigger the predicted chaos. This is just a theory however and many have viewed the album differently. Supposedly, ghastly murders of whites by blacks would be met with retaliation, and a split between racist and non-racist whites would yield whites' self-annihilation. Blacks' triumph, as it were, would merely precede their being ruled by the Family, which would ride out the conflict in """"the bottomless pit""""—a secret city beneath Death Valley.[35] At the Canoga Park house, while Family members worked on vehicles and pored over maps to prepare for their desert escape, they also worked on songs for their world-changing album. When they were told Terry Melcher was to come to the house to hear the material, the women prepared a meal and cleaned the place; but Melcher never arrived.[29][33]}

{Crowe shooting

On May 18, 1969, Terry Melcher visited Spahn Ranch to hear Manson and the women sing. Melcher arranged a subsequent visit, not long thereafter, on which he brought a friend who possessed a mobile recording unit; but he himself did not record the group.[2]:156,185[36]

By June, Manson was allegedly telling the Family they might have to show blacks how to start """"Helter Skelter"""".[2]:244–247[34][37] When Manson supposedly tasked Watson with obtaining money supposedly intended to help the Family prepare for the conflict, Watson defrauded a black drug dealer named Bernard """"Lotsapoppa"""" Crowe. Crowe responded with a threat to wipe out everyone at Spahn Ranch. Manson countered on July 1, 1969, by shooting Crowe at his Hollywood apartment.[2]:99–113[2]:91–96[38][39]

Manson's mistaken belief that he had killed Crowe was seemingly confirmed by a news report of the discovery of the dumped body of a Black Panther in Los Angeles. Although Crowe was not a member of the Black Panthers, Manson, concluding he had been, expected retaliation from the group. Spahn Ranch was turned into a defensive camp, with night pa",0

Knowledgebattle certainly know that User talk:ReliableBen just made a manipulative statement, when you said, """"ZChN does not exist."""" By simply saying, """"does not exist"""", it leaves out the fact that it did, and that the political ideology still lingers. Racism didn't die in the US after the slaves were freed; the ZChN ideology doesn't die just because the party has all but disbanded. The party that many of them went on to, Polska Jest Najważniejsza, is in fact nationalist, as the name, itself, makes clear. And from there, Polska Razem. Being Rightist conservatives, it's no wonder he just made the same kind of comment that one would expect from Donald Trump: """"Everyone must realise how big a mistake it was to attempt to relocate groups of Muslim immigrants in Poland."""" When Christians bomb something or attack someone, no Christians assert that anyone should kick the Christians out of the country, or that it's a mistake to let Christians live in their country. The man is anti-Semetic (in regard toward both Jews and Muslims). He's making that very clear.  """,0
"""

Gotcha.  You're saying if it went Republican, it did so against the net effects of the Jews.  What I'm trying to tie in here is if enough Jews """"defected"""" to make the difference e.g. if 80% of Jews going Dem became 60% because [Bush/W. Bush/etc...] had enough appeal.  I'm claiming Jews can influence a race not only by going solidly Dem, but also by deciding not to.  The article I cited states the amount of time candidates spend on Jews is precisely because they (~20% of them) are swayable.  That being the case, narrow Republican victories could also be a result of Jewish response to a candidate.

This being the case, 2000 Florida could be a result of Jewish voters if either: (1) enough Jews were attracted to W. Bush to throw the state, (2) the state actually went Democratic by voter intents (again this is possible but contentious, or (3) Jews made the race close enough to require Supreme Court intervention, which is itself a political outcome and has profoundly influenced the voting method there, as well as affected ideas about W. Bush.  If any one of these three is possible, we can't discount the effect of the Jewish vote in Florida 2000.  """,0

Wikipedia is not the place to publish original research.  Wikipedia will only give a """"balanced view"""" if such a view can be supported with citations from published literature, preferably peer-reviewed scientific literature.  Equally important, Wikipedia is a reference encyclopedia that has an obligation to note that this hypothesis is not currently accepted by any mainstream, reputable medical organization (CCHR doesn't count, as they are neither reputable nor are they a medical organization).  

Perhaps, instead of attempting to convince the Wikipedia audience as to the veracity of these claims, you would be better off attempting to publish research and convince scientists and researchers of the validity of these claims using evidence.  You mention that you are a psychologist.  I do not know about psychologists across the pond, but in the US, the American Psychological Association, the specialty society that represents and speaks for American psychologists, has been quite clear in stating their support for the mainstream view that ADHD represents a serious neurological behavioral problem.  The American Psychological Association has also not endorsed this Social Construct hypothesis, and many of their statements contradict this hypothesis.

In fact, the APA even has a page set up specifically for ADHD:
http://www.apa.org/topics/topicadhd.html

Now, as I mentioned, I am not as familiar with practice in the UK, but I did manage to find the NICE clinical practice guidelines for ADHD.  They can be found here:
http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG72FullGuideline.pdf

In any event, the problem has nothing to do with anyone being """"wedded"""" to any notion, but rather that the proponents of this hypothesis have published very little research and have so far failed to convince the vast majority of researchers in their field as to the merits of their proposal.  First must come the research, the evidence, independently verifiable information that can be cited to support the hypothesis.  That must come first, before you can expect to see any sort of """"balanced view.""""""",0

Also there were many supporters who presented arguments for 'keep' (probably outweighing the number who wanted 'delete') but these arguments were never addressed and the guys at deletion review are telling me that these contributions have zero weight because the people who want to 'keep' are all first-time users.  Deletion review is also proving unhelpful and in my opinion also biased with nobody seriously considering the arguments that have been raised, or really prepared to read through the AFD discussion properly.  I have no idea of what to do next and in fact if anything can be done.  I am extremely disillusioned with this process as it is obvious that prejudgements and lots of Wiki-speak are employed to 'prove' unsuitability, rather than arguments being actually objectively considered. Anyway, thank you for your willingness to help even though it appears to be too late now.   """,0

"Bard Of Ely
Hi there,
I just noticed that the page for Bard Of Ely was removed from Wikipedia. [] I feel that there should have been some sort of tag attached to the page before removal. I also am mystified by the reference of the dismissal of the the page due to your comment,(promotion written by a friend). I have found that indeed Bard Of Ely is a noteable artist, and should have remained in the Wikipedia listings. For instance, did you know, Bard Of Ely has an EP out on a proper label(Crai Records), and he worked with musicians such as Crum(ex-Hawkwind[], Phil Moxham (Young Marble Giants), Robin Williamson(Incredible String Band) and Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals)and having compered and played at Glastonbury Festival [] and the Green Man Festival [] as well as having been rave reviewed in the NME []. I suppose it's up to the wandering editors to make these decisions. But, how do you determine a friend wrote the info on Bards page ??? For instance, I do not know Bard Of Ely personally, and could be considered a professional associate of Bard. Does this mean I can write a page about Bard Of Ely and it won't be removed ???? Please clarify the standards by which you elected to remove Bards page other than it may have been written by a friend. ie; For instance, the content was not verified and credible. Also, please indicate what makes an article not to the standard of Wikipedia, when in fact the references made in the article are internal links that have a direct relavence to the encyclopedia itself. I'm not trying to cause a stir here, but, I find it strange that Bards page was ripped down, when in fact I have found a few other artists pages that have been left up, and do not contain the same concrete documentation as Bard Of Ely's did. If you would like me to point those out to you, all you have to do is ask !!!! Take care, and please understand, that I am trying to understand some of the standards you work under for deciding to remove pages of Wikipedia noteable musical artists. Thank you, be well, and please accept my questions with all seriousness.

 Mis-quoted text, possibly propaganda? 

""""In 2006, the United Nations mounted a covert operation to capture or kill Joseph Kony. A squad of U.S.-trained Guatemalan Special Ops soldiers set out into Congo's Garamba National Park, a longtime LRA refuge and the scene of the 2008–2009 Garamba offensive. Trained in jungle warfare and accustomed to surviving in the bush for long stretches, the Guatemalans were equipped with M-16s and the latest special-operations technology. Five LRA soldiers were killed and none of the Special Ops soldiers survived. According to one account, the commander of the Special Ops soldiers was beheaded. The battle, which lasted for several hours, included hand to hand combat. Reports put the U.N. dead at eight to forty. The LRA left the corpses in the jungle but took the weapons—including heavy machine guns and grenade launchers.[69]""""

I removed this from the article (someone else saw that this was there, but no one deleted it). The source doesn't say anything about Guatemalan troops, or mention the battle. It's a series of six pictures with stories from individuals who were in some way affected by the LRA, but not even the word """"Guatemalan"""" is present. Much less a description of a battle.

The medes are very obscure historically and they only had conquered a small area of modern day Kurdistan (the people of that area then were considered foreign to the medes no doubt) for a short period before Elam change all that.

Ok, first off, let me clarify that reverting is when you undo someone else's edit (yes, it does include the re-addition of material that has been removed by another user). Your use of the word """"vandalism"""" is incorrect in this case, because everything that you have been involved in so far is classified as a """"content dispute"""", since you and your opponents have been disputing whether certain text should be included. This is not a case of vandalism (this is, for example). Secondly, many of the users that you have been reverting or the ones that have been reverting you are on the same restrictions, so IMO now everyone is equal, and no one is """"winning"""" or """"losing"""". What I've tried to explain to you is that edit wars get nothing accomplished. You keep reverting and reverting, and then someone reverts you, and the cycle continues. Wikipedia articles aren't meant to go back-and-forth like that. The only real way you get something accomplished is by discussing it with other users, in the hopes that you can form a compromise, or consensus. To answer your numbered questions:
After we last spoke you continued to revert (, , , ). On Sason, you reverted 3 times in the last 24 hours. Even though you came close to breaking the three-revert rule (which you were blocked for on May 31), three reverts is not some sort of magic barrier that prevents you from being blocked. An admin could have easily blocked you for simply edit warring. This is the type of stuff that occurred on Armenian-Azeri pages for example before the arbitration case. After that many users were placed on editing restrictions, a lot of the problems were solved. Aggressive editing can be characterized as constant edit warring, and basically a method of getting your version of the article by constant reverting as opposed to discussion. Is is the exact opposite of what is outlined at WP:1RR. Even if you believe the information you are adding is NPOV, if it is contested by several users, the best thing is to discuss it with them, and once you have come to an agreement, to implement that version. 
I'm sure you've tried to be civil, but here I notice you referring to your opponents as """"vandals"""", this is inappropriate because as I explained above, you're involved in a content dispute here. If other users have personally attacked you, please show me links of this and I will warn them. It is never acceptable to do so.
Yes, it is possible. You can get mentored at Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User. Wiki-adoption was created back in 2006 as a program designed to help new and inexperienced users.
Although you may disagree with him, it is within Namsos' right to nominate an article for deletion if he believes it is non-notable. However, as you can see from the discussion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erich Feigl, it appears that many users there are deciding to keep the article, so I'm not sure that it matters anyways. Everything that you mention (awards, documentaries, books, Google hits, etc.) can be mentioned at the AfD (articles for deletion page). I have noticed that you've already made a comment there already. Make sure to keep an eye on that page, the discussion is typically open for five days.
I don't know the specifics about why your sources were removed, but if you feel like you're not getting anywhere with these disputes, you might try posting something at the Reliable Sources noticeboard if there is a dispute on whether your sources are valid or not. Another option is the new Ethnic and cultural conflicts noticeboard. Finally, after you have made all attempts at resolving the conflict (including those two links I gave you), and you still feel like nothing has been accomplished, you can check out formal mediation. There, a mediator will get involved and act as a third party.
I hope all that I have said is helpful. Please feel free to drop a note on my talk page if you have any further questions/comments. khoi """,0

 WP:AFC on Marathonios 

Note: The following post by an IP about Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Tiberius Claudius Hipparchus Marathonios has been copied here from User talk:EdJohnston/Anontalk.   

Thank you for taking the time to review my proposed article! As the source of the wealth of Herodes Atticus probably was his grandfather, i thought some sentences could exist for him, having also an interesting story. His name is (or almost is) as set in my article, through many sources (of which a mentioned in the article only one):
http://www.geni.com/people/Tiberius-Claudius-Hipparchus-de-Marathon/6000000013238402549
http://www.muldermedia.com/roots/INDIs/II2429.html

Marathonios shows descent from Marathon, a famous town of Attica. It was usual at the time to always add the town to which one was belonging. So, most of the times one was using only his first name, but among faraway people the town was used as well (Thales of Miletus or Miletios etc). Whether Wikipedia's policy is to use the full name or just the first i cannot tell and i would appreciate your advice.
But.. in this article http://mapyourinfo.com/wiki/en.wikipedia.org/Herodes%20Atticus/ (see Ancestry) Wikipedia already uses that exact name!  
Probably the right spelling might have been Marathonius, as all the name in in latin, but mostly is mentioned as Marathonios, so i would vote this way.

Thanks for your note. If you create future AFC nominations, the record-keeping is easier if you will create an account, instead of using a variety of IP addresses. My original AFC comment was based on the linked sources not supporting your submission. It appeared to me that bits of information about different ancient figures were being mixed up together. This runs of the risk of an article misinforming our readers. In your above post, geni.com etc are not considered to be WP:Reliable sources for Wikipedia. The Google Book is OK but it only confirms that Herod Atticus's grandfather was known as Tiberius Claudius Hipparchus, without the word 'Marathonios'. So your information has no reliable source. Herod Atticus may have had a relative known as 'Marathonios', but that seems to be a different person who was born after the death of Hipparchus.    """,0

 Brian Chen's analysis of Apple and Flash 

The article quotes Brian Chen:
Allowing Flash — which is a development platform of its own — would just be too dangerous for Apple, a company that enjoys exerting total dominance over its hardware and the software that runs on it. Flash has evolved from being a mere animation player into a multimedia platform capable of running applications of its own. That means Flash would open a new door for application developers to get their software onto the iPhone: Just code them in Flash and put them on a web page. In so doing, Flash would divert business from the App Store, as well as enable publishers to distribute music, videos and movies that could compete with the iTunes Store.
Because this quote is heavy in opinion, analysis, and POV – in other words, unbalanced – I think it's best to summarize the author's factual statements and use a short quote to capture the tone of the source. Including the full quote compromises the article's neutral POV.

I replaced the text with this, which was 
In November 2010, a Wired columnist said """"allowing Flash — which is a development platform of its own — [on the iPhone] would just be too dangerous for Apple, a company that enjoys exerting total dominance over its hardware and the software that runs on it,"""" and that it would allow developers to circumvent Apple's App Store.

Squeaky here
Hi, thanks for the note you left me regarding my article on Bridget Taylor. A few points if I may. I'm new to this so I'm not really good at. I don't think you hate me and I see how much obviously better the article is with your edits. So I'm actually grateful. You are really good at this, I'm not but I'd like to learn. So seeing the changes that you made to my original, I can't help but agree they improved the article, every one of them. So no complaints here.You have my thanks. Just to clear up a couple of kind of misconceptions. I really had no agenda. I don't know Bridget Taylor, I wasn't promoting her in the sense of I think she needs to be promoted. If I was promoting her it's more because I have become a huge user of wikipedia myself. It's become the first place I go to research any subject, person, place or thing. Given that, I totally respect the fact you are such a great editor. As a user of the information provided here, I also hope that the subject matter is comprehensive, fact filled, current, and factual. So again, I am not offended by the need for editing; rather I welcome it. Getting back to my agenda. I became aware of Bridget Taylor through a child with autism and did some research on her background. I found that she is widely considered to be the leading expert practicing the use of ABA therapy and that she is truly a tireless advocate for autistic children and adults. My sole agenda honestly was not to promote her but to have her listed in wikipedia. When the parents of child get the dreaded diagnosis of autism, they tend to search for everything and anything in their power to help their child. I've learned in my research that Taylor 's work and practice are of the utmost importance, especially to the parents of very young children first diagnosed. The Alpine Learning Group is arguably (but not many would argue the point) the best placement for an autistic child in the country. So given what I had learned from my research I just thought it was very important to growing segment of the population that Taylor just be listed in wikipedia. Honestly, I'm without agenda. In fact, I'm not a """"fan"""" of ABA therapy. It is, however, the only scientific method proven to help autisic children learn. Which is a valuable thing. A parent can use dietary supplements, adjunct therapies, etc. which I totally support. In the meantime while waiting to see the results, there is a small window of opportunity when a child's brain is still pliable and they are at their peak learning age. That window goes from maybe 3-6 years old. So, to me, it seems very important to use what we have available (ABA therapy) so that child, all autistic children make the strides they are able to make in lear",0

 Leading paragraphs for articles 

Hi SamClark, this is just a comment that was made to me, that I thought I would pass onto you, for you to think about and respond how you please. The leading paragrpahs in Global Justice, and your draft at User:Sam Clark/justice read like the introduction to an essay. Particularly the last sentences which say what the article will discuss. This is what I did when I created a few articles from scratch, mainly because the only type of writing I ever do is for essays. But a couple of people have commented that as an encyclopaedic article, the first section is more like a synopsis rather than an introduction, and would generally just sum up the points of the rest of the article.

For instance, instead of 
It considers the various ways in which justice has been understood, distinguishes two broad kinds of justice, and then describes several theories of justice under each of those two headings.
It could say something like:
There are various ways to understand justice, but generally you ca distinguish between two kinds of justice: distributive justice and retributive justice. Distributive justice is concerned with the proper distribution of good things while Retributive justice is concerned with the proper response to wrongdoing.

And then it would just go straight into the article. If you look at most of the long-standing and comprehensive articles that seems to be the way they are written. Cheers.  

 Heh - good point. In my case, it's being in the habit of writing lecture-notes, but the same point applies. I'll change. Thanks,  

 Rewrite of Justice 

I think it would be great to see the derivation of the word justice from the latin (not the french) etc and perhaps a section on history on how our understanding of the term has evolved (ie. what it meant in different times and different places). Justice is defintely a philosophical concept and so it is important to discuss the philosophical meanings and debates concerning justice, but it is also a political/judicial term as well as an everday term that people use and so it would be good to have all of this represented in the article eventually. I think stuff like this from the original article is very important: 
In most cases what one regards as """"just"""" (not necessarily meaning what is just) is determined by consulting established and agreeable principles, employing logic, or, natural law In specific systems justice is determined, by consulting a majority, or in social contexts where religion dominates, justice may be thought to require deference to religious texts or to spiritual guidance, under a monarchy or authoritarian state the ruler/s determined what was just and doled out justice. All of these determinants of justice have at times delivered particularlly dark periods of history where justice was seen to be absent. If a person lives under a specific set of laws in a country, concepts of """"justice"""" are often simply deferential to the existing law —the issuing of punitive reprimands for violations may be referred to as """"serving justice."""" In principle, this fits the general concept in that the individuals get what is supposedly due to them. Justice however, is a universal and absolute concept; laws, principles, religion, etc., are merely attempts to codify the concept  occasionally with results that entirely contradict the true nature of justice.

I got rid of this first paragraph for several reasons:

First, """"typically"""" and """"generally"""" are weasel words.  This definition represents RJII's point of view, and violates our neutral poiint of view.  Second, I do not agree that capitalism is an economic system; there are many scholars who argue that it is not an economic system, and an NPOV description of capitalism can't make an assertion that represents one point of view.  Third, there are non-capitalist societies where the means of production are privately owned, and some scholars argue that capitalism threatens the private ownership of capital, so again this definition is inaccurate or at best violates NPOV policy.  Fourth, it is just poorly written, the second and third clauses are redundant.  Fifth, it leaves out what many consider the defining feature of capitalism, which is the commoditization of labor.

i've tried to clean things up a bit though someone else will have to remove the vandalistically applied christianity template lest i be reported for """"edit warring"""" by humus.   i've added a link to the christianity and judaism portals in the """"see also"""" section.   these links are more fitting than claiming this is """"part of the series on christianity""""

this article was very heavy on anti-jfj stuff.  a lengthy """"criticism"""" section as well as criticisms inserted into nearly every other section.  the missionaries are """"taught to speak in hebrew"""" (these people already went to hebrew school!) and jfj is known to """"target vulnerable jews"""" (oh really?) and """"most of the funding comes from christians"""" (well did we think it was coming from muslims and religious jews?) and the current leader """"is not jewish"""" (even though his mother, father, all grandparents were apparently jewish)

some of the criticisms' references were just opinion pieces from religious jews who oppose conversion.  most come from biased publications that don't meet wikipedia's reliable sources standards.  including these references is analogous to editing the """"buddhism"""" article to say that """"all buddhists will burn in hell"""" along with a reference to some fire-n-brimstone website.

anyway, if all we're trying to get across is that some, even many, jewish people and groups oppose jfj we don't need to spread it all over the article.  it isn't at all surprising that religious jews don't want other jews to accept jesus  every missionary movement is opposed by someone.

 

Friend, your edits pushed your delusion that J4J is just another Jewish denomination that a bunch of long-bearded Hassidim oppose. You don't seem to comprehend how the group ruffles feathers throughout the whole length and breadth of the Jewish community even among commies and even among a lot of Christians, as it is contrary to the spirit of modern ecumenicism. J4J is as much defined by the hostility to it as anything else. That is the state of play. I think that you can make a case if you feel the wording is not neutral, but you can't water down the unanimous opposition to J4J and call that """"NPOV"""" 

Thanks for the """"friend"""", nice words are always welcome, even though the rest is not.   Please don't accuse me of """"pushing my delusions"""".   Some jewish groups may strongly oppose them, but there's no way to show that """"all"""" """"mainstream"""" jewish groups, including """"secular"""" groups """"strongly"""" oppose them, without taking the liberty of defining who """"all"""" the """"mainstream"""" jewish groups are, and what degree of """"opposition"""" is """"strong"""".  Can you really not see this simple truth?
Beyond that it just isn't appropriate to overwhelm this article with criticism.  I outlined this above already.   Statements like j4j approachs """"vulnerable jews"""" are unabashedly POV  and tautological.  If anyone converts then its clear they were """"vulnerable"""" to conversion,  so if anyone approached converts, then j4j has approaches """"vulnerable jews"""".
It's not in question that all missionary groups are converting someone from some belief system to another, but it is only barely notable that someone opposes this conversion.  Does McDonald's oppose Burger King and try to put them out of business at every turn?  Yes...but who cares?  Do drug smugglers """"strongly oppose"""" DEA agents coming along and busting up their operations?   Yes...but it would be silly to put it in an article.   Everyone has opposition and it just goes without saying.   Still, I wouldn't be """"strongly opposed"""" to his article having a section on opposition, but nearly every corner of this article is littered with criticism that is all essentially the same.
Compare this article to that of any other missionary group.

""""Since the late twentieth century, the researchers Paul Heinegg and Dr. Virginia DeMarce have conducted additional historic research in censuses, land deeds, court records, etc. to document that many multi-racial groups, later sometimes called tri-racial isolates, who during the nineteenth and early twentieth century were found in frontier areas, were descendants of families of free people of color formed in colonial Virginia. [9] At the time, most colonists were indentured servants from the British Isles. Beginning in the early 17th century, colonists imported African indentured servants and slaves. In the early period, the working classes of indentured servants, slaves and free workers lived and worked closely together, leading to marriages and unions.[4] The historian Ira Berlin has described the first generation of African-descended people in Virginia as the """"charter generation."""" He has noted that some were the multiracial descendants (usually men), who were the children of Portuguese and Spanish men active in the slave trade, and African women in the slave ports. Some of the men arrived as free laborers, having accompanied Europeans. Others were imported as slaves.[10]""""

This should be removed as well, as Melungeons have never been found in slave or servant records.  This is in  a section for the Origins of """"Melungeons""""  yet this section is not discussing """"Melungeons"""".  Since Melungeons have never been found in slave records, it makes no sense why this is even in a article on Melungeons.  Unless someone can find a slave record for Melungeons then it should be removed and anything pertaining to slaves.  This mentions slaves and indentured servant and leads towards African americans, however the original slaves in Virginia was Native Americans, Irish, Portuguesse, people from India, etc etc. Either way it does not pertain to Melungeons as Melungeons was never slaves. 

I looked at he Virginia DeMarce source used, only thing is says about Melungeons is they was mixed race, then it discusses indians, then it mentions the Melungeons being Saponi indians.  http://www.genpage.com/DeMarce.pdf

So not really sure why the actual Melungeon section of that source was not used and instead something was used in replace of what the source says on the Melungeons.  What that sources says is  """"Saponi, who appeared in Orange county, Virginia, on the lands of Governor Spotswood as late as 1742-43- including the Bowling and Collins names later found among Tennessee Melungeons.""""  This is speaking about the Saponi indians.  Then it mentions tri-rcial groups in reference to white, black, and indian mixture in equal portions.  

I looked at the Paul Heinegg source, could not find the word Melungeon used at all,  so clearly that can't be used as a source to this article. http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/

So clearly this stuff needs to be removed and the Demarce reference needs to be re worded to the """"exact"""" way the source states in relation to Melungeons.""",0

Distortion of sources by by lowering the number of casualties from 6,000 to 35 in the Gemlik Yalova massacres

 questions all sources which he doesn't like on the other hand he adds (""""retaliates"""") without hesitation weak sourced massacres (with large numbers)committed by Turks against Greeks in the List of massacres in Turkey.( See, See) This already proves his unreliable POV behaviour, eagerly adding, without questioning the source, info that Turks massacred Greeks but insisting and denying that Turks were massacred by Greeks. (Btw, I don't deny any sourced massacre regardless of the perpetrators and victims)

From the moment I made this article, Alexikoua started to disrupt the article, he is WP:IDLI from the beginning, very biased he tried to deny it, than shift the blame to others, and finally lowering the death toll from 6,000 to 35 by distorting this source page which does not state that the total killed were 35, it states
""""Of the total 177 people (in a refugee camp in Istanbul) responding to a (Ottoman) questionnaire 28 individuals responded that they had family members harmed during the Greek occupation. In total only 35 were reported to be killed, wounded beaten or missing. This is in line with the observations of Toynbee declared that one to two murders were sufficient in driving away the population of a given village""""

He misuses this source and claims the total number killed during the events was 35(!). I explained to him,again that in individual cases the number already exceeds 35.
Furthermore Toynbee states that in one single  village called Hayriye (Khairie) half of the population was killed, according to a Ottoman document it had 250 inhabitants, at another village called Akköy (Akkeu) 60 people were killed, so the death toll of two villages has already exceeded 100. Furthermore the source never states that 35 is the total number of people killed in the peninsula. It is only the result of a questionnaire to 177 people. Furthermore Toynbee states that there were no large scale massacres in one specific region, not in other areas, his words are again distorted.

But Alexikoua still insists on distorting the source, I explained it countless times, he still insists, here here here, ], here, here and here.

He also amateurishly did original research to deny sourced content. See here, he ignores all other sources and insists on saying """"Toynbee's account about 35 as a total number of reported casualties is the only we have so far""""( Which in fact is a lie because it is not Toynbee's account but from the Ottoman questionnaire of 177 people)

States should never be supported when they rest on the oppresssion of others. I oppose all conquest and imperialism, past and present. As far as states created by conquest, what is important is current oppression, i.e.  ending it,(esp. state-sponsored) that are in the bussiness of building based on conquest of others. This must be opposed equally in all cases, which a special responsiblity for those you can have the greatest effect in changing, stoping, i.e. if I live in the US, I have a special responsiblity to speak out against things this countries does (directly or indirectly as in the case of support for Israeli occupation).

There are many ethnic groups who holds a long history and a deep cultural association different country or geographical regions, in particular where the national identity began.

"Your stupidity 

As you are aware, anything that i do gets reverted for no reason mainly by you; you use the WP:3RR the WP:SOCK and that stupid conciseness rubbish for your protection when really you know you are just doing it to be difficult and generally annoying. 

As i saw at the top of your page, and i quote from another twit that You are doing nothing to improve the article by constantly reverting - this occuring regularly in the following:

Louise Henriette de Bourbon-Conti - probably the best example of your obsession with having everything that way you want it; 
Henrietta Anne Stuart - i rearranged the page and added the Template:House of Stuart - clearly a tragedy;
Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre‎ - added titles and styles - where are they; i even tried to compromise by removing the stlyes and putting back the titles but once again you must have your way;
Victoire of France‎ - changed the awful layout along with her sister Princess Louise-Marie of France and Princess Marie Adélaïde of France 

Why?

The latter is quite amusing to me proving that you dont even read the article - you simply revert back because I did it - all I did was move the Template:House of Bourbon (France) to a different part of the page! Then you and your chronic arrogance go and revert it under the claim that there are rv excessive, redundant trivia contained in other articles then as always you groan on an on about the usual rubbish with please don't violate WP:3RR or WP:SOCK WHAT IS YOUR POINT ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Shut up!

 M-hmmmmmm....... 

So, you think that I was ranting, when during the entire article I explicitly noted that I am not, and that this is a serious issue that need not be """"stricken down"""" as hate speech or ranting. Let me rebut all the things you posted on my talk page:

- Ok, """".com"""" stands for commerce, but if you read my post without any bias in mind, that wasn't even my argument. I was just basically pointing out the fact that """".co.uk"""" is explicitly UK, and that """".com"""" can be anything, though it is necessarily NOT explicitely UK, as many of Wiki's articles seem to be.

- Yes, I said I didn't know where to start, meaning I didn't know where to begin addressing the issue, not that I don't know where to start addressing this issue.

- """"Secondly, there is Wiki policy that articles dealing with American topics have American English spellings, and articles about British stuff have British English spellings. If White House has British spellings in it, by all means change them to the US ones.""""
    
 I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to tell me here, but my guess is that you assume that I don't know about the current Wikipolicy, and that you obviously don't understand what I clearly stated. I am arguing that Wikipedia should either have ALL British spelling, or ALL standard English spelling (a.k.a - """"American english), but preferabally standard English because this isn't a British website, and because as an encyclopedia, all the information should be unified under one context and/or dialect.

- My point wasn't """"British are the only people that use British spelling."""" (although in a literal sense, this is a strong point outside of context), it was that """"The majority of the English speaking population use Standard English."""". If I seemed to use the former point, then either the way you interpreted my words was wrong, or I misworded my intentional argument. If I did, then my apologies.

- """"But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds"""" 
Again, you missed a subtle point that changed the entire meaning of my words. See the word generally? What I mean by this, if you can't already comprehend, is that many words in the British spelling include silent letters. Here's an example of one: pAEdophile. If one trys to pronounce this word by the letters, it would sound something like """"PAH-EHD-OH-FILE"""", adding an extra syllable, when it's really pronounced """"PE-DOH-FILE"""", which pretty much follows how the Standard English form is spelled. 

- I'm not very new to Wiki, and if that's a subtle way for you to try to undermind my intelligence, then I resent that statement. And again, do not take my words as rants. Anybody who understands the inherent nature of an encyclopedia understands that this is an important issue. Anyways, the way I worded my post was nowhere near the definition of a rant, please use a dictionary and find out what a rant is for yourself.

Please, if you can't understand the importance of this issue solely based on personal agenda (I understand you are British), then stay out of this. You have no credibility if this is the case since you cannot make a rational decision. If you haven't noticed, everything I posted had rationale behind it.

With respect, in light of the  fiasco I would like to suggest new standards for Administrators, both for the Admin's now working and future Admin's.

What we need at Wikipedia are REAL standards for Administrators, such as resumes, real names and reference checks...who knows who these people REALLY are ?  upstanding citizens? criminals? unemployed druggies? liars like Essjay?  there obviously needs to be a NEW set of standards...

Lest Wikipedia end up on the Citizendium blog again:

Three comments about NPOV
The second paragraph in this article links to 5 specific and very negative reviews.  However, no positive reviews are provided.  Instead, readers are provided to the wiki entries for religious right, conservative and creationist.  Since Rotten Tomatoes was used as a primary source for ratings, could this sentence be updated to include at least one link to a positive film critic review?  As mentioned in Wikipedia:NPOV, even minority viewpoints cannot be completed ignored (and in this case, minority viewpoint should not be applied since the minority viewpoint is the thesis of the film).  
There seems to be a large discrepancy between film critic/scientific community reception of this film and popular opinion (user reviews) of this film.  Popular opinion votes on Internet websites are not considered a reliable source, but in this case, since Rotten Tomatoes was already used as a primary source for this portion of the article, could this section be updated to include a reference to popular reception to this film, with a link to the Rotten Tomatoes User Reviews? (368 reviews, 184 positive, 50% rating at the time of this edit).  Google user reviews for this film (an aggregate, largely from epinions.com) show a similar 2.6/5 or 52% positive rating. 
Why is this film being treated so much differently than Fahrenheit 9/11.  In this entry, there is no reference to film critic opinion or popular opinion of the film even though the reception was [nearly as extreme] (except positive, not negative - 85% at Rotten Tomatoes)   11:25, 5",0

"""irrelevant; only what the world calls her matters. So I checked Google News: 2,753 hits for """"Ashlee Simpson"""", 489 for """"Ashlee Simpson-Wentz"""". I feel this demonstrates that """"Ashlee Simpson"""" is still the correct title. Does anyone oppose moving it back?   

I was going to say the same thing. Her legal name is irrelevant, this article should be at the most commonly used name that most people know her by, which is obviously Ashlee Simpson. 92.1.2.237  
Yes, and even her official website still calls her """"Ashlee Simpson"""".   

I will move the page back to """"Ashlee Simpson"""" in 24 hours unless there is an objection, or unless Google News indicates a significant trend toward general adoption of the """"Simpson-Wentz"""" name.   

I searched Ashlee Simpson as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz and pages are starting to refer to her as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz. Let's keep the article as-is.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.151.137.19   

Yeah, I've searched her as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz in Google News, and they've started referring to her as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz. The article is fine the way that it is.   

You can see the numbers I posted a few days ago above. The current numbers are 3,358 for """"Ashlee Simpson"""" and 559 for """"Ashlee Simpson-Wentz"""". I don't see a trend towards the latter. Most of the newest articles refer to her as """"Ashlee Simpson"""".   

Considering that she got married a couple weeks ago, I think that 559 results as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz is a good number of articles. It will probably increase as more articles are written.   
If that were the case, we'd see a trend, but what I see is that there was a spike in the use of the new name after it was announced, but that subsequently most sources continued to use the old name. The results indicate to me that the new name hasn't caught on.   

Read this: 
she's taking Pete's surname and is going by Simpson-Wentz professionally. I think this settles this dicussion. 24.151.137.19  
The point is that it doesn't matter what she calls herself. Wikipedia articles are titled according to the common name of the subject.   

Exactly. Ashlee is changing her common name. 24.151.137.19  
She can't change her common name. Her common name is decided according to what people want to call her. If they now start calling her Ashlee Simpson-Wentz, then that's her new common name, but if they keep calling her Ashlee Simpson, then that remains her common name. That's why I've been comparing Google News results, to see whether this new name is really catching on. Also, as I pointed out, her website still uses her old name, but maybe they're just lazy. Since there are two of you in favor of keeping it at this title, I propose that we wait one week, then look at the results again and see if there's more of a shift towards Simpson-Wentz.   

I just noticed that Danny has been going around changing the articles on her albums so that they are described as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz albums. Considering we don't even have a consensus on what she should be called now, I don't think it's appropriate to try to extend the Simpson-Wentz name to album articles which were released under the Ashlee Simpson name before she married Pete.   

I've searched Google News for Ashlee Simpson, which had 3,162 results, and Ashlee Simpson-Wentz, which had 1,613 results. So clearly, the results for Ashlee Simpson are dropping while results for Ashlee Simpson-Wentz are increasing. But, as Everyking said, he",0

 """"Jewish settlements"""" map

 The yellow area is unlabeled, but when viewed together with the partition map, one get the impression that the yellow area is all populated by Arabs.

In fact, as the text of the article states, the population was approximately 1/3 Jewish.
 It uses the term """"settlements"""", thus ignoring Jewish population living in the land for centuries in cities like Jerusalem, Safed, and Tiberias.

 ******* Double Standard Against Bosniaks *********** 

ChrisO doesn't want me to use copy of the original investigative article that was published in 1993 by David Bernstein (Pacific News Service). The reason is because he thinks this is a personal website http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html . What difference does it make? It's still original article published 13 years ago by Pacific News Service with full copyright notice? http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html

Anyways, balkanpeace.org is Serb-run website in which Bosniaks, Croats and other ethnic groups are portrayed as the worst of the worst, while Serb crimes are excused.

I urge ChrisO to protect Srebrenica Massacre article in a same way Israel's article is protected http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel .

And remember: Srebrenica massacre article is not about Serbs or pro-Serb lobbyists such as General Lewis Mackenzie. Srebrenica massacre article is about 8,000+ victims of genocide. Let's focus on the victims and honor them.

How would you feel if you lost your children, mother, grandmother, grandfather and all people that you loved and lived for? Ask yourself this question every time you edit Srebrenica massacre article. Search for love and compassion in your heart, you will find it.

"Digital Telephony 

Not sure where to put this, so I'll put it here. Tomorrow I'll take a peek at places like the Village Pump, the Help Desk, or perhaps the editorial council page thingy that I saw somewhere and see if I should post my query there.

I've noticed that a subject I've done some contributing to is lacking its own article. Cable television red-links to digital telephone service. General Communications, Inc. red-links to digital cable telephony (I created that one).

If I were king of the world, I would create an article called digital telephony and make both of the above-mentioned red-links redirects to it. Or perhaps I would create a disambiguation page that links to digital cable telephony, digital fiber-optic telephony, VoIP and other similar articles (some of which don't exist yet.

Alas, I might be king of the world — or at least have editing power in the Wikipedia — but I don't have the time or knowledge to create an entire article about it. What should be done? Should I (or someone else) create a stub and redirect both?

I'm just afraid that someone will create an article under one entry but it won't be tied together with another entry, and there will forever be a dichotomy...or at worst parallel universes in which information is not shared between related subjects.

Are my fears unfounded? Should I just leave it be and let it evolve on its own?

"Research shows that one of the most prominent characteristics of infant directed speech is the wider opening of the mouth that is present in those using infant directed speech versus adult directed speech.  This differences occurs especially in vowels.  Vocal pitch is also heightened during infant directed speech and research indicates vowels are spoken with the highest pitch when infant directed speech is used.  The horizontal positioning of the lips in infant directed speech does not differ significantly from positioning used in adult directed speech.  Instead, the only observed difference remains in vertical lip positioning.  By making the opening of the lips larger, infants are more likely to focus on the face of the speaker.  Research suggests that the larger the opening of the lips during infant directed speech, the better infants will understand the message being conveyed due to the additional visual cues available.  The intensity of speech, however, does not differ from that used in adult directed speech contrary to popular belief.   

Infant directed speech does not only include the characteristics of high pitched speech and elongated syllables, but also incorporates visual body movements that assist in conveying meaning of language to infants.  One monumental visual aspect of infant directed speech is the movement of the lips.  In addition, head movements are used to emphasize various syllables within language production.  These visual cues provide infants the additional information needed to perform accurate speech discrimination during language development.  Further, visual cues allow infants to discriminate speech differences in environments in which they cannot rely on their hearing, such as in noisy environments.  The auditory and visual aspects of infant directed speech do not exist independently, however.  Infants rely equally on both methods of understanding and as development continues, infants strengthen the link between these two important categories.  

It must be considered that although infant directed speech features marked characteristics, it may not only be these characteristics aiding in development of language for children.  Due to the visual cues used  by caregivers in this method of communication, infants are more highly motivated to engage in communication.  Because infants are willing to participate in this process, caregivers are able to make significant progress through the use of infant directed speech.  

It is often assumed that infants are interested in the properties of infant directed speech and play a passive role in this interaction.  However, research indicates that infants are not only attracted to the practice itself but to people who engage in infant directed speech.  Through this practice, infants are able to determine who positive and encouraging caregivers will be in their development.  When infants use infant directed speech as a determinant of acceptable caregivers their cognitive development seems to thrive because they are being encouraged by adults who are invested in the development of the given infants.",0

 Christianity and its Polytheistic Attributes  

Here are some credible, scholarly sources, as requested, for the statement about Christianity and how it is believed to be polytheistic. I request that editors maintain an impartial approach when dealing with Christianity-related articles and other religious articles. I further request that editors acknowledge the polytheistic elements of the Christian faith, the controversy around the issue, and that Christianity believed to be polytheistic by some. 

It says in the American Encyclopedia (an academic accredited work): 

""""The belief in the Oneness of God – as a theological movement – began at a very early stage in history, and in fact it preceded the belief in trinity by many decades. Christianity developed from Judaism, and Judaism firmly believes that there is one God. 

The path that led from Jerusalem (the home of the first disciples of Christ) to Nicea (where it was decided in 325 CE that Christ was equal to God in essence and eternal nature) can hardly be described as a straight path. 

The doctrine of trinity which was affirmed in the fourth century CE bears no resemblance to the original teachings of Christ concerning the nature of God. Au contraire, it is the opposite, a deviation from that teaching. Hence it developed in opposition to the belief in One God… (27/294)"""" 

Will Durant, in his The Story of Civilization says: 

""""When Christianity conquered Rome, the new religion (i.e., Christianity) was infused with the blood of the old idolatrous religion: the title of archbishop, worship for the great mother, and an innumerable number of lords who gave peace of mind and were like who exist in all places and cannot be detected with the senses. All of this came into Christianity as the blood of the mother comes into her child. 

The civilized empire handed over power and administration to the papacy and the impact of the word replaced the impact of the sword. The preachers of the church started to assume positions of power. 

Christianity did not put an end to idolatry, rather it reinforced it. The Greek mind came back to life in a new form, in the doctrines and rituals of the church. The Greek rituals appeared in the rituals of the monastic saints. From Egypt came the idea of the holy trinity, the day of reckoning, eternal reward and punishment, and man’s eternal life in one of the other. From Egypt also came the worship of the mother and child, the mystical union with God, the union which led to Platonism and agnosticism, and the erasing of Christian doctrine. And from Persia came the belief in the return of the Messiah and his ruling the earth for 1000 years. 

Despite the element of atheism in the words of Durant, which is something that he is known for, and which is apparent in his claim that the idea of eternal reward or punishment came from the Egyptians, tracing the origins of deviant idolatry in Christianity is no longer a secret, and he is not the only one who has researched them. In his book Christianity and Idolatry, Robertson states that Mithraism, which is a religion of Persian origin, flourished in Persia approximately six centuries before the birth of Christ, and it reached Rome around the year 70 CE, where it spread throughout the Roman lands. Then it reached Britain and spread to a number of British cities. What concerns us here about this religion is that it says: 

-         That Mithras, after whom it is named, was an intermediary between God and man (for a similar doctrine in Christianity, see Acts 4:12).

-         He was born in a cave or in a corner of the earth (cf. Luke 2:8)

-         His birthday was December 25 (which is the day celebrated by the Christians as the day when Jesus was born)

-         He had twelve disciples (cf. Matthew 10:1)

-         He died to save the world (cf. I Corinthians 15:3)

-         He was buried but he came back to life (cf. I Corinthians 15:4)

-         He ascended to heaven in front of his disciples (cf. Acts 1:9)

-         He was called “Saviour” (cf. Titus 2:13)

-         Among his attributes is that he is like a peaceful lamb (cf. John 1:29)

-         The “Divine supper” was held in his memory every year (cf. I Corinthians 11:23-25)

Only then may they be qualified to comment on the serious topic like Kamboj history or else earn the rights to edit informative articles on this wlllknown ancient historical People.

Contradiction between sources
Hi all. For now, I've removed this:

In 1840, an orthodox Jewish community constituted the largest single religious group in the city.Grenville, John Ashley Soames. A history of the world from the 20th to the 21st century; Routledge, 2005. pg. 456. ISBN 0415289556

I cannot access the text and would like to see it. I also think picking 1840 is arbitrary.  This source which provides a population table for Jerusalem from 1806 - 1945 on page 28 indicates that in 1838 the population was 11,500 people (4,500 Muslims, 3,500 Christians, and 3,000 Jews); in 1846 the population was 17,173 (6,100 Muslims, 3,558 Christians, and 7,515 Jews) and that in 1851 it was 25,354 (12,286 Muslims, 7,488 Christians, and 5,580 Jews). Given the city had become an important administrative capital for the Ottoman empire in the 19th century, its not suprising that there were new arrivals all the time from all three religious groups. I don't think we need to focus on 1840 in isolation. talk """,0

When he later saw more of what the party was about however, he suggested its members were being servile to the Slavs to the point of debasing themselves, as one who is utterly mendicant, whilst disfavoring the Germans in an attempt to save the multiethnic melting pot of Austria-Hungary.

Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

Dear Alifalsafi,

I made those changes, and stand for them, because of the following:
 You don't need to put the literal meaning of """"Gorgan"""" when introducing it. """"The land of the wolf"""" comes later in the text.
 Astar-abad has nothing to do with """"star"""" as far as I know, if you have references for that please provide them in the text.
 Jasmin Tabatabai was not born in Gorgan and is not living there, so her father's properties, no matter how vast, doesn't make her a Gorgani.
 """"Marcel Kazemi, the known german-iranian Crown prince of Birjand born and living in Gorgan, was also the last german after the islamic revolution"""", this sentence is meaningless, if not ridiculous. what it means that he is the last German after the revolution?
 Neither Dr. Sahedi nor anyone else is called """"notable figure"""" because of owning three hospitals. If you want you can create a page like """"people from Gorgan"""" and put these guys there, but they can't sit beside As'ad Gorgani.
 """"Pahlavan-e Jahani Suchte Saray, world champion of wrestling"""", I couldn't honestly find his name anywhere else, if you have more information please write it in a new page and then link it to this page.
 What is """"Literature: Gorgan Nameh"""" ? Is that a news paper? Is that a book? Is that a literary book? Who has written it? Just throwing in a name is not, I suppose, of much use.

Let's make this page more informative and more clear.  

Dear Mtdashti, Salam Hamshahri?
Thanks for your explanation and opinion.
The Book """"Gorgan Nameh"""" written by Massihi and issued by Amir Kabir company I haven't here currently. It was renamed from 'Astarabad Nameh' to Gorgan Nameh.
The old edition I have has no ISBN no. Maybe there exists a new issue.
The different Names of Gorgan I have found in that book. These are correct. The meaning Astar resp. Sattar is setareh. There exists also a TV reportage and a book where all world cities with the name Starcity are listed on a line.
All the persons I named I known self. And so I know they were Gorgani. The famous Kazemis lived in the street Shahid Beheshti ,the known 'Masrahe Talaii' building, and also in district 'Gorgan Pars'. They had much credit and eminence in the whole city. The only european and western foreigner which lived in Gorgan still up to the end of the war. Marcel was born here and attend the schools 'Nahal Enghelabe Eslami' and 'Shahid Motahari'. I've seen him also in TV during the visit of Rafsandjani. They were also the only relatives of the Shah in the city.
The Tabatabi lived in Gorgan and was a Gorgani, so consequently his daughter is also a Gorgani. He was a very large man, very nice and helpful, had a bald head and weared a toupee.:) Had the same face as his daughter. His only land property was here in Gorgan.
Soochte Sarayi, I don't know how his name is written in english was a very known person but I can't find an english web page for him. Because he was in the era of the revolution a world champion no one from the young generation know him any more.
All the persons are dead and so I thing I can't write more about them. Dr. Sahedi was a very deserved man in Gorgan's medical society. He repaired even self the X-ray devices and enabled so the function of the hospitals during the war. He died thereafter due to radiation in Tehran. A plate commemorated on him in the portal of the hospitals.
What a pity I've forgotten the name of the most powerful only ruling Mullah of Gorgan. Maybe anybody else know it.
Maybe a list of the Mayors is also interesting for the future. 
If you want make the page more informative, we should set only a link to another topic with the famouse persons of the city? It would be better as a mix.
So it's better to delete and displace all persons with except of governor and current mayor?
Furthermore 'Torang Teppeh' is in samewise important like the Gorgan Wall. Are you the same mind?
Thanks a lot
 Choda hafez 

Dear Alifalsafi,

Thanks for your explanation. There is much to talk about. Of course these people that you named are (or were) important and known to Gorgani people, I agree with that, but here in this Wikipedia, we should mention people who are known in Iran, if not in the world. As'ad Gorgani is a renowned poet, known worldwide, we can't compare him with a kind helpful doctor who helped people: they are both important, but in different levels. I don't agree",0
