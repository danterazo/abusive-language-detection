 Understanding how Wikipedia does things 

Hello Mike, I see you have some concerns about the article. First off, I want to note that this is exactly why we always tell people don't try to write your own article on Wikipedia. I was willing to write one for you because I think you're an interesting subject, but you really need to stop trying to work on your own article. It is absolutely impossible for you to be objective about your own work, and also you keep trying to make edits which are not properly sourced. To answer a few points:

Why are the links to the National Traditional Country Music Association pages and the Library of Congress Recorded Sound Reference Center underlined in red as non-existent? These sites do exist.  They are non-existed on Wikipedia; we aren't saying they're non-existent in general, just that nobody has written an article about them here yet. The red means """"someone should write an article about them"""". Before they were blue because you were re-routing the link to go to their own homepage, but we don't allow such external links to be used in the middle of the page like that, and also because that obscures the fact that we need somebody to write those articles.
 Regarding your nickname: if you say Plantenga is wrong, I've removed the nickname. However, you cannot simply go and fill in whatever nickname you want in its place, unless you have a clearly cited source.
 You really need to read our guideline/warning WP:Autobiography to understand exactly why you shouldn't be messing with your biography. You should not be making any edits on that page except to remove blatant vandalism. Again, you are literally the last person on earth who should be editing your own biography on Wikipedia, because doing so compromises the neutrality of the project.
 Lastly, I really suggest you read WP:Verifiability, not truth. The long/short is that a given fact is only useful if it can be cited to a good source, and no matter how true a fact is, it's no good on an encyclopedia without citation. So while we of course recognize that in the larger world, accuracy is the goal, on an encyclopedia our concern is how documentable a fact is. So on a certain level, we literally don't care whether a fact in Plantenga's book or in a Washington Post article is completely accurate, we care that it's clearly documented. Whereas if you make """"corrections"""" based on your personal knowledge, that just makes the article weaker because each such edit decreases its Verifiability.

At this point, you really need to just accept that you have a biography on Wikipedia, and it's sourced to published works, and be (moderately) happy with that. Wikipedia is absolutely not here for you to """"get the rest of the story out"""", or """"build your brand"""" or whatnot, we're just here to compile and organize information that has already been published by neutral experts. So please refrain from trying to edit your own article, it always ends badly and wastes time for everyone involved to have to change things back and forth, and just trust the Wikipedia community to do our best to keep things running smoothly.

Steven Colbert
Why can't this guy knock it off. This page was just fine until he opened his big mouth. He has given the wikiadministrators a lot of greif. What's his problem?  

Because it's funny.  God forbid people should cause you grief by opening their big mouths.  You should complain about that to an authority figure.

It's a fact that people get paid to write biased things on wikipedia, and the content can be bought.  If you believe wikipedia is an encyclopedia, with good information and other good things, then he's right, reality is a commodity.  Wikipedia told me so, and I believe what I read on wikipedia.

vandalism does not make things better. 

So how many people with the attitude that """"reality is a commodity"""" does it take before it's reality?  I have peer reviewed the idea that """"reality is a commodity"""" and I agree.  In fact, I've decided to pick it up!  

I love this stuff. Fred pays Jim to lob a brick thorough a shopkeeper's window. Who gets the blame? the shopkeeper!  

  I see what you did there. But there's more backstory to that shopkeeper than meets the eye. So there's this shopkeeper, right? And this shopkeeper, he has a shop that doesn't exactly sell anything. He just stands in his shop all day, and gives people answers to whatever they want to know. Now people start noticing this shopkeeper, and they feed the shopkeeper information to answer these questions as well as asking them things they need to know. It becomes a tightly knitted community. Things go well, until people start to unquestioningly believe what the shopkeeper has to offer. These people here, they forget that people like them are the ones feeding him information, and that whoever fed the shopkeeper this information might be just as clueless as they are. But they keep asking, and the shopkeeper keeps telling.

  Then Fred here comes along, and notices this from an outside perspective. He notices the fundamental flaw in that the advice people are getting from the shopkeeper is just as flawed as the people who told the shopkeeper the information in the first place. So Fred goes up to these people and points this out to them, but nobody seems to care. They're all happy as can be, asking their shopkeeper whatever they need to know and blindly believing what he has to offer. Some of them even retaliate against Fred for disrupting their bubble of ignorance. 

  Fred knows there's nothing that he, Fred, can do to stop this situation. But Fred here, he knows that if something isn't done, people will continue to flock to the shopkeeper like cancer patients to the messiah. And Fred knows guys. And these guys, well, they just happen to own a few bricks. So Fred calls up Jim, slips him some money, and Jim lobs a brick through the shopkeepers window. Of course in this instance, the shopkeeper is Wikipedia. The shopkeeper's devout followers are people who use the Wiki religiously. Fred is Steven Colbert, Jim is anyone willing to follow Steven, and bricks are the messages of those willing people who think that that anyone who uses the wiki religiously, and is willing to attack somebody for calling them on it, should take a step back and look at things in perspective. 
So the shopkeeper had it coming.

 INCONSISTENCIES 

On the two narratives of the Creation Story (Gen. 1:1-2:4a and 2:4b-25), please notice the following inconsistencies:
a. In the first narrative, man was created on the sixth day where man the last of God's creation. On the second narrative, notice that man was first to be created.
b. In the first narrative, all other creatures (birds, fishes, animals, plants, etc.) created before the creation of man where man created at the same time; both Adam and Eve while in the second narrative, note that Adam was first to be created then followed by the garden in Eden and then by the animal creatures. When none proved to be the suitable partner for man, it was only then that Eve was created where Eve the last to be created.
c. In the second narrative, the LORD GOD used the possessive pronoun I (""""I will make a suitable partner for man"""") while in the first narrative, when GOD created man, GOD said """"Let US create man...""""
d. Note that in the first narrative, God created all things using His word (Let there be...) while in the second narrative, Lord God created all creatures including man """"out of the (clay of the) ground"""".
e. In the first narrative, everyday of creation was always concluded with the phrase """"God saw (his creation) that it was good"""" while on the second narrative, the Lord God said """"IT IS NOT GOOD for man to be alone"""" considering it is He himself who created the man that is alone. Believe it or not, it is was a mistake. It then brings us to inquiring whether or not the creation of EVE in the original plan when the narrative suggests that had God did not mistakenly created man to be lonely, Eve could not have been created. Note further that the first choice of the Lord God to be the partner of man was animals. Upon notice of man's loneliness, God created different animals (2:19)and the purpose of their creation is to present them to Adam for man to choose which of those animals he may like be his suitable partner. Eve was actually the second choice after Adam rejected animals. Hence the question again, does God know what he was doing? It seems the creation process a matter of TRIAL AND ERROR. And true enough, EVE is a product of ERROR.
e. Bible scholars are one in the agreement that the second narrative was written way ahead of the first narrative. Gen 2 (the second story of creation) is therefore the original creation story. But why was it written A POSTERIORI the first narrative. Please consider the same parallel confusion of sequence in the first two books of the New Testament. Mark is an older Gospel than Matthew but chronology seem to follow the same confusion between the two stories of creation in the book of Genesis. 

 IRREGULARITIES 
a. On the first day of creation, God created LIGHT. On the fourth day, God separated the light that guides the day from the light that guides the night and all other stars and heavenly bodies. Question is; when did God created the SUN? Was it on the first or the fourth day. If it's the latter, what light did He create on the first day?
b. It is not correct to call the garden Eden. The correct text states (2:8) """"LORD GOD planted a garden in Eden"""". Eden is the place where the garden was planted and not the garden itself. The narrative even mentioned the location of the garden being """"East of Eden"""".
c. Note that in the 2:5, it was stated """"the Lord God had not sent RAIN upon the earth"""". Question: when was rain created?
d. Please check the absurd narrative of Chapter 6 about the Nephilim. SONS OF GOD marrying daughters of man and producing sons who were the heroes of the past and the popular men?"""" Huhhh?
e. It seems disenchanting to consider God a SUPREME ALL POWERFUL BEING but possesses the human frailty of REGRET; (6:6) And the LORD was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
f. NOTE: GEN 1, the creator was GOD. In GEN 2 and 3, it was the LORD GOD. In 4 to 50, its the LORD.

Merge with Kashmir
I hadn't seen this page before.  The article Kashmir is mostly about the princely state.  There is no reason for a separate article.  It will simply create more confusion.  Also, the Imperial Gazetteer of India content is not even minimally paraphrased.  Notice, in the  Kashmir article it is in quotes.  At best this page can be a dab page, but even that is recipe for confusion: imagine a new reader contemplating: Kashmir, Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu (which, by the way, was also called the Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir; in fact the instrument of accession to India by Hari Singh was signed by him with that title.), and Jammu and Kashmir, not to mention Azad Kashmir and lord knows what else.  «Talk» """,0

Of course atheism is a religion: it attempts to answer all the big questions that other religions do, and is based on a metaphysical claim incapable of empirical proof.  But you can quibble about what """"religion"""" means all you want, because the fact remains that theistic religions and atheism are all worldviews.

Many evolutionists disagree that evolution has nothing to do with atheism.  E.g.

All these points are very interesting and worthy of study and thought, but these points also remain: Jews remind themselves every year """"Slaves were we in Egypt,"""" and no real Jews would ever say: """"We are children of Abraham and we were never enslaved."""" The Synoptics contain several references to tax collectors and John not a single one. Josephus indeed does not say who was the leader of the great Jewish protest in Caesarea, and rather gives the impression that it was spontaneous and acephalous, but this is rather hard to believe. A brief mention of the Crucifixion of Jesus by Pilate follows, which may or may not be a useful hint. 

Besides the tax collectors, John also omits the Baptism of Jesus, the Temptation, the Transfiguration, the Kiss of Judas, the Tears of Peter, the institution of the Eucharist, etc. 

Roman historians are just as bad as the Gospel writers when it comes to confusing Procurators and Prefects. The archaeological evidence says that Pilate was a Prefect, but both Tacitus and the Gospels call him a Procurator, just to confuse us, perhaps. Das Baz, 18 April 2006, 10:51 AM.""",0

Elementary algebra may explains to readers certain core complex number ideas quite well, but I only put it out there for discussion.  Argand diagrams made complex numbers respectable.  These diagrams are metaphors, far from exact ones, of the imaginary field, yet appear in the article. Imaginary numbers are not yet points.  Keith Devlin wrote """"since the complex numbers are not points on a line, you cannot say which of two complex numbers is the larger; for the complex numbers there is no such notion."""" Yet he also stated """"There is, however, a notion of size of sorts.  The absolute value of a complex number a + bi is the distance from the origin to the number."""" [Devlin, Keith, The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible Macmillan, 2000: 133.} Desmond Fearnley-Sander explains that """"From a geometric point of viuew, complex numbers are not points but ratios of vectors."""" [Fearnley-Sander, Desmond, Plane Euclidean Reasoning, in Automated Deduction in Geometry, 2nd International Workshop, ed. Gao, X, et. al,  Beijing, China 1998, Google eBook: 108] They're the clock hand that points to the hour, not the hour point. 

Consistent with this logic, it's better to consider the plane rotating under the complex vector than the vector itself.  This sidesteps the variability of complex number position: its the plane's fault, if you will.  Want this grounded in mathematical foundations?  Look no further than the Riemann hypothesis.

Riemann extended Euler's zeta function, which Euler developed to find prime numbers, to define complex numbers.  Riemann's wanted to prove Euler's conjecture, which he attacked by solving complex solutions to f(zeta) = 0.  Riemann found x + iy, where x lies between 0 and 1, has infinitely many solutions.  He proposed they all (except negative even integers) are of form 1/2 + iy.  Computer tests find the first 1.5 billion f(z) = 0 (called z(s)) solutions lie on the line x = 1/2 in the complex plane.  But inductive evidence does not mathematically prove anything, and the Riemann hypothesis remains perhaps the most important unsolved problem of our era.

The only singularity of z(s) is the simple pole at s, or 1. There is no reason to assume complex numbers are points.  I don't believe this is non-standard. It is profound and documented.

Zeman asks them at the beginning of his letter whether they know Bandera’s statement “Kill every Pole between 16 and 60 years” and whether they agree with it.
If you have not heard these words by Bandera, you are not ukrainists. And if you know about that statement, then do you agree with him or not? If you agree, then our debate is over"""" - wrote Zeman.

Hi Pterantula,

The encyclopedia entry requires attributions and references.  For example, the studies of the """"effects of Landmark Education"""" is from the third-party surveys.  If, instead, the encyclopedia entry were to have customer testimonials instead, they could be struck on grounds they are not verifiable.  (We've gone around in circles on that many times as well.)

As well, the 20 points of critique are all against Landmark Education (with rebuttals in many cases).

As for litigation, I am aware of five outbound cases:

Pre-emptive warning

1) Traci Hukill """"The Est of Friends"""" (1998, pre-emptive warning, no suit filed)

Actual litigation, outbound

 Elle Magazine   (1998, LE achieved no result)
 Cynthia Kisser  (1997, LE won retraction)
 Margaret Singer (1997, LE won retraction)
 Rick Ross       (2005, LE cancelled suit for product disparagement)

There are about three inbound cases (against LE):
 Stefanie Ney (court ruled in LE's favor)
 Been versus Weed (2002; 10 claims, 3 settled, 7 dropped;  LE was a cross-defendent)
 Tracy Neff (1997, sexual harrassment, settled out of court;  LE lacked a """"sexual harrassment"""" policy at the time and got pulled in on this)

Does anyone have anything more than this from LE's inception in 1991 (14 years ago)?  Litigation regarding """"est"""" should be on the """"est"""" page.   For a company with $70 million in revenue and over 800,000 customers of the Landmark Forum, this is a tiny amount of litigation.

Cena = Gets too much shit from people for no reason. He can't control the way he is booked. I just believe they should stop pushing him before everyone hates him way too much or just turn him heel which would work for me.

Batista = Whines too much about his position in the company and should shut his mouth. Fuck him, job him out to JBL. I use to like him but he has main evented more than Cena and is in a better position than he should be just because of Triple H.

Orton = Does whatever the fuck he wants because he is a main star and friends with Triple H. Should have been fired already for smoking pot in front of everyone. If it wasn't for Triple H, he would be jobbing in TNA right now. Fuck him, that son of a bitch does not deserve the spot he has. He is good of the mic but ring skills lack, headlock after headlock.

Triple = Been playing politics for years and deserves to become a jobber for the people he has buried. He tried to keep Booker T and Kurt Angle down. Angle is one of the best wrestlers and if you watch his match with Abyss at Turning Point; which I can give you a link, it is worth the watch trust me; is still doing great things.

 Removed POV 

I removed undo criticism of Secretary Boutwell and POV. Wikipedia is not meant to bash persons reputations whether alive or dead. The following has been removed from the article.

""""Boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation, shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation.  Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. """"He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception,"""" Henry Adams wrote in a much-quoted analysis in 1870. """"He believed in common schools, and not in political science; in ledgers and cash-books, but not in Adam Smith or Mill; as one might believe in the multiplication-table, but not in Laplace or Newton. By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice, and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.""""Henry Adams, """"The Session,"""" North American Review, July, 1870, p. 36.  But in a very corrupt time, it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post, either for himself or his friends. Living within his salary, he lodged in a boarding-house throughout his tenure. His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker   though never for money. Chicago Times, March 6, 1875.  """"He is an inaccessible man, uninfluenced by fear, favor, affection or hope of reward, and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred,"""" a New England politician wrote his brother. Henry F. French to Benjamin B. French, March 16, 1869, Benjamin B. French Papers, Library of Congress.

""""Boutwell's financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic.""""Liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments; but while Boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part, , he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of Washington, remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses.''""""

 I didn't know you had personal interests in those articles.
 I didn't know there were boundaries of what I can work with.
 The project banner is not supposed to mark territory.  It only means those who belong in the project should focus on this article. 
 There's nothing wrong with tagging existing articles that fit current project scope.

I have edited Robot, AGV, and some of the articles about vacuums and lawnmowers...not much more than that, related to robotics.  You've tagged several hundred articles as belonging to your wikiproject, without editing any of them, at least not the ones I'm watching, which is most of them.  I'm not criticizing you...I think it's possible that tagging a bunch of articles could be helpful, it might get more people to sign up for WikiProject Robotics and share experiences first, and then edit.  On the other hand, it might mean that people who would otherwise edit won't edit, out of a sense that the article belongs to some other group, or they might misunderstand the """"low"""" priority.  I haven't been around long enough to know what works and what doesn't, I guess we'll see.

To User KF: Don't try to reason with Doc.

So just ignore him and reinstate the article with the tags you propose. He does anything to it again, either you can complain against him to the Arbitration Committee or to a more reasonable administrator for reversal of all his or her decisions.

(CNN)  While football fans were dumbfounded earlier this month when referee Mark Clattenburg failed to award a goal to Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Pedro Mendes, a small German company was quietly pleased.

 RfC: (Policy) Using bad practices from one article to justify another and possible sock puppetry; and (Politics) Acceptability of aggregated data in """"Election Results"""" section 

Policy
While not getting into the issue of reverting edits without first reaching out to the original editor to understand their motivation (in this case, the deletion of a table),  justifies the reversion of my deletion by pointing to other articles with the same flawed table...which he created!

Examples:

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Papineau_%28electoral_district%29&diff;=prev&oldid;=654041277 - the above article
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ottawa_South&diff;=prev&oldid;=593333525 - Ottawa South
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edmonton_Strathcona&diff;=636097681&oldid;=622403799 - Edmonton Strathcona

While we're on this topic, I found an identical table with identical formatting and citation in Toronto Centre...but added by !

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Toronto_Centre&oldid;=670004225

This strikes me as possible sock puppetry.  I'm hoping a more sophisticated WP editor can either confirm or deny my hypothesis.

Earl Andrew already admitted to working as a polling firm employee in Ottawa. It seems likely the same user is responsible not only for adding the content cited, but actually generating it in meatspace.  This in itself wouldn't make the content non-NPOV, though one has to wonder why Earl Andrew guards Canadian electoral district pages so jealously (including the """"Political Geography"""" sections which he invented, the topic of our last edit war).  Articles about Canadian electoral districts are not Earl Andrew's soapbox and should not be treated as such.

Further, in the edit history of every single article mentioned above (only a handful, but statistically, that makes the following more damning), Earl Andrew and Fungus Guy are responsible for the lion's share of edits. While I understand that topics as specialized as Canadian politics may have only a handful of active editors, this appears to be a suspicious pattern and should be treated with all due seriousness.

Politics
's """"Redistributed results"""" tables and the identical table added by , are composed of data aggregated from Elections Canada results.  I take no issue with the data, but being aggregated, they are no longer results.  As such, they should at least be moved into a more relevant section with an explanation, if not removed altogether.  Putting the table in the """"Election results"""" section implies they are Elections Canada tallies, quite possibly having the effect of misinforming voters.  And we're right in the middle of an election campaign!

Unsorted
I could have done a lot more editing in the past 4+ years, but instead shied away from larger and more time-consuming edits and rewrites because I felt the end result might be another """"100,000 Edit Man"""" coming out of the woodwork to stifle me.  When more voluminous editors are allowed to browbeat others into submission because they generate a lot of """"content"""" or have a page full of barnstars, it necessarily degrades the quality of WP by reducing the number of editors.  It's hard enough to fight the paid corporate trolls on here, dammit!

 The Dalai Lama has “banned” the practice of Dorje Shugden and in so doing caused a rift in the Tibetan community as it is a widespread practice.[6] Tibetan and Western practitioners are currently organizing demonstrations against the Dalai Lama's ban wherever the Dalai Lama appears, accusing him of denying them religious freedom.[7] The representative of the Dalai Lama appeared in Hamilton New York to say that from a legal standpoint there is no ban. However, he was contradicted by the practical examples and stories of Dorje Shugden practitioners which clearly indicate that while legally there may be no ban, from the point of view of discrimination there is clearly a ban in effect and it arises from the Dalai Lama’s words.

Brief history: On my return from holiday, last week, I discovered that another editor,  had posted a  which criticises my conduct and alleges that I am part of a concert-party aimed at articles substantially edited by him. During May 26h., I tried to add comments to the page and then had a discussion with him, above, which closed the matter between us.The following day, I posted links on the Talk pages of the other alleged conspirators, one of whom is . The entire correspondence with him reads as follows:

==Discussion involving you==You might be interested in the discussion on my 'Talk Page', here, which indirectly involves you. It is disappointing that the author has not notified you himself.  (talk) Seen all that. Out of context, of course, in every sense. In addition its dredged up from some time back when we were all wrapped over the knuckles then. It seems he wants people perpetually punished for not agreeing with him or for voting on the same pages. I'd hate to list all the AfD and other pages he and Vintagekits collaborate on. But thats all right. Regards,  :Yes; the image of a dog licking its own balls comes to mind. (talk) 

The metaphor is supposed to represent a self-indulgent act which gives great pleasure to the participant but which others view as embarrassing and repulsive.

The next thing I know is that some random Admin has popped up, blocked me, and disappeared again, reappearing on the Administrator's Noticeboard waving my scalp around. The diff link on the Noticeboard refers to the last post only, and a number of commentators on the Noticeboard immediately agree with the view that it is a WP:NPA.

I pause here to point out that either the Admin herself, or I (before I was blocked), could have blanked the comment, perhaps with a warning on this Talk page. I would have been perfectly happy to have done so myself, because I like to think of myself as reasonable and because the post was not intended as an attack; had I wished to criticise  I would have done so on my own Talk page discussion with him. (As it is,  had the sense to blank the discussion in any case.)

Anyway, that said, I reply as follows to those who have posted comments here:

' I hope that I have demonstrated that we're at cross-purposes. Frankly, however, you've made no attempt to engage with either myself or  or to resolve the dispute between us. You might just as well have blocked one of us at random.

' Thank you for yours. You're the dog's bollocks!

' Point taken, for what it's worth (I had initially understood 's complaint to be with the vulgarity of the metaphor rather than her seeing it as an attack). !vote discussions increasingly resemble a mass outbreak of Tourette's syndrome.

' Thank you for yours. I note you seem to have had rather an unpleasant discussion with  yourself on the subject, and I should like to thank you for your interest and understanding. I have also had a look at your User page, which I found very interesting and would like to comment further on your Talk page in due course. To answer your point, I did see how to request an unblock, but as the block was only for 24 hours, and the ground had anyway been cut from under my feet by 's posting on the Administrator's Noticeboard which had garnered approval for the block. I also dislike complaining to Admins about other people's behaviour; it just seems a bit wet to me (and I don't do it myself).

If you examine the history and comments I've left, you'll see that the few people who are responsible for warring on my contributions have routinely vandalized and destroyed my legitimate contributions, while for the most part when I've reverted to my versions I've usually tried to respectfully retain the valuable additions and changes they've made.
Also, universally recongnized FACTS DO NOT require """"sourcing"""" and links.

Now, I guess you do have the temporary power to disable me, but you'll only be furthher discrediting YOURSELF. Even the Wikipedia Administrators who have complained to me about my reverts and re-edits have admitted and openly SAID that ANYONE has the right to edit ANY page, as long as they do not violate the 3-Revert-24 Rule; if you care, go back and review where they said that multiple times.

I have every right to edit any article at least once per day; and my posts consist mainly of ADDITIONS to articles, not deleting portions of other people's contributions. All of my contributions involve generally adding additional information, opposing viewpoints and the pewrspective of critics; ALl my opponents edits consist of deleting my contributions and trying to silence my participation here.

So go ahead, try totally freezing me. I will simply write to the Wikipedia headquarters and request that they review the official record, and your biased actions and statements. I will quickly be restored to my privileges, because you have no case, and you are just harrasing me because of whatever prejudices, bias or immature resentments you harbor.

 Letterism 

John Granville Woolley, Civic Sermons, 1911:

""""The ignorant, dogmatic letterist may groan over the 'apostate church' and watch 
for the Lord to dishonor her and stultify Himself; but there is no 'apostate 
church.' The crowd that puts on its best clothes on Sunday and goes to meeting, the aggregate of the parish censuses, is not the church. But in that, there is the old, true church, unscathed and undiscouraged. She has held up Christ, straight through the centuries, and the crowd has come to her with many aims and many isms and many sins

Ernst Hofer, The Lariat, 1923 - """"Greek letterism""""

Richard M Edwards, Scriptural Perspicuity in the Early English Reformation in Historical Theology

The Antiochenes (literalist) opposed the Alexandrian School's (letterist) interpretive methodology founded on the Greek/Jewish allegorical interpretive methodology.

Mal Couch, Russell Penney
An introduction to classical evangelical hemeneutics: a guide to the history

""""Following the Babylonian captivity, the Jewish rabbis fell into the quasi-worship of even the letters of scripture, adopting 'letterism' as a springboard to allegorization and spiritualization. They committed the sin about which Paul later wrote: 'The letter kills, but the spirit gives life'. (2 Cor 3:6). To their credit, not all the rabbis fell into letterism or, later, allegory"""".

 Well, since we're making a list, individual bootlegs don't need to be notable themselves, but I know what you mean, we need some standards for inclusion. As with the sketchy nature of bootlegs themselves, we need to make sure we included only actual bootlegs (I mean """"bootleg"""" in the traditional sense of the word). Generally, I would say if we can find enough information to write a short paragraph or so on it, then let's include it. Most of the sources for this information is going to be found on personal sites of collectors and not really verifiable, so I would say for every inclusion we should have at least two independent sources. Unless... you got a book on Who bootlegs. I tried to track down my friend's, but he couldn't find it. (

I'm sure you've found these sites already, but these are what I've been using.

 http://www.xmission.com/~legalize/who/boots/index.html <- Hasn't been updated in forever. Mentions The Who: The Illustrated Discography as his source, which I believe is what my friend's book is called.

Edits by me:
searchlight has indeed been sued successfully many times. Someone has altered this fact to suggest that this isn't the case, while providing no proof. I'm changing it back.
 As a magazine, it bases itself on the one of the prime journalistsic principles of not revealing its sources. Amongst those sources have been Ray Hill, Tim Hepple, Matthew Collins, Darren Wells and Andy Sykes.  - isn't this rather contradictory!? Its sources obviously have been revealed, although I shall leave it in. """"prime journalistsic principles"""", however, is rather too complimentary-sounding for a NPOV article.
 Hepple has been discredited somewhat, but that is in no way a reflection on Searchlight's modus operandi. - no idea what's this is supposed to mean. It makes no sense without an explanation. I have therefore removed it - if whoever added want to reinsert and explain, fine.
 few minor NPOV tweaks, along with a little reprasing for better flow, and grammatical corrections (""""MP's"""", etc.). IT is still rather slangy in places, and this ought to be rewritten.

 Traditional or Simplified Chinese? 

I've moved this to a new section because it has become difficult to continue two topics in the same section. I would like to discuss what should be done about the issue of Traditional and Simplified Chinese in TW related articles (without discussing romanisation methods). My aim is just to get a consensus (either way), and not simply to push my ideas on wiki. I have tried posting similar topics in the HK page as well as the manual of style, but it seems hard to have an active discussion let alone get any real consensus. 

Why are we still including both sets in these articles?

Naturally I support removing simplified Chinese from TW related articles. It is just as misleading to include traditional chinese in the PRC article as it is to include simplified chinese in the ROC article. I am not talking about matters of race or cultural identity, but about de facto usage. Users in the pinyin section have argued (quite well) that hanyu pinyin should be included in ROC articles because it is used de facto, even in TW. So why then can't we eliminate simplified chinese from the TW related articles as TW's de facto standard is traditional chinese only? Wiki is not a chinese dictionary, so is there any reason to include TW and PRC's writing systems in the articles of the other? This doesn't have anything to do with anyone's personal views on """"one china"""" or """"two chinas"""", but rather is an issue of reflecting the language situation in both areas and cleaning up articles. Open for more discussion. """,0

But if you click on the """"Click Here"""" for a high resolution TIF, they state not to use for commercial uses, which would be incompatible with our policy.

The image on their userpage was uploaded by someone else though, who is interested in the same topics and has few edits anyways. I would say they are the same person. Lastly, the image on their userpage (:Image:FarmSanctuary.JPG) has a unique message I've never seen before about OTRS that says they gave permission. I asked on IRC and the OTRS folks said it was only for that image, but it seems they would be likely willing to license the others, if asked. My guess: Email the folks at the foundation, and ask them to do what they did for the other image, for the other 6 images that this user uploaded.

There are thousands of articles on Wiki where the original author was closely-related to the content. Once an uninvolved editor steps in and makes the tone/content neutral the tag is no longer valid. Its purpose is to serve as a warning that the content may not be neutral to other editors. Given than a lot of editors have since taken control of the matter here, and are enforcing measures to prevent Dom and those closely related to Davina from introducing puffery, peacocking and any other bollocks, there isn't really any need to """"warn"""" anyone that the content may be untrue. I'm sure if or when Davina's meatpuppet """"fans"""" make edits they are quickly spotted, verified and removed if unsupported. As such, I recommend removing the tag, in due course, once the minor disputes are settled. Tags are aids for editors to develop the article as fore mentioned, they should not be used in the spirit of a warning system to general readers.  [Chat • RFF] """,0

The tank losses extremely biased

The Indian tank losses are exaggerated at atleast 175 tanks this means some Pakistani wants to believe that even more than 200 Indian tanks were destroyed. And the Pakistani tanks losses are put at minimal 200 tanks. The original source is US library which i dont consider as neutral at all considering the fact that US was a supporter of Pakistan. The losses dont reflect the fact that Pakistan lost almost all major battles of """"Khem Karan"""", """"Phillora"""",""""Burki"""" and even at Chawinda according to pakistan general himself pakistan lost 34 tanks(india claim 57tanks) on the other hand Pakistan exaggerate its claim to 120 tanks(India accept only 29 tanks) more importantly at Khem Karan and Phillora Indian army put on display some 100 tanks at khem karan and 58 tanks at phillora then how is it that pakistan losses are mere 200 and Indian losses """"Atleast 175"""" a complete lie. 

Spencer C Tucker one of the most renowned military historian puts pakistan losses at 300 tanks(Indian claimed 494 tanks) and Indian losses at 150 tanks(Pakistan claimed 290tanks).

http://books.google.co.in/books?id=N481TmqiSiUC&pg;=PA172&lpg;=PA172&dq;=pakistan+tank+losses+1965&source;=bl&ots;=O9UCZHbyUs&sig;=-oILZn-csKxRzDXKPkNF3-dGEPY&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=rZsOUPWhENHirAfzuIDoBg&ved;=0CFUQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q;=pakistan%20tank%20losses%201965&f;=false

All the Indian editors plz focus on this the neutral losses are represnted by US figures which i think are biased and further Spencer C Tucker is also one of the most renowned historian , even Stanley Wolpart and Jeremy Black made it clear that at the end of war Indian Army has Twice the number of tanks(Pakistan started with more tanks when war started).

All the Indian editors must raise this issue as some pakistani editors think that by peddling lies they will win the 1965 war.

"I am certain that it is wrong to say categorically, without detailing what one means when one says that biodiesel is non-toxic. Even apart from the fact that you are generalising on several items: mode, temperature, duration of exposure, plus even more pertinent: on source of oil (what plant it is coming from, and which part of it) and whether it is a methyl ester or ethyl ester. In my view it is irresponsible to say categorically that biodiesel is non-toxic.  If you insist then you can sign on the bottom line, if anyone comes to harm from biodiesel of any source and in any application you'll take the responsibility, but I don't think that you would be foolish enough to do that.

As an example: The toxicity of erucic acid (see WP under that title) a component of some canola oils and several others is a contentiou issue. Canola (rapeseed) oil is classed as high, medium and low eruc canola oil and only the low erucic acid canola oil is accepted universally for human consumption.

If you study a textbook on vegetable oils and fats you will find that the composition of an oil can depend on which part of the plant it is coming from.

Another example of the danger of generalisation: Is rhubarb toxic ? Its roots are not, but the leafs are deadly. So if you insist on leaving the statement in, then please say what you mean exactly (which biodiesel, when and how)

 Does the ongoing ANI (I haven't checked it yet) regarding canvassing, pertain?

"""==Subalpine Fir==
Hi Walter - thanks! very nice pics again -) I'm doing very little on wiki just at the mo, my computer seems set to expire, keeps on freezing in mid-type . . grrrr! (so if I disappear that's why). Nootka Cypress has been reclassified recently, you'll find it at Callitropsis nootkatensis now (the reasons for the change are outlined there) -  
Thank you. I've put Nootka Cypress in the proper category, now. I'm sorry to hear of your computer woes. Best wishes.  
Thanks! Been wondering - do you have any opinion on whether it would be better to have Subalpine Fir at one page or two?: the two species split used by Fl. N. Amer. is far from universally accepted (e.g. USDA don't accept it). I was thinking of (a) moving the present page to just 'Subalpine Fir', and (b) expanding on the one/two species discussion, to make a page similar to that for White Fir (also split into two species by Fl. N. Amer.), or the coverage of Alpine Spruce at Norway Spruce. Let me know what you think -  
I think that is a good proposal and support it. Pojar (op. cit.) does much the same and it works well. Coast Range Subalpine Fir and Rocky Mountains Subalpine Fir would be replaced by redirects to help those unfamiliar with the issue.
Will do, computer permitting! (just now, it seems to need 2 hours cool-off time for every half hour of working before it goes on the blink - yet a temperature indicator says it isn't overheating)
Hmmm - needs an admin to do it; I'll give Guettarda a buzz -   Addenum - Guettarda's done it now, I'll start working on the page -  
I thought the White Fir and Norway Spruce articles were very good.
Thanks! -)
Some redirects for the White Fir and Norway Spruce common names seem to be missing. Is this intentional?
No, my oversight - I'm forever forgetting to do all the necessary redirects. By all means add any you see missing!
Do you have plans to work on Abies amabilis anytime soon? It is the dominant mid-elevation species west of the Cascade crest in Washington, often with only small number of other individuals, mostly Thuja plicata and Tsuga heterophylia.
Yes, again computer permitting; for pics I've got a studio closeup of some foliage (useful to show the dense pubescence) but a pic or two (or three or four ...!) from the wild would be brilliant. Any options on getting cones, or is it a poor crop this year?
Your suggestions of image subjects from Washington are welcome.
Any are welcome! If there's lots, they can always go in ... format. Outsize trees are nice, but typical 'average' mature specimens are also perhaps better for an encyclopedia (I liked the Whitebark Pine pic in that respect), and shots of foliage + cones. Vine Maple would be good too, there's already a PD pic from the USDA, but it's very low res and could do with replacing, ditto for several other broadleaves too. And Taxus brevifolia (only very low res PD pic at the mo).
Best wishes,  
Thanks again! -  

Thank you for the image suggestions. I think that I can get some of them soon.
Thought of another - Grand Fir could do with a tree pic - 
Perhaps the giant tree images could go into a new article Giant Trees or something similar, eventually.
Someone else suggested that too, by moving the ==Champion trees== section out of Tree to its own page; it might be a good idea - 
Why not request admin status? I'd be happy to suggest it, if you prefer.

Hi ChrisGualtieri! Thanks for reviewing my SpongeBob GA nominations. Anyway, the season 5 article is I think complete and I think you should check it out. If you found any issues that are not yet resolved, please post it in the review page. About the season 8 article, please fail it because there are still more issues to resolve. Thanks for working on this. )  (t • c) """,0

 First point - it was not only treated as mental illness, but as criminal activity.
 Second point - you should only refer to 'homosexual romance' in the lead if there is a section that deals with 'homosexual romance' in the body of the text, as the lead is a summary of what is in the body, and having ten sources does not count for much unless the terms are unpacked somewhere in the main text.  All these seem to show is that people like Giddens (who is a notable sociologist, but no authority on sexuality, sexology,  LGBT studies in general or homosexuality in particular) use the term.  If there were a link to an article Homosexual romance, which shows the term can be taken for granted, fine - otherwise it needs to be dealt with in the article before it can be inserted into the lead. 
 Third point, my earlier comment about this was made with ironic and humorous intent, because I have only come across the term 'romance' used in this context, at conferences, ironically or critically.  Just because a term is used in sources does not mean that it can be used in the lead when it is not in the text, for example, """"Homosexuals deserve to be executed or tortured""""   """,0

 Gabriel Olutola 

There are some issues with Gabriel Olutola, which I just deleted.

I had previously identified some concerns with this article. You seem to understand that there were issues and agreed to address them. We let some time elapse so you could address them, but you did not make any substantive progress toward resolving the problems.

In addition, you are not communicating in a way that is desirable for editors. You are perfectly free to remove material from your talk page (although archiving is generally considered preferable). However, if you simply remove material and do not respond, it is difficult to understand your thinking. I don't know for example, whether you felt that you cured the copyright problems, or perhaps thought that the source of the text was an acceptable source. If you explain your actions it will be easier to help you.

I recently deleted the article because it had copyright problems and I saw no action by you to address them. I now see that you have restored the article in substantially the same form as the article that was deleted. Again, if you do not communicate I do not know what you are thinking. I don't know whether you thought it was deleted in error, whether you thought you cured the problem, or something else.

I notice that the version you restored is not exactly worded the same way as the source. However, we have seen editors who think that changing a word here or there cures a copyright problem. It does not. Please read the following link for more information: Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing

I also ran a duplication detector which does not pick up close paraphrasing, it only picks up exact matches. Even with this cruder measure the article is problematic. I'll provide the link below so you can see the results. However, I emphasize that changing a word or two here or there to eliminate the exact matches is not the cure.

Duplication Detector

Unfortunately, we have identified other articles with issues. I haven't had a chance to look closely but we may be following up with other articles which need addressing.

I urge you to take this quite seriously. If you are editing with a misunderstanding of policy we can help you understand the rules. If you do understand the rules and ignore them, you may be blocked. Explaining your actions will be the best way to ensure that doesn't happen.(Talk) """,0

Hi David, great explanation and thank you.
I acknowledge and accept your main points above.  My only argument is that the term """"British Isles"""" is being used as a substitute for a more accurate term.  If we substituted the word """"Europe"""", we would lose the point that this was the first anglican bishop to not swear allegiance to the British monarch on behalf of a """"province"""" outside the kindoms controlled by the British monarch (in enemy territory).  The scottish anglicans were still within the area (Kingdom of Great Britain).  As a note, the relevance is those two points taken together - not swearing allegiance *and* not being in an area controlled by the monarch.
BTW, what is the connection between the consecration of Samuel Seabury and the founding of the new province?  Is it assumed that the new province was recognized immediately?  If so, what is the relevance of representative clergy from nine dioceses meeting in Philadelphia to ratify the church's initial constitution in 1789?  Is this the actual official founding of the province?
If you are happy to substitute the term with kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland as a compromise, I am fine with that.    """,0
"""

Exactly, Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song """"Behind These Hazel Eyes"""". Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called """"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes"""", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like """"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved"""". I like the """"problem solved"""" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.

TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her, so much so they forbade users from writting what Belle's eye color is. Notice how Belle's name is missing from the Eye Color tropes colony, while the rest of Disney Princesses have their eye color mentioned. Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?

I noticed she has a Live Journal account. See what she has written. The lack of links speaks for itself. She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote """"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?"""" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.

If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.

My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl. I think it's safe to say the interent is better off without her. She's toxic, she's a nuisance, she's talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her, she lies, she mangles, twists and misrepresents other people's words, and she causes edit wars. Action needs to be taken against people like this.  """,0

You really do not understand:

1-The question is why the symbols must be removed from the infobox;

2-They MAY be still valid. What we have until now, and nobody can find more evidences, is that law of 1962; The last law that deals SPECIFICALLY with the topic is the one to be followed; It doesn´t matter if this law is from the time of Cleopatra. It doesn´t matter if it´s a colonial symbol.

3-There are many examples throughout history: New York city, Jakarta, São Paulo city, Rio de Janeiro city, and many other cities used their colonial symbols until a new law dealing with the subject was created. Some even maintained their colonial symbols, like New York and Rio. That´s a heraldry principle.

4-What we can do is to put a tag or something saying """"MAYBE STILL IN USE"""". If there is no newer law dealing with the symbols of Dili, YES THEY ARE VALID NOWADAYS, as strange as it can be.

"Way I see it, people who say the Sherman is a very good tank, are seriously overestimating it. I mean come on, it was nicknamed Ronson for a reason you know. Any tank that has to maneuvre around at close range to the sides and rear of an opposing tank to score a kill is definitely not good. The only notable good Sherman at the end of the war is the VC Firefly, but because US Ordinance doubted the 17 pounder could be fitted onto the tank, it was manufactured in limited quantities. 

The only notable features of the Sherman was that it was produced in large quantities, had a mechanical reliability that beat the T-34, and came with better secondary equipment such as FM Radio and an elevation gyro-stabiliser.

Not to mention the extremely sad stories behind it. Once, a Sherman maneuvered around a building to hide from a Tiger tank. The Tiger shot at the building, and the shell went right through and penetrated the Sherman's turret. There are also tales of German tanks who take out two aligned Shermans in one shot. Also, do you know why you see all these wartime photos of crewmen who have Shermans with spare road wheels and tracks welded onto the hull? Those are efforts to help augment the armour of the Sherman.",0

I notice that we have a Category:European goddesses. It would appear that most European goddesses are individual personas, just like everywhere else. I think what some writers appear to have done is gather evidence that a particular triplet of goddesses associated with fate seems to be attested across Europe (going way back to whenever).
I think a little confusion arises because this reality was expanded upon and popularised by Graves (19th century) and others, leading ultimately to pride of place for the Triple Goddess in neopaganism (20th century), and later popularised again by certain elements within the feminist movement (late 20th century).
Ultimately, we don't have to restrict material to only one article. I doubt that the US civil war is left out altogether from the article on the US, just because it has its own article. ;)
I think Fuzzypeg's main concern is ensuring that Wikipedia documents the scholarship regarding pre-19th century triplicate goddesses in Europe.

Apata Sahi is located 35 km distance from its District Main City Khurda .Apata Sahi Pin Code is 752102 and Post office name is Prataparudra Pur and Police Station is Balianta .Apata Sahi is a mostly farmer village in Khurda district, Odisha, Situated amidst groves of coconut, palm, mango and jack fruit, the main village has two streets with over 60 houses, most decorated with handicrafts.  It is situated on the bank of the Kushabhadra and other side is Prachi.  The village is very old and has a number of special features.
Although it faces flood every year, the geographical feature of the village has not altered. It is believed that Maa Yashomati who is the village deity protects this village in all kinds of disaster. Another specialty of this village is that there is no Brahmin family here. All the families bear the surname of Moharana (Carpenter), Gaya (Yadav), Behera (Fisherman) and Sahu.  There is no sign of work. They all are farmers. The main occupation of our villagers is cultivation.
It is a small village with only sixty families. Its population is about five hundred only. It is sixty kilometers away from the Bay of Bengal (Sea Beach, Puri). It looks green as there are many green trees in our village. The place of Maa Yashomati is situated in the first of the village. There is also a big pond near the temple. There are Banyan (Bargad) trees and Ficus religiosa(Pippal) trees. This part of our village presents a beautiful attractive color arrests everybody's attention.
Our village has been awarded by the Kalyani Team, Door Darshan, Bhubaneswar for the cleanliness and purity of atmosphere. The villagers do not differ on any issue. If at all there is a dispute, they sit together at Bhagabat House and settle it amicably by all villagers.

"""This comment is a classic straw man argument meant to misrepresent the side that wishes not to include the questions and answers to the test.  The author writes """"But we have to decide whether we believe in a society where most people are only allowed to know some few things that more enlightened heads decide are useful enough to them to justify any potential dangers and social problems they might create."""" Of course I and psychologists would agree that most people should not be forced to know only """"some few things!""""  The problem is that Mike Serfas provides a false misrepresentation of what the minority wants.  We do not want """" society where most people are only allowed to know some few things.""""  We want a very narrow and specific limitation - no cheat sheets (questions and answers) to tests that are used to help people. Other than test questions and answers the more encyclopedic information the better! Is that clear enough? We do not advocate that """"only psychologists know psychology"""" as falsely claimed, only that test questions and test answers ought not be leaked.  It's as simple and limited as that. Leaked questions and answers to psychology tests make articles on those tests no more encyclopedic than leaked questions and answers on the SAT or some other test would make articles on those subjects """"encyclopedic."""" A """"democratic sense of equality"""" brought about by leaking  psych tests is no different than one for medical licensing exams (""""why shouldn't everybody be able to practice medicine? let's leak all the questions ans answers...""""), etc.  

When you leak the test questions and test answers to a history test you rob that test of its purpose: to examine how well students have learned history.  A history teacher objecting to leaking this information does not wish that history remain a secret known only to him (on the contrary!).  He just wants to be able to tell how well his students have learned and it's much harder for this to be done if he can't use a test to do it.  Similarly, when you leak the questions and answers to a medical licensing exam, you rob that exam of its ability to test whether or not people are qualified to practice medicine. This makes it much harder to determine whether or not someone is qualified.  The purpose of the Rorschach is help the psychologist make accurate diagnoses in order to help people and society. Mr. Serfas' statement that """"is no consensus even among psychologists that the test is useful"""" is absolutely false.  There is some controversy between a small group of psychologists led by James Wood and the majority over whether or not it is overused but even Wood, the Rorschach's main opponent, states that the test is not worthless (see this article. This controversy can be adequately described (and ought to be) in the article without including the tests' """"cheat sheet"""" (its questions and answers). Even Wood states that the Rorschach is good at detecting thought disorder. Thus, by posting its questions and answers it becomes more difficult to accurately diagnose thought disorder; a tool for doing so has ben compromised.  People might be given pills for it that they otherwise would not have been given, or conversely not be treated for something they have.  Most psychologists would welcome a lot of encyclopedic information about the Rorschach in the article.  It would be useful to dispell some of the scary myths about the tests, etc.  They object to including information about the test.  Just not the test's questions and answers.      

So no, psychologists on this forum are not monsters lurking in lairs, or a secret society doing unknown and scary things which must be exposed, which is the picture you and others seem to be trying to paint. They're just people defending a test used to help people which, like most tests, gets damaged if the questions and answers are leaked all over the internet. It's rather difficult to engage in a dialogue when the other side misrepresents the minority position to such a huge degree, and then others vote or make decisions against this minority based on the misrepresentations rather than the actual position.  I hope that this has cleared things up for you and others.

Some people have claimed that psychologists and others want to bring back the """"dark ages"""" by not having questions and answers to tests on this page. I invite you to consider if maybe there is some of that going on on the other side?  There was a time when """"common sense"""" indicated that it was ridiculous that people were descended from monkeys. The science, backed up by thousands of studies, is clear that the Rorschach works - but """"common sense"""" tells some people unfamiliar with it that the idea that what is seen in inkblots can tell you something about that person is ridiculous. Or that some kind of """"magic"""" is involved (scientists were once accused of witchcraft).",0

Van Hoogstraten (R on the Application of) v Governor HMP Belmarsh

Case No: CO/4302/2002TABDate: 23/09/2002

40. The term """"legal adviser"""" in rule 2 must embrace any lawyer who (a) is chosen by the prisoner, and (b) is entitled to represent the prisoner in criminal proceedings to which the prisoner is a defendant. On the evidence before the court, Mr Di Stefano is an Italian avvocato who falls within the definition of """"EEC lawyer"""" in the 1978 Order. He has been chosen by the claimant to represent him in ongoing criminal proceedings. It therefore follows that Mr Di Stefano falls within the term """"his solicitor or counsel"""" in rule 2 of the Prison Rules.
41. Under rule 38(1) Mr Di Stefano must be afforded reasonable facilities for interviewing his client in Belmarsh Prison in connection with the current criminal proceedings.

MR JUSTICE JACKSON: Thank you. The claimant has won on the grounds set out in his claim form. The claimant has won on the live issues before the court. The proper order in all the circumstances of this case is that costs should follow the event. The defendant must pay the claimant's costs of the judicial review proceedings.

10. The argument which Mr Johnson deployed at the hearing last week was to the following effect: An Italian avvocato is not a solicitor or a barrister; therefore he is not one of those persons entitled under Rule 38 of the Prison Rules 1999 to make a legal visit to Mr Van Hoogstraten in Belmarsh Prison. There was before the court last week evidence that Mr Di Stefano is an Italian avvocato. There are a number of references to this in the documentation before me. Perhaps most pertinently the bundle at page 67 includes Mr Di Stefano's identification card and halfway down we see: """"Professione Avvocato"""". On the right of that there is a photograph of Mr Di Stefano and his signature.

11. There was no reservation by the defendant to the effect that Mr Di Stefano was not an avvocato at all. Argument proceeded last week on the question whether or not an Italian avvocato fell within rule 2(1) and rule 38(1) of the Prison Rules.

17. It should be borne in mind that Mr Di Stefano is the lawyer who has been chosen by the claimant to represent him in criminal proceedings. He has been chosen as the lead lawyer to represent the claimant, and under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights the claimant is entitled to be represented by the lawyer of his choice. That must entail the opportunity to confer with the lawyer of his choice before he appears for sentence.

25. Mr Di Stefano has been appointed as the principal legal adviser of the claimant. It seems to me that Mr Di Stefano has exercised wise judgment in the legal team which he has appointed. He has selected as one of the Leading Counsel to make the plea in mitigation a leading authority in the field of criminal sentencing. Mr Tam submits that with such a distinguished legal team it is quite unnecessary for Mr Di Stefano to visit his client in prison. He can receive instructions at secondhand, and Article 6 does not require Mr Di Stefano's presence.

26. I do not agree. Mr Van Hoogstraten has chosen Mr Di Stefano as his principal legal adviser. The choice of principal legal adviser is for the client. It is not for me; it is not for counsel in this case or anybody else. It is a matter for the client, and if he wishes to appoint an Italian avvocato as his principal legal adviser, and that Italian avvocato has rights to practise in this country under the 1978 Order, then Mr Van Hoogstraten is entitled to take that course.

And more important the concession made by the Home Office 

71. If your Lordship then goes on to page 61, your Lordship will see the letter written to the Central Criminal Court. In the second paragraph of that the letter is said to enclose the documentation referred to therein, including the Power of Attorney and the Certificate that he has as to his good standing as an avvocato in Italy. Then in the fourth paragraph, the identification card which describes him as an avvocato. 

72. Now, it appears that the certificates on 64, 65 and 66 are the certificates referred to, but as your Lordship will recall I think a concession was made last week that those certificates are in fact of good character in terms of criminal convictions and charges and do not relate to his status as an avvocato. And then the identification card on 67 itself describes him as “avvocato"""". One does not know which of the two ambiguous meanings that might have.

 Recent edits by User:Ramorum 

Ramorum, please discuss your recent edits here instead of accusing me of vandalism for undoing your edit.
I will explain here why I think that your recent edit represents a violation of WP:NPOV and WP:NOR.

You have changed the title of the section """"Constitutionality"""" to """"Unconstitutionality"""" and added a paragraph that reads:

The REAL ID Act violates the following articles and amendments of the United States Constitution: Article I, which does not grant the Congress of the United States the powers asserted in the  REAL ID Act. Section 8 enumerates the powers authorized to the United States Congress. The Fourth Amendment, which states:  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. The Tenth Amendment, which states: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. The legal encyclopedia American Jurisprudence says the following in regard to constitutionality: The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and the name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void and ineffective for any purpose since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it; an unconstitutional law, in legal contemplation, is as inoperative as if it had never been passed ... An unconstitutional law is void. (16 Am. Jur. 2d, Sec. 178)

These are fine legal arguments and I personally agree with them. But they clearly represent a personal judgement (correct as it it may be) on a controversial political topic. But that is not what Wikipedia is about. WP:NPOV implies that statements of opinion, such as The REAL ID Act violates the following articles and amendments of the United States Constitution, are not appropriate in a WP article. It would be perfectly OK to say, however, something like Critics charge that the REAL ID Act violates the following articles and amendments of the United States and then provide a reference to some reliable source
where such criticism is raised. As your edit reads now, not only does it represent a statement of opinion, but the way in which this opinion is justified also, in my view, violates WP:NOR. Instead of citing some sources where consititutionality of the Real ID Act is questioned in the way you describe, you list some general legal sources that in your view (and in mine)justify your opinion. This is a clear instance of original research that WP:NOR prohibits.

There are plenty of newsarticles and other reliable sources that criticize the Real ID Act and I think you will not have much trouble finding a few of them that raise the same points as your edit does. So if you want to make a constructive input, please find such sources and add them to the article. Regards,   """,0

 Carol Kivler testimonial and mechanism of action 

I have removed new content on the mechanism of action and an endorsement from Carol Kivler.  Medical content on Wikipedia is strictly governed by guidelines and policies. I'm not sure the Kliver testimonial, or any testimonial, is appropriate for an evidence-based article. A very important guideline is Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources (medicine). The source (Perrin et al.) for the mechanism of action content does not conform to that guideline.

Perrin et al., an fMRI study of ECT and frontal cortical connectivity in severe depressive disorder, is not appropriate for the claims the new text makes. Per the guideline I linked to above, we rely on expert reviews to put such results into context. This study can be mentioned once a review has done that, if the review gives it sufficient importance to warrant inclusion.

Also, it's important to be very precise in paraphrasing sources. The recent edit said, """"The group's findings confirmed the hyperconnectivity hypothesis of ECT"""" which is stronger than the source's """"The findings reported here add weight to the emerging “hyperconnectivity hypothesis” in depression...""""  

I'm not contesting the veracity of any of the content. But to be included in Wikipedia, the relevance and accuracy of all medical content must be supported by sources that conform to the above guideline - usually systematic reviews, graduate-level textbooks, national or international professional guidelines, or similar, that can be expected to accurately reflect the current scholarly consensus.

The following comments have been deleted:

The band promotes Croatian patriotism and ultra-nationalism, and sings about topics such as the love for one's country, family and religion, but also about the hatred of Serbs and Croatian social democrats. Dealing with such topics has made the band controversial. Perković has been known to openly promote Ustaša ideology because he wears black clothes, salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the Ustaše and the NDH in his statements to the media. 

Ultra-nationalism?Ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation.While patriotism means that you love your own nation,but you respect others.Where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations?And no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbs,because it was the time of war.And only mention songs written by him.Not what he is accused of performing.

 Hatred toward SDP?Where?Name source.He is right wing,that si widely known.Of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatia,but hatred? Reliable source please.

Where does he promote openly Ustashe?Citation please.Because he wears black clothes?Are all rockers Ustashe?By this,rock 'n' roll is equal fascism.He is a rock singer,of course he wears black clothes.
Salute he uses is an old salute of Croatian nobles,that existed long before Ustashe.

Despite this, his statements confirming his support for the Ustaše actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual NSDAP equivalent (he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the NDH, in various degrees, to the media on at least twenty occasions). His credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning (or other legal action).

Again,I see that this is already discussed.Feral is not reliable,its a tabloid.Only reliable newspapers should be used.And these quotations in Feral,while they may be true,there are no links to check the meaning,because they may be taken out of contest,and they could have totally fifferent meaning ii their original contest.This is not reliable.

And one more question.A couple of months ago I translated two Perkovic's statements in Jutarnji list and Vecernji list.I've put relevant sources,links to that articles.And a picture was there also.Someone deleted all this without giving explanation on the discussion page.This is not what wikipedia is about.Any change must be explained.Shame on anyone who uses this kind of sneaky methods.",1

 Re: References 

This article's references appear to be entirely bipolar.

Are there any neutral sources available?  01:21, 10 January 2006 (EST)

It is hard to find a """"neutral"""" reference about Scientology.  Anyone that has studied it seriously soon discovers that its a viscious cult and a global scam, and therefore their """"neutral"""" report becomes a critical report.  There are sources in the media like Richard Lieby (now at the Wash Post) that have written numerous newspaper articles exposing the cult.  There has been an article in Time Magazine about the cult that was reprinted in Readers' Digest.  60 Minutes has done a couple of exposes on the cult as well, but none of these have been flattering for Scientology.   The task you are expecting is akin to asking someone looking into the pit of hell and write a neutral non-POV article about Satan incarnate.  Unfortunately, it just isn't possible.   

There is a page that purports to be a neutral resource at [Bernie's Scientology Pages], but even a cursory examination of his site shows that 99% of his words and pages are either criticizing critics of Scientology or making excuses for the Church of Scientology.  Most critics of Scientology believe that Bernie is in fact doing the work for the church.  """,0

As I said, the general re-work (to me) is fine, and WP policy and recommendation is that valid additions or re-works should NOT be undone or reverted, and most of the time I stick to that...(it's NOT my article or anyone else's)

 PLEASE READ BEFORE ADDING ANY MORE RUBBISH 

As far as I can see Wikipedia has become a very turgid shadow of what I originally signed up to - and I really can't see any point editing it any more.

Having followed the climate articles for many years and now having a great deal of expertise, I can no longer just sit back and hope that Wikipedia will some day come around to a NPOV. There are certain simple things that are so obviously POV pushing that it beggars belief that they still go on: 

Not using common names when they are used by everyone else
Not admitting simple facts like it is not currently warming.
Pretending """"global warming"""" is a """"scientific"""" issue when everyone knows it is mainly political rhetoric even when practised by the """"scientists"""".

And don't you dare think I'm pushing POV - I have not once added anything to a climate article without first seeking consensus (which basically means I have never edited a climate article)!!!!

I KNOW WHAT IS A NPOV ... BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED FROM WHEN I USED TO BE A GLOBAL WARMING ADVOCATE AND NEITHER HAVE MY VIEWS ON THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGED ... I JUST CAN'T STAND PEOPLE BEING DISHONEST, AND I JUST THINK SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS

From the day I first tried to get a NPOV on the climate articles (when I used to work in wind and was openly saying global warming is happening) till today, I haven't once managed to get a substantial change toward NPOV into a climate article. '''I'm angry ... not because I f*cking wanted to put the sceptical view ... it is because you bunch of pr***s have turned me into a sceptic because you refuse to see the obvious POV pushing that has been going on.

And the great consolation, is that the climate articles have been so POV that most decent people can spot it a mile off and what with climategate, the propaganda in Wikipedia is no longer considered a reliable source.   """,0

  Central figures behind FishBase are Daniel Pauly and the fish biologists around him at the UBC Fisheries Centre. FishBase itself is supervised by an international consortium which fields many of the world's most prominent fish scientists. The consortium includes the FAO itself, so in that sense it would be true to say that FishBase and the FAO are entangled. The central fisheries scientist at the FAO for many years was John Caddy. Daniel Pauly and John Caddy have, over the years had conflicts which could be regarded as representative of conflicts between FishBase and the FAO. Two high profile examples that spring to mind were a disagreement in 1999 over fishing down the food web, and a conflict in 2001 over FAO fishery returns. I have never seen FishBase and the FAO disagree on the common names of fish. That issue would arises only in relation to commercially significant fishes, since the FAO does not concern itself with fish that are not commercially significant. Presumably many wide ranging accommodations and rationalisations have been made within the FishBase consortium, and suppose this would be an example of one of them. We cannot know for sure, since the consortium doesn't seem to make its deliberations public. But the attempts some editors are making on this page to discredit FishBase are, well just plain ridiculous.   23:33",0

They have coeliac disease, it does not define their person and it is, IMHO, quite offensive and gramatically incorrect to call someone a coeliac. We don't call people with Chron's disease Chronies...

"""Welcome to Wikipedia:
Remember the five pillars of Wikipedia. 

  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia incorporating elements of general and specialized encyclopedias, almanacs, and gazetteers. All articles must strive for verifiable accuracy: unreferenced material may be removed, so please provide references. Wikipedia is not the place to insert personal opinions, experiences, or arguments. Original ideas, interpretations, or research cannot be verified, and are thus inappropriate. Wikipedia is not a soapbox; an advertising platform; a vanity press; an experiment in anarchy or democracy; an indiscriminate collection of information; or a web directory. It is not a newspaper or a collection of source documents; these kinds of content should be contributed to the Wikimedia sister projects.   Wikipedia has a neutral point of view, which means we strive for articles that advocate no single point of view. Sometimes this requires representing multiple points of view, presenting each point of view accurately, providing context for any given point of view, and presenting no one point of view as """"the truth"""" or """"the best view"""". It means citing verifiable, authoritative sources whenever possible, especially on controversial topics. When a conflict arises regarding neutrality, declare a cool-down period and tag the article as disputed, hammer out details on the talk page, and follow dispute resolution.  Wikipedia is free content that anyone may edit. All of Wikipedia's text is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA); much of it is also licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL).

Recognize that articles can be changed by anyone and no individual exclusively controls any specific article; therefore, any writing you contribute can be mercilessly edited and redistributed at will by the community. Do not infringe on copyright or submit work licensed in a way incompatible with Wikipedia's licensing.  Wikipedia has a code of conduct: Respect your fellow Wikipedians even when you may not agree with them. Be civil. Avoid conflicts of interest, personal attacks and sweeping generalizations. Find consensus, avoid edit wars, follow the three-revert rule, and remember that there are  articles on the English Wikipedia to work on and discuss. Act in good faith, never disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point, and assume good faith on the part of others. Be open and welcoming.   Wikipedia does not have firm rules besides the five general principles presented here. Be bold in editing, moving, and modifying articles. Although it should be the aim, perfection is not required. Do not worry about making mistakes. In most cases, all prior versions of articles are kept, so there is no way that you can accidentally damage Wikipedia or irretrievably destroy content.

Mish Mash
I believe this  article in its current format is a major mish mash because by a curious mix of disparate citations  it  seeks to cover Khatris from the Peshawar to Nadia  in  Bengal and  deep south into peninsular India . 
So either the article is restructured to cover by provinces ( Both India and Pakistan)
or by creation of separate articles for Khatris from different states . Although the overwhelming majority of Khatris are Punjabi , this article in its current state has juxtaposed  citations and content from books pertaining  to one region to attach to another , which is really quite absurd . 
Some interesting references to Manu Smriti and Dasam Granth also need discussing in the way these books have been used in the article . 
And off course the addition and deletion of some interesting citations on this and related articles by both """"new"""" and experienced editors also needs exploration .  """,0

Hello RR.
I think the link to the Railway Performance Society should be included for a few reasons. Readers can see what the society is about and whether they think its references and research are worthy. Furthermore, to be frank, the RPS generally at least wants some publicity for using """"their"""" sources and data, which, to be frank, I think is fair enough, it`s not as if they`re a business in it to make money. If you want to move the link to the reference at the bottom of the page be my guest. I think this is a classic case where an inflexible attitude to Wikipedia`s """"rules"""" is counter productive. As I say on my """"User page, we shouldn`t lose sight of why we`re actually here.

On the Cecil J Allen book, it is actually a book which I have in my collection, the full title is """"Locomotive practice & Performance in the 20th Century"""", first published by Heffer in 1949.

On the reference thing, my eyes just glaze over when I see that, my brain is already full.... Just as I sometimes edit others grammatical errors, I`m quite happy for others to edit my references if they want !

Incidentally, is there a spelling checker on the Wikipedia software because the one on my Google toolbar doesn`t seem to work on Wiki editing for some reason.   """,0

Concerning the deletion of information: you deleted the """"Program for 1st Annual Workshop on Geoethical Nanotechnology"""" page and merely left links to the videos, hence no one would even know the circumstances of how the video came about or when it was made; with Jason Rennie's interview you deleted everything except a link to an archived Archive.org page which doesn't even have a working link to the audio (talk about incompetence); and so on it goes.

 White House circumcision petition needs 2,455 more signers by OCT 23

The National Organization of Restoring Men has information about Circumcision 

Routine infant circumcision is in direct violation of human rights. It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: """"Do no harm."""" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. 
It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.

 Concerns on Shiromani version 

User:Kayastha Shiromani has apparently restored the version of the article pre-dating my cleanup, as well as made some additions. Diff is here: . I submit that Shiromani's version is unsuitable on multiple levels, and also undoes a large amount of totally WP-appropriate work I added. Just to touch on a few major points:
Extensive amounts of the Shiromani version are WP:Originan research from ancient texts
A historical image of a Kayastha scribe has been replaced by an image of a god they claim descent from, which is far less informative as to the community itself.
Right in the lede it makes major claims like the only sect who are referred to as direct descendants of a Vedic God with only a blatant fansite, http://chitraguptvanshi.wetpaint.com as a source vice an actual academic work.
Random OR editorialising such as Also, it is but logical to consider the status of the Kayasthas when Sanskrit was the state language under the Hindu Kings.
Frequent non-WP tone, such as honorifics such as """"Lord"""" and a generally promotional slant on this caste
A massive """"family tree"""" of individuals of no clear notability
WP:Primary sources cited as References
A lenghty list of community websites, rather than a short list which also includes more NPOV approaches.

Long/short, I submit it is not appropriate to undo all my improvements and bring back an updated version of the highly flawed older version. If you disagree, we can take this to Dispute Resolution, but I am quite confident that the version I and others have been working on is more neutral.   """,0

 Request that """"Civilians..."""" section be cleaned up 

I am unable to edit right now, so I would like to draw a more senior user's attention on this matter:

This paragraph needs to be changed to use less inflammatory wording:

Strikes on Lebanon's civilian population and infrastructure include Beirut airport, residential buildings,[67] clearly marked ambulances,[68] fleeing civilians prominently waving white flags,[69] United Nations posts and personnel,[70] ports, a lighthouse, grain silos, bridges, roads, factories, medical and relief trucks,[71] mobile telephone and television stations, fuel containers and service stations, and the country's largest dairy farm Liban Lait.

""""clearly marked ambulances"""" and """"fleeing civilians prominently waving white flags"""" is ridiculous wording, clearly showing an Anti-Israel bias.

It is fine to say that there have been confirmed instances of ambulances and fleeing civilians being hit, but to use language like """"clearly marked"""" and """"prominently waving white flags"""" is completely unacceptable and should be removed.

Also, I will request again that some mention be made of Hezbollah's use of warheads filled with ball bearings (whihc are designed to maximize human casualties).  All mention of this was removed, apparently by POV vandals.

The part about the ball bearings was moved down and is now next to the part about Hezbollah using civilians as human shields, I believe.  """,0

However, because the initiative was controversial in the eyes of many pro-gun groups, it made national headlines with Daly’s name featured in newspaper articles, etc., BillyTFried thought Proposition H should be included in the Chris Daly article.YouTube video: Yesterday night, BillyTFried posted some words on my Talk page along with a link to a YouTube video of himself firing what looks like a semi-automatic weapon. (In case the video gets taken down, it is 1:43 minutes long and shows BillyTFried firing weapons at a shooting range while thrash music plays. BillyTFried occasionally leers at the camera. The video is titled “Shoot Em' Up!”.)

Last night when I read his post, I thought it was just plain weird and creepy, but I didn’t feel threatened. This morning, however, I mentioned it to my wife, who was horrified. She pointed out that BillyTFried lives in the same town as me (he told me the cross streets where he lives) and that his post on my Talk page with the video link was made in the context of a gun control debate. She thought he was threatening me.

I did not take up this matter with BillyTFried because, frankly, after watching his video, I don't want anything to do with him. I’m just curious what the community thinks of this and whether some action should be taken against BillyTFried.

I think that this page is in needs of a major overhaul in order to improve its quality. To me the following steps are required:
 1)Discussing a new name
 2)Updating the Lede and the infobox
 3)Expanding the background
 4)Reorganizing the later categories (informative titles better than montly titles)
 5)Searching for typos and grammar

 Why.... 

Has the article Jacque Fresco been removed... WHY OH WHY!!! Now I don't have his picture anymore on facebook! Goddamit!  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 145.120.15.192   

 Discussion of New Jacque Fresco Article 

The new article is up. There may be some contentious information in it. I realize the """"Reception"""" section may be most controversial. Some may recognize that there are events and issues missing from the article. This is because some popular claims have not been verified yet or cross-confirmed. On the other hand, there may be some things that are superfluous. Discuss suggestions here. Good luck editing it; it's an intricate string of text.   

Good job! I do have some concerns with some of the sources, though. """"The Soveriegn Independent"""" is hardly a reliable source, but just one these infinite slanted political outlets claiming to be """"alternative news"""". Russia Today is notoriously unreliable as well with load of nonsense news about aliens making it look more like Weekly World News that a source of information.  In addition the Florida Living Magazine article is basically an interview with Fresco, and therefore the source is Fresco himself, and as such it may break WP:BLPSPS. That goes for Jack Roberts Miami news article as well, but at least it's used much less as a source. And that article works fine as a source for him being called a dreamer, though. ) And why did you add Frescos claim of making a car with only 32 moving parts, not not his claim of inventing a 3D TV with picture so real you could feel you could touch it? ;-)   

I considered whether some of the news articles will be reliable beings they use Fresco's word as their source. But in many instances, the citation is doubled up and the claim/information is cross referenced between those two sources. But if some is unacceptable then we will have to make adjustments.  

Maybe it can be rescued if we point out that it's his claims and we say that he *claimed* to develop a car with only 32 moving parts. We have no source for this except two interviews with him, one which he also seems to claim to have invented 3D TV, that articles' reliability is maybe not as high as we want it to be. But I suspect that in biographies we shouldn't have personal claims even if we mar them as such, but somebody with more BLP experience than me should make that call.   

There are some parts of the article regarding the theory of The Venus Project that I disagree with, but on the whole it seems to be an outstanding piece of work. There is a lot of stuff about Jacque Fresco that I would have never known about if this article had never been written. Very nice, short, interesting biography; well done. I like it.  (  )

For the most part, I copied that info from the Venus Project article. I plan on expanding the Venus Project article to cover more of the theory, and will then modify the info for it on the Fresco page.  """,0

 == Issue on images still unresolved == 

I appreciate your inputs in Image talk:Monkey3.jpg and I agree once in a while I might sound rude (purely unintentional, since I put facts blantly). But SlimVirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone.

Slim is not a """"he"""". Given that she named herself after a Javanese princess, perhaps you could take the hint and note that she's a woman. Also, I don't think you were simply blunt. I think you were rude to Slim. I recognise it's a fine line but given that I've mentioned it to you, perhaps you'll take more care to stay on the right side of it?

She has suggested in an email to me, that she is in talks with another editor. Now, I don't know who this other editor and i certainly don't like this secrecy. Instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. She could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.

Perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. I think that would be reasonable. I have a high regard for Slim and I don't think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.

Inso far as the images are concerned, I had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by PETA and its assocites.

So you have a dispute. You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary. I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.

This should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.

The BUAV is not a """"controversial organisation"""". It is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of British society. A viewpoint doesn't become """"controversial"""" just because you don't share it.

Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints - 

But you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.

thus I requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.

I don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.

As far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have """"agreed"""" to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.

First of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith. Perhaps you're not aware of that policy. Yes, you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.

Once I pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.

Yes, okay. Trust her AND ask for proof.

Both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.

I'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.

If she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information.

''I think that's a bit dramatic but I agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. However, she is not a """"copyviolater"""" trying to destroy Wikipedia. Partly, I think she simply didn't understand your problem, and that was in part a failure of your communication, and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesn't handle disagreement well. So perhaps you could recognise that and be more helpful than combative? I know",0

"""

First of all, congratulations on the Good Article status.  Nice work.

Since you don't object, I have added that section back to Little Boy.  That action should not affect its good article status.

Here is my reasoning.  That particular bomb design is uniquely associated with the Hiroshima bombing, which, in turn, was largely a public weapon effects demonstration.  Its purpose was to show that a single bomb could duplicate the effects of, say, the Tokyo firebombing which required 279 airplanes and 1,700 tons of bombs.

Hiroshima was spared any earlier bombing in order to serve as a pristine nuclear bomb target, a situation made possible by its lack of importance as a military target.  The two airplanes that accompanied Enola Gay were there to measure the weapon effects.  Nobody expected the loss of Hiroshima to tip the balance in favor of immediate surrender.  The """"shock and awe"""" was expected to come from observing that it was effect of a single bomb.

Most of what we know about nuclear weapon effects comes from an intensive study of Hiroshima.  It was flat urban terrain well protected by natural and artificial firebreaks, and it was enough larger than the total destruction area that the margins of the effects could be precisely measured.  Nothing new was learned from Nagasaki, and no other bombs were tested on live urban targets.  In the many test explosions that followed, large and small, the overpressure and thermal impulse contours were measured, and the Hiroshima effects were extrapolated to estimate the theoretical destruction area.

Granted, it was pure happenstance that Little Boy, and not Fat Man, was used at Hiroshima, but since it was this discussion of weapon effects seems appropriate here.

 I think Mateas and Cox are enough to establish notability of the subject.

The term may have been taken out of context from an earlier website called """"Esoteric Topics in Computer Programming""""; that site used """"Esoteric Programming Languages"""" as a section name about a much broader set of languages, seeming to use """"esoteric"""" as an adjective like """"unusual"""" rather than as part of a specific term.

You can recognise that flag as much as you want, it does not bestow any legal status upon it. Can we include other unofficial flags in the infobox? Northern Ireland does not have a flag that uniquely represents it, and the Ulster Banner is an unofficial flag. If an unofficial flag does in the infobox it gives undue weight to the flag. There is no """"tug of war"""", the editor who restored the flag without consensus has this to say on the matter:

I can see right away that the official flag of Northern Ireland is going to cause controversy. There are two options: 1) That this is an encyclopedia, and we stick with the correct information or 2) We appease a minority of people by changing the flag to the defunct Northern Ireland flag.. some of whom will still not accept that flag either.

The emblem of the Northern Ireland Assembly is just that - an emblem used by that body. The proposed flags have not yet been adopted and so are not official.

This leads me back to the two suggestions above - the official flag of Northern Ireland (the Union Jack), or the unofficial Northern Ireland Flag. I do not want to purposely cause offence (though it seems to me that anyone likely to be offended by the official flag would also refuse to accept the existance of Northern Ireland in the first place), but I do want to include factual information in this encyclopedia.

Note that he claims the flag is both unofficial and defunct. Obviously his option 1 is the correct option, we stick to correct information.  We've already had outside opinions before (see above), and they unanimously said that as there is no official flag, no flag goes in the infobox. 303 """,0
"History 
Long before white settlers entered the area, Mississippian Indians or more specifically Adena and Hopewell Indians inhabited the present day area of Fredericktown. Early settlers found three mounds and earthworks located on nearby hilltops.  While the Raliegh Mound and Stackhouse Mound and Works are preserved today, the third mound, located by what is presently the Baptist Church, was demolished.  These mounds were all visible from one another when there was no foliage or building obstruction.  Both preserved mounds were most likely ceremonial structures and they are oriented towards the Sun's movements.  When settlers arrived, all they found were these abandoned sites with few other traces of the people who lived there. There were a few scattered Native Americans that settled nearby along what was then the perifery of Indian Lands established by the Greenville Treaty Line.

The first white settler was John Kerr who in 1807 bought and platted the town and built a mill on the North Branch of the Kokosing River.  Growth was sluggish until the Sandusky, Mansfield, and Newark Railroad came through the village in 1853.  A grain elevator, a foundry, and other small trading businesses set up shop to establish Fredericktown more firmly as a business center than nearby crossroad settlements of Batemantown and Waterford.  Around World War II a small airplane panelling factory was built and later reverted to the furnature manufacturing.  In the last half of the 20th century, a few light manufacturing operations and the largest privately owned general construction contractor in Ohio, Kokosing Construction, have been established there.",0

 Question concering RFA votes 

As you have not answered my question that I asked you on Download's RFA, and before you show me that subpage, I already read it, so there is no need.  Secondly, do not quote policy on me and evade, simply answer the questions, please.

 1.How many more active admins do we have now then we did at the time you nominated Child of Midnight for adminship?
I nominated him because he asked for it. I probably would have opposed if he actually accepted it, but he didn't. I do not care about active/inactive admins. I am only concerned with good/bad admins. Remove all the bad admins, and then start nominating good admins.  
 2.Please explain your ideal active admin-to-article ratio.
The number of admins is fine, there are just too many bad admins that hurt the project more than they help it. Again, there could be 20,000 admins, and I would be fine with that, but there must be no BAD admin. If all 20,000 were active or inactive I wouldn't care, as long as they were good and followed policy. The current 1000+ has many bad administrators, this is why there are too many. I would be fine with 500 or 5000 admins, as long as they are all good. As soon as an admin blocks some maliciously, or deletes something that wasn't within policy - he should be desysoped by policy without a vote.  
I've always seen you vote in oppose, and while you are indeed entitled to your own opinion, I would like to understand what you view as a good admin / bad admin. I find it hard to believe one should assume bad faith in that all potential admin candidates  are considered bad. Could you please explain your criteria for what makes a good admin in your opinion?  
I also wish to still know what your desired admin-to-article ratio is, and why, if you think an admin is bad, don't you just say that, instead of answering with .— dαlus Contribs 

That is all, since you put great thought into your votes, I'm pretty sure you should be able to answer these questions with absolutely no problem what-so-ever.  Than you for your time.— dαlus Contribs 

 Something to take note of 

Hi DougsTech. I just wanted to make you aware of a bit of information regarding your RfA voting pattern. In the past you have claimed multiple times that you're not violating any policies/guidelines with your RfA votes, but you seem to be in violation of WP:AGF. You are obviously not assuming good faith when you oppose every admin hopeful you see. If you think someone will be a bad admin, you need to provide a reason specific to that candidate, otherwise you're assuming bad faith, which is contradictory to the principles on which Wikipedia was founded and on which it still operates. meh!(review me) 
No, he's not.   
Someone else can has already found their flaw, and the other that oppose the candidate give reasons why he/she is a bad admin.   
That doesn't excuse you not to give a reason though. — (talk • contribs) 
Hey I've got an idea! Start a thread about this at WT:RFA. Otherwise, accept that he has his reasons, they are good and have been thoroughly explained multiple times. Stop harassing him over it.

My two main suggestions are to make smaller improvements to the article and to use more than one source. Unless you are very skilled at proper paraphrasing, using a single source greatly increases the risk of close paraphrasing, i.e. improper paraphrasing, and also leads to a very one-sided view of the subject. I've added two reference to the article with links to their pages on Google books (most of which are visible, at least in the UK). The print copies may also be in the Longy library:
Marco, Tomás (1993). Spanish Music in the Twentieth Century. 
Draayer, Suzanne Rhodes (2009). Art Song Composers of Spain: An Encyclopedia
The previous reference I had added—Romero, Justo (2004). Liner Notes: Joaquín Turina (1882–1949): Piano Music, Vol. 1—is also very useful, especially for discussing his musical style and works chronology. I suggest you use these as your sources for further expansion with the biography on joaquinturina.com] as a back-up only.
 
One thing you could do is separate out the last paragraph (beginning with """"His works include..."""") with its own heading Music and expand the commentary there. For example, he was a very noted composer of art song, which is given short shrift in the article. Much has been written about his approach to incorporating Spanish musical idiom in his work and on his style in general, including its strengths and weaknesses. This is also lacking in the article.
 
Another possibility, is to separate out a section at the beginning of biography to Early years where you discuss his family background and his musical education prior to Paris. The material between that section and Music could be entitled Paris and Madrid and can always be expanded in the future.
 
A third possibility is to expand and rationalize the list of works in the article. The current one has three major problems. First, it excludes many of his important works because it relies solely on those scores available at IMSLP. Secondly, it gives no indication of each work's type. Thirdly, it gives no indication of the date of their composition. Listing them alphabetically, is not a good way to go. If you do decide to concentrate on improving the works list, I suggest using List of compositions by Claude Debussy by genre as a model, although in this case, the list would not be a separate article, but rather continue to appear in the Selected works section of Joaquín Turina.
 
Hope that helps. Best,   """,0

Okay, I disagree with this just as strongly as I disagree with attempts to say he wasn't Jewish.  Firstly, Marx didn't kill anybody, nor did his ideology.  A bunch of people claiming to be inspired by his ideas killed millions of people.  And given that the German people managed to produce some unquestionably German people who unquestionably actually did murder millions of people, I'm not going to weep for the fact that the Germans are also saddled with responsibility for one of the greatest political philosophers of the nineteenth century.  Beyond that, Marx was born and grew up in Germany with a very limited connection to his Jewish ancestry.  His primary language was German, and this is the language in which he wrote most of his works.  Although he spent most of his later life in England, I've never really heard that he didn't always consider himself to be a German - I'd think, in fact, that living in England would have accentuated that.  While I do think that his Jewish background is important, and make it perfectly reasonable to describe him as a Jew, his German background was substantially more important than his Jewish one.  His own works emerged out of post-Hegelian debates within the German philosophical community, and his greatest influence throughout his life (and for several decades afterwards) was in Germany, where Marxists were far more dominant within the socialist community than they were in most other parts of Europe (Britain, France, and Russia, in particular, had their own, non-Marxist, socialist traditions that were not assimilated into Marxism for a long time, if ever).

Done. Posting in the middle of people's comments, as User:HistoricWarrior007 did, is certainly undesirable and something to be avoided wherever possible.   

 Quoting emails 
Increasingly, some parties are quoting emails from the leaked archive (ex. . I thought that this was not to be done (""""No quoting of any email is to be done by persons other than the author or intended recipient(s)"""")? Am I mistaken? | talk  
I believe the intention of the provision you have quoted, is to prevent wide-scale quoting of entire emails and entire email exchanges; that is the assumption I will work off when taking affirmative action (as opposed to reactive action, such as this), although I invite you to have the Committee comment on my interpretation of it. Regardless, I'll ask Offliner to paraphrase what you wrote on the mailing list, although having him do this could be to your disadvantage as it provides him the opportunity to represent what you said on the mailing list in whatever way and with whatever language he chooses.   
Daniel, I don’t mind you removing my entire section (at your discretion) for as long as you read it, by going back to my post, and relating to the particulars listed in it. However, there’s nothing in the initial provisions of this case indicating that you’re supposed to prevent only wide-scale quoting of entire emails and email exchanges. – That is your own interpretation of the warning which needs to be confirmed by the Committee. Meanwhile, quoting of illegally accessed emails includes also explaining in ones own words what’s in those emails, which in a way is even worse, because paraphrasing other people is obviously tainted by personal agendas. Cheers,  talk 
Quoting, out-of-context and possibly doctored emails is creating, IMHO, more problems than paraphrasing, as it gives an air of legitimacy to this harassment campaign. PS. Offliner is not the ony party quoting @s, Russavia is doing that as well. | talk  
(edit conflict) I'm charged, as the Clerk of the case, to interpret the directives I receive. Until such a time as I am explicitly overruled by the Committee, how I interpret those directives is how the case will be run. I have interpreted the directives and disallowing the quoting of the contents of emails, allowing the subjects of emails, and allowing the paraphrasing of content of emails where said paraphrasing. If you're concerned about mis-paraphrasing, the other alternative is to give permission to be quoted; otherwise, your emails can and will be paraphrased within reason. If you believe a paraphrase is misleading, you are free to address it in your own evidence section.
These are the rules for the case.   
And in response to Piotrus, either allow yourself to be quoted explicitly, or refute the paraphrasing in your evidence section, or else appeal my decision to the Committee by email to arbcom-l@lists.wikimedia.org. I will be happy to have my interpretation, which is binding on the case absent a contrary directive from th",0

Black Keys leave Fat Possum, pay tribute to Junior Kimbrough

 The Black Keys Split With Fat Possum, Prep Releases

Kati Llewellyn and Amy Phillips report:
The Black Keys and Fat Possum Records seemed like a match made in blues-rock heaven, right? But as Jack and Meg (or Puffy and J.Lo or Britney and Justin) will tell you, sometimes couples that look like they're perfect for each other just aren't meant to be. Sigh...

Black Key Dan Auerbach told Billboard.com recently that his band and Fat Possum have parted ways, and they are currently shopping around for an American home for their forthcoming album, which they hope to
release on September 12. (V2 will put the record out in Europe, and Modular will handle it in Australia.) Although the album is untitled at the moment, songs slated to appear include """"Your Touch"""", """"The
Flame"""", and """"It's Just Got to Be"""". 

Auerbach assured Billboard.com that the Fat Possum split was """"amicable."""" Yeah, yeah, they all say that, but this time we actually believe it, for quite a few reasons. First of all, Auerbach and his
bandmate, Patrick Carney, will leave the Mississipi imprint with a parting gift in the form of the Chulahoma: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough EP. A six-song tribute to the late bluesman (with an
answering machine message from Kimbrough's wife tacked on at the end), the disc hits stores May 2. It includes """"The Black Keys - My Mind Is Ramblin'"""", which
the Keys covered on last year's Fat Possum Kimbrough tribute album, Sunday Nights.

Tracklist:

01 Keep Your Hands Off Her
02 Have Mercy on Me
03 Work Me
04 Meet Me in the City
05 Nobody But You
06 My Mind Is Ramblin'

Also, Fat Possum will continue to distribute Carney's Audio Eagle label, which has so far put out the Gil Mantera's Party Dream album
Bloodsongs. Future releases include stuff by two Carney side projects, 10% Animals and Marble Arches. The latter also features guitarist Jamie Stillman (ex-party of helicopters), who co-runs Audio Eagle.

That's kind of the rock and roll equivalent of seeing the kid every other weekend, right?

The Black Keys are currently in the midst of an Australian tour, which has them playing some weird festivals with people like Femi Kuti and
Buddy Guy. In May, they'll head to England to rock The Shins-curated date of All Tomorrow's Parties.""",0
"No Anome, what matters is the correct matching up of the maths to physical reality, and the polar coordinate system is the one that is tailor made to deal with concepts such as centrifugal force and Coriolis force.

The centrifugal force is a radial effect and the Coriolis force is a tangential effect.

But before we can use the expressions in polar coordinates we must construct a physical model of a real situation and then construct a differential equation around it, usually in the scalar variable of radial distance. 

If you were in the slightest genuine about this topic, you would have read the section which I added to the main article yesterday. You would have blocked PeR for vandalism and wikistalking for having erased it on specious grounds.

It hardly needed sourced since it is standard planetary orbital theory which obviously none of you know anything about. In fact I did mention Goldstein's Classical Mechanics.

The picture that I am getting here is that the article has been hi-jacked by a group who have had a basic introduction to circular motion but who would be incapable of handling elliptical or hyperbolic motion and so they will all make sure that no such generalizations appear in the main article.

Your group has indulged in a number of deceitful tactics which I will now list.

(1) Making arguments in polar coordinates but jumping into Cartesian coordinates to conceal the flaws. The main example is circular motion, which is all that you seem to be capable of considering. You accept one moment that there is a radially outward centrifugal force balancing a radially inward centripetal force. But as soon as the centrifugal force becomes inconvenient for you, you claim that it vanishes in the inertial frame, even though the centripetal force remains. That is just a nonsense.

(2) Trying to drag in the three body problem while totally sweeping the two body problem under the carpet. This is because you feel more comfortable in a field that nobody can understand. It is good cover for talking nonsense.

(3) Introducing Lagrangian mechanics.

(4) Introducing Hamiltonian mechanics.

(5) Introducing matrix algebra.

(6) Quoting Feynam.

We have seen all these tactics used in a pathetic attempt to deny the fact that centrifugal force only occurs when a particle actually possesses an angular velocity relative to a point.

The section which I put in yesterday contained partically all hat you need to know about centrifugal force. But that was too good for you. You much prefer that big mindless waffle of an introduction that tells us absolutely nothing about centrifugal force.",0

How did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? 

Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant """"to knock, as on a door"""" up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like """"you're"""" and """"your"""", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier """"gay"""", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex """"gay anal sex"""", but that's really irrelevent. 

I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, """"splash"""", from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person's face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it.

"Foroyaa: Do you have any other involvement apart from politics and trade unionism?
Alh. Cham Joof: Yes, I was the founder and Secretary General of the First Gambian Youth Movement called the Central Council of Youth in the Gambia, in 1957 and I helped to build the Central Council headquarters at Allen Street.
We used to organise annual youth week and sporting events. All kinds of sports were staged including cycling in which Alhagie O.B Conateh (Fisco) used to participate. 
In the field of scouting also, I have been named the doyen of Scouting in the Gambia. Scouting, which is a supplementary to education, was dear in my heart and I served the movement from 1938 up to date. I was the first Gambian Scout to be awarded the coveted badge known as the Wood Badge by the Chief Scout of the World at a successful training course held at the International Training Centre at Gillwell Park in Sussex, England, in 1953. I was also appointed by the Gambia Scouts Council to represent the youths at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth in June 1953.
I also had the opportunity to be selected as the Leader of the Gambia Contingent at the World Scout Jamboree held at Sutton Cold Field in Birmingham in 1957.
As a scout I grew up from Wolf cum Scout, Scout Master, Commissioner in Charge of Training and retired as the President of the Gambia National Scout Council in 2005.
I attended the First Pan-African Youth Movement Conference in Tunisia in 1960 and the second in 1961. I was able to meet Julius Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda and I had the privilege of travelling with Kaunda in the same plane and we had fruitful discussions about politics. I also helped in the creation of a Unit called the Hansard Unit at the National Assembly in 2002 and I was appointed as a member of the International Committee of Dispute Resolution in 2002.
I was also appointed as a member of the Dispute Tribunal Unit of the Magistrates Court in Banjul in 2003 and I retired in 2007.
I am the current chairman of ECO (Education through Culture Organisation) which is an International NGO.
I do part time lecture at the University of the Gambia on History and the students do come to my house for lectures.
I also wrote books on various subjects in the Gambia.

While any edit warring may lead to sanctions, there is a bright-line rule called the three-revert rule (3RR), the violation of which often leads to a BLOCK.The three-revert rule states:An editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page—whether involving the same or different material—within a 24-hour period. An edit or a series of consecutive edits that undoes other editors' actions—whether in whole or in part—counts as a revert. Violations of the rule normally attract BLOCKS of at least 24 hours. Any appearance of gaming the system by reverting a fourth time just outside the 24-hour slot is likely to be treated as an edit-warring violation. See below for exemptions.A """"page"""" means any page on Wikipedia, including talk and project space. A """"revert"""" means any edit (or administrative action) that reverses the actions of other editors, in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material. A series of consecutive saved revert edits by one user with no intervening edits by another user counts as one revert.The three-revert rule applies per person, not per account; reverts made by multiple accounts operated by one editor count together. Editors violating 3RR will usually be BLOCKED for 24 hours for a first incident. Even without a 3RR violation, an administrator may still act if they believe a user's behavior constitutes edit warring, and any user may report edit warring with or without 3RR being breached. The rule is not an entitlement to revert a page a specific number of times.
If an editor violates 3RR by mistake, they should reverse their own most recent reversion. Administrators may take this into account and decide not to BLOCK in such cases—for example if the user is not a habitual edit warrior and is genuinely trying to rectify their own mistake.""""  """,0

Because of Fuji San's height above sea level and the reflectivity of snow you do not have to be due east of the mountain to observe a spectacular sun rise. Further confusing the issue, the """"Kanagawa"""" in the title of the print does not refer to Kanagawa Prefecture. Kanagawa Prefecture was established in 1876. Prior to that time, the easternmost part of what is now Kanagawa Prefecture was known as the Province of  Musashi. The westernmost part was known as the province of Sagami.

 Is Brian really an atheist? 

In the recently aired episode, """"April in Quahog"""", Brian can be clearly observed praying some time after the news report leads the public to believe that a black hole is going to swallow the earth. Also, at the end of the episode, Brian leaves the house saying he made a deal with someone that now that the earth is spared he would go volunteer at the soup kitchen. Based on the context of the situation and Stewie's remark in the background that the 'someone' Brian made a deal with was God, this calls Brian's atheism into question and suggests that he has developed some closeted religious beliefs (though other evidence from previous episodes might lead one to suspect that they have been there all along). There are only two other explanations for this series of events that I can think of: One would be that one of the underlying ideas behind the episode is something to the tune of 'there are no atheists in foxholes', though this is unlikely because Brian can be seen following through with his promise which a person who had temporarily reverted to religion because of fear wouldn't do, let alone that any kind of conservative message is very unlike McFarlane. The other would be that McFarlane is somehow poking fun at peoples' work righteous attitude towards religion, however this is also unlikely because in order to understand the joke, an in depth understanding of what Christianity actually teaches would be required which most people (including McFarlane) likely do not posses.

Actually, that policy you cite basically just tells you to not revert banned editors if reverting would restore inappropriate content. If you do so, it's your responsibility. But the section above that talks about how helpful edits do not need to be reverted. Our one goal here is to build an encyclopedia. Reverting positive contributions to the encyclopedia just because a user is banned (or for any procedural reason, for that matter) is counterintuitive. So the general rule in these situations is to use common sense. If the banned user's edit is not helpful, revert. If it's obviously helpful, don't revert (or don't think you need to). If you're not really sure whether it's helpful, you should probably err on the side of caution and revert. But at the end of the day, blindly reverting any addition made by a banned user really doesn't help anyone, and whether to revert or not is left to your own discretion. In this case, there's clearly a disagreement, so I would recommend you explain exactly why you think their edits should remain, and discuss the issue with Hobartimus.

experience. You can do this by making at least 10 credible edits on Wikipedia and remaining on Wikipedia for four (4) days. Check out this page for tips.    talk 

Adding media to  articles
Media files, be it images, drawings or sound files are an integral part of Wikipedia's articles. They apart from enriching articles, make them more credible too. You can add media files to both your new articles as well as once you are editing. To do so you can search for it on wikipedia:commons or you can either upload the image if you have it using this file uploader or [commons uploader]. Please be informed that you must provide accurate information about the file being uploaded since they are reviewed and if if is found that the license given to the file is false, it will promptly be deleted.     talk 

Spotting bad edits and vandalism
As you age on Wikipedia, one thing you will come across and probably address will the issue of bad edits or vandalism. There are several ways of 
spotting them:
by reviewing articles on your watchlist regularly and looking for bad edits
verifying new changes to pages and articles
If you happen to come across a bad edit you may:
ask an editor you trust to review the work for his/her inputs
you can rollback the change if you have credible information that the edit is indeed bad
request that the necessary change be made on the article's talk page.
Whatever you do, please be very careful about the changes you make, for a rule of thumb, discuss issues you are not sure of first before making changes.    talk """,0

Lock this page up. Been too much vandalism on it. some ppl thought it would be so funny to write she's lesbian... I think this is because of Ubisofts raffle to give the winners some kind of a date with her.. not serious I think btw but as said some stupid guys thought their edit would make people sa they're great...sry my English is not very good but I think I could have a good point at this. 89.247.201.104 

Do we lock up pages on Nazism because of would-be contributors' abuses of Godwin's Law? No  because Wikipedia utilizes editorial scrutiny when an article is tainted with undocumented allegations and inappropriate personal sentiment. If Wikipedia can streamline articles on Hillary Clinton and Rush Limbaugh despite public animosity, they can do it for an article on Jade Raymond. As long as the public record is noted with specific references, the strengths of the article should outweigh its disadvantages.

Apart from Raymond's unquestionable level within her profession, as evidenced by her non-PR work with Sony, et al., one of the main reasons to allow the entry is to chronicle the extraordinary and documented pitch of sexual harassment that was directed against her on the internet and within the gaming community once she became a spokesperson for Ubisoft. Hers has been a unique situation, and sexual harassment is an important issue because of her status as a pioneering woman in the gaming field.

No need to """"put the brakes"""" on an article in which the achievements of the subject warrant a sober entry, and even the worst aspects of the controversy have lasting cultural resonance. Notorious cases of defamation of character and verbal lynching are of particular relevance at this stage in the internet's development, as recent cases bear out (such as the case against Lori Drew after Megan Meier's suicide).

How does the language of the Franks, which is known more or less from place names and personal names only plus a few borrowed words, tell us anything about their ethnicity? We knew they were Germanic before that. Are you implying that there is a connection between Dutch and Frankish """"ethnicity""""? That connection, though it is probably there, is not very direct over a thousand five hundred years...
I don't know why the fact that a Frankish-derived language (Dutch) being spoken in a certain region (the Netherlands) should force us to believe that the Franks were originally from there. Of course the two facts are related, but the fact of the language being spoken there does not itself tell us that at one point in time its inhabitants were primarily Franks any more than the fact that a Latin-derived language is spoken in Belgium tells us that at one point in time its inhabitants were primarily Romans. Again, I understand the connection, but it is not made on linguistic analysis alone. This is why most books/articles on the Franks that I've read (Wallace-Hadrill, Bachrach) don't mention Dutch. Your comment about Franci seniores (what does the Franci superiores have to do with anything?) does nothing to explain to me the importance of their language. Their well-attested written language was Latin. Why not mention that? In fact, it tells us far more about the Franks than that they spoke a proto-Dutch language. 
As to the remarks concerning the pertinence of my comments only for the Merovingian period, I was not aware that the article was about the development of a language and not about the Franks, a term which does not have a consistent universal ethnic/tribal meaning by the end of the 9th century (and probably by the end of the 8th). 
In short, I don't see how you have actually answered the objection. I don't know what """"German"""" point of view you think I have, but I find that ridiculous. And shouldn't a minority of scholarship moreso undermine your """"Dutch"""" point of view? Finally, when did I declare myself a Carolingian specialist? I have no specialty.  """,0

"""
My experiences came up on the talk page but once I understood Wikipedia I didn't post anything on the article related to my personal experiences. That was like the 2nd day almost two months ago.

All of my references are verifiable.There's nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation.  I didn't put my experiences in the Judge Edward Nottingham article either although he was my judge.

I went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue. For instance, I wrote to the ABA and asked for their input, and in fact, asked them to work on the article. I also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses, citing references from a lawyers point of view.  Those references were deleted by someone, I can't remember who and don't know why. At this point, the only reference that I posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and I know for sure that is a valid transcript.  The guy who runs the blog is a 3rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers.   Even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration I had references for. I read in the Wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts.

I don't believe that I did any original research. All I did is search the Internet for references for the article.  I really didn't know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before I started working on this article. I had already been thinking about forms based filing but I started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ECF, which date back to 2004.  Also, when I was younger I worked as a systems analyst.

I did get the info on the Laws and Liberties of MA years ago, but Wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway.  Same as the U.N. covenantcan't really hide that.   I didn't add a and b together to prove a point, at least not consciously. Like today, I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the 5th Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone, which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand, who was in the fifth circuit. And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words """"pro se"""" in the 40s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se (No, there was not).  What I found in the 40s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but Judge Learned Hand seemed pro se friendly.

I believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is """"soap boxing"""". I do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business. I've been an entrepreneur. 

I didn't know about the Federal Judicial Center until I started working on this article. That book on appellate procedure I found looking for references for this article. The manual on complex litigation I found looking for references for this article.

Arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself.  One thing I started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation. I ordered the book Slave Nation at the library but I haven't got it yet. But now when I look at pro se law in the different states I think free state, slave state, border state. Also, there were issues related to Indians in some of the western states. The labor union movement had a lot to do with it too, I think. So did the history of workmen's comp, which is of course related to unions.  """,0

Hi I just wanted to comment on the organization of this stub. I think it would be easier to read if you separated some of the bigger paragraphs into smaller paragraphs. Also, none of the information under """"Applications"""" is cited. If this section wasn't written by you and you haven't found any evidence to support these statements, then it might be necessary to rewrite this section. Under references, """"Reference List"""" is misspelled. Also, it would probably be best to integrate all sources under one reference section. If you could incorporate more images to this topic, that would also be helpful to see a visual representation relating the hologram to the holonomic brain theory. The analogies in """"The Hologram and Holonomy"""" under Theory Overview was very helpful to understand the concept.

I smell trouble brewing.  Let's figure this out before an edit war starts.  I see a few issues here in dispute: 
1) Cold-blooded=stockier draft type vs. cold-blooded=origin in cold climates.  I had learned it as the draft-type definition, but I have seen both definitions in use.  I don't necessarily think they are mutually exclusive.  While I think that the geographical terminology likely defined the core original breeds, with years of interbreeding this becomes messy.  So many breeds have differing degrees of both types.  For example, Warmbloods are not the only mixtures of European and Arabian blood.  Wouldn't this strict definition mean that Quarter Horses would be a type of warmblood? My feeling is that we can say something like: """"The hot-blooded/cold-blooded terminology originally related to the geographical origin of the breed, but now has come to refer to the overall character of the horse or pony.""""

2) Ponies (most if not all) are cold-blooded because they originated in cold climates vs. some ponies are cold-blooded because they are draft-type.  Again, I think we can finesse this without saying that one is right or wrong.  I personally think that most ponies are draft-type, and so could be considered cold-blooded, with certain hot-blooded exceptions like the [Hackney pony].  Although, really, come to think of it, lots of ponies are more like little warmbloods...

3) Ponies were not used for 'draft' work in general because they were too small.  As I understand it, some pony breeds flourished at times because they were useful as draft horses in the mines.  For example: """"when the coal mining industry became extensively developed in Britain in the 1800’s, Shetlands were imported in great numbers to haul coal cars in the 'pits'."""" (From """"Shetland Pony"""")

The above paragraph illustrates that the axis to this entire debate is your misunderstanding of WP:SELF. More specifically: your mistaken definition of """"reference"""". WP:SELF seeks to avoid encyclopediac references. This means that all the facts of all articles come from the source and never from another article. The reason for this is clear.
You, however, choose to define """"reference"""" very liberally, and take it to mean that Wikipedia should never include anything about Wikipedia, which of course is silly. 
Somehow you've come to believe you are the last word on what is and is not relevant, despite press coverage and vast consensus to the contrary. McCarthyism is alive and well on Wikipedia. What's funny is these little witch hunts for irrelevance are so restricted in scope, and totally arbitrary in their focus. Do us a favor and go take your fervor over to Christina Aguilera.

 MLK incident 

It's true that Greenberg said what he said. It's true that a Chicago Sun Times blog reported what he said. Those two facts, in and of themselves, do not make the MLK incident """"relevant"""" to his ESPN career. The fact that there was no meaningful followup coverage in reliable sources should establish that.

"Hello friend 

Hello.  I am also someone concerned about the Zionists systematic holocaust of the Palestinian people.

As the people who control Wikipedia have systematically banned and blocked people like me and you every time we open our mouths, I am limited in what I can say here to you without being blocked.  I will suggest two things however.

1) Check out the web site Wikipedia Review
2) Check out alternative wikis such as Red Wiki or Anarchopedia.  Spend some time writing and improving articles on them during them time when you are (or when you are not) blocked here.

Wikipedia was created by Larry Sanger, and has a lot of good ideas in its inception - a wiki encyclopedia under GPL license, the GFDL license etc.  Of course Larry Sanger is no longer with Wikipedia, and to avoid being banned I will avoid talking about what happened after that.  Suffice to say it is extremely ideological and people like you who don't support the Zionist bloodbath are persecuted.  It is also highly one-sided for other topics as well.  Too much so, it is inevitable that competitors to Wikipedia spring up, and I am sure they will be more successful.  By contributing to these other wiki encyclopedias, you hasten the end of the complete control over these matters that the Wikipedia cabal exercises now.",0
"""taHindenburg, influenced by the Camarilla, became increasingly estranged from Brüning and pushed his Chancellor to move the government in a decidedly authoritarian and right-wing direction. This culminated, in May 1932, with the resignation of the Brüning cabinet.

Hindenburg appointed the nobleman Franz von Papen as Chancellor, heading a """"Cabinet of Barons"""". Papen was bent on authoritarian rule and, since in the Reichstag only the conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) supported his administration, he immediately called for new elections in July. In these elections, the Nazis achieved their biggest success yet and won 230 seats, becoming the largest party in the Reichstag.

Knowing that it was not possible to form a stable government without Nazi support, Papen tried to persuade Hitler to become Vice-Chancellor and enter a new government with a parliamentary basis. Hitler, however, would settle for nothing less than the chancellorship. He put further pressure on Papen by entertaining parallel negotiations with the Centre Party, Papen's former party, which was bent on bringing down the renegade Papen. In both negotiations, Hitler demanded that he, as leader of the strongest party, must be Chancellor, but Hindenburg consistently refused to appoint the """"Bohemian lance corporal"""" to the chancellorship.

After a vote of no-confidence in the Papen government, supported by 84% of the deputies, the new Reichstag was dissolved, and new elections were called in November. This time, the Nazis lost some seats but still remained the largest party in the Reichstag.

After Papen failed to secure a majority, he proposed to dissolve the parliament again along with an indefinite postponement of elections. Hindenburg at first accepted this, but after General Kurt von Schleicher and the military withdrew their support

My concern is that an entire article on Billy the Kid was removed for no valid reason. That article not only contained my contributions, but the contributions of others. It contained the most detailed bibliography on Billy the Kid offered yet on Wikepedia. It also included 147 detailed citations. There is no valid excuse for removing that article and substituting the mess that is there now. Blocking me for real or imagined infractions is one thing. Destroying the article that I, and others, had worked long and hard on - and replacing it with an absolute piece of junk - is quite another. You have done extensive work on Wikipedia's Wyatt Earp article. How would you feel if all of your efforts were deleted? What was done to my last version of the Billy Kid article is nothing less than criminal - and that crime is against Wikipedia and all of those unselfish people who have tried to make it a reliable source. The joke is, I considered myself finished with the Billy the Kid article when it was suddenly removed. Now if you, and the others at Wikipedia """"sincerely value your expertise. Wikipedia needs knowledgeable authors like you,"""" as you say. You will restore my last version of the article. Here is my good faith offer: If Wikipedia will restore that article at the point where I last left it, I promise that I will not go near it again. I look forward to the work that your expert editors can do to correct the """"encyclopedic tone,"""" and encourage that effort. I also look forward to submissions and improvements to this article by other Wikipedians. Please note that I have claimed to """"own"""" the Billy the Kid article. All I was trying to do was to provide the most accurate template on the subject of Billy the Kid that others could work from. The quickest way to do this is restore the article as it was when it was moved. I have no intention of trying to get it back to that point, by correcting the absolute mess that is up there right now. I trust you and all the forthright editors at Wikipedia to correct the """"encyclopedic tone"""" that you consider lacking. I would also appreciate the removal of those tags that have suddenly appeared at the top of articles I contributed to on Bat Masterson and Luke Short. They suddenly appeared on the Masterson and Short articles at the exact same time my last version of Billy the Kid. It is not that I should be treated differently because of my credentials in the Wild West History field ... the fact is that no one should have to be treated that way. This is childish behavior from those who don't have the best interest of Wikipedia involved. I won't bother asking to be unblocked ( which, of course, I should be ) since I have to leave the clowns that put that block in place something they can brag about ... as in the vein of """"Well, I guess we showed him!"""" Now the time has come to show everyone else what Wikipedia really stands for. The place to start is with your good faith restoration of my Billy the Kid article exactly as it was when I last worked on it. Unless I am specifically asked for clarification, on some historical point on the Kid,by you, and others involved with Wikipedia, I have absolutely no intention of doing anything further on the subject of Billy the Kid.

 Obviously biased 

This article is extremely biased. Furthermore, the individuals in this video are clearly insurgents and this whole claim of """"war crimes"""" is just people trying to stir up international anger at the US military. At 1:20 you can clearly, obviously see a man with a RPG7 leaning out from around the corner of a building observing the Apache (or possibly responding to the noise of its rotors). At 2:01 before the AH-64 begins to fire you can clearly see one individual with an AKM on his shoulder and another holding to me what looks like a RPG warhead. Another is holding what some think is a camera, but it looks much more like a black case for carrying grenades or mortar rounds to me. When they zoom in at 4:03 after engaging the targets you can clearly see a Kalashnikov lying on the ground next to one of the bodies. Then a van shows up and starts loading the bodies up. Seriously, how much more clear could this be people? Why would news reporters move a van to a location they had just been SHOT AT and start loading up the bodies of insurgents they've never met before as well as two """"reporters""""?

 More content and sources to be added 

The suggestion made above that this article could be deleted or merged as not notable represents a truly extraordinary """"reach"""". As was noted previously, the specific phrase that gives this article its title is used and discussed in literature from sources as diverse as the Air Force Research Institute and Israel's own Goldstone Mission report, which employes it extensively. Already mentioned in the article, is the (also extensive) discussion of the term in a report by the internationally recognized human rights organization, the Public Committee Against Torture in IsraelNo Second Thoughts: The Changes in the Israeli Defense Forces Combat Doctrine in Light of Operation Cast Lead, a report by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel; executive summary, with full report discussing Dahiya doctrine also downloadable at no cost.

Not yet mentioned are papers from the Brookings Institution, one of the most prominent thinktanks in the world, where a new-this-month analysis also discusses the doctrine in considerable depth.The Next War: How Another Conflict Between Hizballah and Israel Could Look and How Both Sides Are Preparing For It, an August 2011 analysis paper by the Brookings Institution; executive summary, with full report discussing Dahiya doctrine also downloadable at no cost.. Nor are any of the multiple scholarly articles that use and discuss the phrase and the policy it identifies mentioned in the article; see footnote.Search Google Scholar for """"Dahiya doctrine"""" (some sifting and use of spelling variants required); one example that discusses the concept under this name at some length is Legislative Attack, by Eyal Weizman, published in 2010 by the highly-ranked journal Theory, Culture & Society. A full-text copy can currently be downloaded from here, at a site that appears to correspond to a university course offering by its author.

Dershowitz even uses and discusses the phrase, as do Noam ChomskyNoam Chomsky interview in """"City"""" magazine, Tel Aviv edition, available on Chomsky's website or in its original context, here, at the magazine's site. and Norman Finkelstein, although Finkelstein calls it the """"Dahiya strategy"""" in his book, This Time We Went Too Far, not mentioned previously here.This Time We Went Too Far, a book by Norman Finkelstein..

Besides the JPost, Haaretz, and Y-net links already mentioned, Al Jazeerah uses the phrase.Al Jazeerah op-ed by Stephen Lendman, 31 May 2010. The New York Times also uses it, and discusses its implications.Tough Military Stance Stirs Little Debate in Israel, by Isabel Kershner, 24 December 2009, The New York Times.

You're surely referring to my """"depopulation"""" of Category:Southern artists: I mean, for every artist who was marked with this category, I removed the category.

The reason was simple. For every state of the US, I think, there exists """"Category: [state] artists""""; and certainly for every one of the artists whose articles I fiddled with, there was one or more of Category:Louisiana artists or whatever. For convenience's sake, let's stick with female artists from Louisiana. If somebody is so notably a Louisiana artist as to deserve to be so categorized, she's also automatically a Southern artist.

In this situation, my side was discussing things on the talk page, and the other side wasn't.  They repeatedly refused to answer my question about which part of my argument was wrong.  Because they couldn't answer the question, because they knew damn well that I wasn't wrong, but they were too petty to admit it.  I was following Wikipedia dispute resolution policy, and they're the ones who weren't.  And if the other side wasn't discussing their position, then my side was justified in changing the article to our version.  Especially if I only did it once.

 WIKIPEDIA IS ! 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it had be",0

The Cosmology part is not by me. I only corrected some really impossibly wrong aspects that someone inserted on a spree of misguided grandiosity. I really have only fixed false stuff, never really written anything but those pieces in the articles we did together. At one point recently (the other day) I nearly eliminated all the Cosmology section and referenced the God Speaks article instead. Then I thought that was too bold, even though that's what my heart says to do. I didn't want to do something that radical without others. But my feeling is that the God Speaks article is much better than the Cosmology section in the Meher Baba article, and that it should only appear in the God Speaks section. So my feeling is still to toss out much of the stuff on the Baba article and if there is anything good or that we missed move it to the God Speaks article. Also, if there is quarelling over these issues in the future, it won't reflect as badly on the main Meher Baba article as it will be a side article. So that's my vote. Sorry I haven't contributed much yet. I find myself pretty shy when it comes to writing. I mostly just try to keep out stuff that is utterly silly.  21:32",0
"""::The CTMU is not passing itself off as an """"academic"""" theory. It can't, because Langan is not a member of academia. But then again, a theory need not be academic to be notable. For example, print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. Nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness, scholarly integrity, or intellectual merit, except possibly in the well-indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves (and of course, their aspiring apprentices, whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions).

Byrgenwulf complains that """"we chaps"""" are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. This is correct. To his credit, he invites others to tag his assertions. However, this is a bit specious, for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant, verifiable assertions to make, he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. Thus, we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of Langan's assertions receive a separate citation, when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. 

It is important for Byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. Not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article, but given that the article already links to ample source material, anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false, irrelevant, or non-neutral. Unfortunately, he hasn't yet been able to lock onto this signal. He still labors under the assumption that like some sort of Ultimate Bureaucrat, he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself.  

By now, everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization: neither Byrgenwulf, nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates, HAS any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. They are merely using the article, which is faithful to the material it cites, to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic, the CTMU, which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. They do not like what the CTMU says; the article on the CTMU reports on what the CTMU says, and what Langan and the press say about the CTMU; hence, they do not like the article on the CTMU. 

This conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in Byrgenwulf's transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article, attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. Meanwhile, he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of Wikipedia verifiability policy, and that his all-too-evident editorial bias is in massive violation of NPOV as well. Oozing contempt, Byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the CTMU article with a load of summary demands, snide remarks, and self-righteous, factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand! Nothing he says is verifiable; as we have now repeatedly seen, he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to take his demands seriously.

 How they do it. Revealing how vandals prevent accurate information on Poppers, that they disagree with, from being posted here! 

I just figured out what's going on  what these guys are doing to those of us who want to edit the poppers page by adding more accurate and meaningful information, but which they do not agree with. If you can find the time, I urge you to go into the """"history"""" of the poppers section or page (click on the """"history"""" tab at the top of the page), and then go to the bottom of that page. There you can click on the largest number, and essentially see ALL the history of this page  from the day it was created!

I just spent time looking at it, and a clear pattern emerges. To be kind, there are some pranksters among us. More realistically, and at worse, they are vandals. Some of them appear to be working in concert with each other to make arbritary changes to the edits of people they don't agree with. They literally  and very quickly  'revert' the versions back and forth among their own versions, all the while essentially vandalizing the credible information that more knowledgeable people have posted. Then, when the unsuspecting editors realize something's going on, that their edits are being deleted almost within minutes of their having posted them, and when they try to figure out how best to react and deal with the problem, as they begin the inevitable complaining and asking of questions, they are harrassed and threaten with having their accounts 'blocked'; or they're falsely accused of violating various rules of Wikipedia, upon which they are often then threatened with even more sanctions against them.

It is precisely this kind of unethical, irresponsible and despicable behavior that was exposed in the world wide media earlier this week. Had I not seen the news reports which described exactly this kind of activity being rampant on Wikipedia, I would most likely have never figured out what was going on.

Other sources confirm the NE articles on the matter. Olle Engstrand (a professor of phonetics at Stockholm University), """"Fonetikens grunder"""" (""""The basics of phonetics""""), 2004, page 120 (my translation):

All languages have more or less significant regional variations in pronunciation. In Swedish there are differences in the spoken varieties of the standard language (""""Scanian"""", """"Gutnish"""" or """"Dalecarlian"""") as well as variations specific to certain cities [""""stadsmål""""] like """"Stockholmska"""" or """"Göteborska"""". By """"dialect"""" Swedish dialectologists are refering to those local dialects [""""bygdemål"""", """"landsmål""""] that have a straight lineage that can be traced back to Old Norse, a history shared with all other Scandinavian dialects - these form a continuum while the distinct """"national languages"""" like Swedish, Danish and Norweigan are relativly recent constructions.

This is confirmed by Claes-Christian Elert (professor of phonetics at Umeå University 1969-1988) in """"Allmän och svensk fonetik"""" (""""General and Swedish phonetics"""") on pages 34-35. Here are some selected passages (again my translation):

For a long time there has existed speech varieties within the Swedish language area which are used only in certain communities and which have only been slightly influenced by the spoken varieties of central Sweden or by the written language. These are the genuine dialects [the bold font is in the book].

[...]

The variety of language that a visitor to a community encounters most of the time is not the genuine dialect but a reginal speech variety [again Elert's bolding]. Sometimes the standard language is spoken with regional influences. Contrary to the genuine dialects, the regional varieties are almost identical to the central standard language [""""det centrala riksspråket""""] in terms of inflection and syntax. Vocabulary is usually also more or less identical, though some local deviations do exist. It is above all the pronunciation of vowels and consonants as well as prosody of the regional variations that deviate from the standard language. Generally these are similar to the genuine dialects within the same region. The regional standard varieties do not differ as much from one community to another as the genuine dialects.

If you interpret these quotes very generously (that is, not according to what the writers intended), you might be able to support SIL's claims, though not the figures. The claims that Scanian as a regional variety is a seperate language is supported only by Lång and a handful of Scanian regionalists who use completely bogus arguments  and often claim the name should be skåneländska (roughly """"Terra Scanian""""). That it would be a dialect of only Danish is also extremely speculative, and it should at the very least be classified as simply """"East Scandinavian"""". For all practical purposes it is most likely a lot more easily understood by Swedes than Danes.

Current state of this article
This article still needs more work in my view; it is still too dependent on rumors and tabloid journalism sources.  Its sources are in many cases tabloid newspapers that rely on anonymous sources in their reporting and that convey unsupported rumors.

Frequently, when one tries to update this article with reliable third-party published sources, the updated information is being deleted with what appear to me to be explanations that are not supported by Wikipedia's own policies and guidelines for editing.  The current infobox template is an example; one cannot just make up one's own rules and regulations; the descriptions in the template box for the parameters are explicit.  There is no requirement for """"legal"""" meaning of """"Domestic partnership"""" (""""domestic partner(s)"""") in the parameter of that infobox: Template:Infobox actor; it makes clear that the parameter refers to """"romantic relationships"""" in a more general sense.  The same editor keeps removing the information about Michelle Williams and Heath Ledger being """"domestic partners"""" (in the meaning def",0

 Unprotected 
I'm going to edit based on my comments in Talk:New_anti-Semitism#Sourcing_claims_for_.22Country-specific_incidents so could we discuss them now?  

All the incidents mentioned are regarded as examples of the new anti-Semitism i.e. coming from the left, related to radical anti-Zionism etc.  (talk) 

They may well be, but they are not sourced that way.  

I don't think we can expect the words """"new anti-Semitism"""" to appear in every single report we reference. We've defined it, and we've linked to many sources who are defining it. The definition is:

It is a form of Judenhass that emanates from the left. It is characterized by the demonization of the world's only Jewish state and of Jews as an ethnicity and a religion. Israel's right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied. The Jewish people's right of self-determination is denied. Double standards are applied, whereby the actions of the Jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her. Jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the Jewish state. Symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism are used: for example, blood libels are resurrected, the Jewish state and Jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving Jews or Zionists or Israelis plotting to take over the world, or being in control of other governments, or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others. Arab and Islamic anti-Semitism are excused and ignored. Straw-man attacks are made, whereby Jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitism, and that is then used to condemn Jewish groups as unreasonable, and to deny that there is any such thing as the """"new anti-Semitism."""" All of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against Jews and their synagogues and schools, particularly in Europe. It is found in conjunction with anti-Americanism (because Jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the American government), anti-Zionism, and the anti-globalization movement.

All the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components, so when we find them, we can offer them as examples, so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti-Semitism or attacks on Jews.  (talk) 

My worry is that Livingstone has not been (at least in the sources provided) accused of anti-semitism, and that most of the discussion of Galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti-semitism against his supporters.  Add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti-semitism (not reporting others allegations), which is OR (and unwise in the case of Galloway).  The NUS thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti-semitism so I'd just want to tidy that up.  

Livingstone has very definitely been accused of anti-Semitism (got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it), as has Galloway, and without question his supporters. The section talks about it in relation to that election. By all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit, and we can talk later if there are any disagreements.  (talk) 

Slim, whose definition is this?   

All the sources put together. The above are the issues they agree on. It was posted weeks ago.  (talk) 

I think you mean """"all the sources from one side of the argument put together"""".  It's been a while since we discussed this, so could you remind me as to which sources you consider authoritative?   
Sorry, you'll have to look in the archives; they're either there or in the article. By """"all the sources,"""" I mean all the sources who study new anti-Semitism. The above are the elements they appear to agree on.  (talk)

""" anybody feels that is nugget of information should be added to the Limerick article, they can add it in two seconds. Merge notices are for situations when two long and complex articles need to be merged. Here it is a quick decision. Go for it. 
Dictionary it, or delete it?  
Merge notices are for where an editor has suggested a merge, no more and no less.  Moreover, you appear to have a broken sense of direction.  The notice is a {{mergefrom}} not a {{mergeto}}.  Both articles discuss the city of Limerick.  We don't have duplicate articles about the same thing here.  However, the reason that I suggested the merge, rather than outright did it, is that clearly the claim that Limerick is known as """"Stab City"""" for the reasons stated needs to be checked.  The article, like so many such articles, doesn't cite any sources.  With the notice, other editors will come to the discussion, and perhaps they may attempt to verify the article to be merged and say """"That's a load of old baloney!  Limerick isn't known as Stab City at all."""" and instead decide that rather than a merger, an outright deletion of Stab City for being unverifiable is called for.  Or, on the other hand, they may come up with some sources to cite.  Either way achieves a better result than just doing the merger.  
The merge notice is not intended to draw attention to stubs needing work. You could have posted a note on this talk page. Limerick is known as 'Stab City' (or used to be a few years ago anyway) but it is derogatory. There are seperate articles for city nicknames - see Big Apple. Googling '""""Stab City"""" -Limerick' turns up 1000 sites, including a US band. So Stab City could be perhaps a disambig.  
It wasn't a stub needing work.  It was, and is, a duplicate article, plain and simple.  Both articles are about the city.  I've pointed this out several times, now.  I've also pointed out that the parallel with Big Apple is a clearly false one.  
You haven't explained why it is 'clearly' false. The Big Apple is a nickname for New York and contains the history of the usage of that name. """"Stab City"""" is a nickname infrequently used to refer to Limerick in a derogatory way. The """"Stab City"""" article has almost no content, but could be expanded to be a history of the usage of the name. I don't have the time or interest to do this.  Another example is Big Easy which redirects to New Orleans, or City of Light which redirects to Paris. If City of Light was an article containing one sentence: """"City of Light usually refers to Paris."""" would you put a merge note on Paris too?  
If it were as superficially bogus as """"stab city"""" was: Yes, of course.  This process is known as """"asking for the opinions of other editors"""".  It is a useful tool in some circumstances.  Notice that it works.  Two editors have already given different opinions here, and a third is forming an opinion.   
It is possible to ask without adding a merge notice. As you seem to agree that the article is potentially bogus, and that we are now having a discussion about it, I have removed the merge notice.  
I've restored it.  The notice is there not just to get your attention alone, and I wrote """"as superficially bogus as 'stab city' was"""".  
Uncle G, How would you like to progress with this dispute?  
Uncle G has not replied for 5 days. I have added a one line of text to the article and have removed the merge notice.  
 The Stab City article is inaccurate in any case - the nickname dates back to well before the late 1990s and first arose after an incident in which an Argentinean tourist was stabbed.  I think this was in the mid 1980s.  I haven't edited the Stab City article as I'm undecided as to whether it's worth having.  
Merge it now - stab city is unfortunately associated with Limerick but it being regrettable is not an excuse to suppress it, but it certainly does not need a separate article.
 I agree, merge it now. I can't see a realistic prospect for Stab City to become a full article. I think there's a case for a Crime in Limerick article, but not for one on this piece",0

Thanks for sharing that.  Sorry if my tone earlier might have offended you.  One of the first things I note, however, is that you were incorrectly assuming that the John W. Brown is a U.S. National Historic Landmark (NHL).  It is not.  It is one of about 85,000 historic sites or objects and historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  There about 2,500 sites and objects and historic districts that are NHLs, including the California Liberty ship SS Jeremiah O'Brien.  Note, the ship is included in a Wikipedia NRHP list for its geographic area, but it is not included in the Wikipedia NHL list for Maryland.  It is understandable that you would not know the distinction.  But, looking for the John W. Brown in search screens for NHLs cannot lead to success.

You did do well to find that Maryland Historical Trust webpage.  I happen to know that is a summary by them of the full NRHP nomination document, from my having gone through detailed comparisons of other such webpages to actual NRHP documents which are available online for some Maryland sites (including the NHL ones), in consultation with editor Pubdog a while back.  Pubdog developed most of the articles about NRHP-listed places in Maryland (indexed here).  I asked Pubdog to comment here on this page, and perhaps that would have helped.

The NHL URL that you reached, http://www.cr.nps.gov/nhl/REGIONS.htm, seems pretty good to me.  It gives you phone numbers to call, and it gives you NHL_info@nps.gov as an email address to send any inquiries.  I confirm that you found a bad link from that page;  when I click on Questions/Answers there i too see that it links to http://www.nps.gov/nhl/QA which just gives an error message.  However you do already have all the phone and email contact info you need to ask about any National Historic Landmark.  I will email NHL_info@nps.gov to tell them that they have a bad link on that page, and I hope they will remove it to reduce anyone else's frustration.

I hope this helps.  I hope you do follow my advice in previous section to get the full NRHP document, since you do seem to genuinely care about developing this article on the SS John W. Brown, and since I believe that is a somewhat useful source for you to use.  Good luck. ncram """,0

Challenged content

The following material has been challenged by two separate IP editors, and restored by one editor (Altenmann). Having reviewed it, it does not appear to be in an encyclopedic style and requires a rewrite. As such, I've posted it here for discussion and reworking to avoid disruption. The text in dispute is as follows:

Pincus offers managerial advice on handling difficulties caused by both types: she defines the know-it-all as the """"Truly Smart Know-It-All"""", an employee with """"a intellectual handle on the job requirements that is spectacular"""", but who """"doesn't 'see' boundaries"""", and the omniscient deity as a person who """"thinks nothing of imposing or intruding"""". Lloyd makes no such distinction, although he notes that ironically, Know-It-Alls can sometimes know what they are talking about, and simply have such a brusque style of communication that people are unwilling to listen. He characterizes Know-It-Alls as superficially domineering and controlling, but insecure underneath. The outward focus on the inferiority of their fellows is intended to mask the inner sense of their own weaknesses in knowledge, skills, and competence.
 
Pincus recommends different strategies for each type. For the case of the Truly Smart Know-It-All she observes that a manager might have to bend the rules somewhat to accommodate the negative aspects of such an employee, which include impatience, an exaggerated sense of self-importance, and other peculiarities, in order to retain the positive benefits of the employee's knowledge and experience. Although she also cautions that managers have to weigh the benefits against the taxing effects, upon managers and staff, of employing an """"outlandish prima donna"""". She also recommends that rule-bending not extend to allowing the peculiarities of a true know-it-all with odd habits to be displayed to outsiders, such as customers and other visitors, and that such employees be clearly requested not to flout their eccentricities when such visitors call. She also states that managers should not be afraid of asking a genius employee questions, and should insist upon mutual respect and not adopt a self-deprecating attitude simply in order to placate such employees. Lloyd similarly advises managers to take a strong line against any form of intellectual bullying, either of others or indeed of the manager.
 
For the Know-It-All who doesn't, Pincus recommends to managers that they give praise where it is due, and that they assign such employees to work together with one, or two, other people, and regularly check for signs of stress. Notess observes that the last tactic mentioned can be unsuccessful if a Know-It-All is paired with a novice, since the Know-It-All quickly takes control away from the novice.
 
LLoyd observes that getting a point across to a Know-It-All can sometimes be difficult, and require much repetition, because such people are more interested in what they themselves are saying than in listening to others.

Please post suggestions for rewrites below; if we cannot find consensus, it might be worth seeking a third opinion or an RfC. '''chatspy """,0

I simply clean up edits - I am a bit more ruthless than most when it comes to Doctor Who, but that's because I want to have the articles to a particular standard, and most times I do give reasons for reversions and edits. If you have any issues with those reversions you are more than welcome to take your reasons to talk and let the other editors chime in on them. If you want me to clarify my edits, you are also more than welcome to ask me and I will do my best to explain them.  08:21, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)

Daleks hovering as kneeling
You don't need a license. What you need to do is back up your edits with evidence. If you can point to me a clear piece of on screen evidence that says that the Daleks are hovering around him in worship, please do. Take that to the Talk:Dalek page.  16:57, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)

You can't argue from contra-evidence because there could be any number of explanations. They could have been simply guarding him (higher ground is tactically better). They could have been invisibly recharging from him. The production team could have thought it simply looked cool. Point is, you don't know for sure, and it is fallacious to phrase it as definitive when that is the case. If you still want to discuss it, take it to Talk:Dalek, and we can see what the others think about it.  17:09, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)",0

 WorldNet TPS 

Hi,

It appears that you have deleted a page which I had created. The page was titled 'WorldNet TPS'. I feel it was unfairly deleted.

The purpose of the page is to provide Wikipedia users with some background/history regarding WorldNet TPS. WorldNet is the second largest payment service provider in Ireland and it is important that web users who choose not to use the WorldNet website (worldnettps.com) can access information regarding the company on the most popular encyclopaedia in the world.

I would like you to review your decision to delete the WorldNet TPS page.

Kind Regards,

Does any one moniter you Phil? First you add, then you delete, then you re-add the same information, then you delete each time citing a different reason.

Your latest removal of reference to Heart Beat Records as copyright owner stated the reason you removed it was because it was being contested in court. This was after you took it off and then came back and added it.

Regardless, the reason you cite for your actions THIS time is inaccurate. The copyright owner , Hearbeat Records, has sued another party for violating copyrights that they own. There are no suits against them or legal proceedings where someone has contested their ownership. Where do you get this from? Please cite your source as the only public information availabe is the law suit in which Heart Beat has sued another party for violating copyrights they own in as verified by the US Copyright office.

I simply do not understand how you come up with your reasoning to not cite Heart Beat as the official copyright holder of the CD's that are listed under the US Copyright Office?

It seems you have a history of creating your own facts Phil and I do not believe Wikipedia was created for that

"""Hello, I wrote Jack Lynch, Professor at Rutledge Univ. of 18th Century Literature. His talks includes works involving dictionaries. He responded (concerning definition of dictionary) with """"dictionary"""" has had a wide range of applications over the centuries.  Since 1631, the word """"dictionary"""" has been used with this meaning:

    By extension: A book of information or reference on any
    subject or branch of knowledge, the items of which are
    arranged in alphabetical order; an alphabetical encyclopædia as a Dictionary of Architecture, Biography, Geography, of the Bible, of Christian Antiquities, of Dates, etc.

There are all sorts of reference works we'd be likely to call
other things  encyclopedias, gazetteers, and so on  that have been called dictionaries by their makers.  In these cases,

    the essential sense ‘word-book’ is supplanted by the
    accidental one of ‘reference book in alphabetical order’
    arising out of the alphabetical arrangement used in modern
    word-books.. My reason for contacting Professor Lynch was the result of a curriculum director denying my published phonetic dictionary to her school relating that the reference book was not a 'real' dictionary. Now the dictionary is in public library collections in Canada, Mexico, The Netherlands and, of course, since it's an American English Phonetic Dictionary, is in over 400 U.S. public libraries. I am the lexicographer and would like to include """"Gabby's Wordspeller & Phonetic Dictionary"""" into the dictionary collection. And, since it's the only known phonetic dictionary currently in existence in either book or digital form, it has no category to list itself. Does it belong in a sub-category or does it require it's own category? There may be others come along now that this one has made the light of day.

"""  Why did you delete my correspondance without reply?  Maybe it was accidental...if so here it is again.

   Thanks for taking the time to explain Tokyogirl79.  I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

 Re: History merges 

The instructions are all laid out at Wikipedia:How to fix cut-and-paste moves. As I found out quickly, when you try to move an article from Title A to Title B and Title B already exists, the software will automatically delete the edits of Title B for you when you move the article. Try to minimise the number of revisions you need to delete and restore as deleting and restoring pages is one of the most taxing operations in MediaWiki. Also, it's a good idea to say in the move summary that the move shouldn't be reverted. Once I was history merging Melbourne, and a well-meaning editor tried to move it back while I was working on the history merge, which resulted in Melbourne disappearing from Wikipedia for a few minutes. Maybe I'll try the same thing at Auckland one day -). Hope this helps some. ''''''87 """,0

G.S.K.

(edit conflict) As to the second issue, yes, my """"personal view is that the content in Giano's post is a personal attack"""" (a view that arguably most in the ANI thread share). The blocking policy, WP:BP, is clear that """"persistently making personal attacks"""" may trigger a block. The policy does expect that """"blocks will be made with good reasons only, based upon reviewable evidence and reasonable judgment, and that all factors that support a block are subject to independent peer review if requested"""", but that does imply that administrators must use their individual judgment - what you might call """"my opinion"""" - to decide whether or not to block. In particular, the policy states that """"Warning is not a prerequisite for blocking"""", and a fortiori, discussion is not a prerequisite for blocking.

The assertion that Holodomor is a term used exclusively by """"extremists"""" is just absurd given the academic use of the term in the world.

 Jonathan Sposato Article for Creation 

Hi Kevin!

I saw that you recently declined my article for Jonathan Sposato, due to """"non-notability"""". Per your suggestion, I reviewed the Wikipedia Notability terms and requirements, and believe my article has met these and that Mr. Sposato is someone of notability. Jonathan is the chairman of the largest media company in Seattle - Geekwire - and the site's readership is now larger than The Seattle Times, and is one of the country's top 20 technology websites today . I was assuming this would qualify him as being someone notable, so please let me know if I am missing a piece of information or rules as to his qualification? I am working on this article with an editor currently writing a biography about Mr. Sposato, who was also unable to identify an area in which we fall short.

Cannibalism
http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/12/donner.party.ap/index.html
This article suggests cannibalism did not happen on the trip.

I'd vote that the new studies ( the CNN link doesn't work, http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060109/donnerparty_his.html does) should be noted on the front page, given they are scientific studies and at the very least seem to note legitimate disagreement. -Nate

There is ample evidence that cannibalism occurred. The fact that the study did not find evidence of it is not evidence that cannibalism didn't occur. The only evidence they were looking for were cooked bones. If the cannibals simply sliced meat from a body there would be no lasting evidence. While we should mention the study, we shouldn't overplay it. - 

Further comment: The Alder Creek digs of 2003-2004 do not """"cast doubt"""" on Donner Party cannibalism. The archaeologists did not find evidence of cannibalism at Alder Creek, but this is easily explainable. Further, the Alder Creek digs say nothing about other incidents of cannibalism by Donner Party members at the lake camp, among the """"Forlorn Hope"""" snowshoers, or at Starved Camp. Survivors said they ate human flesh and rescuers saw the evidence. Donner Party cannibalism is not in doubt among anyone who is familiar with the incident; it's the general public who have misinterpreted the archaeological evidence as """"casting doubt"""" on cannibalism. DPL, 6/28/2007

Cannibalism in the Donner Party is not in question. Ten survivors said they ate human flesh. At the Donner family camp at Alder Creek, the Donners told the First Relief that they were going to start eating the bodies of the dead; when the Second Relief arrived at Alder Creek they saw children eating human flesh and mutilated corpses. Three Alder Creek survivors (Georgia Donner, Mary Donner, and Jean-Baptiste Trudeau) said that cannibalism had occurred at the Donner camp. This is not a legend, but a matter of record. People who are unfamiliar with the historical sources are not competent to dismiss them as """"legends."""" Kristin Johnson, author Unfortunate Emigrants: Narratives of the Donner Party (Logan: Utah State University Press, 1996).

As a little footnote I'd like to add that cannibalism WAS a big part of the story. The website that is footnoted on that sentence shows about 6 episodes of eating people. Some of them ate human flesh for a month! And even the site admits it's a """"brief"""" section of their crazy feeding habits! Donner is forever known for eating others and the fact that it wasn't just 1 or 2 bodies, but like approx. 7-8+? really shows that these people had an appetite for homoerectus! 72.219.137.83  

As a little footnote, I'd like to add that you don't know what you're talking about. A year elapsed between the time the emigrants left home and the day the last survivor was rescued. With one exception, those who ate human flesh did so for about 2 weeks, some for as little as 2-3 days. Two weeks, out of 52 weeks in a year, IS minor. They did NOT """"develop an appetite for homo erectus"""" or a """"crazy eating habit""""  they put off eating human flesh for as long as they could, until finally there was absolutely nothing else left to eat. The reason why """"Donner is known forever for eating others"""" is because the general public, like the commentator above, exults in its own ignorance.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 144.35.8.13   

I would like to point out they weren't eating homo erectus, but homo sapien. lol.   

In all fairness, I would like to further point out that they were actually eating Homo Sapien's erectus. To my knowledge, this is the only story in American history where a group resorts to eating other members of the group to survive. Supposedly the first to die were murdered for their meat. That makes the cannibalism portion of their journey understandably popular.  I would have eaten maybe a shouldercock, but that's it.    16:06, 9 Feb 2010 (Pacific)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.23.168.177

 Very dubious text 

According many shcolar references I came accross it is clear that Ustashi were a n organization of terrorists, saboteurs and above all - rasists.

For example,

Encyclopedia of Holocaust, Israel Gutman, Volume IV, Editor in Chief, MacMillan Publishing Company NY 1990 Page 1551 states:

They assailed many of their opponents, attacked government installations, sabotaged railway tracks, land explosives in public places, and in 1932 even attempted to create popular uprising in a remote area, Lika

Also a number of references copied from the Ante Pavelic talk pages is quite clear in classifying this organization as a terrorsit and racistt organization

 Question about number of edits 

Hello, since the welcome message to my talk page came from you, I presume you're the person I should turn to with any questions.  I notice that every time anyone makes a change in an article, the old and new versions are stored in the history page.  I'm not terribly computer literate, but it seems that that would take up a lot of space, and I presume Wikipedia doesn't have infinite webspace.  If I see an incorrect comma in the third paragraph, a spelling error in the fifth, an incorrect link in the sixth, an incorrect date in the eighth, and unclear wording in the thirteenth, does Wikipedia prefer that I do one big edit so that it will have only one new page to store, or is it okay to save as I go along?  Are the individual versions in the history page deleted after a certain length of time?  I've been editing my user page, and just wonder whether I should leave changes until I have something big to change.

Thanks

 20:39, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

 (Butting in here, again, as people ask more interesting questions on Mel's talk page than on mine).  Ann, firstly, diskspace is so incredibly cheap that you could type flat out for your whole life and you wouldn't fill a drive that cost 100 euros;  so don't worry about diskspace.  This issue of what to do in an individual edit is one purely for the convenience of other people who are reading it.  So if you're doing a bunch of fairly trivial tweaks (fixing grammar, spelling, formatting, etc) then do all of those in one go (and give an edit summary like """"various grammar and spelling tweaks"""".  If the article needs tweaks and also need a higher-level change (adding or removing a big chunk of text, fixing some wording that you thing is seriously incorrect or misreading) then do the trivial fixes in one edit, and the other fix in another (with an edit summary like """"removing nonsense about Father Dougal"""").  So (in summary) make changes based on what is a logical unit, not what's convenient for the software.   (talk | contribs) 21:35, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

 strange situation at the Barak Obama talk page 

Recently I added a single reliably-sourced word, """"African,"""" to the list of Barak Obama's mother's ethnic origins near the beginning of the Barak Obama article.  My basic point is that if the article mentions Obama's mother's single Scottish ancestor (who was born 400 years ago), as well as Obama's Irish and Swiss ancestry, then there shouldn't be a problem with an equally-brief mention of her African ancestry. My one-word addition to the article was first modified and then deleted, so I opened a talk page here.  The discussion has taken a disturbing turn, and seems to have hit a nerve of racial discomfort among some wikipedia editors.  In particular, the suggestion to delete the entire list of ethnic origins as a way to avoid adding the word """"African"""" strikes me as a potential public relations black eye for wikipedia, which is why I am making this post here.

Go out in a blaze of glory...on my own talk page???  No, that's not my intention at all.  It's a very small venue to go out on, I can assure you.  My intention is simply to tell the truth.  Even if it hurts.  On that, I don't compromise.  If that appears suidical to you, it's a sad indictment on the frequency of truth telling in you neck of the woods.  Others compromise on truth, often because they care about $$$ more than truth.  That's what I believe motivates the deletions on WP and elsewhere regarding monetary reform.  That's why this stuff isn't EVER published in """"mainstream"""" sources.  This stuff is starved of funds until it dies.  People who care about $$$ more than truth hate people pointing this out to them.  Because it hurts.  It shows they aren't very smart, but they are very selfish.  It's as simple as that.

One other thing.  Wealth distribution is a separate and distinct issue from the issue of money creation and distribution.  They are related and they do interact, but they are distinct issues.  Many Libertarians (such as Ron Paul) couldn't care less about wealth distribution provided the way in which money creation is just and in accordance with the U.S. Constitution.  Free markets can determine wealth distribution - provided the way in which money is created is open and democractically approved and """"just"""" and the product of rational discussion (i.e. not based on the threat of a bullet to the head if you question the current method of money creation and distribution).  Once new money is created, it gets gets circulated according to the tax laws, and competition laws, and finance laws and a multitude of other factors, and ends up in someone's account somewhere.  Money creation is (arguably) much more important and has many more dynamic implications for an economy than wealth distribution, which is a separate issue.  Again, this confusion shows that the level of understanding of these issues is woeful and I despair at ever increasing the general public's understanding of these vitally important issues, especially given the limitless $$$s financing the countervailing forces (Gregalton, Zenwhat, etc) that are lined up against anyone questioning the sustainability and pointing out the absolute stupidity of the current debt-based system.

FYI
Here is the content of the Monoplane article from Britannica.  It's not an initial.
Monoplane,  type of aircraft with a single pair of wings. The monoplane design has been nearly universally adopted over multiplane configurations because airflow interference between adjacent wings reduces efficiency. The first monoplane was constructed by the Romanian inventor Trajan Vuia, who made a flight of 12 m (40 feet) on March 18, 1906. Louis Blériot of France built a monoplane in 1907 and flew it across the English Channel two years later. Monoplane design proved itself conclusively during World War II, and since then the craft has completely supplanted the biplane except for special purposes. Compare biplane  Best regards.   (☎) """,0

""") This tort reform debate is extremely hot in the sense that although there are no reasonable people in favor of tort reform, it is the position pushed forward by the owners of Conngress and the courts.

So the hot debate is not so much a partisan debate along """"party lines"""" (note you will not be able to see such lines ona cloudy day, so don't bother to look for them), as it is along the lines of which elected or appointed officials are willing to come out of the closet as kept mistresses, and openly do the bidding of their masters. It's a true nail-biter. The """"debate"""" has been keeping """"voters"""" on the edge of their seats for years, even though numerous laws have been passed that could count as tort reform, if the counters were honest. For example, the 1995 Securities Litigation Reform Act, and numerous court decisisons (there's one in front of the Supremem Court nowwonder if the little guy will win?) which limits the ability of defrauded mom and pop investors in teh stock market to sue fraudulent companiesmany of which are operating under the guise of a Fortune 500 firm, as Enron did.

"Chapter Nine
In chapter nine Burlington, Vermont Kolbert writes about Burlington, Vermont’s largest city. Years ago the citizens decided to stand up to global warming by using less power instead of buying more. The mayor of Burlington, Peter Clavelle, who has been mayor since 1989, came up with a program that encourages contractors to engage not in demolition but in “deconstruction”. This helps the city save energy by reducing waste and cutting down the need for new materials. Burlington’s electric department (BED) has a wind turbine that provided enough power for thirty homes and gets half of its energy from renewable sources, such as its 50 megawatt power plant that runs off of wood chips. The BED also leases compact florescent light bulbs for twenty cents a month because a family who uses these bulbs can cut their electricity bill by 10 percent. The city of Burlington estimates that their energy saving projects over the course of this lifetime will prevent the release of 175,000 tons of carbon. Burlington residents also eat locally and have turned old waste sites into an assortment of community gardens and cooperatives, the waste from these gardens is taken to a composting factory, and turned back into soil, making this process “closed loop”. Clavelle’s plan has begun to pick up across America beginning with Greg Nickles, the mayor of Seattle, who created a set of principles called the “US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement”. This agreement has been signed by over a hundred and seventy mayors, representing about thirty – six million people. This agreement is trying to prove how much can be done at the local level and Clavelle hopes that more cities will adopt this plan.",0

"Da Vinci Code & Mary's Descendants 
As the Da Vinci Code fictional story, Many disbelieve, that Mary had descendants through Jesus having children, as inconsistent with their core beliefs in Christianity imputing that if Jesus had children he didnt die on the cross and go to heaven.

See -
He shall see his Seed - Isaiah 53: 10 
He shall sprinkle his Seed across many nations - Isaiah 52:15
Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and His Maker, ask me of things to concerning MY SONS ... Isaiah 45: 11

"Email to Sean Black 

I did not want this text to be publicly known, since I still have to contact the professors, but in the current situation I see no choice but to put the draft text here. 

PM 1. I earlier emailed this draft to Rob Speer and Joe Hall for comment, and just sent it out to Sean Black. 
PM 2. I noticed that I am also blocked from the RfC page. I have not had much time to investigate what the intention of that page is, since I am writing my email to the professors, so I don't know whether that page or being blocked from it is important.
PM 3. It is not true that I only editted pages on myself.
PM 4. Who hold that contacting a professor would be the same as contacting an employer, neglect my earlier comment that I approach the issue from the angle of the integrity of science. The proper reaction is not to neglect it but give the argument why this angle would be improper. 
PM 5. On the RfC Joe Hall suggests that my objective would be to punish him or so. No, I only suggest that the professor and he discuss the situation from the angle of the integrity of science. Earlier I wrote that this would be very beneficial for him. 
PM 6. Joe mentioned that Hal Varian no longer is the dean at SIMS. Thus the draft needs at least one change.
PM 7. I told everyone that I wanted a time out. Why don't you respect that wish ? Didn't I read somewhere that a truce was also an option ? 

Dear Mr. Black,

I saw that, while I was composing my letter to the professors at MIT and SIMS, further action on wikipedia about me. There is an RfC which I am not familiar with and now you seem to have been blocking me whatever that is. 

Below you find the draft text of my letter to the professors. If you think that this is threatening and not befitting a scientific community, please reply.

A few hours ago I already sent this draft text to Rob Speer and Joe Hall. With an introductory text, that I no longer have, since wiki-mail has no cc. But they might forward the email sent to them.

I would appreciate it if you could explain the problem and what I can expect.

Dear professors Hockfield and Varian,
Dear Hal,

I have a problem on the integrity of science with two of your students, Rob Speer at MIT who started the problem, and Joseph Lorenzo Hall at SIMS who is interfering in an unhelpful way. The problem is summarized in the appendix.

Obviously, the integrity of science is a difficult subject even for academics so there must be a great deal of tolerance with students. With students, they certainly cannot be held accountable as scientists can, and they are only learning the trade. Yet, students e.g. know that one cannot cheat a test and that one must study a topic before one gives conclusions on it. When issues of integrity arise, it can be very educational for them to have the issue discussed. In this case, these two students would learn a lot about scientific conduct and scientific integrity.

In the present case, the issue is on the behaviour of these students on the internet, in particular wikipedia. It appears that communication with these students is greatly hindered by that environment, which does not allow the quality of deliberation provided by a personal chat with a person that they respect. My reason to contact you is to ask you to find a teacher or counselor at your school to have that chat.

It is to be considered whether the activity of those students within wikipedia is related to their life as students at your schools. My impression is that this relation exists. Firstly, they present themselves on their wikipedia pages as students of MIT and SIMS, thus partly referring to those institutions and their education there, implying their relation to you. Secondly, they are active in editing work, where they refer to learned books and where they use difficult words. Their behaviour thus cannot be strictly separated from their education and prospective position as scientists. This is most clearly so with Joseph Lorenzo Hall who is already a Ph.D. student who thus must write scientific papers for the journals. For Rob Speer, who started the problem, it can be observed that his education on computing science is relevant for the topic where the problem arose.

 As I said above, Deep learning is the name of a class of algorithms. Feedforward neural nets, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep neural networks and deep belief networks are all mathematical models. How the models are trained, that is, how model parameters are chosen to optimize some loss function, is another topic entirely. People had looked at deep neural network architectures before deep learning techniques were developed, but it was the deep learning techniquesunsupervised pre-training, layer by layerthat made deep networks more practical at the time. With today's GPU based algorithms, the need for pre-training has lessened. The hype surrounding deep learning has muddied the concept to point that people like Michael Jordan claim it is just a synonym for neural network. But the backlash from current hype doesn't change the historical importance of deep learning algorithms in generating interest and good results in deep neural network models or representational learning. Schmidhuber's review has a good discussion of these issues.   21:55",0

"Plot summary issue: sniper scope tampering 

The plot summary states the following:
Unbeknownst to the Doctor the assassin is actually among the delegates. He pulls out a pistol  when the Doctor reaches the camera level and shoots the President dead. The crowd sees the Doctor on the catwalk firing the sniper rifle (in an attempt to stop the assassin) and assume he is the killer.
I don't think this is correct.  The cut when the Doctor fires strongly implies that it is HE who shot the president (a fake-out that's the focus of the cliffhanger, in fact), and not the man in the crowd.  Also, it's later revealed that the scope on the Doctor's sniper rifle was tampered with.  I'll have to go and check, but it's always been my impression that the scope was tampered with in just such a way that when the Doctor attempted to fire on a would-be assassin in the crowd who was standing in just the right spot, his staser bolt would hit the president instead, in a perfect frame-job. 76.126.142.59",0

 Anti-TKD slant 

I noticed that the article was changed to reflect a pro-foreign-influence slant.  I will eventually attempt to make appropriate edits in increments... edits made.  Comments welcome:  1. Introduction stated that TKD is an amalgamation of Chinese, Japan and Korean art.  While this may be factually true, it's a misleading introduction to TKD as many martial arts, including all forms of Karate, are amalgamations.  It serves no good purpose, other than NPOV agenda, to highlight this as an introduction to TKD.  2. Under """"development of TKD"""", controversies surrounding Karate's influence on TKD was overstated once again.  This topic is dealt with quite accurately in the Karate article.  It makes sense to follow that lead in this case.  It's misleading and NPOV the way it is written now.  3. Under """"traditional roots"""" TKD's foreign influence is again overstated.  Whoever, made these edits obviously had a pro-karate agenda.  The topic of foreign influence can be delt with in a fair and objective manner without being beaten to death under every subsection!  4. Under """"External Influence"""" foreign influence should be appropriately dealt with. 

The article is now overstating Taekwondo's relationship with Subak/Taekkyon; do we really need several long paragraphs all about """"Subak"""" (手搏) (whatever that was) and the Hwarang (whoever they really were) and Taekkyon supposedly slowly developing into Taekwondo over hundreds of years?  Taekkyon still exists today, so we can talk about Taekkyon's development in that article separately (noting that Taekkyon looks completely different from modern Taekwondo).  Japan's influences on Taekwondo are also well-documented, so why remove it?  Let's keep a neutral point of view for this article.  At this point, it sounds like the first few pages of a Taekwondo student's guide.

I think this needs to be looked into more carefully but history of Korean martial arts is a very relevant part of tkd.  Let's leave the text as is until we can sort this out.  I also have to say that your dismissive attitude isn't very POV.  Instead of blindly defending or rejecting labels, we need to deconstruct ideas and arguments and go through them with a fine comb.  Regardless of what you want to call it, Koreans have been kicking in fights and contests for thousands of years and documentation for this exists as far back as the three kingdoms era.  Chosun documentation also exists that show that Subak was part of the formal requirements for entrance into Chosun military and large Taekyon tournaments held by the populace well into the 1800's.  Most of Korean folk arts and traditional Korean disciplines existed and even thrived during the Chosun dynasty without formalization or systemization(e.g. korean wrestling called ssirum, pan sori, musical instruments, minstrels, etc.).  But the absence of formal schools, teachers and formal links doesn't mean that those arts weren't passed down or that they didn't exist.    While tkd isn't taekyon, tkd is a product of Korean attempts at formalizing a Korean martial art.  In an objective inquiry into TKD's origins, you need to understand the history and culture of Korean martial arts, culture and history.  To leave this out would be erroneously simplistic.  The martial arts aspect of Korean culture(folk culture during Chosun times) provides the basis for the formalization and systemization that Korean martial arts goes through in the 1900's.  TKD claims this, history and culture of Korean arts and disciplines provides the background for this, and the actual practice of tkd bears this out.  To ignore all this and look only for and only accept formal links between masters, students, formal schools, etc., is NPOV and more importantly wouldn't reflective objective reality behind TKD's conception.

btw.  There's a lot of crap out there about a lot of Korean martial arts but Hwarang are mentioned in Korean historical documents, Subak is mentioned countless times in military, historical records including Chosun records.  Taekyon was a part of Subak and its popularity was well documented by during Chosun times in its mention of Taekyon tournaments that were held well into the 1800's.   

To keep this (relatively) short, just a few points:

1. We know that """"Subak"""" has been mentioned in the Mooyedobotongji and other sources, but we don't really know exactly what """"Subak"""" actually referred to.  In China, the same word (pronounced """"Shoubo"""") was used as a general term for barehand martial arts, however - thus, it is likely that Koreans used the same word in the same way (as it was a loanword).
2. Hwarang are of course mentioned in many Korean texts, but we don't actually know",0

2. Aerosol scattering dominates in most places - in """"clear ir"""" (see Garstang, 1986, PASP), the total scattering from aerosols is ~10x that from molecules.
3. Aerosol scattering has almost no wavelength dependence, reducing the dominance of blue light influence below that expected from pure Rayleigh scattering and the RSI of Keith.
4. But, the Purkinje effect makes the eye more sensitive to white/blue rich light when dark adapted (most relevant when looking at/adapted to sky glow; only marginally relevant when looking at/adapted to outdoor night lighting levels), increasing again the dominance of white/blue-rich sources.
5. The Bortle scale has made very little or no penetration into professional astronomy - astronomers, when they characterize skyglow at all, still use mag/arcsec2.  Bortle scale is being used by amateurs and is being investigated in some detail by US National Park Service as a useful scale to characterize night sky quality.  Finally, the Bortle scale uses much more than just sky glow to characterize skies.

""""I don't understand why you think the definition belongs only with momentum/time.""""  the reason is pedagogical within the physics discipline.  it would be a tautology to define the Joule as the amount of energy required to move a body against a force of 1 Newton the distance of 1 meter, then at the same time, define the Newton as 1 Joule per meter.  it's true but it says nothing about the quantities of the Joule or of the Newton (nor anything about their dimesion).  it is not like the chicken and egg, we know which one comes first (meter, kg, second come first, then the Newton before the Joule). the Planck force is a derived unit and will have to be the Planck unit of momentum divided by the Planck unit of time.  the fact that it comes out to be the basic tension in string theory or in, general relativity, the force that is the conversion factor between spacetime curvature and the energy density giving rise to it or, if multiplied by the fourth power of the (dimensionless) circular orbit speed some distance from a central body that it tells what the body would weigh at that distance, all these are fine and good, but they are the result of working out hypothesized physics problems, they are not the definition.  what if you worked out some other basic physics problem (say the basic tension of a string) and it came out to be 2 FP? or 4 π FP?  would you say that the force solutions to such are the definition of the Planck force?  it doesn't matter what the system of units are, once you have those 5 base units defined, there is no freedom left to define the others.  their definitions are purely consequential.
 i think you need to word things according to the most common terminology.  i fixed it a little more.  i inserted edit notes (invisible) that ask what does it mean to """"distribute energy over a gravitational radius""""? and what does it mean to """"distribute energy over the Compton wavelength""""?  unless you expect your encylopediac readers to know, even vaguely, when or where or how or why such distribution of energy is being done (thus defining the rate of such distribution), why say these words?  also, there still is no citation other than Schwartzchild radius, which i did.  so a reader does not think that this was all just made up, you might want to include references to other stuff.
 i fixed the convention errors and format errors (some just now).  do a diff comparison to see what i did.  """,0

 Legal Action Against Wikipedia 

I've heard that rumors that legal action is being started against wikipedia as a result of this article for the following reasons:

1- the SCIMD sheild being used on this article is a copyrighted image that they refuse to remove even at the request of the holder of the copyright hence they are in violation of copyright laws.

2- Wikipedia and the users involved in editing this page, are being added to one (if not more) of the lawsuits due to the constant slander of the students and SCIMD in attempts to hurt the current and future student body?

> any comments from the posters on the above and the fact that letters from the lawyers for the school, copyright holder, and one of the lawsuits have been ignored repeatedly?

just curious 

 

To be honest, why would or should anyone care about rumors or random unsubstantiated threats from anyone on the internet? The apparent copyright status of the image is documented on the image page; anyone is welcome to comment about it there, but nobody has done so, or use any of the other mechanisms to resolve copyright concerns about media files. You should read WP:THREAT before continuing down this line of discussion.  

it is by no means a theat against anyone.  I was just curious as i had heard about the legal action being taken, and curious as to why no one else had commented about it or why nothing was done.  People are quick to post the negative and not question.  I also understand and see that if anyone trys to defend this school or post anything positive their accounts are removed and the conversation erased claiming vandalism or something else obscure, so i'm pretty sure this will be erased and my account and IP will be banned in typical fashion to surpress anything that doesn't conform.  

Sorry for jumping at you...I think I've been reading on-line ranters too long, and completely misread your intent.  

 Has anyone heard any rumors that SCIMD sued several editors, had its claims dismissed immediately, and was forced to pay damages as a result of bringing a facially unmeritorious lawsuit?  If anyone has heard any such rumors, do they have any comment?   

More seriously, Azrealist, I don't believe """"rumors"""" of a lawsuit  have you heard anything involving (1) what court the suit was filed in, (2) who was sued, and (3) what the case number was?  If not, I would assume that whoever told you the rumor was probably just some disgruntled person with a connection to SCIMD, trying to discourage editors from posting here.  (I'm not questioning your good faith, but I'm betting whoever told you the rumor is an SCIMD apologist . . .)   

From what i heard the suit or charges were being started/processed in NJ and Florida concomitantly with the other suits in progress. Sorry but i don't have anymore info than that.  If i knew all the facts i wouldn't have asked about it. 

I once heard some rumors that a poster on this talkpage did not understand anything about fair use and thought copyright meant that no one could use an image. Care to comment on that Azrealist? -[[User_talk:AKMask|ask]]

If you look at the Mugabe you will find the situation is more complex than 'anonymous vandalism'. User:Bakersville is currently under a 24 hour block for 3RR (this is not his first time), and the things he complains of as 'vandalism' are in fact reverts of his repeated additions to the article. Other users have stated that Bakersville's  additions are in fact copyvio, and it is certainly not obvious that they are appropriate to the article, or better than the versions he is reverting. 

What I think is really going on is an edit war involving Bakersville, an anon, and a couple of other editors. None of the parties are behaving well, and my view is that the anon is no worse than any of the other people in the war.

 US emissions description is totally contentless now. 

The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US """"partial zero emissions vehicle"""" could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.

Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.

Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad """"20mpg"""" reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.

"Avoiding Edit Wars 

Acroterion, I have been trying to avoid edit wars since I was unblocked last October 2008. I try to make articles more accurate, but sometimes it results in stepping on the toes of persons who have a particular point of view. I have learned the lesson from the past, not to push an issue. I have had a few prolonged discussions, but I have avoided edit wars on the main articles.

However, I would like to have your advice on a particular issue. It relates to a comment which I have just left on the talk page of 'Kepler's laws of planetary motion'. I do not intend to press the issue and I do not intend to make any more reverts. But I do feel that there is a matter here which needs to be observed.

I appreciate that phyics is not your topic, although I do know that you are scientific enough to grasp the concepts involved. I'll give you a quick summary. There are two equations involved in the Kepler problem, each with two terms on the active side. A couple of months ago, I was going to try and make major edits to this page, but I got stuck on the issue of agreeing names for the terms in the equations. You can see that discussion further up. There was general agreement about the actual equations, but no agreement on the names of the terms. So I lost interest and went elsewhere.

A few days ago, I returned to add what I considered to be very helpful information on elliptical orbits in relation to Kepler's second law. It was reverted. But it was reverted by a user who has only ever come to physics pages in my time, to revert my edits.

I will now walk away from that page because I don't want a repeat of what happened last July. Interestingly it was during an argument with this same user last July that indirectly led tome getting blocked, albeit that the final straw actually came on the Mozart page.

I intend to tidy up some more of the physics pages over the coming months. I am not asking you to do anything right now. But I would be grateful if you could monitor the situation and provide any advice because I do not believe that this guy is doing these reverts in the genuine spirit of promoting knowledge in physics.

"Misrepresenting administrator scope 

Please take care not to misrepresent how administrators are expected to act, or any other policy in the future - administrators do not make content decisions. What you quoted was particular only to discretionary sanctions which are only applicable in certain arbitration cases. You view has therefore been moved again to the talk page.   

Please take care not to engage in misrepresentation - you are not outside of this dispute, and your quote was particular to discretionary sanctions. Administrators do not make content decisions. See below. Please also do not change my view - I suggest you revert your latest edit - failure to do so will result in administrator intervention for deliberate misrepresentation, misuse of the dispute resolution process and vandalism.   
 

You are welcome to your view, but you are not welcome to misrepresent administrator policy or to change my view.   

You have engaged in misrepresentation, perhaps out of misunderstanding. Administrators are only allowed to make discretionary sanctions in arbitration cases where they are explicitly allowed to - Kirill's comment was in relation to discretionary sanctions only (check the context of his comment; the heading under which he made it). FloNight's comment is in relation to administrator enforcement in general, which is why the SAB remedy has been proposed in the homeopathy case.   

It is only disruptive where there is edit-warring - that is, edit-warring against consensus (separate policy on conduct). NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. Would you like arbitrator clarification?   

Did you read what I said above? NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. See also: . 
Discussing content issues at a conduct Rfc is inappropriate - we have a clear distinction between Article Rfc and Rfc on user conduct for that reason. What is acceptable is pointing editors to an Article RFC so editors can comment on content (and hence address content issues), and that is where discussion of those issues belong in the dispute resolution process.   

So please modify your view so that there is no misrepresentation of policy/norms as it has been sanctioned by the Committee in the past (and admins have been sanctioned when using their position to make a ruling on content). Article RFC is where comment is made on the content policies you have quoted - you are welcome to direct a link to the discussion there in your view so that it is dealt with.   

It seems you don't get the point - it's ok if you think it should be enforceable, but it is completely irresponsible to misrepresent policy by saying that it must be enforcible when it is forbidden, and engaging in misrepresentation in using an arbitrator's view on a separate matter to be absolute on all matters. It contributes to the confusion editors have about Wikipedia norms and policies, and it is unacceptable. Therefore, I am referring it directly to the Committee.   

The assumption of bad faith is on your part, for you clearly have not read - NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. You seem to have a disregard for due procedure and norms. [[User:Ncmvocalist|Ncmvoca",0

First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you don't understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real people's encyclopaediais called Google. Either you don't understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of Manipur where people are terrified to report the truth or you don't care. I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google. One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail. Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid. Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle. I don't think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldn't have to pay you to supress the truth. You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric. One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is a Chinese Government Human Rights Agency. They are not so hot on Tibet and can be truthful on non chinese human rights abuses but in Manipur they have close links with the major human rights NGO which has long been run by the local police. I am sure things will happen but since you haven't got any interest in updating it none will report it here. I don't believe it is helpful either. Wiki did not allow the 24 hours grace to support to keep my fiancee alive again not out of malice but because of aspergers syndrome. I am sending her Hard Times if you haven't read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date info Google is the first port of call or Twitter. So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant. It is far from accurate or up to date. Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit. Before I began editing wiki hadn't updated info for several years. No doubt now you will accept unchallenged the false government reports which because they carry the weight of Chinese Propaganda agencies and local newspapers wholly intimidated by the Manipur State and corrupt police will now stand unchallenged by the editors who look only at code grammar and syntax and have no understanding of hte problems of truth reporting from within a police state of the third world.

"Reply re circularity and plagiarism

Thanks for pointing me to the new discussions. But I probably won't engage there because IMO the issue at that particular article (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) is already covered by the current passage in WP:VERIFIABILITY stating that We should not source to material originating in WP, since it creates circularity. Verifiability is a core content policy and I don't suppose it changes much. With regard to whether the discovery at the PL-LT Comm article is a notable instance of plagiarism from WP by academics: since the cited website is a collection of papers written by students, and clearly published as such (, authors and tutors on page 10) - even tho the website was sponsored by an academic institution - I don't see it as notable occurence along those lines.

 Arundhati Roy's controversial comments on Gujarat riots in 2002 missing in """"Advocacy and controversy"""" section 

Hi,

Arundhati Roy's comments on Gujarat riots of 2002 that came in Outlook magazine when the riots were happening, which got very high media attention, when the enquiry proved false and subsequent apology was published in the same magazine, are one of the biggest controversial statement ever issued by her, which triggered widespread violence during the riots, is missing from """"Advocacy and controversy"""" section of the wikipedia article about 'Arundhati Roy"""".

Some of the comments in the article published in the Outlook magazine were 

""""Last night a friend from Baroda called. Weeping. It took her fifteen minutes to tell me what the matter was. It wasn't very complicated. Only that Sayeeda, a friend of hers, had been caught by a mob. Only that her stomach had been ripped open and stuffed with burning rags. Only that after she died, someone carved 'OM' on her forehead.""""

""""A mob surrounded the house of former Congress MP Iqbal Ehsan Jaffri. His phone calls to the Director-General of Police, the Police Commissioner, the Chief Secretary, the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) were ignored. The mobile police vans around his house did not intervene. The mob broke into the house. They stripped his daughters and burned them alive. Then they beheaded Ehsan Jaffri and dismembered him. Of course it's only a coincidence that Jaffri was a trenchant critic of Gujarat Chief Minister, Narendra Modi, during his campaign for the Rajkot Assembly by-election in February.""""

"anthropomorphic bias ==

There appears to be some sensitivity with respect to this topic, which I think is due to an anthropomorphic bias.  Dysgenics is a research topic in biology; the anthropological and sociocultural aspects are not central to the topic.  The concerns listed in the heading paragraph belong lower in the text, as they apply only to the aspect of the term relating to homo sapiens.  

(and I want to add)

The concept of dysgenics itself is really only at home in a discussion of genotype.  Direct anthropomorphic considerations (of the sociopolitical aspects outlined in the article) are very crude constructions which do not hew to the precise biological use of the term.  I think one danger is that, by focusing on the easily politicized extension of the term, we risk conflating an important biological concept with indirect sociological constructions.  Next thing you know, biologists innocently researching fruit flies get implicated in fascism, eugenics, and gas chambers.  So I agree that we need to make very careful use of these terms.  These concepts, while connected to a degree, should be covered carefully. 137.186.41.143

"Name and scope 

I'm not happy with the name or scope of Category:Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland. I see it's a subcat of Category:Roman Catholic sex abuse cases by country; I don't know about other countries  but it's not the right name for encompassing all the interrelated issues in Ireland. Pretty much every word is questionable.

 There is abuse, subtypes child abuse and sexual abuse, and the intersection child sexual abuse.  Many institutional abuse victims, especially girls, were not sexually abused. Magdalen laundries' inmates were mostly not children. 

 All these can occur either in the context of a Catholic religious organisation or elsewhere.  Not all institutions were run by religious orders, or by Catholics.   

 Not all sexual scandal resulted from abuse (arguable example Eamon Casey).  Not all abuse results in scandal; aggregate abuse statistics can never be NPOV described as scandalous.

 Does Ireland mean the island or the state? The state institutional setup was different in Northern Ireland, but the diocesan setup was not.  (Brendan Smyth)

I'm not sure the ultimate supercat Abuse in Ireland would be an appropriate name. But I do think some overall rejigging and renaming is needed; and if convenient then subarticles and subcategories could supplement it.",0

Just FYI, I've managed to solve my problem, and the same (or similar) solution may work for you.  My extender had an IP on the wrong subnet (192.168.0.123, when all my other devices were on the 192.168.1.* subnet), so I regained access by factory resetting and changing the static IP to 192.168.1.123.  Since you can't get on even after a factory reset, you could try modifyin your router DHCP settings so that the subnet it's assigning everything to includes the static IP you assigned for the extender (and if that still doesn't work, the factory default).

Is it UNDO? 
Years later, it's 50% of her OWN self-promoting website. My instincts tell me that loyal fans - that is """"fans"""" as in the root word fanatics, will contact her through her website and pled with her to remove her account of the incident (or see her memory besmirched on Wikipedia! – That’s just humor to make a point, let that knot in your panties loosen up a bit. Come on. Life will go on if a mild accurate account of the arrest is included). JFK had multiple extra marital affairs, people are interested in that fact. In Clinton’s day, people were so interested that he went through impeachment because of his outside-of-marriage-activities. In Mary Ann’s case, it is all the more interesting because it allegedly has been her co-star, Gilligan, supplying her marijuana for years.

BLP: 
No one answers Chowbok’s questions on any of the “reasons” why this information is blocked, that is, “answer” in the sense of saying anything other than rhetoric. WHY MUST THIS INTERESTING EVENT BE EXCLUDED FROM WIKIPEDIA WHEN THE SUBJECT’S OWN WEBSITE DEVOTES SPECIAL ATTENTION TO IT? Because those guarding her memory, unlike her, can’t deal with a least brief mention of the truth? But in that vein, are we as loyal citizens of Gilligan’s Island duty-bound to protect our virgin queen? Grow up. Let the truth be included.

If Mary Ann writes a biography, the excerpts released by the publisher will assuredly include the arrest while in possession of marijuana, and those facts will be the ones that bring attention to her book. The most worn pages of her biography will be the pages discussing the arrest and the aftermath, unless it turns out that she was in a long-running threesome with Mr. Howell and the Skipper. Oh, by the way, why do I refer to her as “Mary Ann?” Because I am being disrespectful; much like the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of you are to Chowbok and anyone else who disagrees with you. No amount of charm or politeness on my part is going to win a single one of you over. You need to rise above the digs and the rhetoric and improve this article because the exclusion of this information of significant interest to the vast majority of people hurts Wikipedia. If you can’t get over sweet Mary Ann getting her adorable little button nose dirty, or you can’t rise above me being disrespectful, you surely won’t elevate yourselves to include the facts simply because it is, editorially, the right decision. 
I
F YOU WANT TO PLAY THE ROLE OF EDITOR, THEN TAKE ON THE BURDEN OF DOING THE JOB WITH THE PRIDE OF MAKING UNBIASED EDITORIAL DECISIONS. If you are simply a Mary Ann worshipper, then join her fan club, bow towards Gilligan’s Island seven times a day, and burn incense before her golden image; but don’t pretend to be an editor with the slightest degree of integrity.

Years later, HER ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT is told only through the words of her lawyer. She refuses to give a personal account. I find that fascinating. Even O.J. spoke personally when he denied murdering his ex-wife. Hell, in his case, he spoke DIRECTLY to the Judge in front of a live TV audience, even though he had four of his lawyers standing right next to him. Mary Ann, on her own website, still hides behind the unsigned words of her lawyer (I highly recommend reading his words. If the presentation/spin upon the events is not hysterical to you, you have not yet developed the critical thinking necessary to be an editor (well, anywhere but on Wikipedia; interestingly, a place I do not have the right to edit the Sacred Page of The Virgin Mary Ann). 
The CONSENSUS is that Mary Ann is MORE WIDELY KNOWN for the arrest while in possession of marijuana than anything else she has ever done. It's not only the top single reason that anyone searches for information on her, variations on arrest/marijuana/drunk driving are the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of the any searches about her.

BE BOLD?: 
“Be Bold” and edit says Wikipedia’s founder. But the bullies on this issue say, if you are “bold,” you will be sent messages to stop editing, and we will block you from editing anything about Mary Ann as her page is “protected.” 

I can go to the Wikipedia page of Wikipedia creator and founder Jimmy Wales and edit anything I chose on his page, but not so Mary Ann. I can even go to the page about that other “Mary” - you might have heard of her, she gave birth to Jesus Christ, Lord and Savior - and edit anything and everything.

What credibility can any editor of Wikipedia have when its founder’s page can be edited, pages of living and revered religious and historical figures can be edited, but editing of a 1960s’ short run ensemble cast sit-com bit player’s page must be reviewed and “approved” by self-proclaimed “editors,” aka B.O.G.I, the Bullies Of Gilligan’s Island.

Basically, I haven't added anything to the page, I was just watching it. There was some paragraphs on the page about how Beyonce's fans had a petition for a reshoot for the video, and one about the song """"underperforing"""" at radio compared to her last singles, and Tigermichal kept removing them, while I kept putting them back because it's Point of View to not have them, and I think it's encyclopedic to keep them.

Not being used to Wiki process I didn't see the warning until after it was made although I'm not sure what that difference would have made long term.

Custerwest's contains the things which didn't happen, such as the discredited story of """"4 to 6 white captives"""" (discussed in detail before).

"""YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION==

This is the most """"contructive"""" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.

 Lead is too narrow 
The lead states """"Adherents of the 9/11 Truth Movement deny that al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airliners and intentionally crashed two into the World Trade Center buildings"""". I think this is too specific, as not all proponents argue this. Some (engineers particularly) only claim that the towers were brought down with the help of explosives without any assumptions as to who was involved. The use of explosives doesn't preclude Al-Qaeda (or anyone else) from hijacking (or otherwise) airliners (or aircraft of similar description) from intentionally crashing into the WTC. It seems fairly obvious that aircraft flew into the buildings, but that also doesn't preclude the use of explosives. I'm not a die hard truther, but I don't belive the mainstream media or the US government either. As a structural engineer there does seem to be some quirks in the hypothesis put forward by NIST, and the apparent hasty destruction of material evidence from the disaster does seem very questionable. Calling for further investigation doesn't seem unreasonable regardless of what actually happened. There seems to be a lot of people who get offended even by the mere suggestion of further investigation (which may in fact help to clear the government of any involvement). I guess these people (who seem to get all their 'facts' from Fox and CNN) explain why the US government is able to get away with gradual erosion of liberties (PATRIOT, NDAA, TSA, etc).

"""==Celtic Language?==

It says in the article that after St. Patrick was captured he began to learn """"the Celtic language.""""  It is commonly agreed among Irish historians that the Irish are not actually Celtic (e.g. the Irish learned the Celtic style of art from communication with the European mainland, etc.).  So did they speak the Celt language? I defer to an expert on this one. 

To be more precise, what the article means is that he learned """"a Goidelic language"""" or """"the Old Irish language"""". Patrick would have already spoken a Brythonic language and some Latin. Depending on exactly where he came from in Britain, he might have known a Goidelic language as well. Celtic languages and Insular Celtic languages explain how Goidelic and Brythonic may have been related to each other and to other Celtic languages.   (Talk) 

Are you kidding?  Please identify your source in claiming that """"is commonly agreed among Irish historians that the Irish are not actually Celtic.""""  Recent research has revealed that the Celts did not displace pre-celtic peoples but Celts did come to Ireland and the predominant culture remained celtic until English colonization.  Second, Gaeilge is a celtic language of the Q-celtic branch of the Celtic language family, thus the Irish of Patrick's day spoke a celtic language and it is assumed that Patrick learned said language.  Ergo, he learned a celtic language (though, as noted above, he probably already spoke a P-celtic brythonic language prior to his enslavement.

I have seen broken dates for specific invasions of the British Isles from mainland europe during the collapse of the Roman empire, these not only include Picts, Scots, Irish, Angles and Saxons and more bizzarely English! I will have to dig the book out with dates.  

St. Patrick: Fact and Fiction

I have removed 'was captured by Niall Noigiallach' as it is an obvious error. I will try to come back some time in the future and help with citation and new material.

What are the sources for the following statments?

1 - """"born Patricius Magonus Sucatus""""
2 - """" seems to have studied at the monastery of Lérins on the Côte d'Azur from 412 to 415 ...He spent the next 15 years at Auxerre were he became a disciple of Saint Germanus of Auxerre and was ordained possibly about 417.""""
3 - """"Saint Germanus consecrated Patrick bishop about 431, and sent him to Ireland to succeed Saint Palladius, the first bishop, who had died earlier that year. """"
4 - """"There was some contact with the pope. Patrick visited Rome in 442 and 444. """"
5 - """"Popular devotion to Patrick began in France, long before Sucat received the noble title of Patricius""""

These and other statments seriously mar what is otherwise a fairly good and reasonably well written article. Also the chronology implicit in them is all over the place. The fact of the matter is that no one know for sure what the dates of Patrick's life are; those of 461 (arriving in Ireland) and 491 (death) are estimates arrived at only after decades of discussion. Will whoever rewrote this article please show the basis for including these statments. Thank you. 

I've re-revised the article again in line with what I wrote above, for the simple reason that Pcassidy reverted back to his version again without citing sources for statments I take issue with. I dislike doing this unilaterally because it is against the spirit of wikipedia, but it seems I have to draw attention to this in some manner other than being polite. , 18:52 pm, 18th April 2005.

If you want to vandalize something besides an article (i.e. user pages, talk pages, etc.), I really don't care as long as its not mine.  Other people might care but not me.  Just leave the articles alone, unless of course you're adding useful information.   Ndenison talk

If I may, I request that the status of immediate deletion be removed and humbly ask that the community have a chance to expand it living up to Wikipedia's high standards.

The J.D. is not a doctoral level degree. That someone chooses to call it that means nothing. There is at least one college that calls all of it B.S.-level alumnae """"doctor"""" because of some tradition, akin to the Italian use of Dottore. Everyone agreed that the old D.Pharm., before the recent changes, was a master's-level degree. When I see surveys of """"highest level of education completed"""" I often see the J.D. lumped with professional master's degrees like a M.Arch. (usually 2-3 years) or M.S.W. or the like. The D.C. was often lumped in there, but they're made an effort to get more people to have completed a B.S. first to raise their standing, as pharmacy is trying to do. As mentioned, in many fields the terminal degree is a master's, for example in many artistic fields (M.F.A.). I clearly recall arguments, reported in The Chronicle of Higher Ed., over whether a J.D. holder should be a university's president given the lack of a terminal/doctoral degree. I also point out that following a J.D. one still takes a master's or (higher) doctorate as the next step, if desired. In my experience, J.D. holders occasionally use """"Doctor"""" in very formal settings in academiaif speaking at a graduation ceremonybut for the most part, no. Certainly, I consider them to have a degree that is the equivalent of a 3-year M.Arch. Since there is no pre-law curriculum, it just isn't comparable  to a Ph.D. biologist who took a B.S. and M.S. in the same subject.  """,0

City of Vancouver or Greater Vancouver Area?

The classification box should read """"City of Vancouver"""" instead of simply """"Vancouver"""" since it appears to be the Wikipedia standard to use the """"official"""" name of any country, nation-state, American state, etc. in such classification boxes.  Further, I notice alot of articles about Vancouver's neighbouring municipalities that do not mention the official names of such municipalities.  Why simply say """"Delta"""" when one should be saying """"The Incorporation of Delta"""" when the government website of that municipality uses such as a legalistic title? I know that lawyers are the only type of people who really care about municipal boundaries and official names, but this is still Wikipedia and all the technical and legalistic details should be mentioned.  After all, municipalities, whether a city, town, township, village, etc., are merely creations of the law of incorporation.

I was wondering if any person living in the Greater Vancouver Area had a hand in writing this article because there is lack of distinction being made between the City of Vancouver (i.e. Vancouver proper) and the surrounding municipalities such as the City of Burnaby, City of Richmond, etc.  Until the Greater Vancouver Area undergoes the type of municipal amalgamations as seen in the Toronto, Ottawa and Hamilton areas, this important distinction must be made.  This article should not use the simple word """"Vancouver"""" to mean the larger metro area that includes Burnaby, Richmond, etc.  Doing so would be very confusing to a reader in view of the Greater Vancouver Area map with all those municipal boundaries drawn in.

"Turkey is in Europe or not? 

I want this topic to be clearly discussed under this topic. I find it silly to put Turkey in the list of Asian countries. Anatolian side of Turkey is geographically in Asia and the Thrace side is in Europe. So, we have to see political and historical relationships of Turkey. I want ask how many of you have seen Turkey playing in Asian football cup? Why is Turkey accepted to be a candidate for European Union if it doesnt belong to Europe? If the deal is cultural history then i advise you to see Turkish constructions in Greece, Bulgaria, Bosnia, Macedonia, Serbia or visit a Museum in Wien to learn if Turks have ever been there. If a religious seperation is the reason, i have nothing to say... 
I strictly insist on this subject and would edit the entries that show Turkey in Asia unless a offical dokument is posted here.

"I'm not criticizing you here, but I truly don't understand why people from time to time make that comment, that is is irrelevant. It is a major component of identity, far more than say LGBT or political party. Anyway, the reason why I was compelled to ask the question is that I read an article about her new book regarding Revelations in the New Yorker and it was very anti-Christian. I then over the following weekend read an article in the Wall Street Journal about this same book and it was more even handed. It made the book sound very intriguing and a good work of scholarship. So I was using Wiki as a tool to help try and see whether or not it was the author of the New Yorker article or the author of the book who was the bigot; or rather whose perspective was being presented in the article. So if Wiki said that she is some type of devout Christian or proud of her Christian heritage, I would be able to make a better determination of which article was more neutral. Or if it said that she was a Cultural Marxist ditto. This is precisely what Wiki is there to help us with. It might sound mundane but if I had all the information that I needed then I would have been able to make the decision to purchase the book. So instead of Wikipedia, I had to read the reviews on Amazon. Ergo, Wiki did not provide all the relevant info I needed. Thanks!",0

Islamophobia article vs. Antisemitism article
The first section in the Islamophobia article dedicated to in-depth development of the concept...

The concept of Islamophobia has been criticized on several grounds.[24][25][26] Some critics argue that it is real, but is just another form of racism and does not require its own category,[27] while others argue that it is used to censor criticism, that its use threatens free speech,[25][28] or is used to silence issues relating to Muslim populations in Western countries.[29]

Novelist Salman Rushdie and others signed a manifesto entitled Together facing the new totalitarianism in March 2006 which denounced Islamophobia as """"a wretched concept.""""[23] British academic Michael Burleigh argues that the term 'spares anyone the need to examine what has gone wrong within [Europe's Muslim] communities'.[29] Others, such as Edward Said, consider Islamophobia as it is evinced in Orientalism to be a 'secret sharer' in a more general antisemitic Western tradition.[30][31][32] However, Daniel Pipes says that """"'Islamophobia' deceptively conflates two distinct phenomena: fear of Islam and fear of radical Islam.""""[33]

The concept of Islamophobia as formulated by Runnymede is criticized by professor Fred Halliday on several levels. He writes that the target of hostility in the modern era is not Islam and its tenets as much as it is Muslims and their actions, suggesting that a more accurate term would be """"Anti-Muslimism.""""[34] Poole responds by noting that many Islamophobic discourses attack what they perceive to be Islam's tenets, while Miles and Brown write that Islamophobia is usually based upon negative stereotypes about Islam which are then translated into attacks on Muslims.[35][36] Halliday also states that strains and types of prejudice against Islam and Muslims vary across different nations and cultures, which is not recognized in the Runnymede analysis. Miles and Brown respond by arguing that """"the existence of different ‘Islamophobias’ does not invalidate the concept of Islamophobia any more than the existence of different racisms invalidates the concept of racism.""""[35] Halliday argues that the concept of Islamophobia unwittingly plays into the hands of extremists.[34]
British writer and academic Kenan Malik believes that the charge of Islamophobia confuses discrimination against Muslims with criticism of Islam, and that it is used to silence critics and Muslim reformers. He writes that the extent to which Muslims are more vulnerable to social exclusion and attacks than other groups is frequently and allows for a culture of victimhood, where all failings are attributed to Islamophobia. Islamophobia is not a form of racism, in his view, because Islam is a belief system.[37] This analysis is criticized by Inayat Bunglawala from the Muslim Council of Britain and Abdul Wahid from the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir.[38] Bunglawala writes that Malik's argument is limited to overt acts of violence against Muslims, without recognizing less overt forms of prejudice or discrimination. By ignoring non-violent examples of Islamophobia, Malik's commentary """"makes a mockery of victims of prejudice by pretending they have not been discriminated against,"""" according to Bunglawala.[38]

In the wake of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, a group of 12 writers signed a statement in the French weekly satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in March 2006, warning against the use of the term Islamophobia to prevent criticism of """"Islamic totalitarianism"""". The novelist Salman Rushdie was among these signatories.[39] These views are shared by Dutch law professor Afshin Ellian.[40] Critics cite the case of British journalist Polly Toynbee, who was nominated in May 2003 for the title of """"Most Islamophobic Media Personality of the Year"""" at the 'Annual Islamophobia Awards' overseen by the Islamic Human Rights Commission, for claiming that Islam """"... imposes harsh regimes that deny the most basic human rights.""""[41]

In an article called """"Fighting Islamophobia: A Response to Critics"""", Assistant Professor Deepa Kumar writes that the modern-day demonization of Arabs and Muslims by US politicians and others is racist and Islamophobic, and employed in support of an unjust war. About the public impact of this rhetoric, she says that """"One of the consequences of the relentless attacks on Islam and Muslims by politicians and the media is that Islamophobic sentiment is on the rise."""" She also chides some """"people on the left"""" for using the same """"Islamophobic logic as the Bush regime"""". She concludes with the statement """"At times like this, people of conscience need to organize and speak out against Islamophobia.""""[42]
Johann Hari of The Independent has criticized the use of the term by organizations like Islamophobia Watch, arguing that liberal Muslims interested in reform are le",0

I'm thinking of the the same edit that I made.   No biggee, because this  FAQ sentence is a hypothetical question from somebody, not a statement, but these are my thoughts:

 Just a cc regarding the Blagojevich ITN 

Copied from my talk page, no response required

Hey folks, since there's two users in this talk I'll just thread this here.  I promoted it to ITN on the reasoning that the removal of a state executive is, IMO, notable whether the subject himself is or not (though I'd figure it is inherent).  Seemed obvious to me that this was more than Wikinews, which is why I skipped the discussion phase.

As to the portal, thanks for letting me know, I was not aware of the duplication being needed in the editing, I thought it was transcluded.  Learn something new every day ;)

And lastly, I still think that it should be on the main page.  While I can understand Spencer's logic in that it needs more information to make it encyclopedic and not just news, I personally don't think that anymore should or could be added to the article on the Blagojevich scandal at the time and it is a pretty descriptive article.

Hello  I loved your beginning section on social support and found the definition of social support to be very helpful in my understanding. However, your second paragraph was a little too wordy for my liking and difficult to remain interested. Also, in your third paragraph """"with these types of communication.."""" you did not mention any types of communication before, and therefore you cannot use these, until after explaining each type of communication.  Finally, I would suggested maybe making your points in your verbal/non-verbal method section bulleted. Overall, you added great information to our article, take my suggestions as you wish.   

Hello  You added some great information, I am just concerned that it is all from one source, or have you not quite finished adding your additional citations? I really love your choice of bolding and italicizing your guidelines, however guideline three is not separate from guideline two, nor is it bold/italic. Finally there us a Which, in your final guildline that should not be capitalized. Great work Meagan, take my advice as you wish.   

Hello  You have made some great additions to our article, especially the use of the General Adaptive Syndrome. However, in stage three, stressor is missing a letter (small typo). You had a great point of how inadequate sleep leads to irritability, however, I suggest that you change """"less inclined to communicate"""" to less inclined to communicate effectively. Also, in your section of language barrier, you used the word intercultural, I believe interlingual is a more suitable term as culture is not only defined by language. For instance citizens of Quebec, have Canadian culture despite speaking a different language than most Canadians. Finally, the point on imaginary friend, might be a little far-fetched, but it would be fine to leave if you see fit. Great work overall!

Concerning removal of a lead pic 
this has been pasted from talk page of  Elekkh:

Architecture 

Concerning your removal of one of the lead pic that was added today: I have been looking for an appropriate image that contrasted a modern city with the wide view of Florence.  

The two pictures (and their captions) refer, in one case, to the impact of a single architect and a single structure on a city and on architecture and the architect.   The second picture demonstrates very clearly the uniformity created by 20th century structures of the so-called International style.  Although in the body of the article, almost every building is individually notable,  and such is not the case in that picture, the picture demonstrates a significant trend in architecture.  

The article is not simply about significant buildings.   In each case, the significant buildings has been selected to demonstrate the aesthetics or principals of a wide region and era, or an architectural philosophy.  

I want to emphasise that the image of Florence Cathedral has not been selected simply on the grounds of it being a great representative work of architecture (like the Parthenon, St Peter's Basilica or the Taj Mahal). It is not simply an iconic building.  It is the building that launched the notion of the """"architect"""". 

The homogeneity of the Manhattan skyline is the antithesis of the image of Florence.  Read the two captions. I believe they make the point, without labouring it. 

  
I understood your intention, but still that image is not a good illustration of international style, neither is it a very good quality picture. T  

To say again what I said above:
""""The homogeneity of the Manhattan skyline is the antithesis of the image of Florence.  Read the two captions. I believe they make the point, without labouring it.""""  
While I agree that the image is not as high quality as it could be, the two images complement each other in terms of colour and appearance.   It is the picture of Lower Manhattan which in terms of colour and proportion fits best with the image of Florence. It includes the Twin Towers which were so much part of that landscape. 
And while I agree that the image may not show International style as well as an image of a single building might, it illustrates extremely well the affect of the style in transforming cities.  Lower Manhattan is """"iconic"""" in that regard.

"Thanks for the response, but, IMHO, it doesn't go to what is the problem with the statement.  The statement in the article presents it as a fact that Tesla was on the verge of destroying his own building with his resonance device until he stopped it with a sledge hammer.

Another thing, can anyone explain to me why the exact pronunciation is such an issue? Can you provide an example of any name in the Bible that English-speakers pronounce exactly like the ancient Hebrews?—Preceding unsigned comment added by 65.94.130.39

Where is the nice very articulate article information that was here a few months ago? Has all that info been erased? I suspect some vandalism based on POV is going on here.  

Because this type of format allows people to change info obviously those opposed to the use of Jehovah's name will take advantage of the oppurtunity to erase all mention of this name. But for all who will erase there will always be someone to write. It can work both ways.

 """"Today"""" section (or similar)

Response The question of whether one mathematical (or observational) structure stands in a certain relationship to another, or whether, given a structure and a set of relational constraints formulated with respect thereto, another structure satisfying those constraints can be generated or identified in polynomial time (in a number of steps expressible as as a polynomial function of the total number of structural elements), is not the question I'm asking here...although this question can easily be related to the questions that I am asking. 

For present purposes, we might as well define an """"intractable (scientific) paradox"""" as an apparent inconsistency which is agreed to exist by experts in the relevant field(s) of science, but which those experts have failed to conclusively and consensually resolve despite their protracted efforts to do so. (Such an inconsistency can be any of several kinds.) The question of whether such paradoxes owe to a """"lack of imagination"""" on the parts of the experts """"in almost all cases"""" is thus really about the creative competence of those experts. But although it would be possible to justify some fairly negative judgments along those lines, that's still not the question I'm asking here. 

The questions I'm asking here are (1) given such an inconsistency, can you resolve it without a metalanguage of the theory or theories (and data sets) which generate it, and (2) if you own that such a metalanguage is required, is this metalanguage - i.e., a language sufficient for the full expression of the interpretative mapping M:T<>U, where T stands for a (scientific) theory and U stands for the observable universe of that theory - necessarily scientific in nature? That is, in and of itself, does such a metalanguage necessarily involve observational applications of the scientific method (as opposed to the axiomatic method)?

You go on to discuss the UV catastrophe. As we all know, the UV catastrophe was """"resolved"""" by the quantization of light, ultimately leading to the development of quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, there remains a problem with quantum mechanics: the formalism observably corresponds to reality only at limited junctures. The questions of if and how the rest of it corresponds to observable reality remain matters of widespread confusion, and have led to several conflicting interpretations of QM which are necessarily expressed in a """"philosophical"""" metalanguage of QM (which can itself be cast as a metalanguage of classical mechanics). If one of these interpretations is ever refined to the extent that it can generate new falsifiable predictions, it will become """"scientific"""". But until then, we're stuck with philosophical (observationally unfalsifiable) interpretations.

You have already identified """"imagination"""" as important in the resolution of scientifc paradoxes. This alone casts doubt on the notion that there exists any algorithm generating a valid resolution in every case. However, you still seem to believe that there is a set of principles which can be used to conclusively identify such resolutions once they are given, and more generally, to quickly and superficially distinguish between valid and invalid resolutions. Prior to encountering you, the Hillman agent, and certain others here at Wikipedia, I hadn't known of any such principles. I am therefore asking you to share these principles - as opposed to the biases, hunches, rules of thumb, and other voodoo on which others have relied - with the rest of world. 

Can you do this? Thanks,  """,0

 Message to you, Mr Wales 

There are people I unequivocally despise. They lack morals, character, and honesty. They crush the remaining vestiges of democracy throughout the world. In case you can't tell, I'm talking about Mr. Jimbo Wales here. Let me cut to the chase: Wales says that everyone would be a lot safer if he were to monitor all of our personal communications and financial transactions—even our library records. Why on Earth does Wales need to monitor our library records? In classic sophist fashion, I ask another question in reply: Will Wales's shots to the heart of all that is wholesome buy him his long-sought victory for feckless charlatanism with its showy irreverence and glorification of all that is temeritous? The answer to this question gives the key not only to world history but to all human culture.

The next time someone says that Wales's analects enhance performance standards, productivity, and competitiveness, look that person right in the eye and reply, """"Wales is profoundly hostile to religious tolerance, democracy, and the notion of a secular civil society."""" I plan to hone in on his faults with laser-like precision. This is a choice I have made; your choice is up to you. But let me remind you that when Wales says that he has a fearless dedication to reason and truth, that's just a load of spucatum tauri. It is our responsibility to ensure that he doesn't lock all the exits from our present state to the world of constructive reason. I state these facts only to give a bit of personal background as to why I fully intend to stop the Huns at the gate. That's the path that I have chosen. It's definitely not an easy path, but then again, Wales somehow manages to get away with spreading lies (society is supposed to be lenient towards impudent blackguards), distortions (his randy coalition is a respected civil-rights organization), and misplaced idealism (our elected officials should be available for purchase by special-interest groups). However, when I try to respond in kind, I get censored faster than you can say """"predisadvantageously"""".

Carnaptious primates are born, not made. That dictum is as unimpeachable as the """"poeta nascitur, non fit"""" that it echoes and as irreproachable as the brocard that when I hear Wales say that doing the fashionable thing is more important than life or liberty, I have to wonder about him. Is he entirely bitter? Is he simply being mawkish? Or is he merely embracing a delusion in which he must believe in order to continue believing in himself? If you were to ask that of Wales, he'd certainly fling a large barrage of insults in your direction instead of actually addressing the question. He has spent untold hours trying to make empty promises. During that time, did it ever once occur to him that his strictures are a mockery of all that is fair and equitable? Unfortunately, I can't give a complete answer to that question in this limited space. But I can tell you that his tracts are not our only concern. To state the matter in a few words, unlike everyone else in the world, he seriously believes that ethical responsibility is merely a trammel of earthbound mortals and should not be required of a demigod like him. Woo woooo! Here comes the clue train. Last stop: Wales. And that's it. Mr. Jimbo Wales is doing the very thing for which he criticizes others.   """,0

 Recap 

I decided to withhold further comment until I had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision. I am delaying a trip this morning so that I can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion.

Your supporting statement for deletion is as follows: 

""""The result was Delete. The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm, and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted. The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic, and I have counted those opinions as being from User:Julie Dancer. Kevin (talk) """"

As for """"The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm..."""" 
In reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance.  Within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by  at  that other algorithms exist, namely Examples of relevant works are """"A Fast, Bottom-Up Decision Tree Pruning Algorithm with Near-Optimal Generalization"""" and """"An Efficient Algorithm For Optimal Pruning Of Decision Trees"""". which are capable of performing the function the article title names:

If this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.

In anticipation of these other algorithms being added I immediately changed the body of the text to read """"The algorithm used for this purpose..."""" to """"One algorithm used for this purpose..."""" Since I do not now have access to the article's history as the result of your deletion I can not give you the exact date and time. However, it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. (Incidentally, it has been suggested by a Professor at Cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.)

Normally as a Wikipedia user I would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the Wikipedia was setup this way. The Wikipedia still claims to be """"...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.""""  

The impression I have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. They simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the Wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. Instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection, especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves. 

As for """"...references not supporting the notability of the subject"""" 
You can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like """"Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted."""" All of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which I deferred. Just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. I know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.

As for """"The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic... 
This shows you did not read or comprehend the response I made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it. I explained that each of the user names were created so that I could track the use of my own resources better, similar to the need on the part of the Wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user. Eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots, but currently I am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the Wikipedia and mining it off line.

Since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w",0

 I'm short of time at the moment, and a lot of the policy and guideline pages have had their content shuffled around, but here is a recent template deletion discussion that illustrates some of the problems with SourceWatch as a reliable source. Beyond issues of bias, the main reason that open wikis are not allowed as reliable sources is that one can never guarantee what is going to appear on the screen at any given random time, when the source page is loaded. It could be good info, or it could be """"POOP"""". That is the main reason that Wikipedia is not allowed to source itself, and the principle holds for all wikis. As to the Drudge issue, I think that the arguments presented on Talk:George Soros in opposition to including well-sourced criticism from Bill O'Reilly apply here, and Eleemosynary was a strong opponent of including that information in the Soros article. The O'Reilly criticism is nowhere near as harsh and derogatory as the piece I removed from Drudge. O'Reilly is certainly more notable (as is his opinion) than the NYPress author.

"Hi Neuromancer,

You will never get anywhere with the likes of Keepcalmandcarryon, Mastcell, Nunh-huh, etc. Going into the archives of some of the articles here on AIDS and HIV, I found that some of these people have been working, full-time it seems, on keeping these pages biased for years, and that they don't allow any edits which provide alternative information to the orthodox theory that HIV=AIDS, or anyone attached to these theories. They can be illogical, bullying, they will name-call, they will call any persons with honest questions denialists, and they will use any and every strategy no matter how ugly to keep these pages the way they want them to read. They don't allow edits they don't like to stay up for more than 30 minutes, and their tactic is to bully and threaten people until they give up. Of course people do give up, because they become exhausted and worn down as nothing they try to correct will stay up. Interestingly enough, some of these people also police pages on subjects such as Aspartame and alternative medicine. It's frightening how the AIDS orthodoxy doesn't want the public to know the facts. Most horrifying is the effect on AIDS patients themselves, who have the right to know everything there is to know and to make their own choices. I'd be interested to know your uncle's history, whether he was taking AIDS medications, what AIDS-related disease he actually died from, etc. AIDS has turned into a fear campaign - they give you a death sentence, and tell patients that if they stop the drugs that they will die.

"Re sockpuppetry, I'd say it as unproved rather than false. I have said before (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Socialized_medicine#KBORER_.2FFREEDOMWARRIOR_-) , its not that difficult to run two IDs from two IP addresses even if the IP address points to different geographical locations. The main evidence for my claim came from the way the two editors behave and interact and in particular their edit breaks ... they both seem to take edit breaks from WP at the same time! The period before Christmas and the last two weeks have been more recent examples but the same pattern was observed throughout 2007. 

Re the contested edit. I'm not really bothered about the inclusion or otherwise of this edit. Its about a parallel issue. I did add it back because I know that if I didn't then someone else surely will. Its an interesting observation and in my view a true one. The discussion has decended into one of semantics about wealthy and industrialized that I'd rather not get into. The other editors are doing a good job battling that one out. I just have a gut feeling that the U.S. is in a different league economically from China though I would accept that this is changing fast. It is odd that China, socialist country, does not guarantee health care for all its citizens. It does for many, but not for all. As far as I recall it had more to do with the government being unwilling to pay doctors enough to persuade them to work in the rural areas. They can earn more in the wealthier cities. Urbanisation and industrial might is now the thing that is motoring the Chinese economy so failing to support rural areas may be deliberate government policy. I am not a China watcher so I can't really say.",0

 Notable != Important 

Hello, . Please don't use the word """"important"""" when talking about notability, as you did at WP:HD#Zeeshan haider. In this case it probably doesn't matter, because the issue is that the article doesn't make a claim of notability. But when an article is deleted (or rejected) because the subject is not notable, new users often come back with something like """"How can you say X isn't important?!"""" The answer is that that isn't what we're saying: 'notable' has a technical meaning in Wikipedia, and does not mean 'important', 'influential', 'popular', or any of the other things that people might interpret it as being in the normal sense.

For an example where I made this point, and another editor took me to task for nitpicking, and then came back and apologised when he saw a new user make exactly that misinterpretation, see User talk:ColinFine/Archive 1#Your comment.   """,0

it is inarguable you're trying to improve the exposure lesser-known bands, whose musical merits are FAR inferior to Elton John's. That is not how music works. I have never ever seen someone post cover art of covering artists' album. it is unheard of and rude. it is the only page for which i have ever seen this, and clearly it is your prerogative to promote Ben Folds and other horrible bands.
The bottom line is that Elton John is a LEGEND, and I think what you're doing is no different than someone posting cover art for a boyband cover of a Beatles song; you would be eviscerated if you did something like that for a Beatles single, and I don't see why such evisceration should be spared when you're insulting arguably one of the best musicians in the past 50 years. Do not argue about whether this is an encyclopedia, argue the merit for why the cover art of inferior artists whose musical merit is far far far below that of the ORIGINAL artist. You can't, because you know they are inferior. instead you're using a BS """"freedom of information"""" argument to ruin the appeal of a great song. No one covers a song better than the original artist. For example: Oasis' cover of Street Fighting Man is unbelievable, but I would NEVER EVER go to the Rolling Stones' """"Street Fighting Man"""" single page and post Oasis' cover art, even though their merit is much closer to the Stones than Ben Folds is to Elton John.

 First, the unnamed first poster writes, """"...written by someone who almost certainly doesn't even know her personally.""""  More likely, it was written by a bunch of different persons, not just one person, who doesn't know her personally.  I would suspect at approx. 99% of articles found on Wikipedia about famous persons were written entirely by persons who did not personally know the person about whom they were writing.  How many people who contributed to the John Lennon page actually know John Lennon?  How many people who contributed to the Kurt Cobain page actually knew Kurt Cobain?
 Secondly,  writes, """"Delete all that about Hailie bc you KNOW Eminem would not want it here.""""  It is irrelevant what Mr. Mathers would want here or not.  I'm sure George W. Bush doesn't want certain things written on his Wikipedia page.  Wikipedians are not in the business of making everyone feel comfy, but rather simply to provide objective information.
 Thirdly,  writes, """"When Eminimemem gets time he will write a good article...""""  I don't know if you're joking here or being serious.

 Re. Please advise. 

Hello Mareklug. Well, I believe that your request at WP:RFPP might have been declined due to the fact that the edit war was just starting and there was thus insufficient information of a full scale edit war that would have surely resulted in full protection to the article (by the way, that's how we call it: we don't """"block"""" articles, we """"protect"""" them). If the edit war continues, then do relist your request at WP:RFPP. It will likely to be accepted. I also have to agree that you might have failed to control yourself sometimes, when in the face of your opponent Tocino. Edit warring is never a good choice, as it only worsens a dispute and can indeed grant blocks to both of you (although I think that a topic ban would be quite an unlikely/draconian measure, you're not causing that much trouble as far as I see). My suggestion is, when Tocino (or any other user) makes an edit that you strongly disagree with, refrain from reverting right away and instead, summon the other party to the talk page. Then two things may happen: either he joins the discussion so you can both argue your points of view, or he doesn't join the discussion and provides you with a good reason for requesting an administrator's intervention against his unilateral actions.

We made a compromise with Whitesnake, but there really doesn't have to be a compromise because these articles are technically correct already. There's got to be a bit of give and take. Also, racing drivers and teams all have British licences, not English / Scottish / Welsh etc, so you're right to change the Scottish ones to British, but not the British ones to English. The motor racing admins usually just block people who do that, to be honest.   """,0

 Possible narrowing of US racial gap 
The article currently contains the following text and in image:
""""Dickens and Flynn write in their 2006 paper Black Americans reduce the racial IQ gap: Evidence from standardization samples that blacks have gained five or six IQ points compared to non-Hispanic whites between 1972 and 2002. Gains have been fairly uniform across the entire range of black cognitive ability.[28] J. Philippe Rushton and Arthur R. Jensen have disputed Dickens's and Flynn's findings, calculating a mean gain for Blacks of zero to 3.44 IQ points, and questioned the exclusion of four independent tests that showed low or negative IQ gains.[33] However, in the very same 2006 study that was criticized by Rushton and Jensen, Flynn and Dickens give explicit reasons for why four tests were excluded. Rushton and Jensen include in test such as the AFQT which is not strictly an IQ tests and their inclusion of Herrnstein and Murray's AFQT data was criticized by Flynn and Dickens. Rushton and Jensen derive the figure of a 3.44 IQ point gain by adding data from four excludes tests to Table A1 while Flynn and Dickens' figure of a 5.5 IQ gain for black Americans was derived from Figure 3 in the study.[34]""""

Similarity to """"Boy Kings""""
Section on similarity between this book and The Boy Kings was deleted. The facts in question are easily verified. What was the reason for this deletion?
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

Re: the two flags: on notability, the book has received substantial media attention. See, for example, http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323342404579081503189753492.html

In addition, the author himself is critically acclaimed (see his page).

On sources, Amazon is a credible source for the topic in question, the relative contents of two books. The Twitter sources are necessary given that 1. Twitter is the topic being discussed (specifically: discussions on Twitter about the book), and 2. the issue is new and has not yet been written about in mainstream publications. These sources can be improved as additional information and media coverage becomes available which is likely given the high profile of the author, the ongoing media attention to the book, and the fact that The Circle will soon be released.
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

If it's easily verified, it shouldn't be hard to find secondary sources to support it.   

Agreed, that is a fair point, though it will only be easy to do so if sufficient time has passed for secondary sources to pick up on it which they haven't yet. It was only a matter of hours ago that the alleged victim of plagiarism was made aware of the details of the book in question (The Circle) and therefore able to point out the similarities. In the coming days it is likely to receive more attention. The female author in question has upward of 1,500 Twitter followers and a well-received book on Amazon and the other comments on Twitter corroborating her interpretation also come from prominent Tweeters. While I am a Wikipedia novice, it does not seem that this is an unusually suspect story to report in somewhat-real-time versus other pages that are rapidly updated, and to reiterate, it is very obvious from reading the respective Amazon pages that there are myriad similarities between the books and it is only a matter of time before this is picked up.
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

Update: a secondary source is now available. Updating accordingly. 
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

I see your edit was removed by a bot. I don't think it's impossible that there might surface secondary sources to support this part of the article, but these aren't them. Tweets are generally considered unsuitable, which is why bots remove them. And that Medium post isn't a suitable source either. 1) it's written by the person who is theoretically the aggrieved party in this case, 2) Medium is basically a self-publishing platform, like Livejournal, and doesn't really qualify as a secondary source, especially in the case of a potentially contentious allegation like this.   

Let's not let this plagiarism flap stand in the way of making this a better article.  It could use a lot of improvement.  My personal opinion is that the plagiarism claim (which amounts to """"I wrote a book about a woman hired by a social networking firm, and any similar books are plagiarism"""") should not be included in the article anyway, in the absence of a lawsuit or settlement.  So let's get some interesting stuff about the book in there.  For one thing, Margaret Atwood reviewed the book at length. 70.114.146.227  Eric""",0

"The 'arguments' above consist of reiteration. I also disagree that there are significant differences between anime and animation; certainly the latter covers a far wider stylistic range and anime could be described as a subset derived from the development of particular forms of mass production (which are also found in animation from other countries, whether the USA, Korea, or anywhere else making significant amounts for the mass market); this definition would exclude Miyazaki (who, indeed, excludes himself, unlike his western fans). Likewise men in monster suits and miniature work are hardly unique to a particular national tradition. Yes, the Ultraman tradition represents as much of a speciality as Marvel/DC superheroes, and certainly deserves a specific article, but this is not the same as Tokusatu. Ergo, Tokusatu is not a genre. 
 should not be so quick to assume what people do and don't know about; my original comment may have been sharp but was in response to an I-will-not-be-questioned tone, and I certainly know enough to contribute to this article.

There are two FeloniousMonk's!

One must be a sockpuppet. I edited the intro to say:

The canonical definition of the Discovery Institute's Intelligent Design is that Intelligent Design (sometimes abbreviated ID) is the controversial assertion that certain features of the universe and of living things exhibit the characteristics of a product resulting from an intelligent cause or agent, as opposed to an unguided process such as natural selection. Intelligent Design is wholly a product of the Discovery Institute, a conservative Christian think tank. The idea has been around since 1990.

Just like FeloniousMonk said above:

The canonical definition of intelligent design, which is the one offered by the Discovery Institute (""""that certain features of the universe and of living things exhibit the characteristics of a product resulting from an intelligent cause or agent, as opposed to an unguided process such as natural selection"""") Since ID is wholly a product of the Discovery Institute, with every leading ID proponent is one of its Fellows and every campaign and strategy arising from its offices, defining ID as they do is necessary in the intro for any of the claims made in the article by Dembski, Behe or Johnson to make any sense. Any intro that ignores the canonical definition is deficient.

"""The title refers to remarks Hickey had repeatedly made on prior visits to Harry's bar about his wife having a fling with the ice man while he was on the road.

(Then again in 1938 the Cole Porter song My Heart Belongs to Daddy seems to make a subtle reference to cunnilingus (.. to dine on my fine finnan haddie .. asking for more .. etc) without any adverse results.)  There is harsh irony in this since it appears that the opposite is the case, that Hickey's wife was totally faithful and endlessly forgiving of his womanizing and drinking sprees.  This surfeit of virtue creates such self-hatred in Hickey and anger at his wife that he is ultimately driven to kill her to end their common pipe dream that each of his indiscretions will be the last.

"Nice to meet you, 92.xx. You ask some very good questions. I'll be glad to answer them. -)
One of my great passions in life is learning about a broad variety of different topics: computer sciences, physics in a general sense, world history, geography, biological life, etc. But above all else, I am extremely passionate about human rights. In the most general sense, I support freedom for everyone, regardless of their life situation. With regards to most of the causes that I support, not only have I taken the time to read about them on the side, but I've also followed news developments pertaining to them very closely. For example, I oppose the ruling family of Saudi Arabia because of their hardline Islamist ideology and authoritarian methods. To start with, I consider Saudi Arabia guilty of gender apartheid against its women, who aren't even allowed to leave the house without wearing an abaya and being in the company of a male consort. It's the only country in the world where women are not permitted to drive. They are also known for severely discriminating against expatriate workers from throughout Asia and Africa, abuses against the Shiite community in the Eastern Province, and publicly beheading people for nonviolent offences — they literally still perform executions on charges of witchcraft and sorcery.
And that's just the tip of the iceberg in a laundry list of reasons why I detest the Saudi monarchy. What makes it worse is the fact that there doesn't seem to be any outrage over their human rights record, which deeply troubles me.
Granted, I don't think Saudi Arabia is a controversial state to denounce. Some of the ones I've listed are no-brainers to most people: a free Burma, the end of totalitarianism in North Korea, etc. But then there's the more divisive issues, such as Kosovar independence or the Syrian civil war. I have been following the latter since before the uprising even began in March 2011; already very familiar with the human rights situation in Syria, I was fully anticipating the Arab Spring to arrive there sooner or later. I also knew it would be far more complicated than any other Arab country, if for no other reason than for the fact that it has a society divided along sectarian lines. I support the downfall of Bashar al-Assad. I believe that he and his regime have committed large-scale crimes against humanity for the sake of retaining power (yes, I do think he deployed sarin gas in Ghouta). However, unlike many others, I do not see opposition to Assad as being mutually exclusive from opposition to al-Qaeda and its affiliates, including its Syrian branch Al-Nusra. They too have committed atrocities, specifically against the Christians and Alawites. The long and short of it is, I support a free, democratic, and secular Syria. Easier said than done, but it never hurts to be optimistic. Now, Kosovo is an entirely different story. The region has a very complicated history, especially during the existence of Yugoslavia as an independent state. I'll spare you the lengthy explanation of the context, the situation after the breakup of Yugoslavia, the guerrilla war conducted by the terroristic Kosovo Liberation Army against ethnic Serbs, the resulting ethnic cleansing campaign against the Kosovar Albanians conducted by the regime of Slobodan Milosevic, the UN presence in Kosovo, the 2008 declaration of independence, etc. All you need to know, as it pertains to my support of Kosovar independence, is the fact that the vast majority of people in Kosovo support it. Everything else is immaterial to me; it's what the people want that I care about. The issue of Kosovar Serbs should be resolved through negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo. Those are just two examples of my less popular stances.
Asperger's Syndrome is considered a pervasive developmental disorder on the autism spectrum. At its most basic, you could say it is simply a mind form of autism — but that in itself would be a drastic oversimplification of what is a very unique condition. Every case is different, and I have a particularly mild diagnosis. Most people would never guess that there was anything different about me. It's more in the negative way that I would oftentimes interpret subtle nuances of socialization. For example, if I overheard two people having a conversation and discerned my name, I'd get nervous and assume that",0

"Dammit people, at least let me talk. I believe Thrindel is not editing these pages on the interest of creating a neutral page that informs about all aspects of this comic and its creator. By checking his history and that of these pages you can see that he quickly and simply removes any criticism about either. His knowledge of wikipedia's rules seems to be extensive, but then why have they only edited pages relating to CAD? The nature of his edits, as it has been said, smacks of self interest. I really don't see the need for proving that he is who he is, but it is pretty obvious. For example, posting that he is Buckley on his user talk page will get you banned from the cad forums and Buckley's blog. I'll save you some time Tim, you've already banned this IP.  And this isn't hard to believe since he claims to make a living off income from his comic. For example, in this talk page he suggested that the fact that there are CAD gamer pictures available on xbox live. Those cost money, which means someone is making money. This is not article worthy and the thought of using wikipedia for free advertising would just be low. Ask people a million times to buy them on the cad site, but not here. When money is involved it's completely understandable for him to try and quell any criticism within his power, but this is wikipedia, not a fan site, and defiantly not a site to be edited by the creator of the comic. Leave this page to be edited by the rest of the world to edit. In conclusion, I believe there is an obvious user bias here.

 Response to Skinwalker's personal attack on  via a RFC  

Hi

This is a response to 's RFC on .

Rather than straight talking language, some folk prefer to use clever legalistic attacks on individuals such as the way that  is using on .

In the context of the Wiki, this is an ad hominem where his intellectual powers failed to persuade the consensus on the discussion page.

 failed to get his way with regard to muddying of the waters with anorexia just as   had done previously with the met industry's pollution. So what happened her is they conspired to attack  with the use of a meatpuppet called   employing all the trick they can like making false allegation, lying, official complaints and so on.

I would like to point out that in British English the word nark is non-pejorative and I understand that it has an objective meaning something akin to a """" snitch """" in American. That is, meaning someone that makes, often erroneous, allegations to authorities in order to personally benefit themselves in some way. It is certianly a lot less intentionally insulting than to be continuously called a meatpuppet or, I am sure, for user Canaen to be accused of having some connection with me when he has none.

The funniest thing for me is that  is busy digging a hole in his own canoe because his allegations are outright lies of which he can in no way substantiate.

This conflict started because  insisted on posting data refering to anorexics on the Vegan topic which had no relationship to veganism whatsoever.

 is entirely wrong. I know this because I know who I am and I know with whom I have and have had connections and I take a very minor little offence at being accused by the likes of you of being something I am not. I state """" very minor little offence """" because you and your views genuinely are so unimportant. 

  is an individual of very little decency and integrity. I do not state this as an insult but as an objective statement.   has been told on many occasions that I have no connection with this or the other individuals and yet he not only continue to go on making such allegations but   even uses them as the ground to make an attack on another individual.
 

This is where   boasts to Canaen he has made a complaint about him on Canaen user page ;

User conduct RFC

Please be advised that I have filed a user conduct RFC on you.  It can be found  here.  Cheers,  

This is where I - as one of the erroneiously accused """" meatpuppets """" respond ;

Just out of interest, who do you think this nark  is and why is he so motivated to go about doing what he is doing? I put this record up in the open for you and them to see because I have no and have had no connection with you nor any of the journal pages and, frankly, I take offence at being called a meat or sockpuppet of yours when I am not. I am sure that you are just or even more upset as being accused of a connection with me when you have none.

Unfortunately though, that is the depth of 's lies and the shallowness of 's integrity. 

 Where he has no grounds he invents them and he is, oh, so clever at playing WikiTricks with all these technical terms and methods. 

I am starting to feel like a Jew in Nazi Germany being hunted down, connected to individuals which I have no connection with and their so-called crimes and accused of crimes which are not mine. 

And what of ? He just seems to get off on throwing around his weight whilst avoiding entering into the actually factual discussion.

For the record - and let them love every minute of their persecution syndrome, let them avidly copy and paste and make little weblinks to this as they are so good at Wikitricks - I am a vegan of 20 years or more standing and, arguably, MacDonald of Clanranald. I became involved in editing the vegan article before you returned to it recently.

 Russia (and Ukranian) forces completely vacate the Transnistrian territory, that is all arms, all troops, and raze all arms depots to the ground.

after every Russian in the PMR authorities is out (as in out, and out of the country);
after the foreign troops are all out (as in out of the country, and their arms depots demolished)and I don't mean Russian military retiring to become """"citizens of the PMR,"""" either;
after it is legal for a political party to be pro-Moldovan (that currently being treason); and
after Romanian is once again taught in its proper Latin script, not in some Cyrillic Soviet-era utter bastardization created purely to support the Stalinist fiction that Moldovans are not Romanians.

 Okay, all of you listen to me very carefully. I'm hereby making my case that Larry was a Category 4 Cyclone (at very least) on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. Unlike some of you, I've taken the time to check out the FACTS for myself. If another one of you reverts my edits I will dissociate myself from WikiProject Tropical Cyclones indefinitely. 
Here's my comparative table for all of you to have a nice, long look at ). If you ignore this reasoning, I'll just have to call you names:

 Characteristic Saffir-Simpson Cat 4 Cyclone Larry Central pressure 920-944 mbar 915! mbar when landfall made Potential damages """"More extensive curtainwall failures with some complete roof structure failure on small residences. Major erosion of beach areas. Terrain may be flooded well inland."""" 55% of all buildings in Innisfail damaged. Entire banana crop and some of sugarcane crop demolished. Rooves stripped of countless buildings; some buildings flattened entirely. Extensive flooding. Universal power outages, sewage system fails. Airports closed for the day. Storm surge4.0–5.5 m5.0m 1-minute average sustained winds210-245 kph Unknown, with gusts frequently exceeding 280kph. Conclusion Larry is indeed a category 4 cyclone at the very least.

The newspaper cuttings can be found in date order at Press Cuttings, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton. There are no paqe numbers. In the Michael Aldrich article other references are also used. There are three central claims - he invented an online shopping system[he actually claims to have invented online shopping, which I left for peer review],Thomson Holidays 1981 was the first recorded B2B and Gateshead SIS/Tesco was the first B2C with the world's first recorded online shopper. For the first claim I found 4 sources in the Press Cuttings plus of course Aldrich's own claims. For the second there are also 4 sources, one peer reviewed. For the third, there is a peer reviewed source and a TV interview by Lawrence McGinty, an acclaimed UK science reporter, broadcast on Independent Television News in the UK in 1984.
In looking at the sources common-sense is needed. Aldrich's teleshopping systems received a very sceptical welcome. HiFi systems were the big news in 1980.

There are two problems  with Jza84's sumarizing language and overall conception of this page.  First, in terms of dividing territory geographically, there is no """"merely"""" involved.  Territorial division is a serious and often deadly issue.  Moreover, Brits tend to be more tolerant of the mixing of cultural, ethnicity, and legal issues because they live without a written constitution.  Jsa84 could learn from this attitude.  The second revealing problem with Jsa84's language is that Jsa84 underscores geographically as if this modifier is going to clarify anything. The discpline of geography is made up of several branches and, until you specify whether you mean political geography or other kinds of geography, you haven't resolved anythingyou haven't even begun.  This page is one of the more inconsisent pages available, and not just internally, but in relation to other pages that deal with consitutional and cultural issues in the United Kingdom.  I recommend that Jza84 begin to accept the help of others in the Wikipedia community.  Otherwise, these pages will continue to look confused.  Dylan Hunt

 Query 

I suppose I should have taken the point better when you made it here. This is neither a challenge, a complaint, nor a whine, or an attempt to """"gotcha"""" but a ood–faith question and a related comment on which I'd like your observations.
Question: John Bapst Memorial High School 2005 was nominated — not by me — and subsequently deleted yesterday under A7. (I think that's the one, not being a sysop — ahem () — I can't go back to look to make sure.) The entire text of the article was something like, """"Composed of people born in 1986 and 1987. Said to be the best class to ever graduate from this school."""" As I understand from the discussions at Talk:CSD, an indication of importance or significance is credible if it is plausible, even if it is vague and unsupported. That school's class of 2005 could, in fact, have been the best to graduate from that school in many different ways: highest GPA, most athletic championships, fewest teenage pregnancies, or in a 5–year retrospect, most graduates to be admitted to Ivy League schools. None of that is, of course, probably what the creator meant, which was probably nothing more than chauvinistic chest–thumping (but we must AGF). Was that an indication of importance or significance such that the article should not have been A7 nominated or deleted on that basis?
Comment: If I were to start declining A7 speedy noms by strictly applying the criteria you set out at my RfA nomination, viz """"A7 simply does not apply if there is any credible indication of importance or significance"""", then I have the suspicion that at my next RfA nomination, if I choose to try again (and your responses here may help me decide whether or not I will do so), that I may have a hoard of opposers claiming that I'm perverting the CSD process by glibly dismissing valid CSD nominations. I'm concerned that by working on CSD nominations at all that I'm stuck between the battle lines drawn by the deletionists and the inclusionists. If I have any remaining desire for the mop, wouldn't it be better to just avoid CSD altogether?

I suspect that in the end we may need to seek external help to decide whether some details are to be included. But if we have a process which can lead to a decision, that's a definite improvement.

Arbitrary break for my reply
but if we really can't say that with our own experience from watching the show then we should remove the rest of """"such and such is based off of the character such and such from the original version"""" (at least for every character but the main three, maybe)

You're totally right with this, and I hadn't noticed that this was noted for other characters.  For now we should pull it. But I think eventually we'll see reviews and interviews noting the comparisons we've made.   But unfortunately, per the  original research policy we can't make those statements based on our own observations.  It's really frustrating sometime when something is so obvious but it prevents more problems than it causes.  Keeping the main three shouldn't be an issue; the show runners have talked about the one-to-one comparison to their UK counterparts in interviews.  It's something I've been meaning to go looking for (the articles where they've talked about how they are similar and different from the originals) but haven't had a chance to do yet.  This sort of thing is always an issue on list of character articles -  they tend to get updated with plot summary and very little else.  But as the show progresses there will be more material to drop in so that the article isn't so in-universe and has more real world info.

But would you still remove my edits if I added that information to the casting section?

If we can find the links to back up the comparisons, absolutely not.  I think it will be great info to provide once we have our sources.  It's exactly the kind of thhing I mean by real world info (casting the roles, how they are changed from originals by creators, how actors interpret the scenes and characters).  

Actually what I gave in my first reply wasn't plot summaries, but character summaries. 

That was actually a reference to an edit that came after yours.  Someone added waaay too much plot detail in there and I was reverting past two people's edits.  Since the lines for our edit summaries are so short, I find it hard to be clear about that sometimes.  

And while unsourced original research, it was from my experience of watching every season and  episode of the UK show so far and doing the same pretty much with the American one. I hate things like this where it's true but you have a hard time finding something that confirms it's true due to Wikipedia's standards. 

I know exactly what you mean.  It drives me bonkers sometimes.  I like to drove myself nuts last year looking for this little bit I remembered from an interview about an actor on True Blood.  But it really does prevent more problems than it causes.  Imagine if every person who had an off the wall interpretation of a scene came in and said """"well this bit reminded me of this thing in another thing so clearly the other thing was an inspiration.""""  

No need to make this personal. But if I really did come across that way I'm sorry, because I didn't mean to.

Not personal at all; no worries.  I just figured you undid before you saw  my reply to you here.  My edit summary probably seemed more blunt than I meant it because, again, trying to explain the reversion of more than one edit.  And I do waaay too much recent changes patrolling which seems to lead to a severe truncating of verbage in edit summaries.  I probably seem like a stark raving butthead half the time when I'm just trying to be brief.  I think you have great instincts about the type of stuff we'll want to include on the article.  We just have to find the articles to back up the info.  There's not going to be a lot out there yet because it's the first season but it'll be awesome if we can start getting the article overhauled with this kind of stuff right away.  I follow the UK version's article and a few other list of character articles that have been going on for years with just updates to plot summary and no real world stuff.  So now it's particularly overwhelming a thought to try and fix them.  The True Blood characters page is my personal nightmare.  I'll get around to it?

One thing I've been looking for is an article I read just before the premiere that talked about changes made to the three main characters.  I vaguely recall that it had some quotes from the writers and a couple of the actors (I think Witwer mentioned something about watching the UK version).

@AynHaylo The Aramean movement is based on our real heritage and history, which forms this strong foundation!

BTW we are actually known as Süryaniler in Turkish and as Syrianin in Arabic, both words mean Syrians, but refer to the Aramaic-speaking Christians. In Arabic you have two words for Syrian, but with different meanings. Moreover, the bible clearly distinguish between Syrians (Arameans) and Assyrians. Syrian is the Greek word for Aramean and this word was adopted by the Arameans in their mother tongue and they have called themselves Suryoye since then. I don't care about what other people call us.

The idea is to have a summary version of what should be covered more extensively on the Samsung Electronics page.
I have supplied two reliable sources in English, but the summaries I provided of those have been altered in a manner that deprives the reader of important information, so there is a need to discuss that. 
Further, the quote, """"it had not interfered with any online product evaluation report and had stopped online marketing campaigns involving posting or responding to messages in online forums"""" is not a quote from Samsung but a quote from the source indirectly reciting what Samsung said on its Facebook page without quoting Samsung. So it is misleading in its present form, as it appears to be a quote from Samsung. The other source, meanwhile, does directly quote (in quotation marks) a portion of the statement made by Smasung on its Facebook page. 連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0

CC vs RCC

""""The points you make, replete with the claims of injustice and oppression (despite the fact that there are several Roman Catholic editors who support the current name or don't care about the issue one way or the other) have all been made before, as Archive 7 above will reveal in all its prolix glory.  I invite you to read it if, for nothing else, the strange sense of deja vu it will likely inspire in you, as it does in me. Cheers."""" 

This it the type of patronizing rhetoric I've received from what I consider at this point, outwardly Anti-Catholic editors in this site.  I know there is a good faith policy, sure, but the repeated disrespect and blatantly forward condescending attitude is just too obvious to conclude anything less.  

I am aware you have supported the change of the article for the proper name """"Catholic Church"""" in the past.  I am determined to have our voice heard again and have this issue reviewed and hopefully repealed.  However, there is no way I can do this myself, I need you help and anyone else that may assist us.  (by the way where the due process ?)

My most significant points for change are found in the one of my latest post as follows:

 """"1)Using a geographic description in addition to the title of a Church has to be one of the poorest excuses. What is not understood is that regardless of additional descriptive properties """"Catholic"""" Church IS the common title of the Petrine Church in the equivalent manner as """"Anglican"""" Church is the common title of the Church of England...regardless of any descriptive meanings of the words """"Catholic or Anglican"""". If anything it proves how inappropriate it is to impose an extrinsic adjective upon an institution that is not titled in such a manner. If that is allowed then where does it end. Why not add to the Greek the Athenian Orthodox Church, or say London Anglican Church since the symbolic head of the Anglican communion resides there.

2)Since """"Catholic Church"""" is NOT a description, but the title of the lone Church titled as such, by far, historically, in the present and by the world at large it deserves to be title as such. It is not ambiguous, Anglicans do not say they are going to the Catholic Church, do they? Thus, no point in pulling out the ambiguity alibi Also, the article describes one Church, it is not a comparative study of several churches, no confusion to be entertained.

3)The personal ignorance of a Catholic which refers to himself as Roman Catholic is not an excuse to go by such a term. Many of these same Catholics are the same ignorant Catholics that think Catholics of other rites are not real Catholics. Thus, ignorance is no reason, if any a reason for proper education.

4)The listing of a Parish as Roman Catholic is reference to the Rite not the Church at large(albeit slang, where """"Roman"""" is interchanged for """"Latin"""") just as Byzantine Catholic churches are frequently listed as Greek Catholic Church. Since this article is discussing the Church at large and not the Rite, the usage within the church by the """"listing"""" excuse does not apply to this article.

5)The Church in the few instances where it does add the descriptive adjective """"Roman"""" it is used in reference to its Petrine primacy and only when describing or comparing the Church with other schimatic churches.  This fact, is perfectly exemplified in Pope Pius XII's encylical Humani Generis where he mearly mentions """"Roman Catholic Church"""" as he speaks of churches not in  full communion. Because, in that entire encyclical Puis referrs to the Church as simply """"The Church"""" vs RCC 46 times to 1.

6)Since, this article is NOT from within the Church there is no way to confirm that it is not mentioned pejoratively, thus the additional push to disregard this disrespectful term.  Face it, the only way to prove an article's description is not meant pejoratively is only if it comes from within the Church. (Wikipedia should not pretend that anti-Catholicism does not exist)

Lastly,Wikipedia is not a Protestant or Anglican outlet. I mean really how many Protestants, Anglicans, or Orthodox refer to themselves as """"Catholic"""", yet that article is presented from the non-Catholic POV(as well as Catholicism). Yet, the Catholic is supposed to shut up and take it - fine, I'll take that for the terms """"Catholic and Catholicism"""". However, we are not allowed the common title of our Church in the name of outlandish excuses, instead the Catholic is supposed to swallow a term imposed by others outside the church, Anti-Catholicism, as is the preferred connotation of those against the Petrine Church.[9] [10] Where are the concessions coming from the non-Catholics?

The injustice is truly preposterous! """"

Additionally, and possibly the strongest point is historical. (What do you thin",0

"""I agree with Kevin entirely. The first paragraph of the section is highly debatable. Certainly, """"Jews!""""-slogan is a recent invention. Condescending use of the epitaph has been around a lot longer, unfortunately. In that light, the paragraph needs serious revision.
Also, it would greatly benefit from mentioning last year's attempts by the club to reduce if not eradicate the slogans altogether . The club argued it was inappropriate and hurtful to many of the club's Jewish supporters, the statement must be out there on ajax.nl.
Regardless of any of the above, hardcore Ajax supporters are not exclusively Jewish, neither currently nor historically, which is definitely worth mentioning in light of the symbols and slogans.

A request has been made at Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations to usurp, or """"take over"""", your username because you have not used it to edit, and another user would like to use it to edit. Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations says that any unused username may be usurped if the user is given seven days notice to object and does not do so. 

If you have an email set in your preferences, you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process. 

If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to utilize the name you currently have, please log in and post a reply here saying so (you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to, or we will provide you with a generic one). 

If you do nothing: the request will be filled after seven days, and your account will be moved to a generic username. You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time.

If you object to being renamed: please log in and make an edit to this page clearly stating that you object to usurpation. 

Please note that even if your current username is usurped, you can still edit and your data will not be lost; your preferences, watchlist, and other user settings will be transferred to a new username.

"Support - This has developed into more than an uprising, how much blood has to spill before the folks who oppose the name change can call this a war? Reports from CNN that 46 people were killed on Monday. As we discuss this, the Syrian Armed forces (Army, Republican Guard, etc.) are trading hot rounds of lead with the Free Syrian Army. Also, a neighborhood was shelled and snipers continue hunt activists like they're animals. I read from Yahoo News that 9 soldiers from the Syrian Army (pro-Assad) were killed and many more wounded, the same day 46 others (anti-Assad) were killed. Therefore it's clear there has become a constant exchange in gunfire and violence overall. I think you can either call this a Civil War or perhaps a Revolution, but it's quite clear (to me at least) that the uprising is over and Syria is now a war zone. After months of violence that ranged from smaller domestic disurbances to riots with people being killed, the United States decides to close their embassy and get all of their diplomats out of the country. Why now and not earlier? This is another sign that things are getting worse. I believe the United States has enough intelligence in the country to know what's going, war has started and it was time for the U.S. to get any Americans in the country out of harms way.",0

Diff of attempt to resolve dispute on article talk page: [diff]

My repeated attempts to get other editors to discuss content, talkpages have the perverse result of being used against me.  I used the term, editors, when there's really only one other editor, Esoglou, who is currently under sanction, and who used to be sanctioned under the handle LimA.  Lionelt's involvememnt stems from a cry for allies at the Christiannity noticeboard:
 Origin of the Eucharist 

History2007 has referred above to a past problem with the article Origin of the Eucharist.  The problem is again as acute as ever.  Only two editors are active in opposing the lone editor about whose apparent aims I say nothing.  I would be grateful if editors with greater knowledge than I have about Wikipedia rules would give advice.  One solution with which I am toying is to let the lone editor have free rein, so that nobody then reading the article would take it seriously.    

One thing I am not sure about is this. Does Eschoir have a possible WP:COI issue there? That may be one way to resolve it. As I said before, I have 1,500 pages on my watchlist, so I can not get involved in details there right now, and that is why we need a general 9-1-1 call system or a Mayday button (perhaps built into the WikiProject Christianity banner) as Lionel suggested so editors can be called for help.   
What an interesting idea: add it to the banner. Well, if you like the """"Click here in case of emergency"""" button I just added to the top of this talk page, it should be relatively easy to add the button to the banner. It would take a consensus, of course, and we'd want to coordinate with John's redesign of the banner. – Lionel (talk) 
Lionelt has helped very much, and I express my appreciation.  As for Eschoir, I think he just enjoys stirring others up.  In the past, another favourite target of his was Free Republic (see the archived talk pages).

"Toward a better description of the collapse of the SLA

There is lots of detail missing in the account of the collapse of the SLA.

The IDF, according to its plan of withdrawal, started handing major positions in Lebanon over to the SLA in the middle of May 2000. The collapse started on May 22, 2000.  Around a dozen villages and eight SLA posts in the center of the front surrendered to Hezbollah. The posts were mostly manned by Shiite muslims who were put under heavy pressure by Hezbollah. Hezbollah had made pubic threats against those involved with the SLA in April 2000. The threats were most effective against the Shites in the SLA.

Antoine Lahad, the leader of the SLA was in Paris while all of this was going on. Lahad's departure for France at such a critical time was a source of demoralization within the SLA. Lahad has claimed that he was taking an extended family vacation in advance of the July departure of the IDF. He claims to not have been aware of the handover of IDF positions to the SLA in May.

By the end of the day, the SLA front line had been cut in two with the flanks of the SLA positions in both the east and the west totally exposed to attack. On the morning of May 23, 2000, the western (Druze) sector of the front collapsed. There were (in 2000) reports of a secret deal between Walid Jumblatt and Hezbollah that led to the collapse.

This triggered off a general retreat of what remained of the SLA. Shortly after, both Israelis and some elements of the SLA were moving south. The retreat was finished by the early hours of May 24.

Israeli initially announced that it would give labor visas good for one year to soldiers of the SLA.

The controversy in all this is what the Israelis really intended to do in May. Many senior figures in the SLA claim that Israel announced the July departure date while actually planning a full withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000. These SLA people claim that Israel deliberately did not tell them the depature date because of fears the Lebanese could not be trusted with the information. I dont tend to believe these sorts of stories.

My view is that the SLA collapsed out of its own internal weakness. The SLA was really multiple religious militias with no effective unified command to speak of. Hezbollah worked on breaking off the Shite and Druze elements of the SLA. The Shite portion cut a deal first. The Druze portion, seeing that the game was up closed their own deal after. Lahad probably knew what was going to happen and stayed far away.

I think most of what I've wrote can be sourced with newspaper articles from the time (May 2000). I've put this on the discussion page for informational purposes rather than the article itself because all of this would be very controversial. Maybe someday someone can rewrite the section of the article on the SLA collapse.",0

 Role in Russian civil war 

That section states the Bolsheviks won that war in the late 1919. That is completely wrong by any historic books and textbooks. Officially the war ended in 1922, but there was still fighting going on in the Russian Far East. That is what the Soviet historical textbooks say. For some reason the war with the Ukraine is being perceived as the Civil war in Soviet times and it seems that the same trend exist today as well. That is also wrong. Ukraine was a recognized state by the Soviet Russia as well as by the other numerous countries. That was a straight aggresion against the Ukrainian republic, following an unbelievable slaughtering of population in Ukraine by bolsheviks (Kyiv and Podillia still remembered). In 1920 Ukraine united with Poland to stop the bolshevik bandits. The Soviet textbooks state that it was an intervention of the """"White"""" Polish burgouis, relating it to the Russian white movement which is way off. 

Not on the subject of the section, but Stalin should be recognized as the enemy of the world and, at least, should be on the same page with Adolf Hitler. Stalin was way more evil. Not all of his wrongdoings are uncovered, but the one that already are known can easily convict the guy. His name should be cursed for the eternity and humanity needs to learn to avoid the next Stalin.   

Define """"convict."""" What exactly is Stalin guilty of? Killing off men and women that he believed threatened the unity and safety of his nation? Knights did that all the time. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union became incredibly well-developed, albeit uncaring towards others. They even beat us in the space race. I'm sure all of our wonderful presidents would have thought that would happen with the amazing ideals of wonderful democracy. Luna RainHowLCry

Why is Abbie Bakan even mentioned in this article?  Based on the worthless rag of hers which is cited as a source in this article, she's nothing but a shill for Lenin and the rest of the commie gang.  In that rag, she not only shows egregious pro-Communist bias, but doesn't even bother to check the facts, much less look at the causes of the Kronstadt rebellion or even cite reliable historical sources on that subject.  She also discredits herself with absurd accusations of a White conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet government and even of the rebellion being motivated by anti-semitic racism among the sailors.  Furthermore, all the claims made in that rag are based on a case of begging the question: that is, since Lenin's Communist regime was good (major premise) and the Kronstadt rebellion harmed said regime (minor premise), suppressing the rebellion was justified.

""": Hi Hanely, and others,

First, a further clarification on the concept behind wikipedia, neutrality is a fundamental pillar, but there are two others as well, no original research and verifiability.  This takes us into the """"weasel words"""" you mention, which it's true is an area where improvements are needed with the article.  A reader should be able to independently check everything written in a wikipedia article should they want to, and as such, wikipedia is more about providing verifiable information rather than what a given editor simply thinks or believes is """"true.""""  You specifically cite the Criticism section, and I agree.  """"Plagiarism"""" has evolved the furthest of the three subsections IMO and is solidly referenced with verifiable sources (I think the believer stance(s) aren't presented as well as they could though), and the same should probably be done for """"Science"""" and """"Revelation"""".  For instance, one thing that can be done for """"Revelation"""" is cite the low book sales and distribution of the TUB instead of the simple current statement that it isn't widespread.  """"Peacock terms"""" have been an ongoing challenge from my perspective, commonly inserted throughout the article in a way that aggrandizes the book, but I think this is currently toned down.

What I'm hearing from you Hanely overall is a suggestion to focus on TUB alone, make the article perhaps a book summary with some history added, and put everything else in other articles.  It is one way to go, and you specifically mention Criticism-related topics as being placed elsewhere.  This would also need to be true of the adherents section and anything """"pro"""".  I don't agree with this tactic however, for reasons of wikipedia policy and overall usefulness to the average reader.  What makes TUB interesting and worth writing & reading about is that it purports to be more than a typical religious book, and people accept it as such.  I think that is a highly intertwined element of the TUB topic, and it fits in this article, and by the same token the reasons people *don't* accept it as such is part of the story.  I think it is a challenge to have the article reflect these differing perspectives, but that's a basic challenge involved with wikipedia articles in a nutshell.  Writing separate articles for separate points of view is discouraged.  See POV forking.

I think there needs to be a top-level article that is a summary of The Urantia Book basics, its teachings, its history, and those who are pro and con on topics related to it.  Other articles can then develop certain topics in more depth, if needed or wanted.  I don't see why the top-level article shouldn't be this one, it already serves as that, and other similar topics on wikipedia are structured the same way (for instance A Course in Miracles isn't a simple book synopsis & some words about the history, but covers pro and con viewpoints, as does Book of Mormon, which also has a plagiarism section).  I certainly do not accept that for some reason everything to do with Criticism should be tucked away in separate articles.  This is inherently biased toward the idea that the main wikipedia article is only for those seeking viewpoints where nothing negative is said.  Audiences also come to learn about contrary viewpoints, and those viewpoints are just as valid.

On the points you brought up, my thoughts:

1.  I've seen a tendency over the 1+ year I've followed this wikipedia article off and on for people to add many digressions to the article.  And understandably so, TUB is enormous and has thousands of interesting details and side stories.  But not all will fit in the main article.  I've seen multiple people each add a few sentences here and there, and over time, the article has become enormous and unfocused with all sorts of illogical disorganized digressions.  Like you say, this article can stand to be streamlined (you should have seen what it's been like before!).  IMO, the Lucifer rebellion story, while interesting, doesn't quite make the cut in terms of being essential enough to mention on the main page.  Perhaps an article summarizing TUB's view of the history of earth is worthwhile to build up?  The Lucifer / Caligastia / Satan story would fit in article such as that, for example.

2.-5.  Like I've said, Criticism is appropriate to have, as is the view of believers, and a POV fork is contrary to wikipedia standards.  In terms of Gardner specifically, despite any opinions on his conclusions about TUB, his book is one of the few published about TUB to analyze it from a nonbeliever perspective and it's entirely appropriate to use and cite as reference material for the article.  I say that even though I'm not personally convinced by arguments he makes.  I've read his book, have access to a copy, and can make edits regarding i",0

 Footnote formatting 

In general it's considered preferable to combine multiple citations of a single reference into one footnote.  This is discussed at Wikipedia:Manual of Style (footnotes)#Reference name (naming a ref tag so it can be used more than once).  In this article I did that recently with the """"50 State Quarters Report""""  look at footnote 7 here   but after that another editor separated them out again, here.  Also, it's better to link to the reference from the name of the reference being cited, like I did, rather than have the link be a separate unlabelled number like the other editor did.  So, I think the footnotes should be combined again, the way I did it.  Anyone else have an opinion on this? —  (Talk) """,0

My Reverting of The Edit In The History Section
I didn't revert the edit because the material you removed isn't redundant in some ways, which is fairly obvious if you read the  section as a whole. The entire history section of this article is still in very bad shape in my opinion, I'd suggest that its got non NPOV issues in several spots, the tone it's written in and choice of words seem somewhat """"chatty"""" and unencyclopedic to me and worst of all it continues to contain, what I'd argue, are historical inaccuracies in some places. Instead of editing out the paragraph that was removed today, which contained a link to a map, as well as an internal link to the ongoing Caledonia land dispute, a subject quite relevant in the Grand Valley these days, I'd like to see the entire history section itself brought up to a higher standard. In my opinion, from a historical perspective, the article itself would benefit more if some of the earlier comments in it regarding the acquisition of the land by the Six Nations were edited out and replaced by the material that was removed today. As I said back in August, I'm willing to work on this article myself as time allows, but in my opinion it doesn't make sense removing content that's not only relevant and contains references, it's actually of a higher quality than what remains.

You can't have it both ways. You're either an encyclopedic website that seeks to be factual and informative while minimizing speculation or you're a fansite. Either way, it's not suitable for inclusion. For example, if your site is a community run information site, then it should not be included under the In general, any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of brilliant prose guideline. Your Wiki won't provide information we don't already have or will have in the future if its just a community info site. However, if it trades in information that we won't be adding, such as speculation, theories, spoilers, because of Wikipedia guidelines on such material, then we should not be posting your sites for the reasons discussed above. It is not the case of making a link between encyclopedias, but between an encyclopedia and one particular fansite.
Further, the two Wikis you mention aren't even major fansites, when the guideline specifically states: Fan sites: On articles about topics with many fansites, including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such. In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link. We already have the major AND official forum: The Fuselage. If you'd like to add a link to a directory of Lost fansites, be my guest... but inclusion of either Wiki alone (instead of a list) is preferential treatment of minor fansites, since there are certainly other, larger, more popular fansites (Lost-media, Lost-tv, for example). Certainly, if we were to start adding fansites at random, we'd have to begin there and with others, like a link to TWOP's reviews and forums. The best course of action if you believe these sites simply must be linked to is for you to make a list of fansites and include a link to that directory, which is how WP:EL says to proceed.
As for removing the disclaimer, its not going anywhere. The disclaimer was put there specifically because we'd have people posting each and every fansite they dreamed up as official sites when they weren't. Lost is an example of a show wherein Wikipedia guidelines and policies are repeatedly ignored by the editing community, so the long-term editors have had to be very diligent in monitoring this page. This is an outgrowth of that, and has for the most part helped a lot. Moreover, there is no """"freebie"""" section for links. All links listed there are official sources except IMDB, which is used almost without exception. The same list of reasons I mentioned above for IMDB, including the fact that IMDB is a featured part of the standard TV Infobox, clearly do not apply to these Wikis nor any other site people have been trying to add (Mr. Clucks, 4815162342, etc.)
Finally, I will agree with you that the list of links for all the individual networks is redundant, and should be chopped down or moved to Airdates of Lost as a link for the country/network listed there.  """,0

The previous comment of the article states that MOC was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920 and a ban by the Serbian (then Yugoslav) autocratic King Aleksandar. 
The article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. 

The statement """"over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""" is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that """"most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""", but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.

You can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that """"all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918."""" This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in """"its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church"""" it is not balanced. Also, the statement """"its following is small to the point of non-existence"""" needs to be based on fact not fancy. Do you have an official census of followers or is this your speculation?

Can someone please tell me why this list has many sit-down restaurants in it, like Big Boy? Also, should we really include fast-casual restaurants in this list as well? Dec '06

 Wrong countries 
TelePizza is not Polish. It's Spanish. Poland is dominated by McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut... etc and sadly didn't develop even one national chain to compete with them!

I'm not sure if it's some kind of """"pro-Canadianism"""" or what, but many companies founded in the U.S. are listed erroneously under Canada instead of where they belong, either in International or U.S.

I fixed a few but I'm sure there are lots others if someone wants to help out.
 

 Agreed, I'm fixing a few today...  

On a similar note, I am currently moving some from United States to International, where the business in question also operates in Australia.   

 Pizza 

A pizza place that customizes, to order, every order they take, and take 20 minutes to make are NOT fast food restaurants.  Sorry, but no way.  Who is writing this list?  TGIFridays?  Fuddruckers?  Have any of the writers here ever EATEN at these places?  Also, there should be zero overlap between fast-casual and fast food.  There is a noteable difference.  I'm tempted to delete all the fast-casuals that I recognize out of this list, but I'll wait to see what others think.  

 Where? 

Where does Long John Silver's go to? it should be added to the list.  

 Grouping 
Some places listed in International should not be listed in Coutries. I've removed McDonald's from  Eqypt, India, Mexico, and USA, since they are ALL franchised off of McDonald's International. I left McDonalds Canada since it seems to have it's own President and logos etc (with the Maple Leaf).  Also, I've removed other """"international"""" items like KFC, Pizza Hut, etc from international places.  Also, Dunkin' Donuts, and Krispy Kreme are NOT fast food.  They are donut stores, with sandwhiches added in the last few years.  A suggestion, so as to not have 'doubles' and not need to have them in the founded country, is, have a flag beside the international resturant where it was founded.  I.E. McDonald's would have a US Flag, * Made In Japan Teriyaki Experience Would have a Canadian flag etc.  

 Russian fast food chart looks short 
There are more interesting fast food chaines started from Russia. Such as Pasta La Vista italian cuisine cafe. Check www.pasta-la-vista.com or http://i-food.livejournal.com/
It offers pizza in a cone among other specialties...

 US/International List 

Wendy's is listed under the Internatioanl Fastfood chains, but its not listed under the US Fastfood chains. Is this an error, or is there a particular reason for this?

This is also true for Pizza Hut, while many other chains are listed under both. Is this just a miss, or was there a reason?

 Is there a list for out of business ones? 

I added Red Steer. I think they're out of business. They launched a kids meal in a box around about the same time McDonalds started their Happy Meal. They also had small burgers called Lil Pardners. Same size as White Castle or Krystal Burger. Their thing was the beef they used came from some breed of cattle with red hair and a white face.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 Removed unnecessary UK fast food outlets 

Seriously, there is no need to list every single Halal chicken restaurant you have ever seen in the UK. It is unnecessary to have such a long list of non-chain stores. Goes against the guidelines too. Also got rid of restaurants that are not fast food, such as Frankie and Bennys. If you want to add to the list, make sure it is not just one store but is a chain, and is even fast food in the first place  """,0

 NPOV required  

The article seems to me to lean more towards an """"heroic"""" account of the war than an encyclopedic piece seeking a NPOV.  
For instance the opening sentences of the section Soviet–Finnish relations and politics: 
""""After the Soviet involvement in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, no formal peace treaty was signed. In 1918 and 1919, Finnish volunteer forces conducted two unsuccessful military incursions across the Russian border""""
The Finnish doctrine is embedded in its first sentence, tying """"Soviet involvement"""" in the Civil War  with the idea that it necessitated a """"peace treaty"""", and then using this muddled logic as if it were an a priori justification for Finnish military incursions into Russia. (Russian involvement was perhaps half that of the German involvement and both together accounted for about 10% of the protagonists. 35% more Finns died in the Civil War than in the Winter War)
Orthodox Finnish doctrine riddles the article, even though it contains all the information needed for an NPOV.  The account of Finnish independence for instance fails to mention that the Boshevik's policy was to grant autonomy, stating the event in heroic terms instead: 
""""The outbreak of the First World War and the collapse of the Russian Empire gave Finland a window of opportunity; on 6 December 1917, the Senate of Finland declared the nation's independence.""""
Knowing the Boshevik's policy makes such doctrinal heroism ring hollow.
To go through the article and cite every example of the bias and absence of references would take far too long but perhaps one or two more from various angles may make the point clearer. 
The article states: 
""""the Soviet Union changed its foreign policy toward Finland in the late 1930s. The Soviet Union began pursuing the reconquest of the provinces of Tsarist Russia"""".
Both parts of this need substantive verifiable reference(s).  What was this change? What form did it take? In what way can it be said that the new Russia was """"pursuing reconquest""""?  Is such a characterisation neutral?  The whole requires contextualisation as history is not a simple cause effect nil sum comic strip equation and there are many drivers for any situation.  In this case the pivotal role of the economic and political policies of the West towards the revolution in Russia (as previously towards the French revolution) need to be plainly set out.  However, from the implied assertions the article segues into a distortion of what would be the core issue imo for an NPOV article: 
""""The Soviet leadership believed that the old empire had ideal security and territorial possessions, and wanted the newly christened city of Leningrad to enjoy a similar security."""".
The """"old empire"""" is implied as being the driver rather than any legitimate security concern even though these concerns are in fact detailed afterwards.  
It seems to me that the key aspect in understanding any of this is the socio-political concept of buffer states.  Again, the article contains all the information required.  It is just that it is presented in a non-NPOV form, and so ends up in the good guy/bad guy shoot out at the OK Corral story of the Finnish doctrine.  
I believe that in the West, the establishment treated Finland as a buffer state, one that stood between it and the influence of the new socialism/communism.  I believe that Finland enjoyed the consequent economic benefits that flowed from this status, and which ended recently with the end of the Cold War.  
When all these things are included and made overt, again adding nothing into the article, the following paragraphs can be seen as the key to understanding how the war broke out.
""""In April 1938, an NKVD agent, Boris Yartsev contacted the Finnish foreign minister Rudolf Holsti and Prime Minister Aimo Cajander, stating that the Soviet Union did not trust Germany and that war was considered possible between the two countries. The Red Army would not wait passively behind the border but would rather """"advance to meet the enemy."""" Finnish representatives assured Yartsev that Finland was committed to a policy of neutrality and that the country would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev suggested that Finland cede or lease some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the seaward approaches to Leningrad. Finland refused.   
Notwithstanding what was said at the time, history, in the simplest manner, seems to me to record its verdict on the two parties positions.  Finland's behaviour during WW2 merited her having to pay war reparations.  Russia's assessment of Finland's true position (and intent?) was vindicated.   
In my opinion the NPOV could easily be resolved by some rebalancing of the introduction and by atte",0

 DIFFUSION ASSOCIATED NEOCLASSICAL INDIGENOUS SYSTEM OF HALL ASSEMBLY (DANISHA)   

DIFFUSION ASSOCIATED NEOCLASSICAL INDIGENOUS SYSTEM OF HALL ASSEMBLY (DANISHA)

Dr. A.B.Rajib Hazarika, PhD, MIAMP(Germany),FRAS(Lond.),MWASET,A.E.S.
Lecturer, Dept. of Mathematics,
Diphu Govt. College, Diphu
Assam, India
The present study is related different geometry of the Hall thrusters in which I have tried to get better results than the simple Hall thrusters available at present with the future next generation device Duo Triad Tokomak collider (DTTC) hub by the using new type of code Diffusion Associated Neoclassical Indigenous Hall Assembly (DANISHA).
Hall thrusters were studied independently in the US and the USSR in the 1950s and '60s. However, the concept of a Hall thruster was only developed into an efficient propulsion device in the former Soviet Union, whereas in the US, scientists focused instead on developing girded ion thruster. Two types of Hall thrusters were developed in the Soviet Union:
(A)Thruster with wide acceleration zone, SPD (Russian), SPT, (Stationary Plasma Thruster) at Design Bureau Fake. 
(B) Thruster with narrow acceleration zone, DAS in English: TAL, (Thruster with Anode Layer), at the Central Research Institute for Machine Building (TsNIIMASH). 
 
 
Soviet and Russian SPD thrusters
The common SPD design was largely the work of A. I. Morozov. SPD engines were operated since 1972. They were mainly used for satellite stabilization in North-South and in East-West directions. Since then until the late 1990s 118 SPD engines completed their mission and some 50 continued to be operated. Thrust of the first generation of SPD engines, SPD-50 and SPD-60 was 20 and 30 mN respectively. In 1982 SPD-70 and SPD-100 were introduced, their thrust being 40 mN and 83 mN. In the post-Soviet Russia high-power (a few kilowatts) SPD-140, SPD-160, SPD-180, T-160 and low-power (less than 500 W) SPD-35 were introduced. SPT-100 has a life time of 8000 hrs, efficiency of 52%.Soviet and Russian DAS-type engines include D-38 and D-55. 
Soviet-built thrusters were introduced to the West in 1992 after a team of electric propulsion specialists, under the support of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, visited Soviet laboratories and experimentally evaluated the SPD-100 (i.e., a 100 mm diameter SPT thruster). Over 200 Hall thrusters have been flown on Soviet/Russian satellites in the past thirty years. They were used mainly for station keeping and small orbital corrections. Currently Hall Thruster research, design, and theoretical modeling are led by experts at NASA Glenn Research Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A considerable amount of development is being conducted in industry, such as Aerojet and Busek Co.
This technology was used on the European lunar mission SMART-1 and is used on a number of commercial geostationary satellites. 
What's a Hall Thruster?    The Hall thruster is a type of plasma-based propulsion systems for space vehicles. The amount of fuel that must be carried by a satellite depends on the speed with which the thruster can eject it. Chemical rockets have very limited fuel exhaust speed. Plasmas can be ejected at much higher speeds; therefore less fuel need be carried on board. The Hall thruster was invented in the late 1950's. Until the mid 1990's, it has been developed primarily by the Russians. During the past 30 years, the Russian placed in orbit more than 100 Hall thrusters. However, the vast majority of satellites worldwide have relied on chemical thrusters and, to a lesser extent, arc jet thrusters and ion thrusters.
    A conventional electrostatic ion thruster consists of two grids, an anode and a cathode, between which a voltage drop occurs. Positively charged ions accelerate away from the anode toward the cathode grid and through it. After the ions get past the cathode, electrons are added to the flow, neutralizing the output to keep it moving. A thrust is exerted on the anode-cathode system, in a direction opposite to that of the flow. Unfortunately, a positive charge builds up in the space between the grids, limiting the ion flow and, therefore, the magnitude of the thrust that can be attained.  
    In a Hall thruster, electrons injected into a radial magnetic field neutralize the space charge. The magnitude of the applied magnetic field is approximately 100-200 gauss, strong enough to trap the electrons by causing them to spiral around the field lines in the coaxial channel. The magnetic field and a trapped electron cloud together serve as a virtual cathode. The ions, too heavy to be affected by the field, continue their journey through the virtual cathode. The movement of the positive and negative electrical charges through the system results",0

Yes, he was indeed married to the same woman for all those years, and as far as I can tell their marriage was a very happy and harmonious one. There are some nice vignettes of their life together in his autobiography, maybe I'll try to work in a few mentions of domestic life somewhere.

  Statement on my block

I read your post on WR. I have just dealt with a rampant sockpuppeteer User:Burrburr and friends, whose main activity is to remove such pro-pedo edits from dead historical figures. I suspect he was correct on substance but the abusive sockpuppetry (80+ accounts) was unacceptable. It would be a good thing for a knowledgeable, non-sockpuppet using editor to perform the same sort of review, as long as it is done civilly etc. The pro-pedos will find it much harder to revert someone of relatively higher status (most of Burrburr's accounts edited for only a day or two, so it was easy to label them as vandals or """"single purpose accounts"""" and deprecate their edits). This is, of course, harder to do with an established named editor. Thatcher 

For example, it was being claimed with very little properly sourced evidence that Jules Verne was a paedophile.  I did so with the help of an editor called Phdarts whose contributions I looked at and judged worthwhile.  I made a considerble number of edits to the

 corticosteroid v. anabolic steroid 

Canof steroid hormones that are genericly refered to as """"steroids"""" by different groups (corticosteroids by doctors, anabolic by athletes), end of similarity.  The corticosteroids are actually catabolic, the opposite of anabolic. 

removed section and reasons

TABThe first “Steroid” was a product developed in the 1930’s to give much needed testostarone to people whose bodies did not produce enough on their own. It just so happens that testosterone helps build muscle at an alarming rate. Once Steroids were proven effective on animals, Germany used these steroids on soldiers in WWII. The Germans saw that their POW’s (Prisoners of War) were suffering from malnutrition, so they made the decision to treat them with steroids. The steroids helped prevent muscle loss, thus making them live longer. It wasn’t until the mid 1950’s where steroids were first used in professional sports. Many Russian and European weightlifters used these steroids to increase their game and dominate the sport of power lifting.
TABThere are many types of Steroids, but the most common of them all is anabolic-androgenic.  Most athletes take this steroid for the good effects the anabolic part brings. Anabolic means increasing body tissue (mostly muscle). So when an athlete takes the steroid their muscles increase dramatically giving them an impressive amount of strength. The only bad effect this part brings is that it can increase your muscles so dramatically; it can cause the user to become more prone to injury. The androgenic portion of the steroid is the bad part. This part is highly related to the male hormone: testosterone. This increases facial hair, baldness, nervousness, bad breath, and much more. The doctors sometimes prescribe their patients steroids because of the androgenic part. Androgenic helps synthesize testosterone, giving much needed help to patients whose bodies do not produce enough on their own. Doctors however prescribe only about 4-10 mg a day, whereas an athlete may take up to 100mg a day. Steroids are still not safe even if you use it in small doses, unless your body is lacking testosterone. Athletes need to consider the dangers of Steroids and not just the increased muscle tissue.
TABAs well as the many types of Steroids, they can also be taken a couple different ways. The most common way to take Steroids is through injection; this is when the user takes a liquid steroid out of a bottle and puts in a needle. The user then injects the needle directly in the skin, like a shot in the doctor’s office. This can be especially dangerous because many abusers do not use sterile needles. HIV and AIDS can be transmitted from a person that has the disease to a person who does not have it. The other way you take steroids is in a pill form through the mouth. This is used less then injection throughout the athletic world because they do not work as well. Injection works faster and is much more efficient then pills. Pills are chea",0

"Complex Iteration 

I've discovered that not only fractional iteration is possible, but also complex iteration. It's not as intuitive as fractional iteration, but it does make sense once you have a new model for what iteration means. Probably the simplest explanation is with orbitals in the complex plain: iterating to a real values generates the complex orbitals as paths. Iterating to imaginary powers, meanwhile, generates paths perpendicular to the orbitals at every point. You need the entire vector field of orbitals to know the new path. For example, iterating a linear function (multiplying by a constant) creates orbitals which are rays. Iterating to imaginary powers creates paths with are concentric circles. After that, complex iteration can be done by composing real and imaginary values. For a more precise derivation, I had to invent a new type of derivative, it looks at the instantaneous change in value at a point as the function iterates. The formula for this derivative is: 
f*(x) = lim n->0 (fn(x) - x)/n
Which is equivalent to the derivative of f's Abel function. The key about this derivative is it has the property that fn* = f x n . This enables iteration to imaginary powers to be calculated directly. Ultimately I think it is equivalent to taking the analytic extension of the Abel function, but it's a bit more intuitive than Taylor series witchcraft. I've done the calculations to arrive at Euler's identity using this method rather than the typical one, and graphically it makes much more sense: once it's understood how complex iteration works, it's just geometry to find the imaginary value e must be raised to in order to complete the arc from 1 to -1.",0

 About the revert on the """"List of Windows Phone 8.1 devices"""" page 

Hi, and I'm here to inform you there's no such thing as a """"memory card reader"""" in mobile phones and I'll hope you'll understand that.

 Josef Rosch Image deletion 

Hi,
I uploaded File:Josef Rösch.jpg for an article on Josef Rosch. It was tagged for speedy deletion because of some sort of """"copyright infringement.""""

""""Will be provided on request"""" - no! - evidence must be provided at the time of upload. """"Free use for wikipedia"""" - hopelessly vague - we need a proper Creative Commons licence.

For starters, dating back to the original discussion back in December 2009, while the user Optigan liked FinancialNorth1, he preferred a cropped version of the fourth photo, to which no including PaulH or you for that matter said anything as clearly noted in the discussion. As i'm saying again for the umpteenth time and as the record showed, no decision was made and the discussion ended. Paulh, or you did not say anything. If he wanted the photo then, why didn't he continue to press his case then and convince a consensus then? I would've left it at that then, but instead he and other editors remained silent. I didn't restart the discussion because I assumed that the editors simply lost interest, or didn't have the time.

Furthermore, I did not """"slip in"""" as you disgustingly, dishonestly, facetiously say. I only added that photo because I noticed for the time being that no one had made a decision since the original discussion back in January. Again, no one did anything for months. You and Paulh cannot claim you didn't see the change, because you made several other edits throughout the article for months.

Again, Paul did not form a consensus prior to the change, or continue the discussion where it had left off. Once again, he instead changed the photo, got a """"consensus"""" from Binksternet. The IP editor liked the photo, but, quoting the editor again:

""""Any of the photos in that section (""""FinancialNorth.jpg""""; """"Montgomerystreetsf.jpg""""; """"Federal Reserve Band (San Francisco).jpg"""") except #2 (SanFranciscoEmbarcadero.jpg) would be fine as a replacement, and even the cropped version of #2 is better than the one currently there now.

""""I'm going to replace it with """"FinancialNorth.jpg"""" and see what happens.""""

The crux of it was that Paulh made the change before even Binksternet approved it, or I or other editors could respond.

Binksternet's abusive little crusade against me shows my point that he and Paul have no interest in perusing collaborative editing efforts. Despite my reverts, I at least agreed to having a discussion and a """"photo choosing contest"""" as it were. Paulh did not and Binksternet is now acting as some kind of enforcing. I don't see Binksternet asking the IP editor in question or other editors to the SF article including Optigan13 have their say either in this. He is not apologizing to me and asking that we resume the discussion and consensus, something that at least Paulh did earlier. Only showing his intentions as pure slander towards me as attempt to have me banned purely because he disagrees with my edits or whatever personal victory he may get by flaming me

I posted a new subject but don't know if I highlighted it this way. It's about the National Press Club and PRSA. Here's part of it with four tildes at the end. (jack@odwyerpr.com)

Hi Jim:
Thanks for your help in posting crucial material on WP.

The National Press Club, the largest, most prestigious press club in the world which has about 750 PR (""""communications"""") members in addition to thousands of journalists, on Oct. 19, 2011 issued a formal statement asking Public Relations Society of America to withdraw its ban against O'Dwyer Co. reporters at the 2011 national Assembly of the Society Oct. 15 in Florida. This ban had been stated in writing in a 23-page document of PRSA which NPC examined and rejected.

Whatever was in those 23 pages was not enough to bar O'Dwyer reporters from the Assembly (for the first time in 40 years), said the NPC statement which was signed by Mark Hamrick, president of NPC and a longtime reporter for the Associated Press. NPC does not want the lesson going out to the 31,000 regular and student members of PRSA and other PR people that the way to deal with critical press is to ban it from the group's meetings. The NPC did not agree with any of the charges against the O'Dwyer Co. or its employees that were in the 23 pages. It only noted that PRSA had made such charges.

To underscore its condemnation of the PRSA boycott, NPC sent its statement to 390 national and international media with offices in Washington, D.C. (That list is available if you wish it).

Below is the full text of the statement. If additional verification is needed, call executive director Bill McCarren at 202/662-7500 or e-mail him at wmccarren@press.org. At least one news medium published the statement.

Cordially,

Jack O'Dwyer (jack@odwyerpr.com)

"Sick POV
What the hell? 
User:Izady is a sick fuck:

It should be noted that the conditions in which individuals died varies from site to site. The people that were buried in these graves are believed to have been members of the Kurdish population which was in support of Iranian occupancy of Iraq at the time of their death (circa 1980's) 'and who deserved to die in the hands of patriotic Sunni Arabs of Iraq'. The legitimacy of claims of atrocity are debateable for this reason, 'since Sunni Arabs are too honorable to do any such things'. The distinction between those who have died in military style combat or executed under the direction of a lawful court of President Saddam Hussein, although buried disrespectfully, and those who have been victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing or otherwise murdered innocently and buried efficiently is a bright line; mass burial should not be assumed to be evidence of criminal activity. 'These Shia and Kurds were traitors to Iraq and were fairly tried and executed by the patriot Arab Sunnis for their crimes', although the burial was not always respectful. Victims of chemical weapons are unknown, 'and they too were traitor Kurds and deserved the punishment by the patriotic Saddam government'.",1

 The focusing on dinosaurs as being the main or only  subject of religious interest doesn't really stand up since it is sufficient to show that a conflict exists between bible literalists/ young earthers and science in general if any life form can be shown to have died out before Adam and Eve.

It would appear that some people believe that if any dinosaurs can be shown to have coexisted with man then the problem of bible chronology and science is solved., but thats no the case.

About the new song, I'm not going to debate you about this because there shouldn't been any doubt in a few days. But I think you're being far, far too strict in your inclusion of information here. We don't have an exact confirmation by Michael Jackson that he sang the song. That's because, as far as I know, there wasn't much doubt. A singer is not going to release a statement """"Hey I sang this song"""" everytime a song that is suspected to be his is leaked. I doubt any singer will do that, much less Michael Jackson. And if Billboard Magazine and MTV news could confidently claim that it is sang by Michael Jackson, there is no doubt whatsoever. This similar reasoning should be applied to other things as well. Wikipedia relies on sources only when common sense does not suffice. We don't need exact statements on everything to merit their inclusion or notability.

There are still many fundamental problems with the string theory and its successors (M-theory etc.). I mention just three problems which a good Theory of Everything (TOE) should solve:

1. A good TOE should be able to formulate its own principles and fundamental equations. Moreover, these principles and equations should clarify and simplify our picture of the physical world and allow some testable predictions. As far as I know, nothing like that is still available for the string theory (M-theory), in contrast to its rather long development and far-reaching claims. 

2. A good TOE should allow  calculations of all interaction constants and particle parameters from its fundamental principles. It was actually one of the original Einstein's goals - to give some purely geometrical or mathematical origin to fundamental physical constants. No variant of string theory is able to calculate these parameters from some first principles.

3. If the TOE is formulated in some space of higher dimension (11, etc.), as expected, there should be also a unique and justified principle of compactification - e.g., a principle how to project the structures from the 11-dim world to our tangible 4-dim world. In its contemporary status, (super)string theory is very fuzzy and umbiguous concerning the compactification.

 
In my opinion, the very word """"theory"""" is rather premature in connection with the (super)string theory and Einstein himself probably would not be very happy with its present form and claims.  """,0

Fair use rationale for Image:Stolen_logo.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Stolen_logo.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

 Lets start with the opening three paragraphs 

I think we put this version on the discussion page, FunkyFly had few concerns, we addressed them, and we should start with this version:

Macedonism (Bulgarian: Македонизъм, Macedonian and Serbian: Македонизам) is a term mostly used in Bulgaria, and to some extent Greece (Kofos) to describe the perceived negative aspects of Macedonian Nationalal Movement. In Bulgaria this term is used primarily by the nationalists to describe the Macedonian National Movement as a political ideology, or a regional linguistic separatist movement. In Greece this term is used almost exclusively by Kofos in the context of United Macedonia related subjects. In an extreme context, the word itself means that there is no authentic, but only an artificial Macedonian nationhood, an ideological mindset imposed by Yugoslav socialism (Macedonians = Bulgarian Macedonists) .

The term is chiefly a Balkan regionalism, rarely used in the English historiography. It is not found neither in Enciclopedia Britanica nor in the Oxford English Dictionary.

In the article The Macedonian Question published on 18th January 1871 in the """"Macedonia"""" newspaper in Constaninople by Petko Rachev Slaveikov, Makedonism was defined and critized, his adherants were named Macedonists, and this may be one of the earliest surviving references to it.

I specifically stated that ArbCom probably wouldn't reprimand you (not least because it has nothing to do with you), and so I will likely be too busy to respond to Cebr1979 until sometime after this case is resolved. What I meant was that, regardless of the outcome of the ArbCom case, I will still have any number of users campaigning for me to be SBANned, and will likely still be too busy to respond. Please learn to read other users' comments more carefully. And while you're at it, please stop following me, as your closely reading a comment on my talk page addressed to another user indicates you were. As for the first half of your post  the reason I am interested in your edits is because in the last five months you have made requests on ANI for me to be de fact SBANned no less than three times, and on at least two of these occasions you have justified this by claiming that the number of pages you managed to sneak past the GA review process exceeds the number of GAs I have produced. Your making bad article edits usedn't be that big a concern for me, except where you directly revert my good article edits. But once you started using the number of GA reviewers you have managed to trick into thinking you didn't misquote sources as justification for trying to get me blocked/banned, I suddenly had a massive incentive to bring to light the fact that the so-called GAs you advertise on your user page all contain serious sourcing errors.

But don't worry  I won't post any more GA reassessments for the foreseeable future (even though I have half a dozen already drafted off-wiki) as long as you cease your campaign to get me removed from the project.

If you look at the language classification  the Malay language and Javanese have over 1000 languages in the same language group. Out of those, the Malay language is in fact closer to many other languages such as Ibanic, Kendayan, Balinese, Madurese & Sundanese than it is to Javanese. So why have you mentioned Javanese specifically and not one of those other 1000 cultures, especially those which are more closely linked to Malay culture?

During the reign of Soekarno, whose deed perhaps stopped at the proclamation on August 17th 1945 and the short time following when MPR and DPR are established, Indonesia are on the verge of being turned into a communist nation, and people are on the worst of poverty due to the minimum development and import-export. When Soeharto was the president, Indonesia was at its best of conditionschools are openened everywhere, the 9-year-education program are legitimated, etc. It would be too much to mention all of them. He ruled with military force, correct, but I personally think it was pretty much needed to keep things in order, and would be the right thing to do had not he overdid it.

And about Soekarno etc cooperating with Japan, it wasn't completely true. During their time in Indonesia, Japanese banned all national organization and established 'Putera' which aim was to have the educated people of Indonesia to work for Japan. Soekarno, Mohammad Hatta, and few others joined in 'Putera' just so they could gain information about Japanese and have supplies from them. This is also so the Japanese wouldn't keep their eyes on them while they secretly establish the national movement. There are also controverisal/underground organizations established by Indonesian icons that worked secretly amongst the villagers.

Understandable and taken in good humor, of course, and nothing on the page is sourced (it's more of a stub than anything).  But I'm curious why you were so sure it was fabricated.  )  xkcd
I find it hard to believe that a 22-year-old could have been working full-time for NASA. Of course, you may well be freakishly gifted and the kind of person that NASA would have been all over, but it just seems ever so slightly hard to believe.  - Schreit mich an 
I interned there during college and started working for them a bit before I graduated.  I stayed for the better part of a year until late 2006.  NASA is a huge organization with a tremendous number of contract positions on all sorts of projects.  It's not all rocket scientists leaning over mission control screens and talking to astronauts on their headsets.

Anyway, the information is taken from my published bio page, but you're right  you have no way of knowing whether I'm lying or not.  I guess it's probably safest to assume that I am.
In that case, I'll admit my mistake and congratulate you on interning and working in a pretty impressive place (I know very little about science, but anyone who got to work for NASA has got to be a smart cookie in that kind of area). Feel free to re-add the info, although the impression I got from the original version was more than you weren't just a contract worker. If that's not even a valid distinction in the States - it's increasingly less of one here in Oz - then my apologies there in advance.  - Schreit mich an 
 Honestly, they never really explained to me which one I was.  I went to work every day in a building at NASA where I worked on NASA robots, and NASA paid me (through a government contractor).  When I said """"I work for NASA"""" no one argued.

 It was a lot more Dilbert-esque than you would expect.  Old, echoing tile hallways with quiet, gruff middle-aged men working at blueprint-covered desks, mild office politics, lots of presentations and buzzwords, and hours spent wading through computer code trying to figure out why the motor on the lab bench was spinning the wrong way.

For the record, below is the controversial text which these morons think needs citations:

The Coyote (canis latrans, or """"prairie wolf"""") also interbreeds with dogs, and many Americans have dogs which are part coyote. The coyote is very closely related to the wolf, and the two can be made to interbreed, but they never do in the wild. Most dog/coyote hybrids are in the domestic population, where the father is the coyote responding to a female dog in estrus, and the puppies are born into captivity. The word coydog was coined in the Eastern US when coyotes began to appear there, as they seemed larger than western coyotes, and it was assumed that they were dog/coyote hybrids. DNA evidence has shown, however, that this is not the case. The Golden Jackal is another wild wolf-like canid which can interbreed with dogs, and it has been crossed with dogs by Russian breeders to created the Sulimov Dog.

Any species of the Canis genus has 78 chromosomes and can interbreed with dogs. These include all varieties of the wolf, the golden jackal, the coyote, the dingo, and the New Guinea Singing Dog. The only 78-chromosome canid which is not thought to have contributed to the dog gene pool is the African wild dog, which is in a separate Genus. However, the vast majority of the DNA in dogs comes from the various Canis lupus varieties. Yellow jackals have 74 chromosomes and don't interbreed well with dogs, and other wild canids such as the bush dog, the maned wolf, and the fox, have different chromosome sets and cannot interbreed with dogs at all, so they played no part in the dog ancestry. See canid hybrid.

Finally, the origin of the dog is so ancient that many now-extinct varieties of wolf, some unknown, may have played a part. It is wrong to say that dogs descended from modern wolves. They descended from ancestral wolves, and this difference must always be kept in mind. Ancestral wolves of many varieties existed all over the planet and were most likely domesticated in many places during a period of thousands of years, and some of these ancestors are now extinct. This helps in explaining the different morphological groupings of dog, as each group may have derived from a different variety of wolf. The common belief that greyhounds and other short-haired dogs descended from modern gray wolves of norhtern climates, and lost their undercoat through human breeding, is weak compared to the argument that these breeds descended from a short-haired wolf of warmer climate. The Arabian Wolf, for example, has short hair suited for its climate""",0

Merged with Pentateuch
I merged this article with Pentateuch; there was nothing in the Pentateuch article that was not already in the Torah article, so there wasn't much point in making the distinction. If the article were to be recreated, I would suggest that attempts be made to focus specifically on that term as opposed to the Torah. podous 

 Dates and Wellhausen 

I think this edit  by  should be pulled, at least pending further consideration:

It must be noted that Wellhausen's knowledge of Jewish literature outside of the Bible was limited, and led to his considerable confusion in event chronologies and dating. Notably he supposed the receiving of Torah was dating from about 1450 BCE, and that of monarchy, established by Saul, c.1020 BCE, and the (later) prophets, 9th to 5th centuries BCE.[ Julius Wellhausen ] In the case of the first the date in Jewish chronology is established as 1313 BCE, Saul is dated to 879 BCE, and Isaiah during 619 BCE. [pp.33,47,53, Kantor]

These dates are based on Seder Olam Rabbah.  But a literalist reading of that book would give the destruction of the Temple in 423 BCE   way after the accepted dates for eg the Battle of Marathon (490 BC) or Xerxes' invasion of Greece (480 BC); so a wholesale new chronology for the entire history of Classical Greece would have to be found  which nobody seriously believes is credible.  (See Missing years (Hebrew calendar).

So people who use the Seder Olam Rabbah dates (though not eg chabad.org ) generally adjust them to make the destruction of the temple match its date in the Babylonian records, viz. 586 BCE.  

Adding that shift to Kantor's dates gives 1476 BCE for the Exodus, 1043 BCE for Saul, and 782 BCE for Isaiah (compare Chronology of the Bible).  Modern views tend to revise the numbers down very slightly (see eg Kingdom of Judah).  So Wellhausen's dates still match contemporary scholarship pretty much exactly.

Furthermore, what is important for Wellhausen's history is the relative dates of these events.  Even if one prefers not to add the absolute date shift, it makes no difference to the relative chronology of the events, and the relative dates between them.

I don't think therefore that this can be seen as a substantive objection to Wellhausen.    

I'm not sure I have ever seen Wellhousen mentioned to have been familiar with Seder Olam.
You seem to be well versed, so I need not explain to you how Greek chronology is rather problematic in itself.
What modern academics do with dates to support their individual hypothesis about record keeping in various ancient cultures is of course their province, but this particular subject, if it is to be consistent, can not be """"adjusted"""" to match sources outside of its innate culture, or time, never mind that many academics who postulate the chronologies you suggest are neither Jewish, nor even monotheistic. 
I note that the Missing years (Hebrew calendar) completely lacks citations, so its hard to say who and how argues for """"the modern secular dating"""". In any case, I will make sure to include a link to that article and will try to fix the citations in it.
Chronology of the Bible article, besides being likewise poorly cited, has four other templates at the top {{confusing|date=June 2008}}{{disputed|date=June 2008}}{{refimprove|date=June 2008}}{{totally-disputed|date=June 2008}}{{Cleanup|date=April 2007}} however, I will get to that also eventually. 
This article is about the Torah. Textual criticism is really not the place for it given the volumes of published works on the subject, so I'd like to keep that short. My point with the dates was to illustrate that not all 19th century theories about the Torah were well founded.Meieimatai 

The dates need not be """"scholarly"""". They come from a source consistent with the method by which chronology has been established within the culture for which this text is held as the core source of social construct. I'd say that it has every right to adopt whatever dating it desires for its purposes. Lack of faith by the academic textual analysts is not required, however, deletion of what constitutes cultural me",0

 Re:CUplex 

Hello Tungilik!

Unfortunately, you cannot, even tough you work and have access information at the City of North Battleford because no original research says """"original research used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published sources exist"""" which means if an article has no sources it cannot be notable and hence counted as original research per General notability guideline.

Make sure that your sources must be reliable, if you want to know if a source is reliable. WP:SOURCE says """"a source material must have been published, the definition of which for our purposes is made available to the public in some form. Unpublished materials are not considered reliable"""" You can use university-level textbooks, books published by respected publishing houses, magazines, journals and mainstream newspapers as reliable sources. Never use blogs as sources as WP:NEWSBLOG says """"Never use blog posts that are left by readers as sources. For personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources.""""

Wikipedia strongly prefer """"free"""" files, wherever possible. When no """"free"""" file exist, it sometimes to ask a permission to use a non-free (copyright-protected) file under the """"fair use"""" provision. Ideally, most free files should be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons instead of Wikipedia. 

In uploading images, only logged in users with autoconfirmed accounts are allowed to upload images. Now, you first find out whether the image is legal in the United States (where the Wikipedia servers are located) also, if the image has not been released (to your knowledge) under a license, and is still under copyright you must gain permission to use the image from the copyright holder. Next if you're finish, determine which image copyright tag is applicable for your file.

In the procedure of uploading it, You can upload an image by using the Upload file link on the left side of the main page under Toolbox. Use good filenames because some filenames (such as highly generic filenames produced automatically by digital cameras) are disallowed, and attempting to use them will generate an error message.

So we're back at the point we were before - is there something special about the relationship between Hagos and Biasutti that allows this transfer of expertise just by citation? My point is that it takes years of training, experience and recognition by others in the field to be considered an expert in that field. You seem to be saying Hagos got it just by citing Biasutti. If David Attenborough cited Niels Bohr would he become an expert in Physics? No he wouldn't, he'd just be an expert in biology who happened to cite an expert in physics once - we wouldn't be able to accept anything he said about quantum mechanics or block holes as fact until we checked it with a genuine expert in the field. So what makes you think Hagos has become an expert in human skin colour just by citing Biasutti? And remember that the policy doesn't just state """"expert"""",  it states """"established expert in the topic whose previous work in the field has been published by reliable third-party publications"""" - unless you are you going to argue that Hagos got Biasutti's reputation and previous publications as well I think this is a dead end argument. You should accept that Hagos doesn't meet the criteria laid down by the WP policy for the creators of self-published sources.
If you don't think that Hagos chose the colours for each country then who do you think did it? They didn't just magically change due to """"migration trends"""" - somebody made a decision that colour X goes in country Y. From the evidence we have it would appear that Hagos was the one who made that decision - it certainly wasn't made by Biasutti or the writers of the national census data that he cites as his sources.
It makes no difference to the situation so I won't argue it, but for the record I don't accept that Hagos is a recognised expert on migration.

 Aoyama Tanemichi 

This is certainly a promising page but for the english wikipedia it has a lot (too many) Japanese characters. I would suggest to restrict this mostly to the name of the person itself.

en: ウイキで、メイン話題の「関係ない」漢字を書けない方が良いと思います。WP:MOS-JA#Using Japanese in the article bodyと同じい。

例えば、University of Tokyoの場合、そのページのなかで「東京帝國大學」と「東京大学」などが書かれているので、他のページで漢字を書けなくて良いの意味があります。漢字を知りたい人がUniversity of Tokyoで見える。 
As for the proper noun ( specifically the noun of the past-historic ), to translate Japanese into English is improper.Because, the English translation way to their Japanese of being common isn't decided.
For example, as for 東京帝國大學醫科大學校, the systematic organization was different from the present University of Tokyo. Or the Aoyama internal medicine (青山内科) is a popular name and is not a formal name.

Tsuki no Misaki
Tsuki no Misaki will become an article with enormous quantity.

Incorrect:

""""will"""" is simple future, used to express certainty:
Example: The sun will rise tomorrow
 
That is not certain here. More correctly
Tsuki no Misaki should become an article with enormous quantity. (that which you think is proper)
Tsuki no Misaki may become an article with enormous quantity. (that which you think is possible)
Tsuki no Misaki could become an article with enormous quantity. (that which you think is possible)
Tsuki no Misaki probably will become an article with enormous quantity. (that which you think is strongly possible, but not inevitable)

""""Enormous"""" is usually used for physical things and/or things which are larger than normal or too large:
Humpback whales are enormous mammals.
Global warming is an enormous problem.

Equally important, mere size is not the issue, since Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate (unsorted, unorganized) collection of information. Quality counts, since an encyclopedia is a digest  a summary  of information on topics.

The area may deserve an article: it does NOT deserve a block-by-block and street-by-street description of the entire chome, especially since there is NO organizational principle holding them together. Any reader from outside Tokyo  any reader outside that neighborhood, in fact  will NOT understand in the slightest how any part fits in with any other part.

"t-mans comments 

having had a third opnion by someone with more knowldge of the subject, what t-mans posted is factually correct even if as pointed out by the editor in need of some copy-editing  

some copy-editing later
an editor came up with this:

Alongside Clayface, a resurrected one-off concept from 1940 (there are 6 resurrections in total).

In the 1970s, new Batman villains begin to adopt influences from horror and realistic crime fiction (secret agent films), first with Man-Bat (who unlike Batman, is a real human/animal hybrid) and the later with the master criminal Ra's Al Ghul and his daughter Talia, the first villains to learn Batman's identity. (very ok!!!)

The less famous villan, but often equally charismatic Ventriloquist, KGBeast, Black Mask and Killer Croc emerged iduring the 1980s.

More common criminals, such as the Gotham mob leader Carmine Falcone were also added to the villain lineup

The 1990s were notorious for the introduction of the Joker's assistant, Harley Quinn who appeard exclusivley in the cartoon series.

Bane, was the only villain to physically humble Batman. Hush and a new Red Hood are the most famous inductees in the 2000s, due to their connections to Batman's past

Plato not """"part of the Socratic entourage"""" or """"inner circle""""?
At the beginning of the Plato and Socrates section of the article, someone had said, """"Plato made himself seem as though he were part of the Socratic entourage but never says so explicitly.  ...  In the Apology, Plato distances himself from the inner circle.""""  I believe this involves a misunderstanding of how Plato represents himself in the Apology.  I would not be prepared to say that Plato considered himself """"part of Socrates' entourage"""" or Socrates' """"inner circle""""; but that's only because it's not clear what whoever wrote this part of the article means by """"entourage"""" or """"inner circle"""".  Is it made clear elsewhere in Plato's dialogues who did belong to the """"inner circle""""?  So far as I know, Plato never mentions an """"inner circle"""".  But he certainly portrays himself in the Apology as one of Socrates' young devoted followers, in quite explicit terms in fact.  Given this fact, I think it's simply misleading to suggest that Plato somehow went out of his way to """"distance himself"""" from Socrates or Socrates' devoted followers.  So I've edited this part of the article accordingly, including textual citations.  Comment if you wish.  """,0

 Withdrawn charges 

The London Free press also reported that his charges were withdrawn silently. Now from the perspective of a normal criminal process, this usually means the police had a weak case. The fact that the police were gung-ho about this case may also suggest that the police had no case at all (judging by the seemingly high-profile aspect to this case). In other words, Homeontherange's addition of that information is a pretty clear sign that the information is being added in order to disparage James Scott Richardson.

What is my point of reference? Well. When I added information to Alex Kulbashian and Richard Warman about a Canadian Human Rights Commission complaint file by Alex against Richard, Homeontherange removed the information stating that the complaint could have been filed, however it wasn't serious enough to because there was no evidence the Commissioner signed off on it. Now, getting back to this case, the crown attorney and/or withdrew the charges because there was no prospect for conviction.

To Homeontherange: If you are going to have double standards in """"enforcing"""" wikipedia's criteria for information posted in articles, then that shows your political motivation behind your edits and the way you handle your """"administrative"""" tasks. That would be classified as Administrator Abuse Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_abuse. Furthermore, the fact that the IP address 72.136.34.96 spontaneously lost the ability to make edits without logging in with no explanation could also show a certain level of abuse of administrative rights (by the way. Will be reporting that to Jimbo Wales). So feel free to revert the edit I've made, but make an attempt to justify your actions this time.""",0

It was not a personal attack, but rather a racist remark about Indians in general. No, I did not accuse Anir1uph of being unfamiliar with the English language because he is Indian, his nationality was irrelevant. Anir1uph showed failure to use the English language correctly, common practice among non-native English speakers. I am fed up with uneducated third world citizens who edit Wikipedia according to their own POV. Anir1uph is a pretentious editor and forms fart of a larger Indian demographic who subtly edit Wikipedia pushing their own POV, using weasel words and do not adhere to consensus. There is a growing concern among a considerable number of White Western editors that due to the increased availability of computers and the internet around the world - the number of uneducated third world citizens with a POV agenda to their edits is rising rapidly. Nationalism is a large factor in this and it isn't healthy for the Wikipedia community. There is an ongoing clash of culture and outlooks, Asians view the world differently than Europeans and North Americans. In my opinion the sooner editors are restricted to editing Wikipedia in their native tongue the better. 

I will hold my hands up for my disliking of India and the Indian population, I have a ferocious and bitter attitude towards them, but not hatred. I pity India and its misfortune - 5,000 Children die every day in India under the age of 5, how sad.

Thank you. My problem was with labeling Achilles a """"sexual predator."""" Presumably Sommerstein will go on to identifying Daedaluas as the first aviator and Andromache as the first feminist. Without in any way denying the existence of sexual predation then and now, this particular use of the phrase strikes me as homophobic. It raises the question, which other (nonmurderous) sexual predators he is thinking of? Solon? Socrates? Aeschines? I can only view it as a homophobic remark directed at the Greeks in general. If so, that raises questions about the propriety of repeating it here.

To add to that, what information do we have on the respective ages of the two? Am I mistaken or was Troilus described as a boupais? It has been a while since I studied the topic, but I seem to recall he was nineteen when he died, one year short of the magic twenty needed to save Troy. Achilles, on the other hand, was sixteen when he shed his female garb and left with Oedipus to join the battle, I believe. And the killing is said to have happened early in the war. So what can Sommerstein be editorializing about? An adolescent preying upon an adult?

On a separate note, I never saw anything claiming that Achilles fell in love with Polyxena at the same time as with Troilus. Everything points to his lying in wait at the Lion fountain expressly to get the boy, not the girl (though it may be significant that she was sacrificed by the Greeks at his tomb).

One more thing - when the brothers (which ones?) of Troilus ride - too late - to his rescue, Achilles meets them in Apollo's temple with an unusual weapon: Troilus' head, which he is swinging around by the hair. It is such a gory detail, it would be a pity to not include it, I just no longer have the sources.  """,0

 From User talk:Jimbo Wales I wonder if you might consider...

I wonder if you might consider simply removing your political/religious/etc.  userboxes and asking others to do the same.  This seems to me to be the best way to quickly and easily end the userbox wars.

Userboxes of a political or, more broadly, polemical, nature are bad for the project.  They are attractive to the wrong kinds of people, and they give visitors the wrong idea of what it means to be a Wikipedian.

I think rather than us having to go through a mass deletion (which is what is likely to happen if the userbox fad doesn't go away), it will be better to simply change the culture, one person at a time.  Will you help me? 

 From WikiEN-l [...]

The current situation with these things being in the main Template namespace, and promoted as if healthy and normal in the Wikipedia namespace, is that they are damaging to our culture.  They are attracting the wrong sort of people, and giving newcomers the wrong idea of what it means to be a Wikipedian.

That's why they need to go.  Not to censor people's self-expression, but to make it clear that as a whole the community considers these things to be divisive and inappropriate. Jimmy Wales (jwales at wikia.com)

A report by the WAG in 2003  discussed access to CIA, and the tone of the report indicates that they consider CIA to be a major destination (although they do not specifically state that). The tail end of the report mentions that the contractors' preferred option is a new trunk road toward the CIA (section 4.6.3), and that the route to the airport, both in the short and longer term proposals, be considered for adoption as a trunk road.

"""]], and use Uchiha Sasuke's profile as a template for how it's used.  14:18, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

 Naruto/Sasuke Yaoi 

Is this really necessary? This is mearly a fandom among female fans. The two characters are obvious not gay in Kishimoto's story and this dose not need a whole section or even a paragraph.  

I dislike Yaoi myself so I distrusted my initial instinct to just do away with it, but prompted by your comment I think I'll just go ahead and act on it. - 

Personally, I'm a great fan of Yaoi, especially of NaruSasu. However, I don't think it has a place on this page. Yaoi pairings exist of practically every male manga character, it's nothing special. The only thing which might make Naruto and Sasuke's relation more special then other Yaoi pairings, is that, for a shounen manga, their relationship is very deep and emotional. Not to mention the enourmous amount of Shounen-ai scenes ^^
Still, even this isn't that special or unique. And it wouldn't justify a seperate section. A small footnote, perhaps...not it's own heading 

Naruto has acknowledged Sasuke as being like a brother to him, so that might change the Yaoi perspective, at least from Naruto's standpoint?

i hate yaoi, but we gotta admit that Naruto's seeming obliviousness toward any female's attraction to him makes him and sasuke prime yaoi-bait

 Sasuke's name? 

Sasuke is named after """"Sarotobi Sasuke"""" or something right? Well I went to the article, and took the kanji characters, and I got two that kind of mean the same thing: help(佐助). So shouldn't this be in the Trivia section? I'm just checking.

Why should Sasuke give a crap about his clan I mean Naruto had it worst then him he didn't have any parents,doesn't have any friends,crappy at jutsu,and suffered from something he didn't cause.Sasuke on the other hand had natural talent, the girls loved him,and if he's going to restore his clan than then whats the fuzz

 Question 

I just have a question. When Sasuke and Naruto fought for the last time, it seemed as though their powers were equally matched. However, does that imply that if Sasuke used a higher level of the Cursed Seal, he would have become more powerful than Naruto even while he was using the Nine-Tails' chakra?

Probably not. I'm pretty sure it's stated in the data books that the Heaven Seal (which Anko and Sasuke both have) is the strongest type of seal, and so far no evidence of anything above Level 2 Cursed Seals exist.  """,0

 More on Protocols/Procedures/Courtesy 

Hi Bov,
Thanks so much for your kind reply. Our discussion was getting so long it was unwieldy to scroll though, so I thought I'd continue under a new heading. Hope you have no objection.
I'm still under the gun with that project I mentioned and am amazed that my last note was as long as it is!! Wanted to reply to a few points for the moment...I'm using numbered points because it makes it easier for you (and me) to refer back to.
1. Regardingn my making a clear distinction between me/us and """"your editorial colleagues"""", yes, you're right. I guess I don't know enough about WikiP yet, but I clearly don't have access to the same """"additional facilities"""" (which I take to mean """"tools"""") as you, so I don't have the same control.
Sure, I could put a Copyvio on someone's page, but I rather doubt it would stay there any more than my {db}s did  I assume Copyvio notices are either 1. sent to all admins (or those who deal with Copyvios specifically), and/or 2. posted to the Copyvio page for you and your colleagues to make some sort of determination on. From what you say above, it appears that some Uber Admin(s) makes the final determination.
2. Also regarding """"tools"""" I and, I suspect, most WikiP contributors have no power to Lock and page to insure it doesn't get Reverted by anyone else. Nor can we Delete a page, even our own. Nor do we have access, as I assume you do, to EB and other pay services to check for likely infringements.
There are even several services used by educational institutions which faculty regularly use to check for plagiarism in term papers, theses, etc. Perhaps you also have access to those? You didn't indicate how that EB page was accessed since the public can only get the """"teaser"""" entry for Crapsey.
Thus, to paraphrase your quote and the old axiom: """"we are all peers, with equal power to edit, but some of us are more equal than others!""""
3. Regarding your statement that it's """"actually relatively rare for a copyvio to be contested, and most pass without comment,"""" are you saying that once a Copyvio is pointed out, the """"offending contributor"""" simply concedes the point and allows the page to be removed without so much an objection?!! That's truly astouonding  I'd imagine that most folks do not deliberately borrow from others, however similiar the contents might be.
Have no idea what you mean by """"the ones that are contested often end up in the sections at the top of the page."""" Can you point me to a sample of this?
4. Regarding your statement that """"he EB page I'm referring to is , the one originally referenced  what do you mean? Referenced by whom? By your colleague?
Or are you obliquely saying that WikiP has the means of reading contributor hard drive caches and Recent URL lists to determine where they've been?! I know I didn't reference EB and don't know how you access their pay service, but if you're in fact suggesting that WikiP can somehow monitor member hard drives, I'd find that VERY disturbing...an outright privacy violation. Will run AdAware & Spybot S&D; just to see if anything they regard as """"malicious"""" turns up with WikiP fingerprints on it! ;-) 
5. On your reply to 3 above that """"Wikipedia does not, in general, use text 'with permission,' """" I'm confused. The passage I quoted suggests that the authors are granting WikiP a GFDL """"license,"""" which, from my understanding of the law, means """"with permission."""" The author still """"owns"""" the material and, presumably can make whatever other use s/he wants of it but cannot expect payment from WikiP, restrict the editing of, or, for that matter, even withdraw permission for work submitted to WikiP.
6. Regarding your answer to 5 above that you """"don't have access to any special posting info. It's all available to everyone, although some of it is better hidden or harder to use,"""" this sort of relates to my #1 immediately above, and I guess I'm confused again. How in the world would Admins and other """"watchers"""" like you (still don't know what your title is) know """"what's new"""" on WikiP if you don't get notices or have some list you can comb through? Are you saying there's an actual public list of all new articles? If so, where is it, and what prompts you folks to check one article vs. another?
Again, thanks. Will try and get back later or tomorrow.

"Salut 

Hi Dc76! About Anittas, I regret very much what happened to him, and I maintain that he was dealt with too harshly, and I intended to protest his indefinite block. However, he informed me that he has decided to leave Wikipedia, and that even if the block can be shortened that he is not interested in returning. I find his decision unfortunate, but that is his own choice. 

As for Moldova, thanks for your offer of help. The article is in a rather sorry state, and I always had it at the top of my list but never quite got around to it. Indeed, there is much work to be done. I am trying to make the article follow the guidelines listed on Wikipedia:WikiProject Countries. As my model, I have other featured articles on countries, such as Belgium, Turkey, and Germany. The problem is that now there is little structure to the Moldova article and much random (and some inaccurate) information. Of course, if there is relevant data, I don't want it lost, so if it's just too detailed for the main article, it should be moved to the sub-articles. My idea for a schedule was to first create the skeleton of the article, meaning that only the sections from the Countries projects should be kept and rest integrated or moved. Then, all the sections need to be reworked, some to be expanded, others made more compact, others need sources (and most existing sources need to be changed to standard formats). Then, various issues of style need to be changed (i.e. to make the article pretty), which means finding some nice images, making the tables look nicer, etc. And finally, the article will need to be copy-edited and checked for errors. So if you want to help, it would be great if you could work on any of those aspects, or any other. See you around!",0

Fetal Pain (cont.)

Fetal pain, its existence, and its implications are debated politically and academically, particularly in regards to the abortion debate.

Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques.""""""""Fetal Pain: A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence"""" JAMA. 2005;294:947-954.

Can a fetus feel pain?. Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance. Retrieved December 14, 2005.  Most medical researchers agree pain cannot be felt until the third trimester of pregnancy or until after birth.""""Study: Fetus feels no pain until third trimester"""" MSNBC

There may be an """"emerging consensus among developmental neurobiologists that the establishment of thalamocortical connections"""" (at about 26 weeks) is a critical event with regard to fetal perception of pain.  Nevertheless, because pain can involve sensory, emotional and cognitive factors, it is """"impossible to know"""" when painful experiences may become possible, even if it is known when thalamocortical connections are established.Johnson, Martin and Everitt, Barry.  Essential reproduction (Blackwell 2000): """"The multidimensionality of pain perception, involving sensory, emotional, and cognitive factors may in itself be the basis of conscious, painful experience, but it will remain difficult to attribute this to a fetus at any particular developmental age.""""

Status, let me ask you somethingwhere do you think these budget quotes you put up as gospel come from?  They come from people at these websites evaluating the information available to them.

In their perfect world, nobody would know what they spent on their moviesthey'd announce a preliminary figure before one frame of film was shot, and no matter how much higher the actual expenses went, that's what people would quote.  But we're curious to know, and it's part of how we decide how well (or poorly) a given film did, so in the very rare event that somebody directly at the center of financing a given film says """"Budget was Mid-30's"""", that's actually a big deal to a site like box office mojo.  They take that very seriously, and they will use that to base a budget estimate onknowing full well that's not the exact figure, and neither they nor any other website will ever have the exact figure.  No movie ever costs exactly 10 million, 20 million, 100 million, etc.  It's always approximate.  It's never exact.  And it's usually lowballed, because studios want people to think they made more money than they really did (or in this case, that they lost less money than they really did).

 Is it too late to join (The elections are only what, a month away)
 If I can join, what still needs to be done.

Please use a talkback to inform me if you respond.

Thanks,  Talk """,0

Your request for rollback

Hi Leszek Jańczuk.  After reviewing your request for rollback, I have enabled rollback on your account.  Keep in mind these things when going to use rollback:
Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.
If you no longer want rollback, contact me and I'll remove it.  Also, for some more information on how to use rollback, see Wikipedia:New admin school/Rollback (even though you're not an admin).  I'm sure you'll do great with rollback, but feel free to leave me a message on my talk page if you run into troubles or have any questions about appropriate/inappropriate use of rollback.  Thank you for helping to reduce vandalism.  Happy editing!   ''''''  Let's talk about it! """,0

Eurasian and African mitochondrial DNA influences in the Saudi Arabian population

Macrohaplogroup M
Five of the eight M Saudi Arab lineages clustered into the M1 African haplogroup. Three of them had the 16359 transition that was diagnostic of the M1a East African cluster, and the remaining one belonged to the rare but widespread M1b1 cluster characterized in the HVSI region by 16185 transition and the 16190d deletion that had been identified in the northwest Africa, Jordan, and the Iberian Peninsula [27]. The other three M sequences belonged to Indian clades. One had the basic motif (16126, 16223) of the M3 haplogroup [28]. A second had the 15928 and 16304 transitions that defined haplogroup M25 [29], although this sequence [see Additional file 1] did not match any of the definite or putative M25 sequences found in India [29-31] or Pakistan [26].   

M1 originated in Africa (Semino)
The Genetic Legacy of Paleolithic Homo sapiens
Conversely, all non-M mtDNAs of non-African origin analysed so far carry 10873T. These data indicate that the **transition 10400 C>T, which defines haplogroup M**, arose on an African background characterized by the ancestral state 10873C, which is also present in four primate (common and pygmy chimps, gorilla and orangutan) mtDNA sequences.

Hello Mr.feedhigh 
there are few things i want to make you clear
1)
why I wrote descended from """"old royal families in Nepal"""" not just Mallas is because i have some tangible evidence for this """" I myself is a newar and I think you know for a fact that most newars has an old god or a place dedicated to worship the old gods called """" Kul devta / kul devta mandir"""". Our temple is located in Balkumari hill (near Balkumari mandir in Patan) according to the """"purohit """" of the temple who also happens to be our """"purohit"""" (Sorry I can't find a good translation for this word """"purohit"""" in english) has a recorded document (I can provide the document if you like to examine it, also give you the contact address of the purohit himself, whos living near Mangal Bazzar even today) states that the """"kul devta"""" temple was erected at the time of Bhaskar verma by his second son Diwakar verma as a tribute to the god called """"Bhairav"""" and thats how were descended and still worship the same place and temple even till this day. Also according to the same purohit we adopted """"Shrestha"""" (changed from Verma) in the time of jayasthitti Malla (the reasons purohit told my there was a lot of instability in Patan and family feuds happening , but am not sure the exact reasons. If you want details, like I said I can give you the contact of  the """"purohit"""" who gave me this information you can also go to him to examine the document. Hence, this is the reason I wrote descended from old royal families in Nepal.

Second you removed [during shah dynasty] yes it seems ironic serving the same people who later happen took our whole race out of power but there is a lot of history here too and history has to be written as it happened . What can i say is that you have to accept defeat sometimes , but it doesn't mean we will always be defeated , or accept that defeat for all eternity ( All I want to say is .This 2006 revolt where you probably think a  lot of Newars participated is not the only revolt that Newars has supported , if you look at history from the time of Damodar Pandey to Ranas, lot of Newars has reovlted , be it from house of Tripura from bhaktapur or others that followed it , but as always these revolt has been hijacked , for the most recent I wold like to give you the name Puspe Kamal Dahal """"prachande"""" .As always there is one prachande in the story.

What I want to remind you is that not all the Shah kings were anti Newar .

Review
 With this work, the authors, Mayoury and Pheuiphanh Ngaosyvathn, offer us a wealth of information on the history of a small kingdom, the Lao, centered at Vientiane, in modern Laos, caught between expanding core states (Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam) in the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth century. The authors draw upon a wide literature and an impressive range of languages to present a clear and careful picture of a very complex period in Lao and Southeast Asian history.

This book is really the story of Chou Anou, the last of the Lao kings of Vientiane and his struggle against rivals on all sides. Chou Anou played a political game between the expansionist Thai and Vietnamese states in the late eighteenth and ear]y nineteenth centuries, a game that his kingdom eventually lost. Because of the Tay Son, Vietnam was out of the picture for decades; the central Thai court was Chou Anou's chief antagonist. When Vietnam does enter the picture again under Minh Mang, it is as a supporter of Chou Anou, in the context of a larger Thai-Vietnamese competitive hostility. Fighting between Thailand and Vientiane appears on an extremely personal level in the text — the authors stressing at one point Rama III's anxiety that a massacre of Vietnamese emissaries and Lao guides by a Thai officer had not left enough dead, considering an earlier massacre of Thai by Chou Anou in Vientiane (p. 242); they stress also the personal nature of the fighting between Chou Anou and the Thai general Bodin. Further, the text seems almost to replicate, anachronistically, aspects of war more endemic to the post-World-War II conflicts in Indochina, including a reference to """"sophisticated Siamese psychological operations"""" (p. 212).

Paths to Conflagration is organized into nine chapters, each covering a different episode of the period, examined step-by-step, and turns from one incarnation of Vientiane to another — from victim to provocateur to buffer state. Each page is heavy with documentation, but the narrative is lighter. This book has three real strengths. First, it discusses history at the point of intersection between three different polities and does not apply the nation-state """"cookie-cutter"""" approach — looking only at developments as they relate to a state-centered narrative (thus framed by political borders). Instead of the history of Laos, we find here the history of a very turbulent period in which political borders did not mean very much in delineating the boundaries of action. Second, this book makes use of a very wide range of sources, especially from the Thai archives, spanning a large number of languages (including Lao, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, French, English, and German — both primary sources and secondary literature) and a multitude of perspectives. Third, this book focuses attention on developments sometimes left out of analyses of mainland Southeast Asian history, such as the all-important impact of migration, especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is no mistake that migration is referred to over and over again in chronicles of the period, from western Burma to Vietnam, and that migration is used as metaphor for political change and state reformation for far earlier periods in these chronicles. Here too, migration played a very important role, as the authors stress both migration into the Lao kingdom, and forcible expulsion by the Thais, as a basis for the well-being and even survival of the Vientiane-based state.

Against merge
The Uvs Nuur has already been confused by making the article about the lake instead of the basin. Much of the relevant information has been removed or confused in the merge or copy/paste or whatever an editor did. The hollow, although lumped in with the World Heritage site is really about a different set of issues including nomadic peoples, archeology sites, enormous variation in terrain, endangered animals etc. The current article on Uvs Nuur seems to have missed all the relevant points on the geological aspects, plus the name of the article is different from the name given on World Heritage Site. Further, the editors have disregarded that almost all citations are about the basin; there is hardly anything in the article about the lake. 

If you refuse to allow editors to write articles that they are interested in, and insist on an instant mindless merge, we can have an RFC, which I will abide by, unless you consent to a rewrite of the current article so it is accurate and not confusing. Why do you have such an investment in preventing other editors from writing articles about what they are interested in. It is against policy to #REDIRECT without a discussion which is what was done before. Please consider this, rather than instinctively merge everything.

"""

As a Wikipedia, I am aware of the three main guidelines for editing articles about living people and feel I have not strayed from them in my editing of the article about Paul Offit. 

On Neutral Point of View:

 I was merely stating the conflict of interest of the """"studies"""" done by the committee affiliated with the AAP claiming that the Rotateq vaccine was safe when the very academy this committee is a part of takes bribes from the very corporation that manufactures the vaccine, Merck. Clearly, these people who receive hundred-thousand dollar contributions from vaccine makers are completely unreliable on topics such as vaccine safety. Studies allegedly confirming the safety of a product should never be considered reliant if done by those who would profit off them.Besides, 89 patients have been given the vaccine and died. This along with the conflict of interest done by those who claimed the vaccine was """"safe"""" shows that there is no reliable evidence that rotateq is safe. 

Verifiability: 

I provided valid links, 1 to Medalerts describing the adverse effects where Rotateq was administered and the patient died. 88 of such cases can be found on the website. The second to CBS news in which Sharyl Atkisson reveals hundred thousand-dollar contributions taken by the AAP from pharmaceutical corporations such as Merck and Wyeth.For deaths associated with Rotateq: 

http://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?LOWAGE=&HIGHAGE;=&VAX;=ROTHB5&SEX;=&VAXCNT;=&STATE;=&VAXMAN;=&VAX;_DATE_LOW=&VAX;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXLOT;=&ONSET;_DATE_LOW=&ONSET;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXDOSE;=&SUB;_DATE_LOW=&SUB;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXROUTE;=&REPORT;_DATE_LOW=&REPORT;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXSITE;=&L;_THREAT=&PRIOR;_VAX=&ER;_VISIT=&CUR;_ILL=&HOSPITAL;=&HISTORY;=&X;_STAY=&SYMPTOMS;=&RECOVD;=&LAB;_DATA=&DISABLE;=&OTHER;_MEDS=&DIED;=Yes&V;_ADMINBY=&DEATH;_DATE_LOW=&DEATH;_DATE_HIGH=&V;_FUNDBY=&PAGENO;=1&action;=Find&PERPAGE;=10&SORTING;=NONE For conflict of interest within AAP: 

http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/25/cbsnews_investigates/main4296175.shtml 

Original Research:

 This is not original research as nothing added made any definitive claims beyond what was stated in the sources. The fact that infant patients who were administered the vaccine, including a set of twins died after receiving it and that the evidence provided attempting to show the vaccine is safe was essentially done by an organization tied in with the vaccine manufacturer shows that there is no reliable proof that the vaccine is safe. 

Despite my keeping within the Wikipedia guidelines, I was repeatedly blocked by User:MastCell, my citations deleted. Some were on the excuse of """"libelous,"""" but they were all factually verifiable, and had cited sources. So then I wrote in these same facts again and along with how User:MastCell is acting as a minion of Paul Offit by censoring all negative information about him however true and violating Wikipedia's guidelines as a responsible administrator. Angered, he has blocked me indefinitely for """"personal attacks,"""" when I merely wrote them in response to his own abuse of power by censoring anything negative albeit factual about Paul Offit as """"libelous."""" Ironically, MastCell violates all of the above. His verifiability for stating Rotateq is safe comes from a Merck-funded Association, his neutrality is limited to the point of censoring any negative information about Paul Offit that is verifiable, correct and unobjective, his original research comes from drawing the erroneous conclusion that Rotateq is safe on the basis of """"studies"""" essentially funded and determined by the drug's own manufacturers. Therefore, I appeal to nullify my week-long blocking. I would also suggest blocking User:MastCell as he has actually violated Wikipedia Terms of Use himself, especially since he holds the responsibility as an administrator, the basis on which he has used to block me.""",0

While I am somewhat dissapointed by D'Adamo's lack of footnotes, and frustrated by his avoidance of indexes, I haven't yet found a credible direct dispute to any significant claims of his. I am aware of a text that might indicate behavior of lectins on stomach tissuus would need to be directly studied, but I wasn't willing to spend in excess of $200 US (iirc) to find out what exactly it found, depite it being a """"real"""" scientificly strict (apparently, as I didn't actually get to read the) study. 
While not as rigourously strict with the science as it should be (at least what is presented in his books) ER4YT doesn't seem to be significantly paranormal or disprovable. So while it has a stigma of pseudoscience, that stigma hasn't really been justified.  Some supposed refutation I have come across turned out to be of even poorer quality, either reflecting it's own pseudoscience, or a lack of familiarity with the nominal subject. I would really like to see some explicit, maybe even rigorous debunking of D'Adamo's (occasionaly controversial? I can't see why) offerings. As of yet, I consider this closer to protoscience than unfalsifiable pseudoscience. 
In any case, I don't think that anything I previously posted on this matter is all that fantastic.

 You are in violation of Wikipedia:Civility 

Since it has been months and you have refused to address it, I am soon going to take action through the appropriate channels in Wikipedia.  In Wikipedia:Civility it clearly states that you can't lie about users, such as outlined here (in regard to my arbitration committee ruling).  In the future, I suggest that if you make a ruling against someone, you don't simply make up dozens of claims against them out of thin air.

The problem is that when you make them up, instead of reading through what the person said to try to """"spin"""" what they've said, chances are you won't be able to find any supporting links as evidence.  This was evidence by one of your more bold claims of """"Cite your sources"""", where you provided zero (0) links as evidence.  The fact that you couldn't come up with anything upon request on the mailing list doesn't help your case either (you actually stopped replying completely once I very thoroughly outlined the many places I did cite sources).  This really is your last chance to dig and find something.

In case you're wondering, I was just kind of bored, which is why I didn't get around to this until now.  In retrospect, I find the myriad of accusations (lies) you put with zero (0) supporting links to be appalling.  If I remember correctly, you easily added over 75% of them personally.   """,0

To be very blunt, I do not believe you. Checkuser data indicates with almost absolute certainty that all of these accounts are unquestionably being operated by the same person. So many questions arise now... I want legitimate answers to these:
How did some of the accounts you claim are completely unrelated to you find out about the WikiCup and sign up for it?
Why did you sign up for the Wikicup with accounts you claim you were only going to use as bots? 
How do your neighbors manage to have absolutely identical hardware and software (not common software either) installed on their computer that you do, and edit with the same mobile devices? The same with your pen pal. Strange...
Why are you letting your older brother access your accounts? 
Why did you lie to me and say that Reborn American was your brother, and that you now have his computer, when I can see clearly from checkuser data that that account has never accessed Wikipedia using anything other than an iPhone?
To be honest, if you had said from the beginning that they were all being operated by you, I would have warned you not to do it in the future, and probably left it at that. Now that I know that you are not securing your accounts from your own brother... Not to mention knowing that you are willing to flat-out lie to me.... Let me just leave it at, my attitude is slightly different now. gabsadds 

I'm not trying to lie (in fact I never lie when it comes to serious matters just like this) but I'm serious about every single detail. I'm afraid I'll just leave it like that. Please don't block me for what my brother did. I can't take anymore criticisms and hatred  because of what I am and what I think.    

Ps. These are my answers. 
1. I told them about this competition and they were very interested so I told them """"Go ahead. Do it.""""
2. I said Runs like a cheeta, stings like a bee and IronMöogol8.0 were going to be my bots and they weren't on the signup list.
3. My father works for a computer company and he built some for my neighbors and for my penpal in Tusla. The mobile devices, however, I'm confused about too.
4. I didn't. He would take my accounts by force.
5. I said my younger brother is Reborn American and I own my older brother's computer. Other than the time he used his account on my iPhone, her forgets that he has an account and edits on mine instead.
6. Everything is true.

Fine, I'm sticking with Secret Saturdays.

Unseen Warfare
 Hi there,
The title Unseen Warfa",0
"I'm still awaiting an explanation as to why my careful and accurate sourcing of statements in this article was vandalized while I was away during the past three weeks.  When I added the archival sources many months ago, they were approved by a Wikipedia editor.  Moreover not only were the archival references recently vandalized, but also the reference to my published article in Brief Chronicles, a peer-reviewed academic journal, was deleted.  These archival sources cannot be characterized as 'original research'.  As noted earlier on this page, Alan Nelson's book is merely a series of quotations from these same archival sources stitched together with a bit of commentary.  If my transcripts of these archival sources (readily available to everyone on my webpage) are 'original research' and thus to be banned under Wikipedia's policy, then so is Alan's book, for the same reason, namely that it's largely a series of quotations from archival sources.  And as stated earlier, Alan misinterprets these sources, thus generating factual errors.  For example, re the Brincknell incident, Alan deliberately conflates William Waters, one of the jurors in the coroner's inquest into the death of Thomas Brincknell, and Oxford's servant, William Walter.  On p. 48, Alan writes of the coroner's inquest that:

>The 17 jurymen were, however, as compliant as the jury was packed: one juryman, William Waters, was Oxford's own servant.<

Alan clearly knew this statement to be false since he himself transcribed the testimony of Oxford's servant, William Walter, in a 1599 lawsuit in which William Walter described himself as being 50 years of age on 8 May 1599.  See Alan's transcript at:

http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~ahnelson/RUSWEL/ruswel07.html

Oxford's servant, William Walter, was thus almost the same age as the 17-year-old Oxford at the time of Thomas Brincknell's death, and could not possibly have served on a jury at that age.  The juryman William Waters was obviously an entirely different person from Oxford's servant, William Walter.  Because he did not like the jury's finding that the death was the result of Brincknell's own actions, Alan deliberately made a false statement about one of the jurors to impugn the jury's finding.  This is merely one among dozens of examples I could cite which demonstrate that no 'fact' stated in Alan's book can be accepted without checking it against archival documents. Nina Green",0

A History Lesson from, The Catholic Knight: 

""""British anti-Catholicism has a long history going back five centuries and reaching the highest levels of British government. It began in the early 16th century when King Henry VIII failed to receive an annulment from the Vatican and subsequently broke English Christianity away from the pope and declared himself the absolute spiritual ruler of the Church of England. He then proceeded on a campaign to persecute and murder all who opposed his personal claim to the """"English papacy."""" Things only went downhill from there. In subsequent generations the throne passed between Catholic and Protestant heirs, each persecuting their political enemies. The final result came under Queen Elizabeth I which settled England as a Protestant country. In the following centuries, England became the leading herald of anti-Catholic propaganda around the world, as the British crown persecuted Irish Catholics and waged war against the Catholic kingdoms of France and Spain.""""

""""Sadly, the more things change the more they stay the same. The world may have moved into the 21st century, but British politics is still locked in the 16th century. To date Catholics are still forbidden from the British royal family. Government officials still mock the pope and the Church behind closed doors. Leading party officials not only refuse to defend the pope's right of innocence until proven guilty, but actually participate in promoting anti-Catholic presumption. Way to go England! Thanks for reminding the world just how little you've progressed in five centuries. Just brilliant! Jolly good show!"""" Malke2010 """,0
"It's a good question. I've kind of gone back and forth on it over the years, but I've been finding lately that when I've been updating licensees as a result of an acquisition, I've been linking the licensees to the owner's page more often (or at least when I remember to do so). In fact, while I was FCC-less today, I was starting to look at categorization of the larger owners, which is kind of related. The only reason I did the iHeartMedia linking today was because I checked my Watchlist last night for the first time in a while, and saw that there'd been a bunch of changes made in error to the licensees a week or so ago. I figured that while I was cleaning them up anyway, adding the link made sense, and then it was suggested to me that the redirects made more sense than the piping.

Yes, I'd say each of the state pages should absolutely be uniform, just the same as how the alphabetical lists are uniform and the frequency pages are at least uniform-ish. I'd lean toward linking all of the columns other than the frequency, although I wouldn't suggest redlinking licensees where the owner doesn't have a page. That said, that's just my opinion - it's a question that should probably be put to the project, to see what those who are still active in the project think. It'd be a big chunk of work to implement if links end up having to be added, although it's the kind of gnoming that's right up my alley, as you know. >)",0

"Totally irrelevant, ego-driven drivel 

And, for the record, NO, this is not a personal attack, just an observation on the total pointlessness of this entry...

Maybe we should all put our CV's on Wikipedia, but I thought that Wiki was attempting to become a credible medium of encyclopeadic information on the Internet, not for self-publicity seeking ego merchants to paste up their life story and that of their woefully un-spectacular personal and family histories.

This entire entry is no more suitable for a page than my life's contribution to the study of Ethiopian-styles of ballroom dancing. It belongs on a Wiki personal page and no more.

Considering that my family tree can be traced to before the Norman invasion of England and I hold an hereditary title (which was once owned by Elizabeth I and Francis Bacon) maybe I could start posting up my little life story and my g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-uncles and g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-grand-daddies and which castles they built, etc. (yawn)  But there again, I am not a vain, egotistical numpty who wants to use Wikipedia as an online CV service - I do wonder if the crypto-consultancy industry needs a few heads at the moment... Hmmmmmmmmmm.

(I only mention dear old Lizzie the First and Nick Bacon as they have actually been heard of by most people)... not becuase I wish to pump up my ego.  In fact, the title was grabbed by Liz after the Reformation, so it wasn't all that good news for us, after all... and certainly not something to be gloating about.

There are loads of unsubstantiated claims in this article, including stats about website hits compared to the CIA... oh yeah, come off it!! -D

I think the German Wikipedians have got it about right...  does not warrant inclusion.

Meanwhile, I'll carry on editing the 2-3 topics that I do know about (Templar History, aviation, and erm... maybe a bit of medieval history too) and I won't try to be all things to all people in offering my omnipotent edits on a variety of subjects that I only know a very little, unlike some of the people on here.  Maybe it's just an attempt to get edit counts ever higher to make oneself look incredibly intelligent and important. And then get supported by all our colleagues from work and our own self-created crypto-society members, etc. to come to our defence when we need them.

Hi John.  In answer to your question about why the UPenn study is inappropriate for the article, I'm reposting a quote from WP:MEDRS: """"any given primary source [such as this study] may be contradicted by another, and the Wikipedia community relies on the guidance of expert reviews, and statements of major medical and scientific bodies, to provide guidance on any given issue."""" 
When I first read  statement, """"We do not use primary sources to refute secondary ones,"""" I was pretty confused.  I mean, primary sources are more fundamental, right?  Well, the idea is just that when the """"secondary source"""" is a systematic review or the like, what that means is that the secondary source has looked at the all primary sources and evaluated their significance and rendered a scientific judgment.  The authors of the secondary source are better able to interpret the primary sources, not only because they are collecting those sources and considering them in the context of all the available evidence, but because those authors are experts in their fields.  We should expect that they understand the data better than we do, or, at the very least, better than the average reader.  Interpreting primary sources is challenging, and when the experts have already done it for us, there is no reason to foist that responsibility on the average reader. 
From my perpsective, the issue of whether it's a press release or a peer reviewed article quoted to describe the UPenn/Philadelphia study is more or less a red herring.  That study is just a single study, and we should trust the public health experts to render judgment rather than ourselves or the readership. I hope this helps answer your question.   """,0

It does not add new external precepts, but proceeds to reform the heart, the root of human acts, where man chooses between the pure and the impure,22 where faith, hope, and charity are formed and with them the other virtues. The Gospel thus brings the Law to its fullness through imitation of the perfection of the heavenly Father, through forgiveness of enemies and prayer for persecutors, in emulation of the divine generosity.""""

Harry Potter has been extremely well received but there is an odd emphasis on negative criticism rather than positive criticism in the reception section.

In fact, if the series wasn't well known then it would be assumed from reading this page that the books were poorly received and little appreciated and that's not the case.

"Nolan Chart? Haven't heard of it until now, and it does not relate to my point, Jacob. If the concept of socialism cannot be broken down into easily digestible concepts for the laymen (or the proletariat) then it will be understood by no one but intellectuals. It is precisely the lack of understanding that makes most people so hostile towards it. Amongst most non-socialists, the word almost always brings up images of red flags and totalitarian states, not the contrary as most socialists argue. So how can this article be improved to correct this? After all, most socialists are absolutely no different than classical liberals, who also sought restraint against any government or corporation from gaining too much power and property disproportionately. If this is the case, than why use the word at all?",0
"I am a little surprised and shocked at the tone of ALoan's follow-up.  This is a very large discussion and it would be quite surprising if I had succeeded in noticing and replying to every single edit by every single participant.  Now that I do see ALoan's request, however, I do not feel motivated to add a further elaboration.  The observation that Ghirlandajo has been inflicting disruptive behavior on Wikipedians for well over a year is well documented elsewhere (and I suspect that ALoan is aware of this because he refers to the application for arbitration).  The observation that Giano's accusations were absurd and extremely damaging is almost a truism and I've cited those accusations enough to establish the point for those who are capable of agreement with it.

 The idea that I was somehow involved in a dispute of some kind with either Ghirlandajo or Giano is something that they have both pushed very hard, so I'm not surprised that there are people who believe this to be the case.  It is, however, untrue.  I was only involved to the extent that any good administrator attempts to maintain order on the wiki and prevent other editors from disrupting it for their own endsin this case, an apparent vendetta and shrieking campaign against other editors.

 I take no satisfaction in Giano's announcement of his departure, but nor am I responsible for it.  He had clearly made up his mind that some of its day-to-day running was in the hands of people of almost indescribably gross moral turpitude, and he did not shrink from stating this opinion at length.  In the circumstances, his departure was inevitable.  Tony Sidaway",0

response to your nasty personal attacks, Blockader and Blah
'You people are unbelievable in your ignorance and the ease to which you get brainwashed by subversive propaganda.
 Learn to read. I said that Paine and Jefferson came up with the ideas for a minarchist government whereby the freedom and equality of the people would  be protected. Have you read Paine and Jefferson? You are attacking the wrong men. If you want to rightfully attack an American forefather attack Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, and others.
 I never said they were anarchists. I do say, though that Jefferson expressed his admiration for anarchism. If he had suggested it at a congressional meeting he probably would have been shot or lynched or they just would have impeached him. (Something that many of them wanted to do anyway.)
 Being patriotic to your country and anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Sounds like you have been reading too much Communist propaganda. Communists just love to subvert governments and China is trying to subvert this one right now. I personally would love to overthrow the fascist-socialist state we're in right now and get back our freedom. But Maoism is not something I would have in mind in the way of freedom.
 Blah and Bockade, since you think you know the ideologies that are best for me, let me find one for you. Hmm, maybe subverting your current government into a dictatorshiptotalitarian state would be appropriate. Or perhaps, as you are incapable of reading comprehension or the most rudimentary thought, working in a convenience store, rather than editing what used to be an encyclopedia would be a good idea for you. Or maybe, how about going and fucking yourself. Now, after having  baited me with your ignorant and idiotic comments, go running to the admins and report me for PAing you, thereby proving beyond any shadow of a doubt how unanarchistic yet socialistic you really are.

Apparantly, Aaron this article is the way you'' want it to be, just to get some accuracy into your last comment.

 That first link has nothing to do with anything - I won't argue the issues with it as I would probably get in trouble for turning this into a blog. Who constructed the table in your second link? (it was not clear). Was it a credible academic clearly labeling themselves as an EP? If it is a legitimate source, you should cite them. Regardless, you should know that this is not how you reference sources in psychology. The sources are not at all clear... in the table, the author writes their piece, then say at the very bottom: """"The four Central Questions are BASED UPON Darwin e.g. 1859, 1871; Lorenz e.g..."""" What does that mean exactly? Is this a bibliographic listing of sources that a person might have read before constructing the questions? Regardless, it needs to be made clear. A bibliography is much different than a reference list. Your table, for example, would seem to be YOUR WORK, with bibliographic references to the sources you claim to have read. You ask us to read the references if information is unfamiliar. I have stated here numerous times that Darwin's Origin of Species cannot be summarized in the way that you have done so.   

Tables are great ways of summarizing established information.  But you are using the table to forward a novel argument - this is a straightforward violation of NOR which is why the table should be deleted.  Your links only prove that other people use this table to make points not about evolutionary psychology.  E.g.: """"THE FOUR CENTRAL QUESTIONS OF BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH USING ETHOLOGY AS AN EXAMPLE.""""  Aside from the fact that this does not come from a source that meets our sourcing standards, the source does not even say what you claim it says.    |  Talk

It also states that in exceptional cases like the Beatles (I would classify Pink Floyd as exceptional), members at the time of dissolution could be listed with consensus from the community.

 List of mycologists 
Thanks for creating the list of mycologists.  The only thing that might be missing is the author abbreviation.  I have been linking a lot of those lately in the mushroom articles.  

I noticed that the botanists have everything set up pretty well - They have a list of botanists with abbreviations and also a template to make it easy to put a box in an article that gives the abbreviation info.

I copied it and changed a couple words - Now we have:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Mycologist

I tried it out on Gaston Guzman.  

There are still some red links, I haven't decided if I should reword the template or add the articles that are in red.

What do you think?

 

I can see the advantage of having author abbreviations included on the list of mycologists, and I can't see the harm of a separate  to parallel , although since mycology falls under the ICBN, all mycologists are, in some sense, botanists (and many were both, particularly in the early days), so the links in the template should lead to author citation (botany) and botanical name. We should not expect a separate article on """"author citation (mycology)"""" to be created, since mycological naming is botanical naming, even if the organisms aren't plants.  

 Melolonthinae 

Thanks for fixing the errors I made in creating Melolonthinae. I took a leap creating it since I have zero practical knowledge of the subject. Hey this is totally random, but I figure you might know a thing or two about biology as a whole. Why does Canis lupus familiaris cover everything from a chihuahua to a great dane yet other animals with very minor variations (ex. Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdnerii, Oncorhynchus mykiss newberrii) are distinct subspecies?   C T 

The species is normally defined as a group of """"actually or potentially interbreeding populations"""" (the biological species concept), which means that if two animals can interbreed to produce fertile offspring, they are considered conspecific. Subspecies are defined more vaguely, as divisions of a species which are not different enough to prevent interbreeding, but which have fairly constant differences. I don't know what the morphological difference between O. m. newberrii and O. m. gairdnerii is, but I am sure there is one. The unusual situation is Canis lupus familiaris, which has been subject to artificial selection, and so exhibits much more physical variation than is normal for taxa of such limited genetic isolation. I am not sure whether it is really valid to apply scientific names to domestic dogs and the like in the first place, although it is widely done; perhaps it represents the scientific name of the wild taxon from which the domesticated breeds are derived. By contrast, cultivated plants have their own system of nomenclature, separate from the ICBN.

I don't want to go about beating around a dead Bantha, but after reviewing the sequence of the transformation on DVD I discovered something interesting when viewing the scene in slow motion within chronological order. In one shot, we see Palpatine's face becoming the Sidious of the OT, followed by more lightning to the face. After a few close-ups on a conflicted Anakin, the camera focuses back on Palpatine, who is still in a transitional state but is lacking the details present in the previous shot. It is as if the Sidious face is showing through once as the lightning is interacting with the skin, and then fading away, and then finally breaking through again as the Palpatine face melts away and Sidious says he's too weak to continue. If Palpatine was indeed literally deformed by the lighting, why did his face go from normal, to Sidious, to semi-normal, and back to Sidious again. If the lightning wounded him, wouldn't the wounds stay instead of suddenly disappearing and re-appearing? Watch your DVDs, you'll see it. I have a few screen shots that I can provide to show you what I am referring to. By the way, both this and the regular Wikipedia article fail to make any mention of Sidious' strange voice after he rises from the window sill and before he puts on his hood. In the commentary, Lucas said he added synthesized effects to the voice to make the """"true Sidious"""" drip a bit more menace. That's all well and good, but there must be a within-universe explanation for it.""",0

There are several points in the current article that are designed to distort who I am or my work.  The lede says I'm an """"embed on assignment in Iraq"""".  I've spent just as much time in Iraq.   I'm not nor have I ever been a blogger.  I've never """"blogged"""" and yet the article claims blogging and commentary citing my participation in Fox Forums.  The truth is that I've written far more hard news for Foxnews.com and have only participated in Fox Forum when requested to by the editor.  The current focus of the article on blogging is meant to minimize my credentials as a reporter.  I'm also likened to Rich Merritt and Jeff Gannon.  Two comparisons that are meant to smear me and are also awkwardly placed in the article

You said that I should not be drawn into petty disputes but these issues have been in the article for two years and despite many protests no one has even bothered to answer why or how these comments have been put into the article.

 More on Wiki writers http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html 

Many errors have been corrected in Wikipedia's Roman salute article.
http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html  The article had many visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page- as Dr. Curry attempted to correct the many errors.
http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html

However, the wikipedia article on the """"Roman Salute"""" is becoming more dishonest by the week. An earlier version referenced the work of Professor Rex Curry and started thusly: """"The Roman salute is a gesture in which the arm is held out forward straight, with palms down. Sometimes the arm is raised upward at an angle, sometimes it is held out parallel to the ground. The salute was supposed to have been used in the Roman republic, but there is no clear evidence of this. Indeed it is not known whether salutes in the military sense existed at all in Roman culture"""" (by Paul Barlow).  A more recent version of the same article is written as if a neo-Nazi has been covering-up again.

A big initial problem is that no wiki writer will even attempt to discover the first use of the phrase """"Roman salute"""" and thus the writers remain stuck in intellectually dishonest confusion about dates and origins.

The article reverts back to its earlier opening concessions to the work of Dr. Curry, conceding that there is no clear evidence of the salute in the Roman Republic and also conceding that there is no evidence of salutes in the military sense at all in Roman culture.

The wiki writer then engages in speculation that people today misunderstood some images from ancient Rome.  There is no support for the idea that the """"Roman Salute"""" concept arose long ago from misinterpretations of Roman images.  There is as much evidence that, after Dr. Curry's shocking discoveries about the salute's origin with the Pledge of Allegiance, modern writers (including wiki writers) deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers misinterpreted Roman images in order to cover-up and suppress Professor Curry's discoveries.  

The wiki writer then engages in speculation that neoclassical artists misunderstood some images from ancient Rome.  There is no support for the idea that the """"Roman Salute"""" concept arose among neoclassical artists from misinterpretations of Roman images.  There is as much evidence that, after Dr. Curry's shocking discoveries about the salute's origin with the Pledge of Allegiance, modern writers (including wiki writers) deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers seized upon neoclassical artists in order to cover-up and suppress Professor Curry's discoveries.  

For example, there is no evidence that Jacques-Louis David actually thought that his painting """"The Oath of the Horatii"""" represented an actual historical Roman salute.  All of the evidence indicates that David created the scene out of whole cloth for drama. All of the speculating otherwise is actually the machinations of wiki writers and people of their ilk. The intellectual dishonesty is all the more evident in that the wiki writers deliberately faill to address those very points already made by Dr. Curry http://rexcurry.net/pledgehoratii.html  Further, the Horatii painting depicts three people reaching for weapons.

The Tennis Court Oath was painted by David later, and repeats David's use of the dramatic gesture that David concocted, but in a more modern setting.  There is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed. David was not there. Further, the oath was was written on paper (the paper being read by the central figure?) and the """"oath was taken"""" by signing the document. There is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting (the central figure might be swearing, or he might be reading his document) while those people about him waive hats, talk, holler, point, etc.  Three figures on the left seem to be an inside reference to the Horatii painting.  The wiki writer is misrepresenting the works or reading into them.

The distribution of the Eagle Standards was painted by David even later, and repeats David's use of the dramatic gesture that David concocted, but in another modern setting.  There is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed and there is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting at all.  The wiki writer claims that this is the mos important of these paintings.  That painting shows no use of the salute in pledging or oath-taking or at all and simply shows various people, with various gestures, acclaiming the central figure and grabbing for, and shouting for, the """"Eagle Standards.""""  The wiki writer is misrepresenting the works and reading into them.

The wiki writer then claims that other painters during the nineteenth century regularly depicted the straight-arm g",0

In reply to  you state in your edit summary for the """"Existence of God"""" article: """"Undid revision 256247715 by 74.4.222.208 (talk) Difference is of opinion is not vandalism. Omega point is fringe."""" That claim doesn't even make coherent sense, besides the fact that you replaced a literate entry with an illiterate edit.

Even if one incorrectly thinks that the Omega Point Theory is """"fringe,"""" that has no logical connection with the edit that Jeffro77 made. Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of """"WP:FRINGE,"""" which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.

In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""". Whereas the version before was properly cited: """"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.""""

As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

Additionally, while Jeffro77's """"fringe"""" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, """"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,"""" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals). The Wikipedia article on the Omega Point Theory lists seven different mainstream peer-reviewed",0

 What a mess I've made 
Sigh... this was all entirely my fault. My only """"defence"""" is that it's been over half a year since I was last blocked and I slipped up - yeah, it's not much of one at all (hence the quotation marks).

User:Guy Macon, I should have stopped with the template warnings immediately after you made it clear that you did not appreciate the first one (which was indeed issued in good faith, even if it did not seem like it to you - but I suppose that doesn't really matter much at this point). Issuing another warning for an edit you made to your own talk page was particularly ridiculous on my part.

User:Thomas.W, I should have heeded your warnings instead of mentioning possible retaliation. Not much more I can say about that.

User:DangerousPanda, I shouldn't have written the comment above (which I've now struck out). Your well-timed block likely saved me from a formal report (and a possible community ban, given my sanction history).

Please let me know what you all think of this (particularly since I'd like to be sure we're now on the same page before filing a formal unblock request). Thank you.   """,0
"Bearian, i need your help to resolve this issue 

Please find below my request to EdJohnston dated 6-Nov

Dear EdJohnston,

 Please find UST Global leadership team in the link http://www.ust-global.com/leadership.aspx
Do you really want to have external links that have outdated/wrong info about an article in Wikipedia? Wiki is an Encyclopedia which is most popular in the world and widely used for collecting accurate information about anything under the sun. Anyway Business Week has updated the content to the actual facts about the leadership team of UST Global. FYI the link to the same http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4298931. I think now you might have understood why I was removing this link before, when it was carrying outdated information.

 Can I ask you to check few pages in Wikipedia itself regarding UST Global content and find what i am trying to say here? This is very important. Could you please check the link http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UST_Global&limit;=500&action;=history.

This link takes you to the earliest revision history page of UST Global. Please find when this page was initially drafted and when did the user Steve Ross started editing the page. This wikipedia page was started in 2005 and Steve came in to picture by 2007. The most interesting thing here you can find is the first few edits by Steve Ross. He added himself as co-founder of UST where right now he wants to mention himself as founder of the company. Don’t you find that this user is inconsistent with his edits and this proves that his intention is to advertise himslef? Also could you please check whether this user has contributed anything else in this Wiki page other than adding his name in different roles of UST Global?

All you want to know about UST Global is available in their website (www.ust-global.com).
Also I want to repeat here that I am not here to violate any rules or policies of Wikipedia. I just want to point out the anomalies in this Wiki page. Could you please listen to my request. This is genuine.",0

Errr...Joanot, who told you that you have binding authority to establish votings which by-pass wikipedia policies and, not happy with that, fixing deadlines etc? Did you see yourself like a neutral editor or an administrator taking care of this page? Because you are not either, are you?

You can organize as many polls as you want, establish very strict deadlines, limiting the answers to YES or NO, etc. All very impressive. But you just can't by-pass the wikipedia policies nor the consensus we had reached here over the months just because you would like to rewrite the article in each and every contentious points (about the rest, you never cared in the slightest). All like if many different editors wouldnt have worked on that (including you) and like if all the work and agreements were, all of a sudden, worthless just because you think so. It doesnt work like that, Mr.

There are two very clear policy guidelines below in the last """"Once Again"""" thread which you havent bothered to reply, didnt you notice them? or maybe is it so much more fun to organize a poll and email everybody and their grandmother from ca:wiki which you think will support your point of view rather than stickign to boring policy rules?. Or maybe you noticed these two policies but, since you are a smart guy, you looked the other way and made like if they werent there because they are definite and crystal clear, even if you dont like them (at least I agree with you in that polls are definitely much more entertaining than wikipedia policies, but life is life and there are some rules to abide, even if you dont like them)

In any case, whether you like them or not, policies are binding, and, fortunately they are clear enough in this case.

As for polls, do you know this other policy? WP:DEMOCRACY? let me quote it for you just in case, because it seems made for you:

Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy or any other political system. Its primary method of determining consensus is through editing and discussion, not voting. Although editors occasionally use straw polls in an attempt to test for consensus, polls or surveys may actually impede rather than assist discussion. They should be used with caution, if at all, and will not be treated as binding.

So now we have three policies against your wishes to rewrite this article the way you would like it. Three policies against nothing but a lot noise and a massive attack to the existing consensus which generally works well for everybody, except for you. Let's see how this ends and then we will meet you again next Christmas, I presume. Can't wait. MOUNTOLIVE  fedeli alla linea """,0

"Disruptive edits 

Hello, . Despite 's statement, you have not so far been reported at WP:Administrator intervention against vandalism as far as I can see; but if you continue your disruptive editing you will be. Looking at your edits, I get that you have strong opinions about John de Ruiter. While I know nothing of him, I have some sympathy with your position. But you are going about your campaign in a way that is disruptive to Wikipedia, and you need to stop.
First, as you have already been told, you introduced material (and, in particular, critical material) into a biography of a living person without giving any references to a published source which supports your material. This is absolutely forbidden, but the first time you did it our policy of assuming good faith should lead any other editor to just remove your additions and explain to you that this is not acceptable; and this is what happened.
What you are encouraged to do at that point, is to discuss the matter on the talk page Talk:John de Ruiter, and try to reach agreement with other editors; if you are unable to do so, our dispute resolution procedure would tell you how to proceed.
What you did do, is to insert your unsupported material again. This is called edit warring, and is a quick way to get yourself blocked from Wikipedia.

Assuming that you are in good faith (i.e. that you think the de Ruiter article is unbalanced), your best bet is to start by finding some reliable published sources which are critical of him (not blogs or forums, but material from reputable publishers). If you can find some, then you may edit the article to add only what is supported by the sources you have found (though in view of your recent history, even in this case you should probably start by discussing it on the talk page). If you cannot find such sources, then I'm afraid you must not edit the page further. Unsupported material and original research are not permitted in Wikipedia articles.

I suspect that you believe that it is important to expose something you think is not right about how de Ruiter presents himself. If that is that case, I'm afraid that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and you may not use it in that way.",0

"Wade Park 

The whole point is that the park is much more than the museum (it's more than 10% of a square mile), so it's a significantly different entity from the museum itself.  Because there's no article on the HD, we shouldn't have its infobox anywhere at all.  Granted, we shouldn't have a stub for the sole purpose of filling a hole, but we also shouldn't pretend that another article fills that hole either.    

You are partially correct in your assertion made in the edit summary for the Wade Park article - the park isn't the entire district, but you are also partially incorrect. You're saying: The park itself is not the district, and the National Register database indicates that the park isn't even part of the district  where that I underlined is where you're erring.  The NRHP website lists this: Roughly bounded by E. 105 St., East Blvd., Chester and Euclid Aves. , Cleveland'' (650 acres, 7 buildings, 1 structure)'http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natregsearchresult.do?fullresult=true&recordid;=339http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/oh/Cuyahoga/districts.html Unless we are looking at different NRHP websites, and you haven't either spent time in Cleveland or ,at the very least, looked at trhe area in question on the map, then you're not taking into account two three things: 1) the 650 acres includes Wade Park (Google Map it). 2) The name Wade Park District explicitly (and even implicitly if you're familiar firsthand with the history of Cleveland). 3) (and this is related to my second point regarding a familiarity with the history of Cleveland) Jeptha Wade's property, which is where Wade Park is and the heart of the district in question, was the seed from where all the buildings in the district sprung from. The CMA, Botanical Gardens, Natural History Museum and Severance Hall, which all are part of the district, would not be there if Wade Park wasn't set aside to be the cultural epicenter that garnered it's NRHP entry.

Lastly, given that any one of the buildings listed on the registry are technically part of the WPHD, there would be no false information by including the NRHP infobox on any of those articles  which was my entire point of putting it on the CMA article in the first place. The infobox being clearly labelled as Wade Park District''' is not misleading by including it on a building that is part of the district. We could argue about this ad nauseam. But what's the point?

Of course I can make an entire article that covers the district specifically. But why just regurgitate the same stuff found in each individual Wikipedia article that exists for every building that is in the HD (including the Wade Park itself)? Bandwdith pollution notwithstanding, it is simply redundant. Or we could make it less redundant by simply putting the infobox in one of the articles already out there... and the Wade Park article being the namesake for the HD would make the most sense (the article is hardly complete, and could be expanded to include an entire section specifically about the HD and relationship bewteen the two)... and if not that article than the CMA which is the largest building in the HD, and the reason I put it there in the first. Either way, the underlying question in this argument that I have for you is this: how is it productive in our task as Wikipedians, and moreover as members of Ohio-specific Wikprojects, to keep adding and removing factual info from articles with direct relationships to the subject of our debate? Are we trying to make Wikpedia a more informative user-based encyclopedia, or are we nitpicking over how to make a piece of factual information, that is an important part of a large US City, available to those who are looking at Wikipedia for information?",0

I regret that it has been changed back. I think I have written a clear and correct representation of metahysical libertarianism. Now the passage seems to say again that metaphysical libertarians require a belief in a soul. This is a falsehood of such magnitude which cannot pass. To require a belief in a soul and implicitly require belief in God is anti-democratic, anti-freedom, anti-emotion, anti-religion. Very clearly in metaphysical libertarianism the way to arrive at a conclusion about an agent is by free belief. I have quoted 2 metaphysical libertarian philosophers previously going out of their way saying that they are opposed to evidence, even against philosophical evidence in coming to a conclusion about the agent. But really ALL late medieval monks are generally considered to be metaphysical libertarians. It is also quite obvious that religion centers around FAITH, not around evidence gathering. So I think I have made a fair and correct representation of common metaphysical libertarianism.

But on the other side I do feel I need more support from people here on wiki that what I wrote is a correct and fair representation of common metaphysical libertarian position. Think this through, is the way in which metaphysical libertarianists reach a conclusion about an agent a free way, or a way forced by evidence?

I argue that section of """"Ethnic Composition"""" in page Urartu and page """"Antiquity"""" in page Armenia in its current version imply ethnic continuity and strong bonds between people who lived in Urartu (Academicians for example use term 'people of Urartu') and Armenians, who (sources I quoted say) moved in Urartu in 7-6 BC. My argument is not only about language diferrences. It is about ethnic and cultural ones. My arguments are on 'Request of Assistance' page. 

I'd like to quote professional historian about Urartu-Armenia nexus:

Philip L. Kohl, Clare Fawcett. Nationalism, Politics and the Practice of Archaeology (New Directions in Archaeology). Page 157: """"No less problematic are heavily slanted interpretations of the Urartian kingdom, the first historically attested state in Transcaucasia (ninth to seventh centuries BC). Armenian chauvinists must explain why this state, a worthy adversary of the neo-Assyrian Empire of northern Mesopotamia and one that expanded over much of """"historic Armenia,"""" composed its royal cuneiform inscriptions in Urartian, a non Indo-European ( i.e., non-Armenian) language, related to Hurrian and ancestral to the Northeastern Caucasian family of languages spoken today by different peoples in Daghestan, Chechenia, and Ingushetia (see Jankowska 1991:231). Reasonable historical hypotheses can be advanced for a Proto-Armenian component to this kingdom, and there is a real sense in which the Armenians are the cultural heirs of Urartu, but an essentialist view of Armenian culture which equates it precisely with the Urartian kingdom cannot be sustained. One must distinguish between popular and professional Armenian interpretations of Urartu, the latter being subtler and more difficult to evaluate. Thus, popular reference to the """"Piotrovskii problem"""" is based on the fact that B.B. Piotrovskii, the late Director of the Hermitage in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and former head of the excavations at Karmir Blur (the ancient Urartian capital of Teishebaine now located within the city of Yerevan), had quite reasonably maintained that the mighty Urartian Iron Age kingdom did not constitute the first Armenian state for the reasons stated above; the """"problem"""" only existed for those who wanted Armenians always to have lived in and controlled """"historic Armenia"""" until the later ravages wrought by Romans, Persians, Arabs, and Turks. More discriminating professional archaeologists, who may accept the reasonable theory that the ethnogenesis or formation of Armenian culture occurred during post-Urartian Achaemenid times, extol the might of the Urartians and see them exercising political control over most of eastern Anatolia, western Iran, and Transcaucasia; in this respect they remain the direct precursors of the Armenian kingdom under Tigran II.""""  

Finally, the problem is not only in the content of dispute itself. It is also about behavior of users - their insults, reluctuance to accomodate various views. """,0
"""Oh my....touch not Gods' anointed......Hey, the only thing haggard was anointed with was baby oil by a homosexual prostitute...........he was anointed alright but not Gods anointed.

 Re: Winans Family 

I fully understand your concerns about the new user but I think if we send him/her a message, they'll understand. I mean, the article is geared towards the musical family...I could understand if Matthew was one of the Winans kids but he's their third cousin or something like that. Honestly, he just isnt pertinent to the article. As for the NPOV statement, the main problem were statements like """"his love and passion is basketball"""" which make it sound more like an advertisement. Granted, this only occured once or twice but nonetheless its there. Also, theres way too much information on him here, more than the actual Winans family are given (granted, many of them have their own pages). Why dont we just make Matthew his own page and then under the trivia section say """"The Winans are cousins of basketball player Matthew Winans"""".

Letter to User:Zoe

The world of Wikipedia is not what it should be and would be if people would not INITIATE personal attacks while correcting possible or actual violations of The Five Pillars of Wikipedia. The first round of Word Wars against me began all because I dared write about myself an article. Sure, call it self-promotion, but self-aggrandizement it is not. I was not fully aware of the rules then, but the fact is that there are people, not unlike myself, who are worthy of mention on Wikipedia, have sufficient write-ups, press coverage throughout the years or were a significant phenomena at a time, but who: a) cannot afford to hire PR and Publicity firms to have someone write about them on Wikipedia or b) would not impose upon their prominent friends to do so! Wikipedia should have a Special Cases Department, just as government should, were certain exceptional individuals can have their day in """"Wiki Court"""", and have a determination made by a """"Wiki Jury"""" as to whether or not they deserve a mention in Wikipedia. In any case, Alec Wilkinson, of New Yorker magazine fame, intends on writing an article about me for Wikipedia, partly out of fairness, since there is mention of Amy Alkon and her two partners in plagiarism. Amy Alkon, Advice Goddess, was one of the Three Free Advice Ladies. They read my write-up in The New Yorker and attempted to become famous at my expense! Until that time my life as The Free Advice Man was quite fulfilling, and I managed to help many people, including some on the verge of suicide. You may want to visit www.infinitysociety.org/FREEADVICEMAN.html to get the full story. Why does this matter?? Because, while it is true that I may have violated Wiki Rules in the past, which I no longer seek to do (as of Tom Harrison's warning), Wikipedia could benefit from an eccentric contributor. Yes I was and I am very angry to find that there are Wikipedians who will make unscientific statements about another person's intellectual accomplishments and worth.  Yes it is likely that there are people who go too far in enforcing the NO ORIGINAL CONTENT pillar. I am astounded that no one ever cared then (neither User:Trovatore, User:MikeTwo, or any of the current Wikipedians involved in this case) or now to make a sincere effort to contact Prof. Miklos Hernadi at The Hungarian Academy of Sciences, who will verify my status as a philosopher and who is aware of media reports in Hungary about my life as a philosopher from 1994 to 2002, including a published book of mine for which he wrote a Peer Review (he has a Ph.D.). And should Alec Wilkinson submit an article about me there should be no reason for it to be deleted. 

Look, I am 42 years of age and more European than American. Maybe Wikipedia is age-blind, but people who are younger, and perhaps less accomplished in life, should take the other person's age into consideration and communicate in a respectful and polite manner. If you analyze the whole matter, and if you are seriously interested in objectivity and making the world a better place, then you may yet come to the understanding that I never initiated any attacks, even though I did overreact at times. Also, about anti-Semitism... When someone attacks me, who really does not know me, my life's story and the reasons why the media has covered me, and dares claim that I am practically a """"nobody"""" then my reactions are perfectly understandable and given that the strong appearance of malice exists, why should I, as a Jew, not conclude, especially about persons who openly admit strong Christian identities with Christian groups that have a known track record for being anti-Jewish. Maybe CRCulver is not aware of his hate for the concept of infinity, which is my specialty and to which I profess my intellectual support for. Maybe he is not an anti-Semite, but he sure did not communicate to me (right from the beginning) as one would normally expect. As for promoting certain views and ideas; most Wikipedians and people working on Wikipedia do this all the time! Some more subtly than others. 

Anyway, you've blocked me indefinitely... Who benefits?? Look: I never went around looking to insult Wikipedians over their violations or mistakes; I never deleted information (because I think that there should be people in Wikipedia assigned for that sort of thing, and those should not be the same as those who add information!!!); .....in fact, come to think of it, that is a great idea! People who do the verifying of facts should not be those who write them...separation of Wikipowers!.... Anyway, adding an article titled """"Infinitology"""" is not violating the """"NO ORIGINAL CONTENT"""" pillar, because nowhere in that article did I talk about my name or my identity (other than being the author), and in fact talked about such prominent individuals, living and deceased, as Philip K. Dick, Isaac Asimov, Carl Sagan, Giordano Bruno, Baruch Spinoza, etc.... Anyway,",0

It seems that even the two main instigators have come around to realizing their mistake in the NONPROFIT issue, as they have now taken to editing the article and snipping out entire parts that could easily have simply been reworded.  I think that it is inappropriate for these two guys to continue editing this page that they have been so aggressively and falsely attacking for days on end.  I'm sorry, this does not seem right to me.  I have no problem with someone like you helping to make the article better.  What these guys are doing is also revisionism in that they are trying to remove parts of the article that confirm its justification for inclusion via WP:NONPROFIT.  (Mentions of the international scope and extent of help given worldwide for instance.)  

I ask that you take the lead here, and go ahead and dismiss the Afd, as it is clear now that it uncalled for.

Lloyd was born in Burchard, Nebraska, to James Darsie Lloyd (1865–1947) and Elizabeth Fraser (1869–1941); Harold's paternal great-grandparents were all from Wales. Young Harold was named for his paternal grandfather. Harold had an older brother, Gaylord (1888-1943), five years his senior. Like his younger brother, Gaylord acted in motion pictures, but his career was nowhere near as renowned as Harold's. Among other roles, he acted in 1921's """"Disraeli"""" starring the famous George Arliss.  With Harold's help, there were even efforts to turn him into a comedy star.  He eventually went on to become a film executive.  When Harold was a child, his parents divorced and Lloyd chose to stay with his father.  Despite this, he and his brother always remained close to their mother.  Harold's father was always dreaming up grand get-rich-quick schemes that ended in disasters. They eventually ended up in Omaha where Lloyd had his first acting experience in a local stock company. He attended East High School and San Diego High School and received his stage training at the School of Dramatic Art (San Diego). In 1912, his father J. Darsie """"Foxy"""" Lloyd was awarded the then-massive sum of $6,000 in a personal injury judgment (although this was split evenly between Lloyd and his lawyer) after being run over by an Omaha beer truck. Reportedly, on the toss of a coin (""""Heads is New York or Nashville or where I decide!, tails is San Diego""""), he and Lloyd moved west.

Lloyd had acted in various Vaudeville acts in theaters since boyhood, and started acting in one-reel film comedies shortly after moving to California. He soon began working with Thomas Edison's motion picture company, and eventually formed a partnership with fellow struggling actor and director Hal Roach, who had formed his own studio in 1913. The hard-working Lloyd became the most successful of Roach's comic actors between 1915 and 1919.

Davis retired from acting in 1923, the year she and Lloyd were married, and Jobyna Ralston became Lloyd's co-star.

From 1915 to 1917, Lloyd and Roach created more than 60 one-reel comedies.

Each of these dynasties (especially the Samanids), and those that followed (notably the Ghaznavids and the Buyids), tended to set up courts adorned with Persian bureaucrats, scholars, astrologers and poets in imitation of the great caliphal court of Baghdad, as enhancements of their prestige, and as a disguise for their tenure of power, which otherwise might have appeared as more nakedly dependent on brute military force.""""

In Chinese Li means setup/erect, Chun spring/egg. Setup spring is a Chinese solar term, literally interpreted as erecting an egg for fun.

"""

I would hope that you read both the source and my points fully before making your edit and writing your response.

As I initially said the source is biased - it is true. They state themselves that their very organisation was set up initially purely to oppose Nuclear Power.

Let's leave that to one side however, we could always come back to it later.

The crux of my point, leaving aside the bias issue, is three-fold. 

Firstly, irrespective of your argument that this is presented as a claim, the fact remains that the way the claim is presented is illogical - there is no fair comparator for the claim that """"Nuclear Power is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions"""". A fair comparator should be found or some idea of efficiency viz. inefficiency should be presented, if even from the biased source itself, before re-inserting this part. Without it, it is on the same level as saying something as intellectually vacant as """"some people claim that Ferraris are not fast machines"""". Not exactly the sort of style an Encyclopaedia should be aiming for, especially on a scientific article, would you not agree?

Secondly, with respect to your argument, the very empirical information the underlying source uses is being mistreated in what amounts to, if I may say, a misuse of data on a level which is so obvious it it would actually be quite comical if it were where it belonged along with many thousands of other equally lazy special interest group papers. It is  a self-contradicting source. Here's why:

It makes its supposition that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions by producing a table of data. The data shows """"Yearly Costs to Avoid 1000kg of CO2 Emissions"""". These are divided between Energy Conservation Measures and Energy Production Methods. Nuclear Power is shown to be more efficient than solar power and as efficient as wind power at cutting emissions. However, the only conclusion the article draws is that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions. By your logic, I could equally claim in this article using the same source that """"some environmental groups claim Wind and Solar Power are inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions"""". You can see how this would get a little crazy, no?

Thirdly, there is only one quoted source yet the text reads """"but environmental organizations indicate the problems with nuclear waste and claim that this energy is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions, excluding it from clean energy"""". Why is it pluralised? Surely the text should read something along the lines of """"the WISE group, a Dutch anti-nuclear lobby group indicate the problems..."""".

In conclusion, I can see the point you are trying to raise here is based on one guideline - as a claim, it is not presented as fact. That would be fine for articles dealing with philosophical issues, or political issues or any other number of normative debates. But we are not discussing ethics here. We are discussing the efficiency of Nuclear Power in cutting CO2 Emissions. We have to hold Scientific articles to a higher level of proof when it comes to """"making claims"""" or worse, """"stating beliefs"""". Science, prima facie, is about the pursuit of absolute truth, not the espousal of circumscribed belief. That way leads to the abuse of Science.

Awaiting your reply with interest.

 That is fine that you have set out your views. I have set out mine and when I am accused to talking 'nonsense' for expressing those views I will respond likewise. That you decide you do not like my reaction does not give you or those of your frame of mind the right to starve my views of the oxygen of publicity, as one nice Englishwoman put it in 1988. I do not have to accept any British nomenclature for my home. I live in Ireland; I therefore am Irish. I live in Europe; I therefore am a European. To claim that I live in what British people have termed the """"British Isles"""" is, despite the wire-balancing act by some wikipedia editors, ultimately an explicit claim that I am British. That, son, is a profoundly political claim. It is hostile, aggressive and completely about imposing a British nationalist identity upon me, my family and everybody I know. It doesn't get any more political. Anybody who partakes in that British nationalist project is of that 'national disposition'. They are aligning themselves with that agenda for who I am. You cannot censor this view simply because it doesn't accord with your British Comics outlook on the world. While you were reading British Comics I was reading books like Edward Said's Orientalism (book) and Declan Kiberd's Inventing Ireland (book), both of which are books that emphasise the importance to colonial powers of controlling the representation of countries they have conquered. Claiming Ireland to be in this """"British Isles"""" is precisely about that, about controlling Irish identity, Irish direction. It is disingenuous in the extreme to claim this title is merely geographic: it is merely political! 86.42.90.145  """,0

 Countries of the United Kingdom 

There appears to be major progress on the lists of countries issue which is great. I was wondering if you have some time, could help try and resolve the Countries of the United Kingdom now. I know i disagreed when i first joined on the use of the term, but after seeing the evidence there is no better term to describe it. It was over 6 months since the poll was started on the merger of Subs / Countries of the UK and the changes proposed would be far better than the current version. I think if it was attempted, an agreement could be reached on this issue which would lead to preventing major disputes in the future.

Present Day Canada Government website incorrectly Titles BNA Act 1867

The Government of Canada (mainly Liberal since 1963) is very """"skilled"""" at practising the Sin Of Omission as shown in the linked text below,

British North America Act 1867

http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/c1867_e.html

This website incorrectly refers to this document as the Constitution Act 1867, which is a misnomer, and a shameful one, indeed.

http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/endnts_e.html#(2)

(2)  As enacted by the Constitution Act, 1982, which came into force on April 17, 1982. The section, as originally enacted, read as follows: 
1. This Act may be cited as The British North America Act, 1867. 
 

 

I disagree with your interpretation.  You're reading a footnote, which merely says that *originally* the 1867 act was to be cited as the British North America Act 1867.  But, under the law since 1982, it is now to be cited as the Constitution Act 1867.  All acts forming the constiution were retroactively renamed.  Judicial decisions, and subsequent legislation, use this new naming system.  This reflects the fact that these documents were not a part of a """"constitutition"""" when originally created, since Canada had no consitution until 1982.  Collectively, these acts were turned into a constitution, and hence renamed.   

What?
""""Canada"""" had no Constitution until 1982?

You are completely wrong as well as per retroactive re-naming, that is not what happened at all.  Please get your facts straight.

Hi Fayenatic london,

I take your point about not publishing denials )

I wasn't aware that the misnomer category is likely to disappear. (As a side issue, is it required for a page to have at least one category? I have been editing for only a few months, and I'm still learning.)

Regarding other drums from different countries/languages, it doesn't make sense to rule in the name of a drum from a different language because dunun are Malinke drums. There is a Nigerian drum called ju ju but that drum is completely different (frame drum).
I have also found references to a drum called """"dun dun"""" or """"djun djun"""" from Nigeria, but as an hourglass-shaped drum, similar to the Malinke tama. (Again, that's a completely different instrument.) The notability of these sources is doubtful in any case; they are about as credible as shops that sell djembe and dunun…

As an analogy (somewhat strained), the didgeridoo is often referred to by Australians as a """"didge"""". Despite this, that doesn't make """"didge"""" a legitimate name for the instrument. It does not have this name in any aboriginal language. Similarly, you will find many places on the web saying that """"djembe"""" is pronounced """"DJEM-bay"""". It is not pronounced that way by the Malinke (who named the drum and pronounce it """"DJEM-be""""). It is only in western English-speaking countries that the incorrect pronunciation is occasionally used.

I had a look at the links you found. There are hundreds more like them, and these are not notable sources. For one, the dunun (and djembe) did not originate in Ghana. (The history of the dunun and djembe in Ghana is no longer than the history in the West because it was not until after colonialism ended that these drums found their way to Ghana. Up to that point, djembe and dunun were confined to the traditional Malinke area (Mali, Guinea, and parts of Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Ivory Coast).) Yes, I know that there are many sources claiming that the djembe and dunun came from Ghana (or Benin), but those claims are simply incorrect, and there is plenty of literature from reputable source to show this.

As to Mamady Keita being a reputable source, that is something beyond dispute: he is one of the most respected and famous masters world-wide, Malinke, and grew up in a traditional village.

What has happened here is that a lot of people who don't have the cultural background have copied from each other. This is unfortunate, but continued mis-use of a term doesn't make it correct, unless the use has entered the vernacular to such a point that it becomes valid. (Djun djun is nowhere near that common use.)

When I first learned about the """"djun djun"""" issue, I made it a point to pay attention to this. I have spent extensive time (many months) in West Africa studying with a number of masters there, including in Ghana and Mali. Not once have I heard native speakers there (either Ghana or Mali) refer to the drum as """"djun djun"""". I also have already asked old and young master drummers specifically about this. Famoudou Konate, Mohamed Bangoura, Epizo Bangoura, Lansana Camara, Isaac """"Tuza"""" Afutu, and Aliou Sylla (all teachers of mine) have all told me that no such word exists.

I believe it is beyond any doubt that """"djun djun"""" is a misnomer. The only question is what do with the djun djun page. A redirect to dunun is incorrect IMO because it would implicitly legitimize the incorrect term as a synonym. So, I would still like to retain the page but I don't know what I would have to do to bring the page up to acceptable standard. Can you help me here? A big problem when writing about Malinke instruments and drumming culture is that there is little material in writing. Most of the information is passed verbally from master to student. And, as far as I know, I cannot simply create a citation saying something like """"Famoudou Konate, June 2011, personal communication""""?   """,0

 Balancing Ross, Krakaeur et al with FLDS sites...and Knoll. A redux 

(The following is chiefly excerpted from commentary above.) External links are many. Should readers follow the link to Bannking on Heaven, they'll quickly size up it's journalistic expose by Jon Kraukaeur and Ruth Cooke, featuring Elaine Jeffs, Carolyn Jessop, and Penny Peterson; should they click over to Rick Ross Institute, that they're at a Christian apologetic anti-heresy site; and should they end up at FLDS 101, that they're at an anon blog by a highly informed partisan giving his take, albeit much more dispassionately in many aspects than either of the two alternate sources I just mentioned. 

Anyways, a fundamentalist Latter Day Saint (at least generically by culture and or belief, although obviously not currently beholden to the Jeffs-led, specifically FLDS faith) is in the process of blogging a veritable compendium of FLDS doctrines and beliefs known as FLDS 101, blogging under the psuedonym Berry Knoll, in which he quotes extensively from the lectures of Warren Steed Jeffs and from excerpts of interviews with current and former members of the polygamous splinter group. (Insiders would recognize Berry Knoll as the """"juniper-covered hill south of town"""" (Colorado City, Arizona/Hildale, Utah...) '' """"said to be the site for the temple the polygamous church had hoped to construct...."""" one day."""")Banking on Heaven: """"In the FLDS (Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints), women are chattel and young boys are kicked out so older polygamous men can have sex with young girls. Everybody does what they’re told, because the prophet, Warren Jeffs, is God [...]]""""FLDS 101: """"The FLDS 'yearn for Zion,' to live in a society free from sin and contention, where all things are held in common without jealousy  a heaven on earth. As the FLDS leadership continued to prophesy that the end of the world was quickly approaching, they taught the people that wickedness needed to be purged from their society. Jeffs taught, 'One or two covenant breakers can cause the Lord to stop blessing this people. As long as we have evil doers among us, the Lord's blessings will be withheld. Zion must be pure. We can't have evil people among the priesthood for the Lord to appear and bless us like He would like to. Be this a warning.' (W.S.J. 12/26/95) Jeffs laid the doctrinal groundwork to justify a cleansing of the FLDS. Their theology teaches that an ancient city lead by a prophet named Enoch, was taken up into heaven because of their righteousness. The FLDS believe they can be taken up too as the wicked world is destroyed.""""[... ... """"Yearning for Zion,"""" a hymn by W.S. Jeffs; 3rd verse]:Imagine the people of Enoch of old, trained in the order of heaven/ A beautiful city the Lord called his own and forever made his abode/ Coming to join with the Zion on earth when finally the earth finds its rest/ A kingdom established in celestial laws, a people the Lord can accept/ A New Jerusalem it will be, a land of refuge, a city of peace [ . . . ]""",0

"""   Regarding the """"Speedy Deletion"""" of my entry for The Resonance Project

I am unfamiliar with this interface so hopefully this is the proper """"talk"""" process.  

I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

For Andrewa

1) """"12-string"""" is vernacular, embedded in our business from the catalogues of the original manufacturers (the last people interested in logic or organology) and later """"folk"""" nomenclature (never scholarly nomenclature). [The same holds for the B.C. Rich company's catalogue referring to its coursed instrument as """"the 10-string guitar"""".]

2) Any instrument with at least one non-single string should use """"course"""" for clarity by any serious musicologist.

3) Intruments with 10 single strings should be termed """"10-stringed guitars"""" rather than """"the 10-string guitar"""" because there is no one 10-string guitar (with the definitive article).

4) I suggest you start a new article and title it '10-stringed guitars' under which you differentiate the various types under sub-headings accordign to their number of courses. The baroque guitar would fall under 5-course, the B.C. Rich instrument would fall under 6-course. 

5) I suggest a non-guitarist baroque lutenist should mediate this and offer an opinion on the established musicological use of the terms course and string. 

6) We must recognise that """"12-string guitar"""" is an exception to and deviation from a well-established musicological/organological convention, and not the rule according to which we should re-write the terminology. We should also recognise that the term 12-string guitar enters not via musicologists or scholars but via guitar manufacturers and was later taken up mainly by folk musicians. In contrast there is an extensive scholarly history of referring to instruments with at least one PAIR of strings as coursed, not (single) strung/stringed. Now, I am not suggesting re-naming """"12-string guitars"""", but it is a mistake (and folly) to try to oppose centuries-old scholarly conventions and to take the exception as the rule and re-write the terminology of organology.

 Original author and valid reference 

Hi. I responsible for the making of the pictures, (see pictures 1,2,3 and 4), and I also freely gave them away to WIkipedia commons.

The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.
The answer is Yes!
For example, It will be impossible to incorporate the pictures, (see pictures 1,2,3 and 4), in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and in the same time include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.
And honestly, do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including the research?

According to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my work as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.
If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.

Consensus means that every body must agree and I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether the people who are continuously deleting my reference are making a terribly wrong and stupid act?

 Kitzinger 

Regards reference 46, Framing abuse by Kitzinger, I got the book out of the library yesterday.  In the index, and on a brief flip through there is no mention of satan, satanic abuse, ritual abuse, the United States, religion, religious leaders, the satanic panic, courts, judicial systems, guilt, or anything else that really supports the sentence """"In America and Britain journalists framed the charges against the defendants as evidence of a moral panic and mass hysteria; child protection workers and social workers involved were bound by their professional codes of confidentiality and unable to comment on the specifics of the cases""""  There is focus on two cases - Cleveland and Orkney, both in the UK.  Based on my reading, the main focus of the book is on how the media's portrayal of the cases affected the public's perception of the event years later - not on guilt or innocence (though there is discussion on how the media left out and selectively reported details that were more convincing of the guilt of the parents.  If anyone on this talk page has read the book or is responsible for placing the text on the page, could you refer me to the page number (and chapter in case we have different versions) so I can verify?  Right now I'm tempted to excise the statement for having a) nothing to do with the U.S. b) nothing to do with the outcome of court cases and c) nothing to do with satanic ritual abuse.  If nothing else, it would allow the most nuanced, hopefully most neutral, portrayal of the book's contents.  Kitzinger appears to be very carefully saying nothing about the suspects' guilt or innocence, but I admit it is a cursory flip-through.  Got some other scholarly books from the same section in the library, some of which discuss SRA specifically, hopefully I'll find time to read them.    """,0

 Semi-protected edit request on 8 January 2014 

Please remove this page from my Facebook page.  This is not
my high school nor did I teach at this high school.  Thank you,  Jude Johnson

  
  Not done: please be more specific about what needs to be changed.   

 Use in Belgium and The Netherlands.. way off. 

Not only does the paragraph not explain the """"Hogeschool"""" (literal translation) system that provides Associate and Bachelor degrees, the information it provides about secondary education is wrong in some key points. Since I can't directly edit, I thought I might sum it up here.

Children are required to attend school from 6 to 18 in Belgium and 5 to 18 in The Netherlands or until they attain a specific level of education (BE: any secondary education, NL: HAVO, VWO or a level 2 MBO). See Dutch government website on 'leerplicht' and Flemish regional government's page on the same subject. Not relevant for Hogeschool, but faulty info in the article nontheless.

Dutch MBO is not considered school for the first two years, it is always considered school (unlike a """"Hogeschool"""", that functions as a University in terms of application, funding etc).

Now I don't know exactly how the Flemish equivalent of Hogeschool/High-school is used, but i'll sum up how it works in the Netherlands from the lowest level up until Hogeschool (usually translated as """"University of Applied Sciences""""). I'll skip internal stuff on VMBO and MBO, basically VMBO level determines MBO starting leve and you can always go up a MBO level(1-4) if you want to spend the time.

MBO level 4 provides access to almost all(1) Hogeschool Associate (120 ECTS) and Bachelor (240 ECTS) programs. Associate degrees are more of a technicality, unknown to employers and unused in most programs, but they exist.
Completing the first year (also known as Propedeuse) of a Hogeschool program grants access to almost all(1) University Bachelor programs.

1)Additional requirements may be set, usually involving math or language courses attended.

Hogescholen (and Universities) must offer access to their Associate and Bachelor programs to potential students aged 21 and up via 'Colloquium Doctum'. Here's some more info from a Dutch University in English on that subject, including a reference to the article of Dutch law about 'Colloquium Doctum'. The same system is often used when potential students lack certain courses from previous studies.

Regarding the article as a whole, it seems to lack sources overall, I feel it should be open for editing or otherwise overhauled to apply only to the term """"high school"""" and it's literal translations, redirecting to articles about secondary/higher education if needed.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 82.171.32.96   

 Is high school in comics a valid category? About half of super hero's are teenagers. 

I think this is as valid a category as zoos in fiction; these are both settings that are only really told by specific kind of stories. Teen and animal adventure.   

:Category:Fictional schools and its subcategory Category:Superhero schools already exist.   

Teenaged superheros are not fictional schools. They might be fictional high school students and or fictional teenagers. In many cases, however, those will not be defining characteristics. - [[User:SummerPhD|Summer",0

"Plummer published in 1896. Mike Christie and I are working on Bede's article, and the general assesment of most modern scholars is that the letter is genuine. Given Plummer's age, I don't think a mention in Laurence's article about Plummer's belief is that pertient, although I am pretty sure it'll make its way into the Bede series of articles. On the canon law bit, I think the bit I've mentioned is enough to establish that it was irregular, but that opinions are divided. (Gotta love those Victorian scholars who just KNEW what was right (grins)). I guess my main problem with Plummer is that he's over a hundred years old. More modern scholars seem to think that reliance on canon law wasn't as important to the papacy and the chuech at this point in time. For Laurence the important points are that he was consecrated by his predecessor and that some folks may have felt this was irregular.

Julien, there always exist contrary points of view. People still take issue with the Earth being round. But while one can have a contrary opinion, that doesn't make said opinion a fact.

 Dubious sentence 

""""Consequently, Ney now organised a combined arms (infantry, artillery and cavalry) attack on La Haye Sainte, which fell as the defending King's German Legion troops ran out of ammunition. Ney then moved artillery up to the allied centre and began to pulverise the infantry squares.[73]""""

This is the final sentence of the French Cavalry attack section.

There seem to be several things wrong with it: first, attacking a building with cavalry is pointless, be they with infantry or not, second, field artillery have little effect on reasonably stout (like Belgian farmhouses) buildings, apart from shells setting them alight (which is what happened to the Chateau de Goumont, to little effect).

I think two events are being conflated here.  

Having become obvious that the cavalry on their own were achieving little, Ney organised a combined arms attack, using Bachelu's Division (Reille's Corps) and the remaining French cavalry in a fit enough state, towards the centre of Wellington's position, this was halted by the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge (who couldn't break the French infantry formations, and consequently the British cavalry then fell back). Uxbridge then tried to lead the Dutch-Belgian heavy cavalry into the attack but they refused to charge.  Meanwhile, Bachelu's men and their cavalry supports were being hard hit by artillery fire and eventually fell back themselves.  

Simultaneously, or thereabouts, elements of D'Erlon's Corps renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte, and were ultimately successful.

 

If you can reference all of that, be bold and put it in! - 

 Done (I'm bloody, bold and resolute - in Shakespeare's words ;)  ) 

 Artillery 

One omission and one challenge. 

We should say something about Wellington's tactic of having his gun crews seek shelter in the infantry squares during the cavalry attacks. There is also Mercer's account of not doing so because he reckoned if his men ran for the Brunswick squares next to them, the Brunswickers would run too. He gives a great eyewitness account of what happened to cuirassiers when you fired canister at them at point-blank range, too. 

Now the challenge. What's the source for there being only 54 guns in the Grand Battery? French """"batteries"""" (field brigades, or companies, perhaps, more correctly) had eight guns. There should have been either 48 or 56, i.e. 6 or 7 batteries, as otherwise it would imply at least one incomplete unit, or that some weapons were detached for some reason. I don't recall any suggestion from elsewhere that that happened. Were there perhaps 54 guns east of the Brussels road?  

Adkin, p. 296, has forty two 6lb, eighteen 12lb cannon, and six 6in and fourteen 5.5in howitzers - eighty pieces of ordnance in total from 10 artillery companies (of 8 pieces each).  This is for the period 1:00 to 1:30 pm.

6th Foot Artillery: 9th, 10th, 11th, 19th and 20th companies

8th                4th company

2nd                7th company

Marines of the Guard Foot Artillery: 2 companies (undifferentiated)

Old Guard Foot Artillery: 6th company.

 

Thanks - and those figures are consistent with what I know of French artillery organisation, i.e. each 8-gun foot artillery company had 6 guns and two howitzers. Your source shows 20 howitzers in total which says they had the howitzers of 10 companies, hence 80 guns - so it ties in. The eighteen 12-pounders would be the guns of three companies and the six 6in howitzers would have been theirs.

I wonder if someone miscounted by adding up just the guns and forgot to include the howitzers? That would get you close to 54 guns. Or perhaps 54 guns is what they had left after the Union Brigade got done with them.  

I vote we change it. At present the article implies that there was a 54-gun battery which covered the entire length of Wellington's position, and that this dilution of fire accounted for its relative ineffectiveness.  

By all means change it.  

Format
In my internet explorer is the formating of the page rather strange. The text begins very late, almost beneath the infobox. Can this be changed, so that the article looks better?  01:36 CEST 6 September 2007  —Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|uns",0

Turkish police warn him hunderds of times to dont detonate the bomb.

Political comments on ancient times articles
While it's good that you want to prevent disruption to articles, I would thank you to please not use the talk pages of ancient times stuff to discuss contemporany political stuff as you did on Talk:Alexander the Great. See the WP:TALK wikipedia style guideline on commenting on talk pages   

The point was to address the recurring references that suggest """"Macedonia wasn't Greek"""" in the Alexander Talk pages. Clearly their intent is political in nature and some sort of disclaimer seemed in order to prevent unauthentic contributions. 

Although I disagree with your choice to completely remove a disclaimer in the Alexander talk page (not the main article) as I mentioned in your own talk page I will accept the removal( since I'm new here and bow to your wisdom). I only ask that you please consider my concerns that the talk page is heavily politicized already.

  

You are right that the talk page can get very politized (it changes with time as old discussions get archived, and new discussions get opened). A warning (not a disclaimer) could be good, but it ought to be at the top of the page (with the other boxes at the top of the talk page) and be very short and neutral, and its rationale should rely on historical sources for ancient times, and not on the current political situation. Sorry for taking so long, but I had stuff to do outside of wikipedia.   

Would it be possible for you to add the warning Enric? This way if could be done to your own satisfaction?  

I made a short warning. It's all I could think of. I copied the code from Talk:Homeopathy.

 Kickstart disks 

The current article states 'subsequent Amiga models all used ROM chips' [following the A1000] in relation to Kickstart.

However, I remember that the Amiga 3000 also required such a Kickstart disk. Can anyone confirm? Thanks!

Most A3000s used ROMs, but some (like mine) had a small """"Super Kickstart"""" in ROM which read Kickstart from floppy or hard disk. (Super Kickstart was based on AmigaOS 1.4, which never appeared anywhere else.) IIRC, only the machines manufactured in Europe had """"Super Kickstart"""", but I may well be wrong on that detail. I do know that I never got my machine to boot a v3.x AmigaOS =(. Cheers, (talk) 

 Freeing memory 

(This is relevant to a different Wikipedia article). I have the statement in front of me that, when a program terminates in AmigaOS, memory assigned by the program is not freed, and that it is therefore vital for the program to release all memory that it asked for, otherwise it is permanently """"leaked"""". Is this the case?  

Memory that is not freed before termination of a program in the Amiga OS is leaked (assuming it was supposed to be freed - in some cases a program may have allocated structures and attached them to system objects, such as a device node).  One of the most common modes of testing on the Amiga was checking free memory after program exit; there were many tools that automated that.  Normal behavior of a program was to free all memory, and all malloc'd memory was automatically freed via exit-time hooks.  (I.e. leaking memory typically only happened to memory obtained via AllocMem() and the like.)   

Indeed. AmigaOS does little to no resource tracking in order to save the memory overhead that it costs to include tracking. There was also a third-party program that patched many allocate/free resource functions (e.g. AllocMem/FreeMem, OpenWindow/CloseWindow) and added resource tracking to them, however this would break any software that deliberately allocate memory then exited, for example programs which installed patches on system functions. Programs assume the responsibility for freeing all allocated memory. The standard C library implementation in most Amiga C compilers used an onexit handler that freed any memory allocated with the malloc() implementation, but if the program crashed or the AmigaOS memory allocation routines were called directly, memory allocations were not freed. Other languages had varying degrees of support for tracking memory, usually (like C) only if you used the language-specific memory allocators.  

Thank you for your replies. The reason for the question relates to a discussion I've been having on memory leak. I'm going to post a question which is very subjective, but maybe there's a consensus. The article includes """"In modern operating systems, normal memory used by an application is released when the application terminates"""". Part of the debate is over whether this is really true, and whether it should say """"In some operating systems..."""". The leading question is: is AmigaOS a """"modern operating system""""? A supplementary dispute, where it says """"The application assumes that the request for memory has succeeded, and continues on this basis. This will typically result in an access violation but in some cases may result in damaging information belonging to this or (in primitive systems) some other application."""" Should this have """"some systems"""" in place of """"primitive systems""""? Thanks in advance.  

The amiga would be included in """"modern operating systems"""", and it does release """"normal memory"""" (i.e. malloced) when the application ends.  Program crashes on an Amiga do not release memory, so you could say it leaks on process crash.  And a program that uses things like OpenFile() instead of open() will leak a filehandle (and some memory) if the program calls exit() without closing the file.  As for your second question, the answer would be """"some systems"""" - many """"modern"""" embedded systems (including running unix variants like uclinux) do not have memory protection, and can read (and possibly write) structures using NULL as a pointer without an access violation.  Personally, I HATE programs that don't check malloc (or any other calls) for failure.  Good programming practice on the Amiga (due to the lack of VM) was to test programs and the OS against random memory allocation failures to see if they recovered cleanly or not.  All allocations (and all system calls, etc) should be checked for failure and",0
"Forthcoming Changes, Outline 

The group of students at the University of British Columbia editing this wikipedia entry have tentatively decided on the following as an outline for the entry:

 History 

The purpose of this introductory section is to give the readers an insight and understanding of the background history of Hells Gate and its indigenous inhabitants. The First Nations people used Hells Gate as a prime salmon fishing ground, and because of this, it became one of many locations for a popular fish station. I also discuss the environmental reasoning (deglaciation) behind the presence of salmon, and subsequently indigenous people in the Fraser Canyon and Hells Gate area.   
 Hells Gate Slide 
This section will focus on the Hells Gate Slide itself, beginning with the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway which spurred the slide. It will discuss how human impact and the slide changed the water ecology and what measures were initially taken in order to solve the issue.   
 Environmental Impacts 

The main focus of this section would be damage to the local environment due to the slide. It would address the impact the Hells Gate slide had on the fish habitat, particularly focusing on the sockeye salmon runs disruption. It would then explore the decline in the salmon population due to the incident and would focus on the relocation of the salmon, which was unable to reach the spawning grounds, into other rivers.
  

 Social and Political Impacts 
In this section we will look at the social impacts on the native fisheries and on the commercial fisheries that happened as a result of the hells gate slide.

 The International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission (IPSFC 
Here I'll discuss how the Commission came to be, what it was comprised of, who was in it, how it functioned, etc. also their research (although this may go in the next section). This section may be relatively small, as there is already an existing entry on the Commission.

 International Dispute 
Discuss the disputed research methods and conclusions, and the escalating conflict
 Government Response 
This section will deal with the response to the slide - building of fishways, etc.

"Australian club notability 2 

Hey Octopus, first and foremost, awesome work on creating a table of notability for football clubs and comps. Much appreciated by all, I'm sure. =)

I'm writing this to see about . A previous user messaged you about adding the old and proposed national cups in late 2012. Since then, two major changes have occurred in Australian Football. The first is not-surprisingly the development of the FFA Cup from a proposal, to a legitimate tournament. The second change is a little more subtle, but still extremely notable. The alignment of 8 of the 9 State Leagues into a national second division.

The updated version I'm suggesting is for the A-League (1), National Soccer League (1), National Premier Leagues (8) to be deemed notable. Your previous list also mentions the Brisbane Premier League (a third division) as notable.

I was also wondering if the following third division leagues (all containing promotion spots to the National Premier Leagues competitions) could also be deemed notable:
National Premier Leagues NSW 2 (12/12 clubs within this league have articles) (Note: This is the most prestigious third division competition in Australia).
National Premier Leagues Victoria 1 (20/20 clubs within this league have articles)
National Premier Leagues State League (16/16 clubs within this league have articles)

Boolean logic involves the theory of sets. And as far as I can see, all information, all communicated scientific information can fit into either or both of the two categories fact, or opinion. So when I get information, I immediately try to fit it into those 2 category sets. But I'm human and live with uncertaincies, and believe in luck, and have hunches etc, which are not consistent with Boolean logic. And I've dealt with the mathematics of probability and know that if we went through that formalized process every time we had to make a decision we'd never get anything done.

 Your edits to Marcus Hahnemann 

Okay, examples:
For the piping of club names, check any other football bio page, e.g. Theo Walcott, Brian McBride, Wayne Rooney, Alan Shearer.
For the formatting of dates in the infobox, check the guidelines at Template talk:Infobox Football biography.  You should be using five tildes (i.e. """"~~~~~"""") to produce the timestamp.
For your other edit, how does """"English FA Premier League"""" even make sense?  Either call it the English Premier League, or call it the FA Premier League, but to call it both in the same sentence is nonsensical!

Please do some research in future before trying to change the style on an article.    
For the piping, the convention is meaningless, as the name of the club includes the initials. The fact that some other articles use your conventions does not mean anything, other articles use mine. So it is a matter of meaning, and I still think mine has more sense.
For adding the hour and minute of the update of scores, I think it is useless, but if your template talk says so...
I do not agree with you. """"English FA Premier League"""" makes sense, as the league is the """"FA Premier League"""", and, guess, it is English.

 Example 

""""For example, a train that weighs 1 kg moving at 500 m/s and that hits a 'perfect' steel wall where it uniformly decelerates from 500 m/s to 0 m/s in .02 seconds, has an approximate impact force of 25000 N. Thus, a body which decelerates more quickly has a greater effective impact than one which decelerates more slowly.""""

I'm not doubting the calculation here, but the example is a bit unusual.  500 meters per second is equivalent to about 1118 miles per hour, faster than a bullet train.  And a 1 kg train is like a toy train or something... so in my head I'm imagining a toy train breaking the sound barrier and smashing into a steel wall.  I'm not sure what a typical train weighs (maybe 50,000 kg), but apparently their max speed is about 50 mph or 80 km/h or 22.222 m/s.

50,000 kg * 22 m/s / 0.02s = 55,000,000 N

 Clarification needed - Run in with Tom Pettigrew after shooting her brother 

According to the Wiki article, under """"Brother's shooting"""": """"...later pointing the weapon at a moving vehicle on the adjacent road, trying to get into the vehicle....""""

Does the above have anything to do with this?  It doesn't seem so to me.  Here's a snippet of the article:

Carrying a shotgun by her side, a 21-year-old Bishop walked intently across a car lot into the adjacent storefront, where she began searching for car keys. Coming down from the second floor, she was heading toward the garage when she ran into Tom Pettigrew and a friend, who had spotted her in the parking lot and came to investigate.  """"Her gun hit me in the chest,"""" Pettigrew, 45, recalled from his Quincy apartment. """"I yelled, 'What are you doing?' and she screamed at me to put my hands up. So I put my hands up.""""

But the Braintree police chief has cast doubt on that conclusion [that she accidentally killed her brother], and the armed confrontation at the garage provides new insight into her state of mind after her brother's death. The Boston Herald first reported Pettigrew's account of the events today.  Only minutes after that shooting, according to Pettigrew, Bishop frantically told workers at the garage she had been in an argument with her husband and needed a car to escape, nervously scanning the premises as she kept the gun pointed at their backs.

So, my question is did this Pettigrew incident happen before or after she pointed the weapon at a moving vehicle?  In other words, what's the time line?  Thanks.    """,0

Herbeck/von Herbeck
Hi, James,  Well, I think there are three separate questions:
 The two articles I merged were most definitely about the same person, unless 2 people with virtually the same name, the same nationality, working in the same field, shared exactly the same day of birth and exactly the same day of death.  Technically possible, but extraordinarily unlikely, I would suggest.  
  Now, there may indeed have been another Johann Herbeck who worked around that time, but I'm no expert and I've never heard of such person.
 As to why the Bruckner biographies have him as Herbeck and not von Herbeck, it's probably because he got his """"von"""" only in 1874, three years before his death.  For the great bulk of his life, he was simply Herr Herbeck, so it's appropriate to refer to him that way in a biog of another person.  For an encyclopedia article, however, he gets his full final name.  

This is a very handy source for some further updates to the article.  Cheers.      """,0

Wikipedia Regrets The Errors

From June to September of 2007, several false and misleading critical statements appeared at the National Civilian Community Corps (also known as AmeriCorps NCCC) page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Civilian_Community_Corps), in violation of Wikipedia standards.  This is the false text as it appeared:

National Civilian Community Corps

""""...Criticisms
The NCCC program has met with sharp criticisms from some fiscal conservatives who accused it of being a """"boondoggle"""".[4] Most notably, Libertarian pundit and commentator James Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud""""[5], in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book """"Feeling Your Pain: The Explosion and Abuse of Government Power in the Clinton-Gore Years."""" Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it """"a fraud"""".
^ http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188385,00.html ^ http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm""""

Wikipedia relies on its readers and volunteer contributors to avoid or challenge and correct misleading or false information.

The following has been called to our attention:

1.  The statement that read """"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud,"""" cited as its source an article at this address by Bovard: http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm  Nowhere in that article does Bovard make that statement.  No mention of """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" nor of the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""" appears in that article, nor is AmeriCorps NCCC called a 'waste and fraud.""""  We regret the error.

2. The same sentence went on to state the following:  """"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud"""", in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book """"Feeling Your Pain ...""""

Upon investigation, this statement turns out to be untrue.  Bovard's book (published in hardcover by St. Martin's press) does not contain a chapter of criticisms of AmeriCorps NCCC in the book """"Feeling Your Pain.  In fact, neither """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" nor the """"National Civilian Community Corps are mentioned at all in the text of that book nor in the book index.  (The chapter in question concerns the umbrella program, AmeriCorps, but does not mention the program known as """"AmeriCorps NCCC'"""" or the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""".

(The only mention to NCCC is in the footnotes, referring to a speech by then-president Clinton, praising, not criticizing, the NCCC.)

In sum, the book """"Feeling Your Pain"""" does not dedicate """"an entire chapter of criticisms"""" of AmeriCorps NCCC, contrary to the information posted at the Wikipedia website.  We regret the error.

3.  Also untrue was the sentence """"Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it [i.e., AmeriCorps NCCC] """"a fraud"""".  This sentence was misleading and false.  It was placed at the National Civilian Community Corps page and referred to the antecedent in the previous sentence, the AmeriCorps NCCC.

The claim relied on the article by Bovard at http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm.  No mention of either the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""" nor of """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" appears in that article.  No evidence has been put forward to support the statement that Mr. Sweet ever labeled AmeriCorps NCCC a """"fraud.""""  We regret the error.

Wikipedia deeply regrets that this misleading text appeared at our National Civilian Community Corps website and that it persisted for as long as it did.

The editor responsible for its appearance and continued re-emergence will no longer have access to the National Civilian Community Corps Wikipedia entry.

Signed: _____

[Philippe - Calls to move forward on the National Civilian Community Corps page, to be a team player, etc., would be better received if Wikipedia posted a note something like the above at the NCCC site  - not to mention, it might restore Wikipedia's credibility on the subject.  I don't know if there is a snowball's chance of that happening, but at least this gives you some information to process so you can evaluate the current situation.  Given the nature of the NCCC - a substantial and serious component of U.S. disaster relief and mitigation capacity - and its recent near-demise following misleading claims like those posted at Wikipedia, the statement above is not written as amusement.] """,0

Nor have I made a legal threat.  First, I am not among those three people who participated in that visit to the BLM protest.  I have never known any of these people.  I would not be the offended party, in any case.  I've never even lived in Minnesota, or been there in over 30 years or so.  (I made an airplane connection through Minneapolis in about 1985, as I vaguely recall.)  I am not saying there WILL be any sort of legal proceeding; I am merely saying that to cite this claim (""""heard the N-word"""") risks running afoul of being libel.  I think WP rules allow us to express concern that the cite of a vague assertion that somebody """"heard the N-word"""" is problematic from a WP:BLP standpoint.  If multiple BLM protestors claim that they heard one of the (white) visitors say the N-word, and it was cited from some reliable source, that would probably change my opinion.

""""Not my business to go and unearth the original source documents.""""  If you read widely enough instead of relying on large overview sources and have more than a superficial interest in the subject, sooner or later you might """"unearth"""" the original documents, which are surprisingly easy to come by.  A large portion of the naval history books I have listed in my library came off the internet for nothing, and if you're lucky you'll find books which quote documents verbatim.  Last weekend I had the great pleasure to take advantage of a incompetent error made by the National Archives and was able to download a few dozen service records for free, instead of the hundreds of pounds of the five hundred pounds/thousand dollars plus I would normally have had to pay.  Already I have seen where certain historians (Gordon in The Rules of the Game is one) have obviously not checked the service record and made false assertions about certain officers, and also where they have cited the service record yet written something entirely different.

Marder is interesting because in his twenties he was possibly the last person to look at a great deal of Admiralty literature.  It's bad enough that in many cases he doesn't cite specifically the details of the correspondence involved, but it really didn't help that the Naval Historical Section literally purged untold numbers of documents, a process which was finally halted in the late fifties.  Therefore quite literally a lot of Marder's scholarship depends on his reputation and not the facts.  (talk |  | ) """,0
"""

 Human rights section should be removed 

After reading through this section it should either be removed or renamed """"Why Chinese are dogs and Tibet deserves freedom"""" section. Referenced or not it's a far cry from unbiased. I don't even see why a section like that is needed   

I have added some more references to the ‘human rights’ section. I have also removed a number of the “XYZ claims that…” phrases, because they (a) disrupt the flow/readability (b) are unnecessary; just click on the reference if you want to see who is making the claim.
I am not too surprised that this new section is upsetting some editors. Nevertheless, I absolutely disagree with claims that the information presented is biased, false, or unverified. Regarding neutral POV, what about consensus POV? Information about human rights in Tibet falls into 2 categories; in one the sole source is the Chinese Government, and in the other side is every other source (including UN, HRW, Amnesty, RSF, etc, etc….). 
I would like to see the “neutrality disputed” tag removed from this section, can we please continue the discussion here to resolve specific concerns? Provide additional sources if you disagree with the information from existing sources.   
At best this section is a place for pro-Tibet to post links to anti-China websites and vice-versa. It really doesn't contribute to the article as a whole.   

 I will say it again - if you disagree with the existing sources then add your own, otherwise quit whining. And surely you cannot be serious about removing the section. Human Rights in Tibet is a very serious issue, and this page is the right place to cover it.   
I'd agree entirely. However, some of the wording could probably made more neutral while preserving the facts. For instance: adding """"According to Human Rights Watch, a non-government organization, Tibetans are denied..."""". (Which is done for several other sentences). It might also allay some concerns if sources could be found from a less-biased source. I'm not really disputing the accuracy of HRW or FreeTibet, but it's rather harder to argue that an article from the New York Times suffers from a bias. Just my $0.02.   
It is essential to state where the sources is retreated from in a particular statement.  In a controversial section like this, its important to differentiate the origin of the source, because many links cited in this section came from a particular organization.  
The user who started this section grouped a bunch of statements (with various citings) together.  Some of the statements are not supported by one reference but the other, we have to pick them out and make sure they fit the accurate reference.  
referenced or not its a far cry from unbiased. Please review WP:NPOV. Wikipedia must report viewpoints held by both Chinese and human rights organizations. A statement of fact cannot be biased, and """"X states Y"""" is a statement of fact.   
I should add however, that which facts ought to be included is up for discussion under WP:UNDUE. However, since the vast majority of English press regarding Tibet deals with human rights issues, I don't think it can reasonably contested that a """"Human rights"""" section ought to be part of this article. 
 I am the one who started this section. I did it in good faith, and considered it to be an initial draft for further development. I tried to group the statements together into a logical sequence, and also tried to accurately link the statements to their supporting references. I appreciate the constructive edits done by other editors since then, and before I add any more references I will help to clean up the existing text so that it faithfully ties to the existing references. 

 GimmeDanger is absolutely correct in saying that a statement of fact (ie. has evidence to support it) cannot be biased; it is a fact, end of story. However, what often happens on other Wiki pages is that the argument then moves to which references are considered reliable. This is the reason I have used a variety of different sour",0
"""

 The very concept of """"discrete mathematics"""" itself is a vague illusion  

The thing is, analysis is like anything else in mathematics. It can be built up from the basic principles of counting. That is, the simplest principles that build the addition function, which we think of as the number of elements in a union of finite disjoint sets of given sizes, and the multiplication function, the exponentiation function, etc, and anything required for general talk of """"the"""" number of objects corresponding to some act of counting, that is, to prove that it is well defined. These basic counting principles are responsible for all of mathematics, including analysis. There is only one mathematics. There is no distinction between discrete and continuous mathematics that is not exposed as an illusion if you look hard enough. There are no walls. 

It's fine to think about discrete mathematics in the same sort of loose way that people think about the distinction between number theory and combinatorics. For example, the Goldbach conjecture is easily stated combinatorially, and that's fine as long as you recognise the inherent looseness in what these two areas of mathematics represent. An article about """"discrete mathematics"""" can never be very good. All it can say, is that discrete mathematics is a hodgepodge of areas of mathematics which do not implictly involve the areas of real or complex analysis, or topology, for their study. Anything else would be far from the truth. I say """"implicitly"""", because real and complex analysis, and topology to some extent, can be very useful in these areas.""",0

 Navigational template 

All the other topics have such things. So if there is a """"X and violence"""" article, there is usually a """"criticism of X"""" navigational template. As a sidebar, it does seems a bit pov-ish and non-WP:TOPIC since articles are often in a """"see also"""" type category rather than relating to the article at hand.   

That's my problem with them also. I think we should really get rid of all the criticism sidebars, all except for the the literary, film, etc, ones since criticism in those circles doesn't usually equate to 'very biassed'. It's almost as bad as putting articles on Christian violence under Wikiproject atheism (or vice versa, though I can't see it happening). When I see articles tagged that way I don't need to see anything else to know that somebody or other has a POV to grind and that the article is likely a mess.
  

 Teehan and Dostoevsky 

So the problem here is that we are mixing contemporary academics with great thinkers and writers and also putting Dostoevsky after Teehan when Dostoevsky clearly predated Teehan.  At the core of the problem is the fact that the question of whether Christianity is violent goes back further than Dostoevsky.  Thus, if we are going to use sources that are not from the last half of the 20th century, then we should frame the whole question as a much older debate involving philosophical perspectives such as Dostoevski's.
Note that I am not objecting to including Dostoevski; I'm just saying that we need to put him up against other great thinkers of a similar stature.  I'm thinking that there must be Enlightenment thinkers who would be good representatives of the critical side.

The article is about a summer program for kids that takes place at Truman State University. The whole thing simply looks like an advertisement or brochure for the program and all the sourcing is to the program's own website pages. The article even has the program's Summer 2012 schedule. Also, if you look at the talk page, the article has been written solely by their students as a project. If you think it should be nominated, can you start the AfD? I don't know how to do it. Thanks! 76.189.114.163  
This is not the type of article I know the WP criteria for. Yes I do alot of AFDs, but most are either Aviation or Sports related. All other AFDs I've done that don't fit those two I doubt number more than 10 or 12. Sorry I can't help. 

Kudos

Kudos for withdrawing the bad nomination on the Maine politician when you realized you had made a mistake. Things would run more smoothly at WP if we all could admit our inevitable minor goofs as they happen.

It is generally considered acceptable to remove personal attacks, though there are some who disagree with that. If when you remove a personal attack you are reverted, then do not remove it again. Instead seek an outside party to investigate, preferably on some sort of public noticeboard. I really do not know the first thing about the Ireland dispute and from what little I have heard I don't want to touch it with a 10 foot poll.

No, there are not different standards for different editors. There is however a gap between the treatment of those who know how to work with the system, and those who do not grasp the intricate details. While Wikipedia claims not to be a bureaucracy does in fact share many similar traits with a bureaucracy. Knowing the correct """"form"""", noticeboard or procedure will take you far, knowing the tone and content expected from said processes and presenting in that fashion will take you even farther. It is a bit of a shame that such an advantage is given to those who know the ins and outs but it is the way things end up working here. Chillum 01:01, 14""",0

Block

I have reverted nationalist anti-Soviet propaganda, mass deletion and removing the mention of Nazi collaborationist war crimes in Participants in World War II about once a day. I have been blocked in circumvent of the rules by a POV admin. The article should be restored to the pre-edit war status

Nixer, you reverted that article four times. I have blocked you for only 24 hours, although your repeated 3RR violations would usually warrant more, as would your """"POV admin"""" remark above.  (T) 

Taking no position whether Nixer  deserves a block for revert warring, I must note that 4 reverts accumulated in 36, not 24 hours as per this. Staying under 3RR is no entitlement in any way and general revert warring is subject to admin's discretion blocks. However, in such case the admin should be uninvolved, unlike user:ProhibitOnions who was one of the editors who reverted Nixer. Again, I take no position on whether Nixer should be blocked for RV warring in general, just noting that technically 3RR is not there and blocking by admin who participates in article disagreement is highly inappropriate in such case.

All this aside, Nixer, you should cool down finally.  

Three of Nixer's reverts were within 24 hours and the fourth was the following morning, which I reverted, but subsequently restored. Furthermore, I am not a recent editor of this article, and am not thrilled by the attitude presented by either Nixer or the editors reverted; if there had been any genuine discussion, they might have been able to reach a compromise, as they were both presenting opposing national",0

No one asked women if they wanted the vote - it was the Suffragettes who put the proposal on the table. Now that women in Egypt have the vote does that mean we should disenfranchise them because the European Suffragettes from one hundred years ago didn't ask them if they wanted to be represented?

The money supply in Japan has been steadily declining for at least the past few years, yet world stock markets have been reaching new highs, and assets of all kinds have been bid to sky-high valuations.  Thus, it can be argued that the asset bubble is being driven by money supply expansion in Europe and the United States, and not by the shrinking money supply in Japan.

Whites are not unique in those types of behavior. 

 'African-American babies are far more likely to die than white ones, which is often taken as evidence that poverty and lack of health insurance are to blame. That's entirely plausible until you notice another racial/ethnic gap: Hispanics of Mexican or Central or South American ancestry not only do consistently better than blacks on infant mortality, they do better than whites. Social disadvantage doesn't explain very much. Nor does access to prenatal care, as the health care critique implies.

On goals(aim) - """"Israel's defence chief earlier said his country was fighting a """"war to the bitter end"""" against Hamas.""""

On whether to use 'stated' or not - """"Israel says its aim is to end the rocket attacks by Hamas-linked militants - of which there were reportedly more than 40 on Monday.""""

Dec 27 - Israel's attack on Gaza kills hundreds - http://www.contracostatimes.com/california/ci_11323391

On goals - """"The government said the open-ended campaign was aimed at stopping rocket attacks that have traumatized southern Israel.""""

""""Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said late Saturday that the goal was """"to bring about a fundamental improvement in the security situation."""" He added, """"It could take some time.""""

""""Stated""""? - see above plus """"Israel warned it might go after Hamas' leaders, and militants kept pelting Israel with rockets - killing at least one Israeli and wounding six.

Dec 30 - Israel Assaults Hamas In Gaza - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/12/27/israel-launches-air-strik_n_153664.html

On goals - """"Israel's stated goal is to cripple Hamas' ability to launch rockets at Israeli towns, which means that a ground invasion is becoming more likely as it becomes clear that airstrikes alone cannot finish the job.""""

""""Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has declared """"all-out war against Hamas.""""

""""Stated""""? Yes. But infrastructure? and since Hamas fire those rockets from civilians area, not having military bases of their own, police stations and houses in gaza are Hamas' infrastructures?

I recognized Nishidani's point as being that from the beginning there was ambiguity as to what this Israel's attack was to bring Israel itself. Now there was a target inside Gaza, Hamas, there is war, but is war about what? goals? yes to some degree, but most of those goals can't be archived until conquering has been archived(re:Iraq war, AND Israel's previous occupations of both Lebanon and Palestine)...so to cripple Gaza, only Hamas's """"infrastructure"""" was the """"stated"""" goal?

At what point, even Israel's foreign minister was at odds with what the prime minister was """"stating"""" as the goals for this operation.

Needless to say then, it would be a great disservice if we use Israel's """"stated goals"""" as of Jan 30.

My humble suggestion is to leave it as """"The operation was aimed at..."""" Stated is a loaded term.

There should be even more discussion on this BTW. Cryptonio (talk) 

Plus, Dec 30 - ANALYSIS / Hamas is hoping for an IDF ground operation in Gaza - http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1051024.html

On goals - """"The operation's goals, as defined by the cabinet, are """"creating a different long-term security situation in the south, while bolstering Israel's deterrence."""" The IDF does not interpret this to mean a complete end to the rocket fire, as it considers this impossible. Rather, its goal is to eliminate Hamas' desire to attack Israel. The bombing campaign has so far dealt a severe blow to Hamas.""""

Fire in the hole. Notice ref to """"as defined""""(so they are defining what they are stating? or vice-versa?) plus IDF does not interpret what's been stated(which of course was defined before it was stated) which at the end, they disregard what was stated for them(perhaps rather just defined, in order for them to interpret on their own?) because they found what was 'defined' for them impossible(or what they interpreted as being defined to them).

Oddly enough, I am truly agnostic on this particular bit of software. It's always been my position that it should have a fair trial, but it seems that at every step things have been problematic.  First off, there was the fact it was introduced immediately on the heels of two other major UI changes (the addition of revision deletion to the admin toolkit, and the switchover to Vector).  Then there was the fact that the version on the test wiki was *not* the version to be introduced here, so nobody could even test it properly on the testwiki.  The trial criteria were not developed until just days before the trial itself, and there were no benchmarks set to determine whether or not there was any change over time, or whether that change was positive or negative. The majority of early supporters in the original PC poll wanted it to be focused on BLPs, but for some reason at the end of the poll it was decided that PC should be applied to currently protected or semi-protected articles instead, and those were the articles targeted in the trial. The WMF press on the subject specifically referred to the ability for anonymous and newly-registered users to edit long-time semi-protected articles of high profile topics (the George W. Bush article was specifically mentioned), without discussing this in advance with the community. (It lasted less than 2 days on pending changes, with mountains of vandalism during that period.) Then there was the promise by the lead developer that PC would be shut off at the end of 60 days unless the community clearly requested otherwise. Four days later, when lead developer responsibility changed hands, the new lead developer announced that he would rather keep things running during any review, on a quiet page with only the most interested editors watching.  Even with all of this disarray, I still hoped that we could get a reasonable trial of the tool. It was agreed that we'd start off with 2000 articles in the trial, starting with just a few and ramping up so that we'd hit the 2K articles around 2 weeks into the trial, with the expectation that if things went well, we'd add more incrementally, perhaps up to 10K; however, only a handful of administrators participated in adding articles to the trial, and I don't think we ever got above 1500.  Further, at that point, we'd pretty well added all of the articles that were eligible under the criteria for the trial, except for ones in categories where one or more administrator had objected to inclusion; as best I can tell, their objections were based on the articles being honey pots for socks.  I was one of the most active admins in adding articles to the trial, and I confess I sneaked in a pile of BLPs that technically didn't meet the criteria (they had been semi-protected in the previous 6 months and had fewer than 10 watchers). Indeed, one of the most telling factors on this trial was the fact that very, very few administrators appeared to be interested in using the tool as currently configured. I also note that the time that it has taken edits to be reviewed has continued to lengthen as time has gone on. A few weeks ago, I led a panel on the topic of Pending changes at the New York City Wiki-conference. Thanks to DGG, Becksguy and Jamesofur, who were also on the panel.   That same day, keynote speaker Clay Shirky talked about the fact that once a culture is """"broken"""", it is not able to rebound back to its prior state. In my own closing statement, I reflected on that comment, and wondered if pending changes might be the """"culture-breaker"""" for Wikipedia and, if it was, whether or not that would be a good or bad thing. Certainly the manner in which this entire trial has proceeded has shown that there are some pretty huge differences in what people perceive as the way we do things around here. I don't think  the pending changes software or its use will be the culture breaker, but the manner in which it is being integrated and promoted into the project might very well be. I am very considerably concerned that this pressure to keep a bit of trial software running has resulted in a level of divisiveness between good-faith Wikipedians from which the community may not recover.

The articles, you are referring to, may be of stub types, however, if you think they are not in accordance with Wikipedia guidelines then be bold to bring them into light.

I'm going to be blunt about this, because there's a lot of things that don't add up here, and I'm a bit annoyed at the whole matter, to be quite honest.  Seven SPA editors for a guy with no press in English?  I don't think so.  First of all, as a technical printer and a PhD, you should know what a return key is, or at least be able to research it.  Use it.  Secondly, you do not verify what is reliable or not as far as sources go, and """"what you are personally aware of"""" is largely irrelevant.  There are policies here.  Read them.  Frankly, we haven't even satisfactorily answered the question of why Oprea is notable in English?  Because he lives in Boston?  So do a lot of other non-notable people.  Oprea has no hits on Google in English aside from this article and his own personal pages as the top three.  He's had no coverage in English-language sources.  As a matter of fact, he's made it obvious that he's the only reviewer of his own books on a lot of websites.  The stuff you're coming up with in Romanian is Internet material, not Romanian literary journals.  Even his Romanian article is lousy.  Are you trying to write a legitimate article on a writer, or an advertising piece for your buddy?  Wikipedia is not his free literary agent.   02:31, 27""",0
"Wikipedia and it's anti-communist bias

Funny thing, one can edit the article related to the mass killings that occurred under anti-communist regimes, but no edits can be done here. Also, it should be noted that the above mentioned article has a neutrality tag, but this one does not (it's quite obvious why it happeens). As a fellow Wikipedian, I demand that the Wikipedia anti-communist administration put such tags here too, since it's heavily biased and counts only with anti-communist references.

 Talk to me and prove your point instead of deleting this",0
""":::::I think if a linguistical male gender is used, it means by default all genders. Only if the linguistical feminine form is used, it would signify that it intends only one gender. How about in other cases: does Romanian laws say """"voter"""" or """"citizen"""" in linguistical male, when however meaning all voters, or all citizens?

 Discussion 

This article does an awful job maintaining an objective viewpoint, it is undeniable. It is a travesty to make it appear as though Mark Kirk opposes the war in Iraq despite the fact that he helped write and co-sponsored the House Resolution to invade Iraq in 2003.

It is also absolutely ridiculous to boast that he received an award from the League of Conservation Voters, and yet fail to mention that the very same group gave him an """"F"""" rating last Congressional session. Absolutely misleading.

I do not often edit wikipedia, and am not quite sure how to correctly cite these facts.

 Problems I am having with Sante Kimes article and changes 

I am wanting to document issues I am having with edits on Sante Kimes article.
All content herein refer to said article.

Moments ago I edited the """"lead"""" content for the article.
My reason for doing this is because the """"lead"""" was repetitious. As I wrote in the editing note, which state: """"Repetitious lead -Lead info is covered in the article in same order. Previous lead was not """"whitewashed"""" - Kimes is best known for 2 murders and the locations - This correction is neutral and factual""""

I believe the change I made was of a neutral point of view and was supported by referenced links within said article.

The change I made had previously been posted by an administrator that I am apparently having trouble with.
I had hoped to work with the administrator in a constructive effort to improve the said article. However, it appears that said administrator is making changes to said article out of spite or personal feelings against me or the article's subject.
I had mentioned to the administrator in said article's discussion page that is they had a problem with the articles subject, then maybe another administrator could assist me in creating a neutral point of view for the article.

On the said article's discussion page, there have been several biased statements by said administrator about the article's subject. And, I feel, about me simply because I would like the said article to be 'balanced' and neutral.

I am wanting to document any issue here as so that if there is a problem later, it has been documented on my talk page.
NOTE: I am not naming the administrator as a favor even though I doubt the attempted favor will be appreciated.
Furthermore, if there is a problem later, I do have it.
I'm sure the said administrator will read this and take offense, however, this is being done to protect myself in any potential future problem.   """,0

I think you have done a great job with the page, and I learned a lot from reading it and the other comments posted above.  I like that you were able to make use of some of the information we covered in class specifically related to this topic, but were also able to include plenty of outside resources.  Many of the concerns I had have been addressed in prior comments, but there is one section that I find slightly unclear.  It may just be the way I am reading your wording, but I figure there is always a chance that someone else will take it the same way and have the same question I do...  In the toxicology studies section, I think your intention is to say that because the mouse study used very high doses of the protein and proteins that will be toxic are usually toxic at very low doses, evidence supports that the Bt toxin is not toxic to mammals.  
what I initially read, however, was just the phrase """"Research on other known toxic proteins suggests that proteins are usually toxic at low doses, further suggesting that Bt toxins are not toxic to mammals"""" which confused me by making it sound like the toxins are almost always toxic at low doses and that the Bt toxin might not be safe.  Perhaps changing this wording would help clarify your meaning for future readers?  Just a thought.  Overall, great job!   """,0

"Nephilim deleted edit 

You state reliable sources. The first part of my edit is that which is taught in college (you would know if you ever attended). It is taught in literature class. It is: When studying this passage, or any passage of the Bible, it is best to use the Exegetical method, which is tearing it down to the bottom and rebuilding it using 6 contexts. First, one must use the Bible to interpret the Bible. Second, using the 6 contexts, which are: 1. What is the context (main idea, or thought) of the Bible?, 2. What is the context of the book you are reading (Genesis, Exodus, etc.)?, 3. What is the context of the chapter you are reading?, 4. What is the context of the verse you are reading? 5. What is the context of the key words?, and 6. What is the historical context? How did the people of that time think, act, etc. An example, to name something is to place one's authority on it. A king of a city state that has conquered another city state gives it a new name, because he is place his authority on it. Two things to keep in mind for a sound, correct interpretation of this passage are: 1. Where is the beginning of the narrative; the pivotal spot? It is Genesis 3:15, which is a prophecy of Christ and the beginning of the battle between evil and good. It is followed by the first example the story of Cain and Abel., 2. In the original Bible there were no chapter or verses, these were added later to make it easier to find passages. The story of the Flood begins at Genesis 4:17 and goes to Genesis 9:7 (this story should have been 1 chapter).
This aids the scholar attempting to understand and interpret a difficult passage. 
The next part: Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-27-5, New Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson; Kregel Publications 1987, ISBN 0-8254-4030-0/ both page 185)renders the word nephilim meaning as to fall upon other in rapine violence and apostates fallen from true religion. Strong's Exhaustive Concordance Of The Bible Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary, James Strong (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-01-1) cites the word as a bully,tyrant, or dictator. 
Here is given references to where the data is gotten (even page numbers), but by what you say this is reliable or acceptable. Just what would be.
The next part: One can get copies of the First and Second Book of Enoch, which one can read. Two such books are The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol 1(Doubleday & Co. Inc., 1983 ISBN 0-385-09630-5)and The Other Bible(Harper & Row, Publishers ISBN 0-06-250031-7)and there others. A WARNING. When reading these books keep in mind that they are non-canonical and are considered fictional; not God inspired and truthful. When one reads the Book of Enoch one sees a measurement for the offspring as 300 cubits. A cubit is 18 inches (check any Bible dictionary), or 1 1/2 feet. As such the offspring is 450 feet tall.
This again shows where one can find the data. All these references are from PUBLISHED and ESTABLISHED books, that is accepted by college professors, but not by you. How did the article get on Wikipedia? Did the author bribe someone, or is it that they are a dear buddy?
You may think this harsh, and it may be, but it is deserved. The reason why the information has been verified with published authentic sources that you refuse to accept. Then what needs to take place is that the articles references must be rejected as well for they are based on the same method and material. Why accept one person's references and not an others when both are from published established sources available to the public.
Once before I attempted this folly on an other article and again nothing, not even a police report, was accepted. The only thing I can think for this is that Wikipedia employees are not getting their palm greased, or that I am not a dear buddy with an in.
The reliable verified referenced attainable data is beneficial and helpful to the reader and scholar, but you and Wikipedia don't care, and spit on me, my effort to help, and the ones who would have benefited from it. Now you cam laugh and do a dance for you wasted my time and you have robbed the reader.",0

"And now for some... amusement 

After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

"""::::You're assuming far more about my views than I've actually said. I have two related points. First, that the topic in question is not necessarily bound to an adherence to the concept of self-reported identity, and that to do so is unencyclopaedic. Second, that it is absurd to assert the logical invalidity of all other definitions of the word """"man"""" but that based on self-reported identity.

I agree that the example is conceptually difficult. My view is that a range of interally consistent interpretations of that situation are possible, such that the choice betweeen these arguments cannot be made on a strictly logical basis. The arguments must admit of some strictly non-deductive premises (adductive, inductive etc.) It should be clear then that I'm certainly not advocating a """"definitive, binary and absolute"""" definition of """"man"""". And my reference to Wittgenstein is based upon his fundamental recognition that any word is a """"social construct""""; indeed it is precisely because of this that Wittgenstein argues that nothing that is exclusively self-defined (such as his example of the 'beetle' in the box) can have meaning.

Writing new guidelines that general folks understand
18-July-2009: These recent events have just re-confirmed what I've been telling people for years: Wikipedia runs on mobocracy, despite other people claiming (for years), """"No, no, WP decisions are made per logical reasoning, in accordance with written policies"""". Well, actually, that's not how decisions have been made, for several years, as of July 2009. I'm not quite sure what the problem is with the wiki-masses, in this attitude, that """"truth"""" is a popularity contest. There can't be a massive, multi-year wiki-cabal, so I suspect these mob-judgments are simply what happens when ordinary folk are challenged to think.Many school teachers have concluded that thinking must be taught to most people. In America, people are not allowed, typically, to become official judges without some type of formal judicial education, where they must pass standards of clear thinking. Not just anyone can sit on the bench, and start making decisions that affect thousands of other people.We have to write reality-based guidelines, with totally obvious examples, so that anyone could understand them. The wiki-masses don't follow concepts such as """"significant coverage"""" in reliable sources: I must conclude the current WP policies are like wiki-calculus for the masses. They cannot calculate wiki-integrals of the policies to reach a logical conclusion. Hence, the current policies are a failure for coordinating general editors.So, these bogus AfD discussions are such a waste of time, re-hashing misunderstandings as confirmed by popularity votes. We have to write policy essays to explain actual examples to be followed: I don't think there's any other hope. Most people just don't understand the current policy points, no matter how carefully that text is quoted in discussions. They see """"NOTINHERITED"""" and that's the extend of their reading: 2 words is a policy to them. Perhaps they started to read the policy text (yawn) and re-zoned to the 2 words, period.

To be readable, we must list obvious examples, such as the one-event R.M.S. Titanic generating """"50"""" notables. Plus, those examples must be listed in easy-to-read essays (no consensus required), so when we put """"WP:BIGEVENT"""" they know that, historically, big single events have generated numerous notables (e.g.: Lee Harvey Oswald & Jack Ruby in JFK assassination; Charles Manson & Manson family in Sharon Tate/etc. murders). It's the only way to defeat the notion that exceptions, to the intricate policies, must be determined by intense debates of popularity votes. No, instead, big-event notability can be explained by a simple essay of examples. We need those policy essays to shift the mass voting. -  """,0

understanding entirely of slavery in the US South.... e.g. 99 % of white families in the US South never ever owned any slaves ever so imputing slavery as the
basis for fighting in the Civil war and so too the battle flag, the confederate flag, has that fundamental flawed distorted view ... Add to that that northerners
were almost 100 % the ship owners and ship captains that brought all slaves over to the US South ; and add to that , that black kings, chiefs were the ones
who sold into slavery, all the slaves that were in the US South... and so on and on the story is one of fundamental distortion... 
And of the % of whites in South who owned slaves, they have all been dead 150 years... further add to the fact that for 100 % of white Southerners, the flag
has always represented Valor in battle of the 600,000 approximately white southerners who died in the war... Add to that the war began due to invasion by North
and the 100 % felt view of white southerners that states rights then was the main issue and to a very small view , slavery way below that esp as those 99 %
of confederate soldiers and their families did not own and had never owned slaves....

No Lists of top ten venomous snakes don't belong in ANY encyclopedia, including Wikipedia. These kinds of lists belong maybe in a children's book. Venom composition is not static. Even within a single individual, it will vary in quantity and relative proportions of components over time. Greater variability in components is seen between individuals of a species, greater still between species. Further, venom continues to evolve, often very rapidly, so there may be wide variations in venom composition and toxicity within a single species, over its geographic range. This is especially true for widely distributed species and may cause problems in antivenom effectiveness. Factors involved in the variation of venom and its toxicity include diet/habit variability, seasonal changes, geographical location, age-dependent variability, gender-dependent/sexual variability, altitude, and the list goes on. Then you've got the research methods used. This can be critical, as some snakes produce many venom components, but eject them sequentially, rather than as a uniform mixture. The immediate fate of the venom after collection is important, particularly in relation to environmental conditions that might denature certain components. The storage of the venom is also vital, and exposure to heat may cause damage to certain toxins. Prolonged storage in liquid form may damage others. Pooled venom may introduce many variabilities, because each pooled batch of venom will contain venom from different specimens, compounding both intra-individual and intra-specific variability. There are many potential variables in such research that may affect comparability and interpretation of results. The choice of test animal may be crucial, because each species may respond differently (including humans). The choice of route is also critical. The standard test of toxicity is the LD50. Mice are most commonly used. The LD50 remains the most universal standard for determining and comparing toxicity of venoms. As an example, the rough scaled snake (Tropidechis carinatus) has a much less potent venom than the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), on LD50 testing in mice. Yet clinically, the two venoms are virtually identical in the type and severity of effects on envenomed humans. There are many examples just like this across all species. The black mamba is not the most venomous snake species in the world, but it untreated human moratality rates are 100% and produces death in the most rapid time. To compare, the many-banded krait has a more potent venom on mice, but doesn't produce the same devastating effects on humans the way the black mamba does. Many more examples are readily available. Mice aren't humans. Yes, they may give us an idea on toxicity, but they aren't the same as humans. Talk to me! """,0

Daniel Vincent Kelley's Theory regarding this phrase
First I want to point out that while it is CLAIMED in the article that Marie Antoinette was kind and noble and gracious of the peasants, NOTHING is cited to prove such. The one Antoinette quote that is offered to this end, smacks of sociopathology or her recognition that she would promote her OWN cause, by offering kindness to those who are proving themselves kind to her. There's nothing in the phrase to indicate that she was speaking of the whole of the French people, but it seems she was speaking about some particular people who had been particularly kind to her. Calculating psychopaths can be kind for this reason, so that they will enjoy camaraderie with their aids. So, this statement, that she felt she should be nice to the people who were being nice to her, certainly does NOT certify Marie Antoinette as kind hearted or noble. I suspect, that much as the phrase is thrown around today, it was probably thrown around by the clique of it's originator. They probably had a real laugh, suggesting things the peasants could eat, when they ran out of bread as happened under the leadership of every dictatorial monarchy. Here's how I imagine the phrase came to be said by Marie Antoinette is she heard her royal family, her mom and dad and step parents, maybe her grandparents, talking about what had been said in an age past, when the peasants ran out of food and started eying the national leadership as cause. Then, when she found herself in the situation, she used what was in her circle a cliche, that was widely unknown to the rest of the world. She probably didn't think much of saying it, she probably thought it would be received by her audience as cute and figured it would never get around, never become more widely known that she said it AND probably she hadn't really considered how callous it is when people are starving, to make light of it. So, my guess, is that, EXACTLY as the phrase is thrown around today for it being so pithy and the situation so often endured, peasants starving, Marie-Thérèse originated it, the phrase circulated amongst Royalty for 100 years, probably spoken of at dinner parties how pithy was Marie-Thérèse, how callous and witty and devilishly fun (from the sadistic royal perspective). So Marie-Thérèse originates it, Marie Antoinette's family speaks of it, tells the story. Marie Antoinette happens upon the same situation, bread shortage, she rehashes the phrase originated by Marie-Thérèse. Rouseau writing of it, attributing it to a Princess who he had not heard first hand say it, proves that the phrase was circulating in royal and educated circles. He says some earlier royal said it, presumably she said it to other royals and presumably Rouseau similarly heard it spoken by royals. So, obviously, if Marie-Thérèse said it, 100 years before Rouseau wrote it, obviously the phrase was conveyed by some royal story teller, who probably blathered on and on about all the corruption and hi-jinks those callous witty royals do, for love of reliving the old times and as """"lessons"""" to the young royals on how to live. Marie Antoinette saying it, in royal company, would be like her saying, I'm on your side royal friends. It's basically a slightly witty way for Marie Antoinette to say she doesn't care how the peasants get through their hard times, how the royals deal with the peasants through those hard times, callous, is her intent and plan. It was a way of declaring her loyalty and making light of the situation. Many here have claimed that because Rouseau wrote it before Antoinette could possibly have said it, means that Antoinette never said it. That's OBVIOUSLY nonsense. She OBVIOUSLY didn't originate the phrase, credit Marie-Thérèse, but that wouldn't prevent her from spouting cliche as so many nim wits make habit.""",0

However, Cooperation may never happen.  Why?

Here is why:

1.  Does MickWest change the theological conservative Christianity  internal link so it goes to the Christian right (Falwell, etc).  Would a person who wants to act in good faith do that?  

2. Would people who act in good faith send harrassing messages (""""fundie"""" etc).

I think there are passages in Proudhon that read like minarchism. But there are just as many others if not more that don't. Whatever Larry Gambone says (I see that's where you've been taking your Proudhon quotes from, which is I guess why you never give decent references), there is certainly inconsistency - or at least, a greater degree of complexity than I think you are willing or able to accept, in Proudhon's work. But then who isn't inconsistent? As I said, it's not hard to find quotes in Proudhon that are against anarchism or that support property (in the full-blown sense). That doesn't mean that he was never an anarchist. 

I think 'On the general idea of the revolution in the 19th century' has his fullest discussion of the state and of his version of an anarchist society. It's definitely worth reading, and is widely available in english (though unfortunately I don't think it's on the net). 

In Section IV (On the principle of authority) you can find for example:

""""We conclude without fear that the revolutionary formula should not be direct legislation, nor direct government, nor simplified government; it is no more government.""""

""""Neither monarchy, nor aristocracy, nor even democracy, where this third term implies some or other government acting in the name of the people and calling itself the people. No authority, no government, even of the people: there is the revolution.""""

Also the number of the photos for this cities are proportional to their text.  

Some of the photos are belong to attraction of other cities of East Azerbaijan Province (Marand, Jolfa and ...) That could be involved inside their own articles not Tabriz.

There are some photos from the same monument that shows the same thing, where the monument has its own article and these photos can be presented in the original article and may be one photo in Tabriz article is enough.

Another thing is that we wanna to create a beautiful  article for Tabriz not Moscow or anywhere else.

About my photos: The images that you have mentioned belong to more than one year ago. Also there were not taken with a high resolution camera but quality of some of them are still good in comparison with newly uploaded photos it is the reason that they could survive up to now yet. By the way I have never reduced the resolution of the photos by myself as some users doing. Actually in those times there was no one other photo so at least even photos  with low resolution were better than nothing.

It is not to offend anyone, but like Kenneth Tennyson and his devoted sidekick JFD (the Green Hornet and Kato), I too have some historical points of views. I understand that you have been accused of being a pan-Indian nationalist, while I have been accused of being a Tamil nationalist. As far as Indian martial arts are concerned, martial arts from both your culture and mine are in the Indian martial arts section. Therefore, it effects both of us.

It seems like through this wiki-conflict, it has thrown us together into one pot. If I am here to put you or your culture down, or to discredit India, why in the first place would I have stuck up for you. I had not intentions in mind when I did that. It just ticked me off when Kenneth sent you that messed up message. Just like, for example, a few years ago, when a Punjabi store owner was beaten up in a hate crime. I was outraged...

I see you have a vast knowledge in the fighting styles of Northern Inda, while I have the same for Southern India. Likewise, you are very knowledgeable about ancient Bharat and its 16 Mahajanapada Republics, while I have the same for ancient Tamilakkam. Since this page on Indian Martial Arts effects us both, maybe together we can combine our knowledges to present a remarkable page. Yes, I do understand our passions which may sometimes clash. However, if we could set aside some of that and work together in a """"give-take"""" mentality we can make things work.

At the same time, we will present our contributions which may be opposite of what JFD-Kenny think, but at the same time their views shall be presented as well to give a fair and balanced view on Indian Martial Arts.

Do you agree with me on this? If so, it would be nice if we could communicate via e-mail. I have more ideas to share with you. I believe we can make this work. As far as JFD is concerned, I do not know what his intentions are. Maybe he feels a little threatened of the possiblity of you and me teaming up on this project? or maybe I am wrong...""",0

This is the memo that I meant - by the way my German appears really,really, really bad - the German version appears to be copied from the USA version. Of course this is just one of
many memos between the participants. I note that the memos that you put
forward, however, seem to show that the """"Jewish problem"""" was being
handled in ways other than gas chambers - ie deportation or sterilization
( both rather extreme injustices but not deadly - a little reading
shows that Hitler, Himmler,etc... could be quite squimish about 
killing people (ie the wiki article """"Night and Fog"""" sugggests as much).
There has been attempts to question this memo's provenace, however, this
memo is just one of several that follow the same theme - """"leave the Jewish problem alone, at
least till the war is over"""". If there was any gassing - or any murder of 
Jews - it was being done behind Hitler's back ( and  the backs of any
loyal/ambitious Hitlerites ), a not very plausible scenario, but the one 
the memos would force on believers. 

The memo I meant was:

""""Mr Reich Minister Lammers informed me that the Führer had repeatedly
declared to him that he wants to hear that the Solution of the Jewish
Problem has been postponed until after the war is over. That being so,
the current discussions are of purely theoretical value, in Mr Reich
Minister Lammers' opinion. He will moreover take pains to ensure that,
whatever else happens, no fundamental decisions are taken without his
knowledge in consequence of a surprise briefing by any third party.""""
July 1942

Unless some scholar can find a memo dated after this that reverses the 
policy - and I believe all the memos and actions taken by various people 
(ie Himmler,Luther, Morgan, etc ) instead tend to confirm the policy - 
it appears that finding a memo with a Hitler ( ie official ) connection
to the Holocaust is just a dream. ( Irving's $1,000 - or whatever amount - seems safe) I hope this memo can make it into the article - ( he may have been a nasty guy but honestly he was 
probably just a bureaucrat, that seems to be the treatment he 
received after the war by people on the scene). 
Browsing/reading the German language wikipedia - I am not really a good
German reader but correct me if you are - version of this article it
appears they also avoid the relevant memo, but of course they have the
fear of prosecution over their heads. In America our reluctance, at least, isn't legal. 
Finding the Luther memo, it appears this memo is of an even later date. 
It is even more revealing as to what the policy toward Jews was during the war.
All Jews were to be expelled from Europe after the war was over - so it 
appears Hitler was not talking gas chambers,etc quite late in the war. 
Memos of this sort seem to crowd all the Holocaust gassing,etc into a
very small time frame - an impossibly small time frame, probably why the 
memos are ignored by all right thinking people.  

PS I just found out that the Luther memo has a long history. It has been ignored 
since at least the 1970s. I thought this was a relatively recent discovery
by scholars etc - it appears to just be an old unanswerable embarrasment 
to the Holocaust story. Thanks for pushing me to search harder. One of the troubles
with trying to hide or falsify history appears to be that it takes very little work
by very unknowledgeable people ( ie me )  to discover the truth. I found most of the
information that seems more plausible than the """"official"""" story by just hitting ENTER
on more than the the first page of search engine results.

 Possible issue 
One weird question. The old rumor about the last line of EoE came out as true, and in a rather disturbing interview. The line was supposed to be """"I'd never want to be killed by you of all men, absolutely not!"""" but was changed to """"Disgusting"""" after a question from Anno. The situation as commented by Miyamura (voice of Asuka) is: 
At last Anno asked me, """"Miyamura, just imagine you are sleeping in your bed and a stranger sneaks into your room. He can rape you anytime as you are asleep but he doesn't. Instead, he masturbates looking at you, when you wake up and know what he did to you. What do you think you would say?"""" I had been thinking he was a strange man, but at that moment I felt disgusting. So I told him that I thought """"Disgusting"""". And then he sighed and said """"... thought as much."""" He said. """" I thought as much. Original text mirror, archived 
Now here's the situation. This actually is a very simple analysis - one which I am sure even Wikipedia would allow, but it is of a bit questionable nature. In End of Evangelion, Shinji sees Asuka in the hospital, ends up revealing her body and masturbates to her. Asuka who returns after the Third Impact (questionable prior death notwithstanding) makes the comment """"Disgusting"""" when she is laying beside Shinji. Would simply stating the information as presented be acceptable for the meaning of Asuka's final line, the meaning is so obvious that it is not a synth.   """,0

Hi Jorgenumata. I liked all the additions you have made. I myself have worked in metals on the physics side, so I can add some things. But actually, for the overall structure, I think it would be useful to discuss some of the ways that MD is used in different fields on the talk page so that we can incorporate the different uses of MD more fully. Most people are focused on their on field, and don't see outside it (me included), so it is kind of hard to incorporate all the different things into one article.
The merge discussion with MM is an example. Metals cannot be modelled by force fields. They are completely incompatible with the force field view of molecules, and from reading the MM page, MM only uses force fields. So it seems impossible to merge the articles. Anyway, enoough of my blabbing. The things that I am interested in knowing are what/how MD is used in different fields.

Fluid/aerodynamics: Do fluid dynamics / aerodynamics people use the billiard-ball approximation of atoms to model fluids, and are these methods considered molecular dynamics if they consider each atom individually?
Metals: We don't use force fields. Generally, TBSMA or equivalent is the least accurate/most empirical that can be used. Tight-binding and ab initio are far more common. Anyway, I can add a lot of metals things myself, so don't need much input here.
Semiconductors: Again, force fields are not used. However, requires very different approximations to metal simulations. Again, I can add stuff to the article on these.
Chemists: What exactly do chemists study? Are the chemical reactions always studied within a solvent, or are they studied on isolated chemical compounds? Is it always important to correctly model the temperature and pressure, or are these secondary considerations in chemical MD simulations?
Bio: Similar to chemistry, are temperature and pressure important? Do proteins get modelled within the context of a solvent, or are conformations studied on the basis of a single protein molecule with no external interactions?
So, I'll try to add some metals and semiconductor things to the article, but I don't want to break the chem/bio side. Will come back in maybe a week and try to do some additions.  09:09, 21 November",0

"Compromise for introduction
I propose to add the following as introduction.
The Safavids (1501-1722) were a Turkic-speaking Shiite dynasty which ruled Iran from 1502 till 1722 (though several Safavid rulers were nominally reigning until 1736)[3]. The Safavid empire originated in the city of Ardabil in Iranian Azerbaijan and had its origins in the Shiite Safaviyyeh Order. Safavids combined the elements of Turkic tribal militancy with Persian cultural identity and the Shiite teachings of Islam to assert the contemporary Azerbaijani and Iranian Shiite identity. During their reign, Safavids established a vast Iranian empire including the whole of modern Iran and the parts of modern Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, South Caucasus and Turkey.

Thanks for getting back to me. I share your """"opinion that we should point out clearly and repeatedly that both Republicans and Democrats are clearly to the right of the demographic center,"""" and I agree it seems like a minority opinion in the mass media. But I still view it as a neutral opinion. With this view, the idea that """"the Democratic Party is almost evenly divided between left-of-center liberals and more centrist moderates"""" seems irrelevant in the lead of an American Left article. I thought that text written in the prefaces to the Encyclopedia of the American Left might hold sway over other editors by serving to dispel disagreements about the scope, lead, and the most important subdivisions of topic. That might be the case in German Wikipedia, and I think it's the case here in science and history articles, but, in politics, perhaps no academic authority can ever hold sway over editors here. This means that even the foundational defining terminology of US politics articles like this one with a potentially ambiguous scope might never be stable. But I respond easily to baiting, I bait other editors myself, I can be sarcastic, and I'm an infrequent (but confident) contributor. If the article is improving now, then it's probably best for someone like me to just shut up.

 Solar intensity due to proximity  
Ratio between Aphelion and Perihelion: Axial tilt comparison still needed

Request confirmation of math

There is some effect of the distance between the sun and the earth on the radiant energy reaching the earth. There is some measure of heating northern latitudes up in their winter, up to a maximum at Jan 3, and heating southern latitudes up in their summer. Thus, the winters in northern latitudes (all other variables such as warming by ocean currents, etc, removed from consideration), are relatively more mild, and the summers in southern latitudes (variables removed), relatively more extreme. However, the ratio of the aphelion (furthest distance) to the perihelion (nearest) is only 1.033988391 . So, a difference of 3.4%.

Then to calculate what that does to the total radiant energy: Inverse-square law says, """"the radiation passing through any unit area is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point source"""" Received light quadruples as the distance halves.

So 

E sun energy stays the same so is 1, solving for intensity I, d is distance, using perihelion distance as 1, d (aphelion) = 1.033988391 and d2 = 1.069131994.

Multiply both sides of the equation by 1.069131994, so that I is both multiplied and divided by the same number; this cancels out, and E is now 1.069131994. E is now equal to I, as I is no longer divided by anything. I =  1.069131994.

1.069 times (aphelion intensity) = perihelion intensity. 

1 / 1.069131994 = 0.935338204, 

.935 times (perihelion intensity) = aphelion intensity.

Axial tilt total radiant energy and/or comparison with the above remains to be found

My name is Stephen Koepfer and I wrote the original Bullshido article/investigation on Geraci. I wanted to share my account regarding how the RF acticle came into being, since my name has come up here. Sacha Feinman, a noted journalist http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sacha-feinman/17/400/976 contacted me about writing an article about Geraci. He was, as any good journalist would be, concerned with not simply regurgitating our investigation. However, reading my article, he felt it was well written, ivestigated, etc. He felt it would be a good springboard for further investigation. So, I provided all my sources to Feinman. He vetted the entire Bullshido piece, found it to be verifiable, and continued to investigate the case in further directions which Bullshido had not covered. As Feinman noted himself it was the Bullshido article which formed the basis for his own further investigation. Feinman and I did not collaborate on his article, other than my making introductions to sources and the subject, Geraci. Feinman was not paid by Bullshido, nor is he even a member of the site. He came to us because of our notability. I fail to see how the RF article, regardless of how much or little it sepcifically mentions Bullshido in print, could not be considered a notable reference for Bullshido. Our ivnestigation served as the springboard for his, he came to us because of our notability, he personally stated this as such, and the subject of the investigation itself (Geraci) is quoted in the RF article as saying the Bullshido investigation was accurate.

This addresses both the neutrality and the reliability issues, and you didn't mention it in your summary. Nor did you mention Carol Kaur's well-reasoned argument, which contained novel points to which no one had a reasonable answer.

The only policies on which you seemed to be amenable to a flexible reading were those involving the definition of consensus.  If Bullshido's similarity to an epithet is no grounds for considering its lack of coverage in a different light, neither are the repeated calls for deletion a basis on which to go with an impossibly loose definition of consensus.

Mario Party 4 is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for Nintendo platforms, featuring popular Nintendo characters. It was released on the Nintendo GameCube in North America on October 21, 2002 strangely before the Japanese release on November 8, 2002. It was released on November 29, 2002 in Europe, being heavily criticised for being 'Nintendo's big GameCube Game' for Christmas 2002 as Metroid Prime was delayed until March 2003.

Mario Party 4 was the first Mario Party that was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Each board had its own host, including Toad, Goomba, Shy Guy, Koopa, and Boo. Mario Party 4 also contains some characters new to the franchise; Thwomp and Whomp. Klepto, Dolphin, Lakitu, and Star, along with two completely new characters named Genie of the Lamp and Ztar, are included as well. Mario Party 4 retains the Story Mode found in Mario Party 3.

The game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many Stars as possible. The Star Space would appear randomly on the board, and players would have to reach it before anyone else. However, the Stars carry a price tag of 20 coins, and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames, which take place at the end of each turn (after all the players have rolled the Dice Block, which will always roll a number from one to ten).

Battle minigames are like the 4-player games, but generally (with many exceptions) a little more elaborate. Battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins (from 5 - 50) into a pot. First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. 

Every Mario Party contains 60 to 80 minigames of a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which all players compete against each other. 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames put players in groups, so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win, even though they are against each other in the main game. In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each.

A new addition to the Mario Party series was the Bowser mini-games. Players play in a very elaborate mini-game that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways. (See Bowser mini-game section below) The loser loses a pre-specified item, usually coins or items.

Spaces
There is various spaces you can land in the game. The following is a list of them, and what they do.
Blue Space - You get three coins. Also, there is a special feature on this game called Hidden Blocks, in which a star or coins may be hidden on random blue spaces.
Red Space - You lose three coins.
Green Happening Space - A special board event takes place.
Warp Space - You are sent to the same space as an opponent. A spinner chooses which opponent's space you will warp to.
Mushroom Space - Two boxes will appear (one big and one small). Choose one, and you will be given either a Mini Mushroom or a Mega Mushroom. (Note: The Mega Mushroom is not always in the large box, and the Mini Mushroom is not always in the small box.)
Battle Space - A battle minigame will start in which players put a chosen amount of coins into a pot. The better you finish in the minigame, the more coins you will get back from the pot.
Bowser Space - Bowser may steal items from players or a Bowser minigame may begin.
Fortune Space - A reversal of fortune begins, in which players may have to give coins or stars to others. The player who landed",0

hey warrens, fuck you too. """"Uncivil manner, means me trying to elaborate on my arguments and getting  revert on revert that's what uncivil means. So yeah your a big winner champ and won't get banned. Asshole. 

Since the vista article contains information about the anti trust situation which, since it seems some people here have got a mouthful of gate's balls, is mislabelled anti trust controversy. Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label. 

Since there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now. 

But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.

So like i said, if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion, things would be different.

But for now this stategy of being a hawk on an article I wish to keep in a certain way, and being completely uncivil and rude about it, merits from my part a roayl, fuck y's all, take your mouths off of gate's balls and then we can talk.

Ultimately, there is one fact that is not disputed - Captain Asseline flew the aircraft into a stall. This is a very bad thing for a pilot to do at any time, and a cardinal sin when done 30 ft above the ground. The evidence is clear – the plane was at alphamax (high angle of attack), at very low airspeed, and with engine set to idle. Asseline has nobody else to blame for putting the plane into such a dangerous configuration, he was in command. All the other distracting issues, eg. precise altitude, wearing a headset, engine lag in responding to throttle-up command, etc etc, are little more than red herrings because none of them excuse the fact that the plane stalled due to pilot error.
There is a lot of evidence in the official report (I haven’t been able to find a version translated into  English), it’s pretty clear what actually happened.

I see that you have recently reverted some edits to the naturopathy page. I note that you have given as your reason that the changes to the lead were POV, but that you have not bothered to explain why you think this is so in the discussion page.

Could you please explain why you think it is POV for the article to describe naturopathy as an approach to medicine rather than a single proffesion or standard of care? Do you dispute the fact, or the way in which it was written? I am open to rewriting/compromising to get consensus on an NPOV, but if you are not willing to explain yourself, this will be very difficult. Do you really think that the umberella term 'naturopathic medicine' is represenatative of single entity, group or way of practicing medicine? Could you back this up?
 Could you also explain why it would be considered POV for the article to mention that the principles of naturopathy are practiced in multiple settings (complementary, alternative, and primary care) by traditional healers, NDs, MDs, DOs DC's etc...? Again, do you dispute this fact or the way it was written? I have provided citations for this, did you even consult them before deleting my work? Can you provide a citation asserting the opposite (that naturopathic medicine is an exlusive term owned and used by a single organisation to the exlusion of other types of practitioners)?
Your assertion that naturopathic medicine is 'CAM, not medicine' could be misconstrued to reveal a deep and irrational bias on your behalf. (What do you imagine the 'M' in 'CAM' stands for?) The fact that the term 'medicine' without a modifier is usually interpretted to mean conventional/regular/normal medicine does not mean that the less common practices are somehow not medicine.

I hope that you will take the time to participate in the discussion of the above on the talk page. I will continue to edit what I see as helpful NPOV information about the complex breadth and scope of naturopathy untill you can explain what it is that you do not like about the contributions I have made.

 Plot summary - I'm not sure if you cited this as a problem, but think that the 'plot section' has a reasonable amount of information (and plot points throughout the development and writing section) because both cast and crew released this information to the public domain, via interviews, statements - etc, so I think that it should be mention, because if the information wasn't suppose to be known then they wouldn't have stated it.

Well, I will be seeking mediation soon, and user:UtherSRG too seems to think it is a good idea.

There are other definitions of 'false' than 'not true'.  For example: """"Deliberately untrue"""", """"Arising from mistaken ideas"""" and """"Intentionally deceptive"""".   The 'false' in 'false skeptic' is more likely one of these, describing people behaving as if skeptical even tho they're not (whether deliberately or not).  Pointing out that some people behave like this (backed up with reliable reports of such behavour) seems to be a valid part of this article, even if the label 'false skeptic' is confusing.  (edits) 

1.In your view and others yes. But there are others who view false as the opposite of truth as it is meant to be. Granted """" Nothing can be so completly itself that it does not contain something of its opposite."""" -Lao Tzu For the sake of argument false is not true. You are all opinion, though ultimately we all are. Either way, the majority opinion of """"false"""" is """"not true""""; pseudo. Therefore, to claim someone is a false skeptic is impossible since you can't prove if your view, let alone theres, is 100% and knows what """"true"""" skepticism is.= The logicians call this quite often the """"TRUE SCOTSMAN FALLACY"""". 2. We could all form websites, talk bs, and then use it or our friends as """"sources"""". The trouble is not in the getting of the source, but in the quality therein. Your view and sources lack quality and are not worthy of Wiki...particularly when applied to such a grand and ancient pylosophical view as Skepticism. For example; """"I know more than the average man in that I know that I know nothing.""""-Socrates . I believe he is saying that one can't know anything for certain and that this truth is the only real knowledge he has thus giving him an advantage that may not be there; a lovely paradox. Most view this statement to be that there is too much knowledge for one to know and that knowing this paradoxilly makes him wiser in his lack of wisdom. HOWEVER, you don't see me going to the page on Socrates, finding bs sources that support my rare view, and forcing hundreds of viewers in the future to be subject to my minority and severly lacking of analysis viewpoint, do you? I deleted it because it is unsalvageable. If you all persist in bringing it back after I delete it again then to hell with it. You can have this page.

 Proposal to Delete this article.   

Notice how the only people who use this word are white or work for the white media?  (I'm white, btw, but this wikipedia and I'm a volunteer).  Someone that is Islamic, like one of the countless Muslim genius's like Averroes or Avicenna or al-Khwarizmi, would not describe their work as """"Islamist"""".  When Muhammad Ali didn't want to fight against Vietnam, his pacifism wasn't Islamist.  Sure, a true Muslim would not have supported or joined in the American war on Vietnam, but that is not called Islamism.  Rather, Islamism is a word invented by racists and imperialists and is a form of Orientalism (book.

 I understand your point. I will have to agree with you on renaming as well. From what I understand, it would be similar to what Current main Luftwaffe article has. A sub section representing Combat history in WWII. One might even add the other article of Organization of Luftwaffe in WWII as another section. 

   So How are we to go about getting this done ? As it is, all 3 articles have sufficient referenced information on their own. All we need is to put it together in a coherent fashion. 

P.S. I am sorry I was not able to see Archive section. I could only see the Page history.

 Note 

The current lead implies Israeli aggression against Hamas by stating that Israel killed several Hamas members in Khan Yunis on July 6, and Hamas retaliated with rockets. I have been trying to seek consensus for including the Israeli claim that Hamas started firing rockets circa June 30 at DRN. However, it may also be worth noting that Israel maintains the Hamas members killed in Khan Yunis accidentally blew themselves up in one of their tunnels: """"Hamas has vowed revenge for what it saw as Israel's deadliest attacks in which six Palestinian militants died, though Israel denied any involvement...The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted """"terror sites and concealed rocket launchers"""" in the enclave, but had not hit the southern Gaza area of Rafah, on the Egyptian border, where the Hamas gunmen died. Military spokesman Lerner said the militants had died when explosives went off in a tunnel that Israel had bombed several days ago, fearing gunmen planned to use it to try and penetrate into Israel."""" It turns out the same account was given by The New York Times: """"When Hamas militants entered the damaged tunnel a day or so later, they apparently set off explosives there...Hamas blamed Israel, escalating the hostilities that grew into the current confrontation."""" Hamas' claim that seven of its members were killed by an Israeli airstrike is not an assertion Wikipedia should parrot uncritically.  """,0

Sorry if I sounded unduly critical, mate. I have been suffering from severe physical pain for the last few weeks and it has left me rather grouchy. (I am chewing painkillers like sweets at the moment!) I and others weren't sure if, in taking off the other caption we'd then be botted again!!! If we know we can be sure of that we can be free of that """"pleasure"""" then of course they should be taken off. What happens is that if someone is working on a number of things, constantly going in and out of old images just adds more work when in fact we may have moved off to another topic completely and forgotten about an individual image. 

Re the Vatican: it is confusing. There was a template created to list Vatican images and their context but that was deleted, so users then end up linking to where the image was displayed, not where it came from. Organisations which use these images don't state they are Vatican images because they don't have to. 

In the media (I do some media work) we often like to maintain that something was taken by our photographer or film crew — it sounds good to the viewer. Newspapers and TV stations don't explain to viewers and readers the concept of pooling where one agreed photographer takes images that then everyone uses. People would expect that if the Queen meets the Pope, that it would be the BBC who would record it, or if President Bush meets the Pope that it is CBS/NBC/ABC etc who were there, not the Vatican's own guy. I simply know how these things work because I work in the media and have had dealings with the Vatican Press Office — I am on their email list. In any case, as mantillas are worn exclusively in relation to meetings with popes, the only images available are going to be news agency images in the Vatican. Ordinary people aren't able to be there to photograph the head of state wearing one until the head of state goes walkabout with tourists (and their cameras) in St. Peter's Square, etc. So there is no alternative to those images. If there was, I'd use it immediately. (I spent an hour searching for alternative images. News agency images are only ever used by me as a last resort where we need to be able to show something and there simply is no other way of doing it. \(caint) """,0

Now here you, Siafu, go misquoting me again.  I did not describe the solution of the navigation equations as the intersection of three spheres.

This of course implies that the position part of the solution is at an intersection of any three of the n spheres but this is not a description of the solution but instead an implication of the solution.

To further elaborate:
Besides being inconsistent, your criteria are arbitrary.
And they are your criteria. You've got a serious problem with ownership of this article; it's very nice that you've done so much work on it, but if you want to enforce your own version on everyone else, Wikipedia is not the place to be publishing.
How ironic that you're complaining about me removing """"relevant cited information"""" (ie. one guy's opinion) from the introduction while you are at the same time removing relevant cited information from the body. Scholars describe it as a genre. That is enough.
You claim that adding this genre makes the list useless to the reader, but that's a very silly claim, because quite the opposite is true: suppressing genres because of the opinion of one writer (or really, because of the opinion of one editor) makes Wikipedia a less useful and trustworthy reference. In Rescue opera, we can go into detail about scholars' thoughts on its coherency as a genre, but the list structure of this article is not set up to deal with competing theories: Charlton's opinion that everyone else is wrong has no place here, and certainly not pride of place.
""""As already explained..."""" - that's rich. You pretend that there was some kind of consensus which I'm violating, when the talk archive you link consists of you, you, and more you; indeed, when Talk:Rescue opera contains more users supports its description as a genre.

 About """"Two Chinas"""" 

I re-wrote and expanded the """"History"""" section for several reasons.
 One, I think """"Background"""" is more appropriate since the article is about the term """"Two Chinas"""". There is no actual thing as """"Two Chinas"""". So a section that deals with the background of the situation described by the term is better called """"Background"""" and not """"History"""" - """"History"""" should be used for a section on the history of the term.
 Two, there was a lot of misleading content in the article, such as the stuff about the Ruijin Soviet: I've seen that claim (that the Ruijin Soviet was the first time there were """"two Chinas"""") bandied about in online forums and anti-Communist China magazines from time to time, but it is factually untrue, since China was split between many autonomous entities throughout the Republican period, and the Ruijin Soviet was no different from any of them.
 In re-writing the Background section I was hoping to illustrate that history of division and separation in order to place the final division that led eventually to the current situation in a historical context.

I don't want to get back into the debate. My latest run-in with the Indian flag-wavers (thanks for noticing, btw) has made me very disillusioned, and I will trust your good judgment to trim, edit, or restore whatever parts of the text as you see fit. Cheers,  (Talk) """,0

Okay...it's not cool for people to keep moving the article back and forth.  We should agree on a single solution before anyone moves forward with any major action.  I am personally for the """"Fourth International (United Secretariat)"""" title because, while I am generally (not officially) a supporter of the FI, I recognize that there is some historical ambiguity, and am seriously interested in the neutrality question here on Wikipedia.  When you mention the FI, you are invariably asked """"which one?""""  And the truth is that """"United Secretariat"""" will always answer the question.  I feel that it's different from titling the article """"United Secretariat of the Fourth International,"""" which is misleading, as that's the now-defunct body that directed the FI for 40 years.  We're disambiguating, because """"Fourth International"""" is touchy ground for Trotskyists outside of the FI (you know which one).  """"Reunified Fourth International"""" isn't used by anybody.  """"Fourth International (1963)"""" posits a 1963 founding that didn't really happen.  """"Fourth International (United Secretariat)"""" is also parallel to Fourth International (ICR), where the organization identifies itself as """"The Fourth International"""" but the article uses a no-longer-present body to disambiguate it.  Any move at this point is going to be, in some respect, not entirely neutral in its point of view.  Given that reality, I think that recognizing convention and using the United Secretariat, while clearly explaining the nomenclature issues up front in the article, remains the best way to present the FI as it has been since 1963.

 Mention of The Gun  

The Sandman's gun was considered to be an unusual and ground breaking invention in the 1960s when the book was published and has had possible influences on Judge Dredd (see above).

I mentioned this in a section entitled The Gun but another editor removed it citing that it was trivial.

I disagree as the main plot of the novel in both this book and the sequel Logan's World, focuses on how terrified Runners are of this weapon and in particular the threat of being shot at with a Homer. 

The Gun provides key plot elements in the novel (e.g. Logan killing the tiger towards the end, his inability to kill Jessica with it at the novel's close, the Gun going """"wild"""" as they race for Sanctuary and Logan using the power cell to find a way out of the cave they are trapped in). 

The Gun is also something that saves his life on many occasions and on two separate instances alerts other people to who he really is (Doc in The New You and Jessica when he kills the Cub Scouts).

I believe such a crucial backbone to the novel deserves its own sub section, especially when it has as much impact on the story as Logan, Jessica or Ballard/ Francis do.""",0
"I read an interesting essay once, entitled: The Pre-Med as a Metaphor of Antipathy. The author was (IIRC) a basic-science professor trying to understand why pre-meds were such jerks, and whether the qualities selected for by the pre-med process were necessarily the ones that would make for an exemplary physician. Taking the pre-med curriculum was among the most depressing experiences of my life - a relentlessly grinding, competitive exercise in rote memorization of material that held little interest or applicability for me. I felt bad for people who took organic chemistry and biology because they were actually interested in those subjects - they were trampled in a horde of people who had come from the top of their high school classes and were trying to beat the curve, inexorably normed to a C+/B-, to get into med school.I certainly witnessed a reasonable amount of cheating, and I'm sure there were more egregious things happening out of plain sight. I was amazed, when I took the MCATs, at the level of security and anti-cheating measures in place. They did basically everything except a retinal scan, but I suppose such things are necessary. The question, of course, is whether such learned behaviors and coping mechanisms can be switched off. '''''' Talk",0

As far as I know ancient Summerian and Babylonian writings conjecture that life might exist off Earth and indeed that aliens may have visted our planet. Seperating practical theorizing from mythologizing is of course difficult with ancient works. Anyhow, this places the idea of extraterrestrial life 3000 to 4000 yrs before the present day. Whether there were earlier theories I don't know. In other places where atronomy was independently invented (India, China etc.) its probably fair to assume that the idea of aliens must have arisen.

Thank you for your message and kind words; they're very much appreciated!

Normally, I would do this straight away but I am quite busy at the moment and will be for the next few days. However, please know that I will definitely aim to fix this if I can, as I am always striving to ensure there is a third-party source for everything I contribute to the encyclopaedia. Of course, if some of these 3rd-party sources are wrong, then it's going to be tricky!
I also notice that you are a brand new user, who has made your first edit today, and to my user page! So, a very warm welcome to you and I hope you will enjoy your time here, either as a reader or maybe also as a contributing editor. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if your user and/or talk pages get supdated very soon with a 'Welcome' message from editors who like to take 'newbies' (= newcomers) under their wings.  
But if you look at my user page, you will see that I collected a lot of links to Wikipedia articles that provide details about editorial guidelines, such as the 'Manual Of Style' (Wiki:MOS). May I also suggest that, if you want some help in getting started as an editor, you can ask me and I will edit a few pointers in your own user- and talk-pages. You don't *have* to do any of these things, but if you're interested and have the time, then I'l be happy to help you in your first steps. So, just let me know, OK?
Finally, although I made quite a few changes to the 'Planxty' article (and especially to the 'Andy Irvine (musician)' article), one of the essential principles of our encyclopaedia is that these articles do not 'belong' to any one editor: we all contribute what we can without any article ever becoming 'mine'. In my case, I just happen to have been a Planxty (and Irvine) fan  for a long time and had kept a lot of reference material (mainly my collection of folk music magazines) that proved very useful to update the articles. I am still working on the Irvine article and the next tasks will be to create related articles for some of the albums. Then, of course, we need more photos but these are very difficult to include because of the copyright rules in Wikipedia.",0

 Pessimism v. optimism in Beckett. 

I have an issue with the statment """"Beckett's work is . . . deeply pessimistic about the human condition"""" as found in the first paragraph. I changed """"deeply"""" to """"deceptively,"""" and it was immediately changed back. I don't know how to contact the subsequent editor directly, so I'll post this here by way of discussion.

Perhaps replacing “deeply” with “deceptively” is not the best fix, but as it stands the quoted statement puts forth, as fact, an opinion that is widley open to interpretation.

Beckett’s writings aren’t just about the journey. If they were, “deeply pessimistic” would be nearly undebatable. They’re just as much about the destination, or at least the goal. And while he frames life’s journey as a slog through shit, his ultimate implication is that the slog is worthwhile. As everything from the Greek and Latin classics to the greatest of Hollywood’s pro-war propaganda movies have proven again and again, the more monstrously you portray the obstacle, the larger looms the hero who overcomes them. The same is true in Beckett: the obstacles are unrelenting and nearly insurmountable, but the journey continues, heroically. The Beckett hero may be standing in the dark, but he's faced towards the light, distant—an unattainable—as it may be.

The essential Beckett quote isn’t “I can’t go on”—full stop; it’s “I can’t go on. I’ll go on.”

Now, I may not have convinced you, personally, that Beckett’s work is more optimistic than pessimistic. But perhaps I’ve made a case that a flatly factual statement like “Beckett's work is stark . . . and deeply pessimistic about the human condition” is a bit overstated for an article that strives to remain free of bias. 

Beckett himself would be the first to disagree with you. He once said that if he were a pessimist, he wouldn’t write.  Although I know that the artist is not always the most reliable source for understanding his work, that ought to count for something.""",0

With an explanation on the talk page I changed it to """"largely confirmed"""". It is important to mention that most people thought Hitler had killed himself in the bunker long before the Russian archives were opened (for example The World at War episode """"21. Nemesis: Germany (February – May 1945)"""" and that events were reported in most English language histories as TR described them, and that his escape was by the middle 50's thought to be very unlikely by most people, although a favourite parlour game (which used to be included in this article) was to say """"if Hitler had survived he would be insert age"""". I added the sentence with cadaver to the article back in May 2006, one of the advantages of using the word cadaver was that as a summary of a source I used it removed any possibility that it was [[wp:plagiarism|plagiarism], and another advantage is it is accurate.

You may want to look into adding about the Poestenkill Gorge (where the High Falls are) and the legend of the Native American who """"kidnapped"""" a white girl and """"married"""" her and hid out in a cave there along with some history of the various mills. You may want to talk about the gorge in the geography section. There are so many beautiful dams that today create lakes and waterfalls of their own you may want pictures of them too, Lake Ida behind the Stewarts at 2 and 66, with several very old dams along the Poesten kill within walking distance of there.
It would be tresspassing technically but there's a great waterfall on par with the ones you have pictures of (I think its called Fred's Hole or something like that?) out past Tamarac schools on Route 2, driving east there's an old abandoned bridge on the left past where the falls are, if you park there and walk over the bridge and follow the paths back the way you came you'll reach after about a 2 or 3 minute walk the top of the falls. I dont know if kids still go there and jump off the waterfall, but I went there once when I was 17 (all for a girl of course). If you cant get there that way there should be an official looking town-owned building before you get to the bridge, it sits (I believe) roughly right before where the falls and there should be a path from it to the bottom of the falls.

 Harrow 2013

conclusions from PMID 23512950, Harrow 2013 Overall, the longitudinal studies cited do not provide conclusive proof of a causal relationship between being off medications and being psychosis free. They do clearly indicate that not all schizophrenia patients need continuous antipsychotics for a prolonged period, providing extensive evidence of samples of medication-free schizophrenia patients with favorable outcomes.6,12,22 Is it at least a moderate-sized number of schizophrenia patients who do well, longitudinally, without medications? This important issue needs longitudinal research for more precise answers. The longitudinal studies indicate the importance of further research on how many schizophrenia patients profit from continuous administration of antipsychotics over a prolonged period, what factors identify and separate schizophrenia patients who do not need prolonged antipsychotic treatment, and whether or not prolonged use of antipsychotics is harmful for some or many patients.

The above-cited longitudinal results from many different countries and different types of schizophrenia patients provide data bearing on issues about long-term treatment. Discussions by Whitaker, Moncrieff, and others question long-term antipsychotic treatment.25–27 These disparate views, research by WHO and DOSMED in developing countries,12 and our own longitudinal studies5–7 should be considered as prompts for further long-term outcome research on this important issue.  This is not a strongly worded conclusion, where our article presents as fact what this article appears to be raising as an important question in need of further study.  I continue to believe this is not a strong enough source for the cited text.  Clearly, further research on this controversial matter is needed.  Can we either eliminate this source or reword the text to better match?  The strongest conclusion of this paper is that further study is needed.  Regards,  (Talk) """,0

 Bloc voting 

Countries with large populations of non-nationals may have their televote influenced considerably. This has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the Balkan countries of the former Yugoslavia.[91] 

This is full-blown crazy. What does """"non-nationals"""" mean? These countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. The stars in Croatia are popular in Serbia and vice versa. People are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries (there are some refugees in each of those countries, but that doesn't really explain why Croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to Serbia, or Macedonia to Serbia, where there was no conflict to speak of). For example, I'm a Bosnian Serb and me voting for a Croatian or a Serbian song is not unusual. But I'm not a Bosnian non-national. I have the passport of BiH, and my family has never lived in Serbia in history. It's really about mutual intelligibility  which is why Scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time.

"From People Mag - 05-04-1992

INTRODUCING: URKSOME Steve Erkel lends his name
People, 05-04-1992

THERE IS STEVE URKEL, TV SITCOM character. Then there is Steve Erkel, TV scriptwriter and director of educational films and real-life person.
Steve Urkel, as played by 15-year-old Jaleel White on ABC's Family Matters, is America's best-known nerd, famous for his high-hitched pants, high-pitched voice and pig-snort laugh.
Steve Erkel, as played by 42-year-old Steve Erkel of Los Angeles, is a regular-looking guy whose life has been complicated by Urkel's success.
In fact, their homonymous relationship  no problem between consenting adults (or fictitious teenagers)  is no coincidence either. Steve Urkel is named after Steve Erkel, thanks to Michael Warren, the show's executive producer. Back in 1989, he borrowed his old friend's name  without telling him. At the time, Steve Urkel was supposed to be a one-episode character on a blind date with Laura (Kellie Shanygne Williams). I had never known anyone named Erkel until I met Steve, says Warren. It's an odd name, but it sure clicked. So did Jaleel White's performance, and Steve Urkel became a show- stealing regular.
Then as the voice of the Urkel was heard in the land, Erkel began getting strange reactions. People started looking at me twice, he says. Over the phone, there would be these unusual delays during
transactions. Finally, in early 1990, a friend of mine called and said, 'There's this guy on TV with your name.' I watched and saw Michael's name on the credits, and I said, 'Ah- hah!' 
Erkel gets late-night phone calls from pajama-partying teenagers who scream, Steve, I love you!; his girlfriend, Susan Cook, a psychologist, sometimes introduces him as the other Steve Erkel; and even his parents, Lorraine and Roy Erkel, who live in Sacramento, find themselves having to explain the whole thing. And, says Erkel, I have a second cousin in Wisconsin named Steve Erkel; I hear that he's going through the same stuff.
As for Warren, he says he would never use a friend's name for a character again. Steve's experience has put an end to that, says Warren. From now on I will get my names out of the phone book.
Warren has invited Erkel to the set on several occasions and has introduced him to White. Steve Erkel says the first words out of Steve Urkel's mouth were: I'm sorry.

I see you have a vast knowledge in the fighting styles of Northern Inda, while I have the same for Southern India. Likewise, you are very knowledgeable about ancient Bharat and its 16 Mahajanapada Republics, while I have the same for ancient Tamilakkam. Since this page on Indian Martial Arts effects us both, maybe together we can combine both our knowledge to present a remarkable page. Yes, I do understand our passions which may sometimes clash. However, if we could set aside some of that and work together in a """"give-take"""" mentality we can make things work.

At the same time, we will present our contributions which may be opposite of what JFD-Kenny think, but at the same time their views shall be presented as well to give a fair and balanced view on Indian Martial Arts.

Do you agree with me on this? If so, it would be nice if we could communicate via e-mail. I have more ideas to share with you. I believe we can make this work. As far as JFD is concerned, I do not know what his intentions are. Maybe he feels a little threatened of the possiblity of you and me teaming up on this project? or maybe I am wrong... Indrancroos

And what the heck is that supposed to mean? I'm not violating N:POV by saying that Left-libertarianism is not a predominant or significant ideology. You are also ignoring WP:DUE, which is just as important as N:POV.

 Vitamin B12 

Some edits by User:Mrt3366 lack proper references and are factually incorrect.
The claim that """"Bacteria are the only sources of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]"""" is false, it is produced by a unicelular alga by example, Pleurochrysis Carterae.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11453796

Fortified breakfast cereals don't offer [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12] from plants, they have it added as a supplement. It is recommended for vegans to take supplements as such, as a minimum dosage can be reliably maintained.

""""The human gut also contains B12-synthesizing bacteria, living from the mouth to the anus"""" looks false. The old 1980 reffered study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7354869) only reffered to small bowels and it was falsified since.
http://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-7c.shtml
""""Claims of intestinal B-12 production may be based on insufficient evidence. Albert et al. [1980] is sometimes cited as evidence that B-12 producing bacteria can exist in the small intestine. Sometimes explicit claims are made, e.g., that intestinal bacteria allegedly can produce adequate B-12. Baker [1981] and Nutrition Reviews [1980] are related citations that comment on Albert et al. [1980].
However, a careful reading of Albert et al. [1980] shows that it used bacteriological assays, which are of lower reliability, to measure B-12 levels. Specifically, the most accurate bacteriological assay they used is Ochromonas malhamensis. Note that Ochromonas is the most accurate bacterial assay method for B-12; however, even it may report values for some analogues as part of its """"B-12"""" results [Schneider and Stroinski 1987, Tables 3-2, 5-3 to 5-5, pp. 56-57, 119-123]. Herbert and Das [1994, p. 405] apparently regard all the bacterial assay methods as being less reliable than differential radioassay; also see Herbert et al. [1984] and Herbert [1988] for related information.
Additionally, the data obtained in Albert et al. [1980] comes from isolated bacterial cultures. Therefore, it is unclear whether the bacteria would produce similar amounts of B-12 under the conditions present in the intestines. This point is discussed in Albert et al. [1980], but is sometimes ignored by dietary advocates with an ideological interest in minimizing the requirement for B-12 in the diet. The bottom line in the paper of Albert et al. [1980] is that it shows certain intestinal bacteria might produce B-12, but it is unclear whether/how much might be produced (and absorbed) under actual conditions in the small intestine.""""

The last paragraph contain only straight propaganda from 2 MD personal pages contradicting the necesity of the vitamin, without any reference to reliable sources.

The editor was also part of a dispute on the Vitamin_B12 article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vitamin_B12#POV_issues  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Algae acquire vitamin B12 through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria.

Individually, algae and bacteria make interesting organisms to study. Bacteria are organisms that can be found living in a range of different environments. Besides being organisms capable of causing disease in humans, they are also vital to the cycling of nutrients within the environment.  Algae are organisms capable of fixing carbon through photosynthesis within aquatic systems.  At the same time they are important to study because with increased nutrient loads to bodies of water can cause algal blooms, which can lead to eutrophication. This reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen available for use by fish and other aquatic organisms.

Bacteria and algae can coexist within biofilms.  Biofilms can help reduce the effects of external factors to produce areas that can allow for growth of specific bacterial populations and make conditions favorable for certain bacterially mediated processes such as denitrification.

 Avoid blindly changing capitalization 

An editor recently used the AWB tool to change a bunch of capitalizations in a way that hurts the article.  I undid his edit.  There are probably a few things that need to be lowercased but they will require case-by-case analysis.

While there is some capitalization that could be changed without controversy, there is some which clearly should be kept capitalized and some which may be debatable.

Note:  In the """"rules"""" listed below, I'm assuming the rules of capitalization haven't changed significantly since the 1930s, and that we can rely on the capitalization used in Amendment XX as a guide.  If this is false then let me know and I'll strike everything that follows.

Cases where capitalization should be copied verbatim:
The text of Amendment XX should be copied verbatim from accurate transcripts.

Other cases that clearly need capitalization:
Any form of Congress, President, Senator, etc. which is being used in the article in substantially the same way as it is being used Amendment XX, where it is capitalized in the Amendment (other than at the start of a sentence or any other place where any word would be capitalized).

Other cases that clearly do not need capitalization:
Any form of those words that do not specifically apply to offices or officeholders of the federal government of the United States of America.
Any form of those words which is being used in the article in substantially the same way as it is being used Amendment XX, where it is NOT capitalized in the Amendment or where it clearly would not be capitalized but for the fact that it appears at the start of a sentence or or any other place where any word would be capitalized.

Other cases that may require discussion (or which may fall into one of the above categories - I'm going to plead grammatical ignorance here):
Forms of those words which are ambiguous as to whether they are specific the United States federal government or not and which it is unimportant to make the distinction.
Any form of those words which is being used in the article in substantially the same way as it is being used Amendment XX, where it is capitalized because it is at the start of a sentence or any other place where any word would be capitalized, and it's unclear if the word would be capitalized but for that fact.
Forms of those words where they clearly apply to the federal office but the use doesn't map directly to the use in Amendment XX (this is the case where I'm unclear on the rules of grammar).""",0
"""

Laughable, eh? What's so funny about it? You make a claim, yet have no logical basis to base it on. Look into this more closely, there IS a Standard English, what standard do you think the UN uses for all English-speaking countries. """"Yeah, there are many English speaking countries, but let's just use Britains dialect, for no reason whatsoever!"""", is this what you think goes on in New York? Lol, anyways, did I say that leaving Wikipedia just the way it is results in a less informative encyclopedia? I said no such thing! My argument is that the inherent nature of an encyclopedia is that ALL of the information is based on one standard, so the reader doesn't get confused, and that this inherent nature must be present in Wikipedia as well! It's like trying to subtract X from Z, and expecting a numerical answer, it just doesn't mutually comply, and doesn't work well with an organized, compiled database of informative facts. I agree with you 100% that enhancing your knowledge of dialects is important, but it's just as important as learning how gum is made, learning more about George Washington, and learning what blood is made of, in a relative sense. And this is EXACTLY why there was an article on American/British spelling differences, just as there are articles for chewing gum, George Washington, and blood, and EXACTLY why I chose to raise this issue on that certain articles Talk Page. That's what encyclopedias are for, LEARNING, but learning at your OWN careful and deliberate discretion, not someone elses.

Ok, sir, my mistake for not checking my facts, but I just assumed, obviously wrongly, that words like """"pedophile"""" are pronounced the same in both British and American dialects, but only because I've heard British people pronounce pedophile as """"PED-OH-PHILE"""". So, like a normal intelligent person would do, they would make a claim with a reasonable logic base, and not just personal agenda. And you seem to think that I've never heard of that """"ae"""" being merged as one letter, do you seriously take me as a fool? Hope not, beause only a fool and an intellect would raise this issue in the first place, and I am by NO means a fool. Well, I've made mistakes in my past, but so has everybody, right? But in the scholastic sense, I am no fool, at all. Anyways, just incase you AGAIN misread what I wrote, I didn't claim to believe they pronounce it """"PAH-EHD-OH-PHILE"""", I was just giving an example for my statement """"there are words common in both the British and English dialect that in the British dialect aren't spelled as pronounced"""". I assumed, based on my reasonings in the first sentence of this paragraph, that both the British and Americans pronounce this word, and similar words, identically. According to you, I am false on this, but I do not have much faith in your credibility, so I will have to look deeper into this one. ANYWAYS, the reason I even made this argument is that you rebutted my original statement that read somewhere along the lines of """"generally speaking, English words are pronounced as spelled, letter-by-letter"""" with the fact that the word """"color"""" is spelled """"colour"""" in Britain, yet it is pronounced """"CUH-LIHR"""". 

O.K., we're kind of going in circles here, so lets just concentrate on the main issue(s) here. There are many words that have greek or latin prefixes, yet the word itself isn't related to the meaning of given prefix(es). This is, as far as I know, just coincidence, and unfortunately, partially due to the fact that it's late and I'm tired, I can't think of any examples off the top of my head, but you should know some yourself. Actually, I CAN think of them, but I'm too lazy, and it would be quite redundant, for lack of a better term. So therefore, strictly speaking, """"pedophilia"""" is by NO accounts a word for """"foot fetish"""".

You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so. I agree with you 110% that no one is """"better"""" than the other, but """"better"""" is very subjective and I'm strictly speaking from an objective point of view. O.K., just so we're on the same page, I'll reword my argument as best I can, for I am pretty tired, so we can stop going in circles:

""""Wikipedia is a database of information, and as a database (and also an encyclopedia), there must be a standard setting, language, consolidation, unification, etc., so that the information is clear, proper, and concise. In order to acheive this unity, there must be a standard for which all other articles are based.

Mattisse, please believe me that I had no intention of pre-determining the outcome of the GAR.  As I said, I hadn't even read the article with any great attention when I put it up for GAR.  I then read it, and said that in my view it passed.  I could well be wrong: I'm willing to be put right.

In saying that the prose was OK but not great, I was thinking precisely of WP:WIAGA which requires of a Good Article that """"the prose is clear and the spelling and grammar are correct.""""  This is a lesser hurdle than the """"professional"""" quality required of an FA.  To say this is not a criticism of GA.

Now, again, I could well be wrong with my understanding of the current standards at GA.  I have done plenty of GA reviews in my time, but not recently.  This is why I pinged Geometryguy, an uninvolved editor who has great experience with GA, whose views I respect enormously.  More generally, the point of GAR is to seek comments from the broader community.

Again, if I (or anyone else) wanted to ride roughshod over the GA process, we'd simply have reviewed the article and passed it forthwith.  But no: my purpose in putting the article up for GAR was to defuse the conflict, and get a broader spectrum of views.

The purpose was also to separate out the question of the article review from the issue of the block.  At GAR, we're judging the article, not the editor (or even the reviewer).

The version that you keep reverting to is at least as anti-contra as the other version is """"pro-contra."""" The irony is that while the Sandinistas themselves have been willing to admit their errors and have reached out to win the votes of former rebels and their sympathizers, some of their foreign supporters seem to be stuck in their circa 1986 vision of Nicaragua. Some Wikipedia editors are holding to views about the contras that even the Sandinistas don't believe anymore.

For instance, while pro-contra editors like to emphasize the role of the MILPAS, anti-contra editors prefer to emphasize the role of former Guardsmen. Yet even Envio, in its February 1987 review of the contra war, noted that Dimas' MILPAS rebellion was """"the most serious episode"""" of the early part of the war.

On the other hand, your favored version reads that """"many members"""" of the old Guard were involved in forming early groups like the 15th of September Legion. But even writers who were hardly pro-contra, like Christopher Dickey and Roy Gutman, have noted how tiny these groups were.

 Triple Crown and Grand Slam Champions 

I am not and was never looking to start trouble, all I am trying to do is expand a definition based on fact and references.

The Triple Crown and the Grand Slam are what we have been going back and forth on.

My contention is that The Intercontinental and United States Championships are equal and thus are interchangeable when when deciding a Crown/Slam.

You say no because WWE never explicitly came out and said so.

On 8-4-06, JBL said he was a Slam winner.  A WWE wrestler on WWE TV said he accomplished a WWE sanctioned feat.

It was said that no outside source has verified this, but no one in WWE has disputed JBL's claim either.

Also it must be pointed out that PWI has always considered the two championships as equal.

When PWI used to do their rankings for WWF and WCW, the I-C and U.S. Titles were always listed as automatic number one contenders for their respective World Champions.  The same holds true today when they do the rankings for Raw (I-C) and Smackdown (U.S.).

PWI is considered the main source for what is considered a """"World Title"""" and their word is law here on Wikipedia.

They also have always maintained that the I-C and U.S. Championships are of equal value and of equal standing.

As I have said before, I am not trying to vandalize or add nonsense to Wikipedia, only enhance it with an updated definition based on consensus and fact, based on logic and references.

JBL, PWI, and many other wiki users have backed up this definition. (Look at the Triple Crown Champion Discussion page).

All I ask is my contribution be allowed to stand as I respectfully feel that I am in the right on this one.

Thank you for your time.

Jesus and Messianic Prophecy
Hey, you removed my addition to this section. I don't get it. You were vague, and mentioned how you didn't like my use of the word """"retort"""". I wasn't trying to instigate some sort of battle between Jews and Christians or something, I was just reporting what the Christian counterargument is to certain Jewish opinions about Jesus (and note- I had referenced Bible passages). It is true- the Bible contains no time-line or deadline for the prophecies to work with. (If there is one then why don't you cite your source?) And the New Testament does give reasons as to why Jesus hasn't fulfilled certain prophecies, and talks about how he'll get to them later (eg, he will usher in the Messianic era of peace/God's kingdom after the apocalypse, as detailed in Revelation).

What really bugs me is how you allow, and even restored, false claims about Christianity on this page. There is a line that says, """"Contrary to the Christian belief that the Kingdom of God is not worldly..."""". I deleted it and explained how all the gospels, several epistles and the book of Revelation talk about how the coming kingdom of God IS going to be a literal physical thing on earth after a physical resurrection of the dead. I even put a reference (revelation 19-22)- this unambiguously spells out these points. 99% of all Christian denominations believe this.""",0

"You are talking nonsense again. The reconstructed pronunciation is not a modern theory nor has it been substantiated by modern linguists. Repeating the same old 19th century out of date fallacies in a modern book does not constitute evidence or substantiation. The only differnece between modern linguists repitition of these fallacies and the original is that the modern linguists have removed all of the racist slurs from the original work (well most of them anyway) and have included the disclaimer that none of the nonsense they are regurgitating is provable given the historical evidence, or rather the complete lack of it, and modern research which is unanimously against the theory. Thanos Papadimitrakopulos publication is a perfectly valid source since it postdates the standard form of the reconstructed pronunciation that is still taught today (a theory that is never substantiated to students but is taught as unproven dogma) and he has never been refuted. Chrys C. Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source. Development of Greek and the New Testament, Mohr Siebeck (ISBN 3161482905) is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient Greek pronunciation in existence. Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.",1

The question of whether EM radiation can be treated as a classical EM wave or as a collection of photons is entirely dependent upon whether the number of photons collected in a measurment is large or small. If its large, then the classical treatment (i.e. spectral radiance over infinitesimal frequency bands ) will apply. Planck's law as stated in the article, calls  a spectral radiance, which immediately implies a classical EM wave, no reference needed.  Photonic emission is for any EM radiation where the number of photons collected is small, including Planck's law in certain cases. """"Broadband"""" means the radiation is spread out over a relatively wide bandwidth, """"narrowband"""" means it is not. Broadband is not necessarily photonic, nor is narrowband necessarily classical EM. Its not a matter of how spread out the radiation is, its a matter of how many photons are collected in a measurement. Broadband can be classical EM if many photons are collected, narrowband can be photonic if only a few are collected.

"""= Sample of bona fide sources demonstrating, or referring to, official US recognition of Scientology as a religion ===

Here is how the New York Times commented on the 1993 tax exemption: 

The landmark reversal shocked tax experts and saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes. More significantly, the decision was an invaluable public relations tool in Scientology's worldwide campaign for acceptance as a mainstream religion. On the basis of the I.R.S. ruling, the State Department formally criticized Germany for discriminating against Scientologists. The German Government regards the organization as a business, not a tax-exempt religion, the very position maintained for 25 years by the American Government. 

I think the NY Times writer clearly expresses the view here that the US abandoned their earlier view of Scientology as a business, as still espoused today by Germany. 

Note that the State Department Report referred to in the NY Times article is the """"Religious Freedom Report."""" The Religious Freedom Reports for Germany have discussed discrimination against Scientologists by the German state almost every year since the IRS decision, referring in 2006 for example to """"certain religious minorities, notably Scientologists"""". 

Following the 1993 IRS decision, the IRS wrote to foreign governments, appending a document entitled """"Description of the Scientology Religion"""" to their letter and stating that various Scientology organizations had demonstrated that """"they were organized and operated exclusively for religious or charitable purposes and that no part of their net earnings inures to the benefit of any private individual."""" 

Media references to the """"Scientology religion"""" (and similar references to Scientology as a religion) are common. 

The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties says that """"Despite its legal setbacks, Scientology has achieved full legal recognition as a religious denomination in the United States."""" 

As for the claimed inability of any governmental entity in the United States to determine what is or is not a religion, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, stated in a 1992 decision that """"Indeed, the IRS itself has stipulated in other cases that the Church of Scientology is a bona fide religion.""""; so in the view of that court at least, the IRS has been quite capable of making such stipulations. 

The St. Petersburg Times wrote in 1998 that """"After a 40-year battle, the IRS dropped its tax dispute with Scientology and declared it a tax exempt religion in 1993."""" 

Such sources cannot be dismissed with a wave of the hand as Scientologist """"misrepresentation"""". 466

Celebrity side dish: John Malkovich brushes Bernie Madoff off of his shoulders
Tom Hanks' films are helping us 'Buck' up through tough times
He’s one of journalism’s most beloved and respected men, but someone appears to have it in for Tom Brokaw. 
Look up the former NBC News anchor on Wikipedia and you’ll find a review of his Emmy-winning reports, his best-selling books, his 20 honorary degrees. Until recently, you also would have found this sentence: 
“He had been married to Meredith Lynn Auld (a former Miss South Dakota and author) from 1962 until 2007, when an alleged affair between Brokaw and Diane Sawyer ended their marriage.”
The Brokaws’ marriage is very much intact (a Google image search shows them arm in arm at events throughout 2008 and 2009). Likewise, ABC News’ Sawyer remains happily married to director Mike Nichols.
A rep for Brokaw said he “burst out laughing” when he heard about the supposed affair. Contacted in the arctic reaches of Finland, Sawyer sent back word through her rep that, “as cute as Tom is, she laughed so hard she nearly fell off the icebreaker she’s traveling on.”
The purported affair, anonymously added to Brokaw’s bio on Feb. 27, was deleted after five days. Wikipedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh tells us the post “would constitute a ‘vandal edit’” but doubted the vandal could be found.
“It’s an open system,” says Walsh. “People may use it to exert their views. But the biographies of living people are most scrutinized by our volunteer editors. It’s incumbent on the Wikipedia Foundation to make sure they’re accurate.”
Walsh surmised that “someone with some agenda” was behind the post. Or maybe there’s more than one person. Clicking on the discussion page of Brokaw’s bio reveals attempts to slip in digs about his accent and personality. Wiki watchdogs rejected the insults, though not the unflattering picture of the newsman, which reminded one reader of “Clint Eastwood saying, ‘Do you feel lucky, punk?’ ”
The effort to smear Brokaw recalls the anonymous Wiki attack in 2005 on former assistant attorney general John Seigenthaler Sr., who, it was falsely claimed, masterminded the assassinations of both John and Bobby Kennedy.
Brokaw isn’t the only newsman targeted by Wiki vandals. “Some of our correspondents have stalkers who constantly post falsehoods,” says a source at another network news department. “We’ve had Wikipedia block posts from repeat offenders.”
But the unflappable Brokaw isn’t calling for any investigations. Through his rep he said, “This is beneath comment.”

"Hey 

Hi, I'm Dimitri from the Dutch language Wikipedia. I'm currently looking for people of about 14 to 18 years interested in politics, economy, education, business, culture or management. In March 2007 we started up a Dutch language site where we build a whole country, called Libertas. The site is named Wikistad, which means Wikicity in English. You can take a look by clicking here. Now, we're working on an English version after starting up a Romanian too. If you're interested, just come down here, you'll like it. You can become everything you want: from Prime Minister over businessman to taxi driver. Our country is named Lovia of the Kingdom of Lovia and is open to everybody.

There is absolutely no consensus for that flag to be in the infobox, it hasn't been there for months.

Yes. I wasn't denying that that was a consequence, but I just think to mention that but not the occupation is a major oversight. I don't think it's really arguable that the most long-lasting and significant consequence has been the illegal occupation, which continues to this day. That has been the source of conflict for over 40 years, with incalculable repercussions. I suggest adding after the above sentence:

 """"Another lasting consequence of the war that has had enormous repercussions and which helped establish the Six Day War as a watershed event in the Middle East was the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, which continues to this day.""""

That's perhaps not as brief as you were looking for, but I think this is crucial and its importance cannot be overstated. It deserves at least one sentence in the lede. I suggest concluding the lede with this. I've worded it in a way that won't be controversial, or require sourcing.   """,0

"London Boroughs 

Thanks for reviewing some of the London Boroughs pages, as you've noticed most are in a distressing state - and it's a good day when the page is extended from harmless to mostly harmless. I would however urge you to use the fact tag sparingly - either for things that don't make sense, or that are obviously disputed. I had a quick look round after you 'facted' London Borough of Barking and Dagenham and was quickly able to verify most of them from one source. If you had done the same, rather than leave it to me, we'd probably cut the work in half - but that's not to say you're wrong. They needed to be verified.

A bizarre example, which I noted you'd noticed is the London Borough of Tower Hamlets article. Somebody did a drive-by facting and reheading the page structure with stuff from the 'How to write about Geographical settlements' some time ago, they then didn't actually do any work on clearing up the mess they'd left - and, well, it left the page in a worse state than when they'd started. (They also did a lot of damage to other articles in Tower Hamlets, requesting facts all over the place, and marking it as 'lacking references'). You could consider marking pages  as this indicates that the page, or section, needs further referencing, and is much less disruptive.

Editors are all volunteers, and have a very mixed standard of production. Most of the articles are deficient in any text, let alone referenced material - and setting standards too high does dissuade people from contributing. There's a balance to be achieved, and that should be encouragement, rather than an over enforcement of rules. Where you believe articles are deficient, please do take a moment to try to reference the material, rather than leave it to others. (I actually take a bizarre pleasure in doing that!).

Anyway, thanks for all your hard work. I wish all boroughs had reached the standard of London Borough of Croydon. On a number of occasions I've tried to persuade WPLondon to do a blitz on a borough of the month (article by article), ultimately, I think it's what's needed to improve the London coverage.

 Felice Beato 
Thanks for your message. I am delighted, that you are pleased that it got translated into German. By the way, I - naturally - checked some literature as well, although not so extensively as you obviously have. To my literature, a large encoclypedia on the history of photography, Felice Beato got naturalised as a British person in the 1860s. I probably will change the now translated text to that as I regard this encyclopedia as pretty trustfull.

Anyway, I really enjoyed translating your article, because I liked your article quite a lot  and as I can see from the George Psalmanazar International Appreciation Society I am not the only one. Right at the moment the article is in the """"Review process"""" and hopefully attract somebody to check my sometimes not so very good spelling and german grammar (it always gets even more awfull if I translate something).

 Nice job on autism causes page 

  Common sense award I think what is on the causes of autism page is well done.  I also like your common sense approach.  I am not really sure how to send you a message on content but thought I would try this.  I see the vitamin D deficiency hypothesis which should be there because it is in the literature, but the hypothesis does not make any sense because oral supplementation of vitmain D among the very young has increased dramatically over the last 20 years and autism increases with it.  An alternative cause of the epidemic is the opposite: too much vitamin D supplementation and fortification among the very young, which makes a lot of sense considering the calcium channel nature of many autism syndromes, the biochemistry of those with autism, and the epidemic.  I have a book about it on amazon and some academics have told me the ideas in it are provacative.  Does something need significant media exposure before it can appear in wikipedia?  As you seem to know a lot about autism causes would you have any interest in reviewing it?  I could send you a .pdf copy.

I appreciate your kind words, but causes of autism in fact, most of our autism articles was mostly written by now-departed ; it would need to be a high-quality journal because autism is a featured article, and it would need to be an independent secondary review per our medical sourcing guidelines.

From where I sit however, when he went straight to his old battleground, you welcomed him back in kind - and the fact is on Wiki experienced users are expected to do better than that. Some sort of attempt at peacemaking is best, or some sort of dialogue or somesuch. When you ran straight to an admin and then AN/I to get the topicban reinstated, it showed me that you are not interested (probably because you believe it is impossible) in working together with Vintagekits - and possibly others who share his viewpoint. You see it as more Vintagekits' fault, but from my chair, you're both beyond the cutoff.

 Moon: """"Time to Beat Swords into Plowshares;"""" 85-Year-old Evangelist Proposes Bering Strait """"Peace Tunnel,"""" Addresses Divisions in America, U.N. Reform in Interfaith Meeting 

WHAT: """"10th Annual True Family Values Awards Banquet"""" News Conference 

WHEN: TODAY, Sept. 24, 11 a.m. Diplomat Room 

WHERE: Hyatt Regency O'Hare, Grand Ballroom, 9300 Bryn Mawr Ave., Rosemont, Ill. 

WHO: Rev. and Mrs. Sun Myung Moon; Archbishop George Augustus Stallings, Imani Temple African American Catholic Congregation; Imam Ameer Salahuddin, Islamic Center of Passaic County; Pastor Leroy Elliott, New Greater St. John Missionary Baptist Church; Rabbi David Ben-Ami, American Forum for Jewish-Christian-Muslim Cooperation; Rev. Jesse Edwards, Pentecostal Family Church, Philadelphia, PA; Rev. A. P. Randall, Pastor of Twelve Gates Missionary Baptist Church; Rabbi Dr. Mordechai Waldman, Southfield, MI; Rev. Dr. C. Phillip Johnson, New Prospect Family Praise and Worship Center, Dr. Arnold Howard, Enon Baptist Church, national and local interfaith leaders. 

BACKGROUND: The Reverend Sun Myung Moon has launched what some believe is his final speaking tour in America, issuing a series of challenges to this nation. Rev. Moon's visit to Chicago coincides with the 10th Annual True Family Values Awards Banquet. A crowd expected at more than 2000 will help celebrate as a number of Chicago community leaders receive appointments as Ambassadors For Peace. The 12 US venues represent the first leg of a 100-city world tour to inaugurate the Universal Peace Federation. 

Asserting that peace cannot be achieved through diplomatic and military means alone, Moon emphasizes the need for interreligious reconciliation, calling for renewal and reform at the United Nations. Addressing the economic and racial divisions in America and the world, he proposes cooperative international efforts in key areas. """"Why must we continue pouring countless dollars into wars that, in the end, will never bring the reconciliation of enemies"""" Moon asks. """"The time has come for all countries to pool their resources and advance toward the world of peace desired by God."""" 

The still-dynamic spiritual leader has launched a dramatic appeal to the world community to undertake the most ambitious civil engineering project in history  a 51-mile bridge and tunnel connecting the United States and Russia, physically and symbolically uniting East and West, to be built across the Bering Strait at a cost of over $200bn. Moon asserts that such projects will help connect the world as a single community, generate economic development, and redirect the focus of the world's leadership. The Universal Peace Federation promotes interreligious reconciliation, family renewal and cooperative service for others as the basis for lasting peace. 

""""Rev. Moon has been building bridges all his life to bring the races and religions of the world together. It is natural that he would now launch this visionary appeal to physically unite the world in a project that demands peaceful cooperation.""""  Archbishop George Stallings, Christianity (Washington., D.C.) 

""""The man is hitting on all the spiritual hot buttons of contemporary society, including racial and interfaith relations, marriage and family, homosexuality, fighting AIDS, peace in the Middle East, and what is more, he's never pulled his punches.""""  Rev. Darryl Gray, Imani Family Church, Montreal, Canada

Can you please try to see the glass being half full instead of half empty.  I'm certainly not trying to do anything that you or others would see as """"problematic"""".  Five weeks ago I was getting involved in wikipedia and I was feeling enthusiastic, so I posted something to some user groups (reaching 10,000+ members), encouraging them to contribute to wikipedia.  I thought, at the time, that long-time wikipedia people would be more welcoming of new people, and that wikipedians would be happy that I encouraged others to participate.  I was not trying to target and encourage employees of a commercial product to contribute.  The groups I posted to were user groups, not employee groups.  But yes, I guess that some employees belong to these groups as well.  And my comment about Hill using the talk page was simply to comment that my personal POV is that he found a good way for someone with COI to contribute. 

I feel that the negative and accusing tone of your last sentence is unwarranted. It is un-welcoming comments like that that drive away new wikipedia contributors.  I see my wikipedia contributions as a way of giving unselfishly to the world, trying to spread knowledge and improve understanding.  I think that even if I only have time to make a small number of contributions, I feel I am helping, and that this should be the spirit of wikipedia.  So seeing your criticism that I am not making enough edits to non-commercial products is just frustrating and disheartening to me.
I hate feeling that I have to defend my reputation here, and I don't agree with you that editing non-commercial pages should improve anyone's appearance of trustworthiness.  However, your claim that I am only editing the wikipedia entries of """"these commercial products"""" is also just incorrect.  I don't know if there is a way to view the wikipedia contributions of others, but if there is, you would see that I've been making edits to many non-commercial pages, including CRISP-DM, Data mining, the journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Predictive analytics, Statistics, Customer retention, Predictive Model Markup Language, Anomaly detection, SEMMA, Machine learning, Jacques Cousteau, SIGKDD, Decision tree learning.  Sometimes I'm making simple formatting edits, and sometimes I'm spending hours trying to track down the right references to put on the CRISP-DM page.  Yes, my edits are mostly in the general area of data mining, because that is where I have the greatest interest and knowledge.  Similarly, when I guest lecture at local universities, I lecture to these types of classes, not due to any collusion, but because that's what I know.

Thanks for listening to my mini-rant.  I know I'm taking this more personally than you probably meant it.  But it bothers me when someone questions that I am not working hard enough or they question my ethics, and that's what your comments feel like.  All I'm asking is that long-established wikipedia people be more welcoming and encouraging, and give new people the benefit of the doubt that they are acting in good faith trying to make meaningful contributions (however small).  New people grow and adjust - but it takes a while to learn the conventions of the wikipedia community.  Please be patient and encouraging to new people.

Well I guess I am automatically a member? Quite an honour - Ahunt 
Hey, around here you take the honours where you can get them!! AKRadeckiSpeaketh  
Someone know how to make an infobox for that? - BillCJ  

Are these above things 'polites'? Ahunt made a work not perfect to say the least, i complained about, he said that if i don't agree, i must not edit.

I rate this like a vandal freedom. Am i mistake something? And swift , my dear Bill (in Arbocom discussion with me) cames rapid to Akra and sign my horrendous word, and he swiftly (5 minutes) block me. 

I can be not 'polite'. Is too much that 'wikilove' asks to not to provocke, attack and even to have fun for someone blocked?

"""

George, you are taking the role of the Arbitration Committee, all by your self. The community already decided that my ArbCom case page should stand, you step beyond your powers by """"ruling"""" it disruptive.

My ArbCom elections participation referred to an ANI in which I was admonished, yet my asking """"any general concerns by the five days of silence from admins in this ANI"""" in a question to candidates is taken as, """"purpose of causing trouble for people Harry has disagreed with"""", """"veiled personal attack"""" and """"some kind of agenda behind them"""". It's almost as if the admin community had some vestigial shame on how that ANI was handled, why else suppress it by removing the questions from the candidates pages?

I have been advised not to make edits to articles if I wish my ArbCom case page to be regarded as timeous, then you say I'm, """"not even trying to build articles anymore"""". However I regarded ArbCom elections, and editing WP:AGF - , ,  as exceptions. As was my WP:AGF talk page participation.

If I was going to re-write the satire,  I would satirise the admin behaviour it was aimed at by comparison to the mindset of the religious police of the Iranian state.

The religious police are to Islam and the Koran as some admins are to Wikipedia and it's Policies and Guidelines.

You can draw further parallels with conservative and liberal wings among admins, but no one likes an extremest.

If you don't like that comparison then compare them with the mindset of US soldiers at Abu Ghraib.

Over-the-top comparisons? Remember I'm talking about mindset here; but given the chance, how many admins would you expect to behave as abhorrently as the religious police? Now take that answer and multiply by three. If the product is greater than zero, then you must have thought of at least one admin who you would expect to abuse others human rights if they had real powers in the real world. Don't you think that these admins should have the tools gently removed from their hands?

Part of the humour of the  was the alternative spelling of Constable to Cunstable - not very subtle humour & a very minor part near the end, but obviously intended as humour, and read with good faith can only be regarded as such - however this was used as a pretext to speedy delete after 5 hours in WP:MFD.  was put up with the Brainstorming template from the first, indicating an appeal for participation in it's production and alteration, as someone did when it was in WP:Namespace. If the cited reason of """"calling admins cunts by typographic means"""" was the only objection, then it would have been quite easy to participate and call for those changes. Instead of participation, admins afraid of satire, suppressed the satire rather than examine the underlying concern the piece was obviously addressing - WP:religious police, another satire anyone?

I would remind you of the story of Dickens being sued by some gentlemen over Oliver Twist, citing that the book used their person as the basis for the poorhouse character who refused Oliver's request for more (despite it being politely put; I know how he feels), the judge summed up that anyone who saw themselves in that character wasn't up to much (I paraphrase). If you felt you were being targeted by my satire, then I would ask which character from Oliver you think the general readership would regard you as.

I trust that my useful, and still standing, contributions to WP:AGF, and for the other rebuttals of your given reasons for the block, you will change your view to one which I hold myself - I am here to build an encyclopaedia; and lift the block.

Finally I would say, all that is required for evil to flourish is for good Wikipedians to do nothing.   18:0",0

And nobody has PROVED the accuracy of the article. The part about Gwen not being able to pass was culled from many people that knew Gwen well and stated that Gwen could not pass. In the Rolling Stone article, it was mentioned that Gwen could not get a job because of her visible transgendered status, in other words, that she was clearly a biological male. Most Photos of Gwen look to be a biological male made up as a female. You can insist over and over that this is not the case, but it clearly is. Gwen was also attacked weeks before by people who clearly recognized her tyransgendered status. Yet we are supposed to believe that almost everyone Gwen came into contact with knew she was transgendered until she met up with these three men and their group of friends?? Somehow they were magically oblivious to what most others can clearly see? 

[QUOTE] That doesn't make her """"dangerous behavior"""" a way to wink and say, """"well, she got what she deserved"""".  [/QUOTE] 

I NEVER implied that Gwen deseved to be murdered, and that is a sick contention of your part! Gwen clearly engaged in behavior that put her at great risk of someone raping, killing or beating her. When the Transgendered do not have a support system in place, and by that I mean qualified professionals as well as understanding friends and family, they are at great risk. Gwen's family, as well as friends, were no doubt sympathetic and loving, but Gwen had no other support or therapy. Gwen should have been in a support group at the very least, and perhaps been transitioning after therapy before attempting to passing in public, which is very dangerous in most places no matter how passable the person is or believes themselves to be. Yes, these guys are scum, and thats even more reason to take any motivation they claim with a grain of salt. But the bottom line is: Gwen should have been more cautious. 

And lets honsetly answer the question once and for all: Was Gwen wrong in not revealing her gender status before having anal sex with some of these men (And it has been widely reported that it was anal not oral sex!). I find it impossible to believe that if it was indeed oral sex that not one of these purported hetrosexual males made a boob grab! This whole situation does not pass the smell test!

This is an article about PAS, and all of these aspects are already included included in the article. The influence of parents clearly is a point of contention as one of your own sources makes clear, and why all the newer conceptions (parental alienation, parental alienation disorder, etc) do not include the parent's actions as a criteria for the disorder.

I have been blocked for responding to KimDabelsteinPetersen's ongoing assaults on Global Warming skeptic articles:

Exposing your arguments as being specious and hypocritical is entirely relevant to stopping the BLP violating assaults that you and Connolley and others in your cabal have carried out. If you're serious about the sourcing standards that you're arguing for, then please apply them equally to all articles in this topic instead of gunning for subjects that you disagree with. You behavior is entirely inappropriate and enormously damaging to Wikipedia. 

The issue was the repeated removal of large sections of sourced content, reverted by several editors. The deletion included removal a statement that Lawrence Solomon is a columnist for the National Post. 

I have no idea why Stephan Shulz, Dabelstein, and Will Connolley have been allowed to continue their POV pushing rampage and are free to continue their efforts to disparage those they disagree with by the smearing them in their biographies. I have no objection to the inclusion of properly sourced criticism, but their use of innuendo, and specious arguments for gutting content and coattracking smears is unacceptable. It is very ironic that at a time when a deletion rampage against unreferenced biographies is going on these editors and their admin allies are allowed to violate our core principles and continue to abuse wikipedia for propaganda purposes. 

I would also note that I was given no warning and no opportunity to amend my comment, if in fact there is soemthign objectionable in it. If someone felt it was inappropriate I would be happy to address that. But once again we have tool abuse by incompetent and dishonest admins who see themselves as being above the rules.

 Elise Ackerman, an Oakland resident who bought the domain recallmayordellums.com sent an open letter to Dellums that was covered in the local press, saying to Dellums, """"African Americans and Latinos live in fear in Oakland because of your lies.

Romanization for words of English origin
On the MOS:JP talk page, a discussion has been started about including or not including romanizations for words of English origin, such as Fainaru Fantajī in  (for the sake of simplicity, I called this case """"words of English origin"""", more information on semantics here).

Over the course of a month, it has become apparent that both the parties proposing to include or not include those romanizations cannot be convinced by the arguments or guidelines brought up by the other side. Therefore, a compromise is trying to be found that will satisfy both parties. One suggestion on a compromise has been given already, but it has not found unanimous agreement, so additional compromises are encouraged to be suggested.

One universally accepted point was to bring more users from the affected projects in to help achieve consensus, and you were one of those selected in the process.

What this invitation is:
 You should give feedback on the first suggested compromise and are highly encouraged to provide other solutions.
What this invitation is not:

Um well, absence of research isn't research evidence of absence. There's no severely affected patients in that lot and they were only exercised modestly with regard to their illness status; the more sufferers push themselves the more aggravated symptoms and weakness should be. The sort of people who apply for exercise testing are not likely to be already on the verge of a relapse or struggling to cope at work (or even at home). If some of them have practical help or accomodating family they would do worse in the same tests without it. Gosh, no mention of exertional insomnia even.

Most of these studies aren't looking into a variety of somatic symptoms or even pain, only fatigue and functional strength (though the latter's good enough a demonstration of worsening after exercise for me. At the end of the day it's objective measures are most helpful).  If good evidence is totally lacking you have to use next best evidence, with caveats. 

You miss out a major notable source of good evidence in all the ME studies (and synonymous diagnoses) before c. 1988 or the 80's, for instance papers by Acheson, Gilliam, Galpine, Innes, Compston, Wallis et al.  This is after all, where exercise intolerance and severe multi-system symptoms were first described and recognised as a cardinal feature in non-remitting cases.  

There should also be some orthostasis studies. There's also Peckerman's heart studies, Les Simpson's trigger finger study, the Da Costa study, and so on. Though they might not be focussing on symptoms the sort and extent of findings likely gives indirect suppport to the extend and breadth of symptoms.

The method used is the Algebraic Topology of PDE's formulated by A. Prástaro in a series of early published works on the geometric theory of PDE's and the characterization of their global solutions by means of suitable bordism groups.

In particular in [1] and [2] it is proved the following theorem.

Theorem [Integral h-cobordism in Ricci flow PDE's]
The Ricci flow equation for n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, admits that starting from a n-dimensional sphere S^n, we can dynamically arrive, into a finite time, to any n-dimensional homotopy sphere $M$. When this is realized with a smooth solution, i.e., solution with characteristic flow without singular points, then S^n is diffeomorphic to M. The other homotopy spheres \Sigma^n, that are homeomorphic to S^n only, are reached by means of singular solutions.
In particular, for n belonging equal to 1,2,3,4,5,6,  one has also that any smooth n-dimensional homotopy sphere M is diffeomorphic to S^n. In particular, the case n=4, is related to the proof that the smooth Poincaré conjecture is true.",0

Surviving in Frankenwiki
Okay, I'm back from my latest 24-hour persecution, and I realize how the mediation request merely subjected the article to more """"Thought police"""" rather than encouraging civilized solutions to problems.  My mind is spinning in 100 directions. I really dread any continued judgment by a """"jury of sneers"""" so I doubt I would participate in any forums of that type. Some articles become hopeless chaos, when the masses descend and start hacking with no concept of the topic (""""Harry Potter what?""""). One of the worst hatchet jobs, to any article, was with """"Search engine"""" where the technical details conflicted with the general concept of searching for """"stuff"""" and people kept deleting those excessive technical parts about ranking pages (not unlike avoiding text about Low copy number DNA, fingerprints, or luminol of Italian fruit juice). It was another case of """"too many kooks spoil the broth"""" and hence, that implies a long-term issue: articles need a limited """"roster of active editors"""" to limit meddling, perhaps have an active count, and when a editor abandons an article, then space opens for another editor to join the roster. The current myth that 500 people can be allowed (to """"adjust"""" an article) is what led to the """"Search engine"""" article becoming a wasteland of chaotic text. Again, it boils down to how should a person choose which articles to develop, versus when they are wasting their expertise in mud-pit articles. It might be much better to develop 100 rarely-trampled articles, rather than fight a POV-stampede within a single article. Plus, it is unsettling to realize they're reading every word of your talk-page and plotting the next insult. I could not, in good conscience, join in a forum associating with haters, because it is agreeing to make a pact with the devil. -Wikid77 """,0

 MY STATEMENT 

AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED?
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN?
You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.
I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.
But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.
An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.
Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.
It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.
Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.
i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.
You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.
She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.
She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.
She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.
She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.
The arbitration should have been about this too.
They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.
And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.
He even insulted Nicholas turnbull.
Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves.
Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.

This has to stop.
I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.
He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.
This don't go and has to be aborted.
I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.

None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.
It is a close debate and not an arena game.
THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.
He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.
He must be removed as well.
i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.
If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.
This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.

ArbCom had a choice: to cast this as an issue of foundation principles (which they could reasonably have involved themselves with) or to cast it as a content issue and dismiss it.  they decided to do the latter for reasons of their own.  C'est la vie.

it's not a huge issue; this will quickly end up on ArbCom's plate anyway as a matter editor behavior, from some place or other - there's just too much tension around this particular problem, and too many people acting out on it like children.

 transjordan, western palestine 

Hello Tewfik,  Here is how the text was before:
 Between July 1922 and 1948, the term Palestine referred to the British Mandate of Palestine. After the seperation of Transjordan, the term referred to Western Palestine,
First there is a contradiction, since the first sentence says that Palestine meant the full area of the Mandate (which included Transjordan) up to 1948 while the second says that it only meant the west part after the separation of Transjordan.  Second, the separation of Transjordan preceded the coming-into-legal-existence of the Mandate, so the time sequence is wrong.  Third, it seems confusing to say in effect """"Palestine meant Western Palestine"""" as if there is also another Palestine that isn't Palestine.  The facts as I understand them is that before the Mandate came into effect """"Palestine"""" was only informally defined, then as soon as the Mandate came into effect the British administration began to use Palestine to refer to the left bit and Transjordan to refer to the right bit.  talk """,0

 POV/inaccurate paragraph 

The Vlachs did not pass the same process of forcible Romanization of alphabet or vocabulary as the Romanians in Romania

Forcible? Nobody forced anyone to change the words one uses. There were French borrowings, but this was done also by Bulgarians and Russians, for example. There was an idea in 19th century to eliminate Slavic words from Romanian and it was labeled as absurd.

and they usually say that they are descendants of Romanized Moesians, compared to the Romanized Gheto-Dacians in Romania. The fact is that both Moesians and Gheto-Dacians were the Thracian tribes, so the substrate was not so different. 

Yes, most linguists think that Moesians and Geto-Dacians spoke the same language, labeled by some """"Daco-Moesian"""", but that's off-topic here. Linking modern people to ancient peoples is nonsense. It's absurd to say that some are descendants from """"Geto-Dacians"""" and others from the """"Moesians"""".

Anyway, the Romanians of Wallachia and Vlachs of Serbia speak the same language! I mean even the same dialect! The southern """"Wallachian"""" dialect is what became standard Romanian language.

"I was also eyeing the “Jane link” as inappropriate clutter, especially given that the Burpee Museum has its own page. It might be appropriate under T-Rex or Theropods, but not here. Several of the “See also” links are redundant or questionable (e.g., taphonomy, since it is now in the page narrative). Regarding a “fav” or famous fossil list, I think it would become intractably long, not to mention the subjectivity involved. I’ve already noticed that the Lagerstätte page has fallen victim to subjectivity, as several listed sites are not traditionally considered to meet the admittedly fuzzy criteria (i.e., extraordinary fossil richness or completeness); 100 paleontologists would generate 100 different lists.

"Heaven of God 

To understand Heaven, then God must be understood:
 1.  God is the all powerful supreme being of the Universe.  
 2.  Universe is defined as everything that is seen and unseen, and defined as everything known and unknown.  Any concept of a multi-universe shall be defined as the mathematical subspace where there can be many subspaces, but only one Universe.  A mathematical subspace is a subset of dimensions that does not have to include all other dimensions.  The subspace we exist within can be a subspace of a larger subspace.  The subspace that includes all dimensions is the Universe itself.  The Universe itself is a subspace that includes all dimensions.
 3.  God is either above the Universe as the creator, or part of some subspace of the Universe, or both above and part of the Universe.  The fourth condition that God is not part of the Universe, and God is not above the Universe negates God's existence; therefore, the fourth condition is not considered a valid condition of God.
 4.  God is supreme over the Universe.  It is God's creation and obeys God's rules.  Each rule can be obvious or non-obvious, and each rule can be hidden or allowed to be known.
 5.  God has the ability to create and destroy energy.  Without such a thing, then the Universe simply exists and is eternal and everlasting with no known explanation of its ability to exist; there can still be God as a supreme being of the Universe in such a condition, but God's energy ability is changed to the ability to manipulate energy without the ability to create or destroy energy.
 6.  God is smart, is intelligent, is wise, has knowledge, is a creator, is good, is benevolent, has mercy, and has understanding.  God has these abilities that are significant as the supreme being of the Universe.  
 7.  God expects God's creation to do well, since as a creator, then the Universe was created for God's purpose and enjoyment; therefore, life elements of God's creation, such as people, are expected to improve their own condition for their benefit and exercise wisdom, understanding, and knowledge when possible to exercise such thingsintelligence is good.
 8.  Because God is supreme, then Heaven and its rules of existence are defined by God.
 9.  God not only deals with people of Earth of our Sol system of the Milky Way galaxy, God is a supreme being that can interact with the entire Universe in whole, or God can interact with the Universe in part; therefore, God truly understands some of the issues and survival strategies of life, and this implies that God may be truly forgiving and God may expect certain behavior for the improvement of ourselvesto survive and prosper is important.  
10.  It is always believed that God likes people, so help from God can be asked by petition for help or intervention using prayer.
11.  God likes to be acknowledged from God's own creation, so it is good to acknowledge God as the benevolent intelligent creator of the Universe.
12.  Love God.  Love is a survival strategy of people that helps to define society, family, nation, benevolence, and many good things of life.  Be who you are as a person and love God, and God is expected to understand this as love is part of the defining qualities of people. 

God has created the Universe and has the ability to define Heaven in any way.  Each person can get a personal Heaven, or Heaven may be a interaction for people, or Heaven may be a combination of both personal and interaction of people.  Heaven is always defined as a good place; but, a personal Heaven can also be a personal Hell tailored to your life, attitude, and existence where God could give us, by observation, an environment where the individual prospered.  The personal Heaven and Hell would be much like an metaphorical ant farm that is designed for ants, but you would not expect things like body building equipment in the ant farm, and the ant farm would function in a way ants survive, and this can be bad news for people who were ruthless where their environment was ruthlessness as a survival strategy (visit a zoo and see how the environmentshowever limitedare tailored to the different animal species).

God can define Heaven in any way, and Heaven is defined as a good place, but as a supreme being God can allow many things, and maybe God might include a body building set for the metaphorical ant farm, so the possibilities of Heaven are expected to be many, if not endless possibilities.  God is benevolent in Heaven and the possibilities are many.  Love God.",0

 Article 

Hi Craddock1. Please chill out and take a step back for a moment. I have considered blocking you for a bit to stop the disruption you are causing, but I feel a final plea is a better bet for now. On Wikipedia we have an important guideline of """"Comment on the content, not the editor"""". Your very first contribution to that AFD is to attack the nominator, and it has gone downhill from there. All you are really doing is undermining the AFD in a way which will not benefit you. Take a moment to step back, consider how you could marshal an argument to explain how the article meets Wikipedia's notability criteria, and continue with a reasoned explanation in the deletion discussion. Continuing with your current behaviour will end up with you being blocked. Errant (chat!) 

Hi Errant,

Thanks for your message and sorry if I seemed a bit frustrated,

It seems as if the nominator has tried to sabotage many articles on wikipedia talking to other admins and editors. The whole point is that the ADF should not even be there and yet it remains because the nominator has a 'higher standard within wikipedia' than me - which I find unfair.

If you read the comments in the AFD you will see they are mainly to keep or strong keep the article.

Nevertheless the nominator has tried to make things difficult by issuing a sockpuppet investigation despite me admitting my fault and promising not to do it again.

I hope you can close the AFD so we can move on.

Once again since i'm new to Wikipedia I hope you will not block me but please also see things from my point of view

Best,

"The costs you speak of are relative, not fixed things. At the moment you are correct, but neglect to factor in the cost of acquiring the natural gas itself.  On site hydrogen reforming may be cheap, but the cost of delivering liquid hydrogen fuel is nearly the same as electrolysis.  Furthermore, no one has mentioned the costs of electrolysis using hydro-electric power, tidal, or wind.  In an ocean based plant using the sea water (a natural electrolyte which electrolyzes better than pure water) with tidal power, wind, and solar operating in tandem the costs would be VERY cheap.  And, the costs must be considered to be amortized over the lifetime of the plant.  Solar panels, windmills, and tidal generators have a one-time, fixed cost, and then they run basically for free until repairs become necessary.  

Statistics designed to make electrolysis of water look expensive are easy to fabricate.  However, you must show where these supposed costs are coming from.  In addition, the people who claim that electrolysis of water is as polluting as hydrocracking always assume that the electricity must be generated by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas.  People conveniently overlook all the factors that don't suit their basic belief or economic interest.  Take away the subsidies to the oil and gas industries, factor in the public health costs, add the money spent on security, and the transportation costs to bring it to market... and then see if it is truly cheaper.",0

Ok, I’m going to enjoy this… Here we go, amateur. You can reply where I indicated between paregraph so that the disscusion can be more organized:

1. Rupert Thorne was a recurring villain in a Kingpin fashion from the 2nd half of the 70's until the Crisis came. Then he was forgotten and then saved by Timm in the 90's for the animated series. Falcone is just a recurring name Frank Miller and Jeph Loeb use when he needs to mention Gotham City mafia. Carmine, was never a lead villain like Rupert has been. If you accuse me of just watching the animated series (which I deny) I can acuse you of just getting exited because of the Carmine appearance in the last movie.

2. every single comment can be sourced. Appealing to whom, for example is the easiest comment to source if you want to waste your time like that. Just check how many batman titles are published every single month and how many people buys against any other superhero's books. You will learn that monthly, the amount of baman books sold is good enough to call the mythos appealing. That's why there are 6 motion pictures, 2 animated series (without jl and superfriends and even scooby-doo appearances by joker, riddler, scarecrow and penguin) and, live action show and several internet about batman, his foes and his mythos. That's why the mythos is so appealing.

3. Catwoman is dangerous. Following your logic maybe mr zsasz would be batman's worst enemy. Being a killer doesn’t make an enemy notable as his protagonism and his importance in the mind of Batman and Batman readers, writers and creators does. Knowing Batman's identity and not being completely on the good side makes her even more important. You seem new to the comics’ world, do you really think Catwoman is going to be Holly for so long?

4. I think you might be confused. We are talking about Batman. You might be thinking of some other superhero. In batman comics bets are that, if you buy a batman comic from any year at random, or watch any episode form any batman series, also at random, The Joker, Catwoman, the Penguin, the Riddler or Two-face are going to be the main villain. If you get the croc, or scar-face, the mad-hatter you are loki, and if you catch you hero the """"Roman"""" you are really, really a lottery winner. By the way there it’s something called figurative speech, and it means to compare situations, I dunno if they told you. They are not literary on a race.

5. Hugo, the Scarecrow and the Hatter are influential because, whenever they appear, the story goes on a deeper lever exploring Batman's mind and messing with it. Those characters are useful tools when a writer wants to analyze Batman. Besides, I don't know if you are capable of using your imagination, I’m sure you can, it’s an indispensable tool for getting into the story when you read, but if someone messes with your mind on the level they have messed with Batman’s , that'll probably leave some ugly emotional scars on you... good thing he is the Batman. Therefore, they do get to be influential in a way. Thinking they don't get to appear as much as the five previous, therefore they are not influential is just wrong

SUPREME COURT, STATE OF COLORADO 

No. 98SA447 

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING IN DISCIPLINE 

January 25, 1999 

IN THE MATTER OF FRED BAUDER 

EN BANC ATTORNEY SUSPENDED 

Linda Donnelly, Attorney Regulation Counsel 

James C. Coyle, Assistant Attorney Regulation Counsel 

Denver, Colorado 

Fred Bauder, Pro Se 

Crestone, Colorado 

PER CURIAM 

In this lawyer discipline case, a hearing panel of the supreme court grievance committee approved the findings and recommendation of the hearing board. The board and the panel recommended that the respondent, Fred Bauder, be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law. We accept the recommendation. 

I. 

Fred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976. He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him. The allegations of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See C.R.C.P. 241.13(b); People v. Paulson , 930 P.2d 582, 582 (Colo. 1997). Based on the default and the evidence presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence. 

On July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for prostitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client. See People v. Bauder , 941 P.2d 282, 283 (Colo. 1997). Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058.97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. As a result, a request for investigation was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation. 

The hearing board concluded that Bauder knowingly disobeyed an order of this court in violation of Colo. RPC 3.4(c); and that his conduct also violated Colo. RPC 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and C.R.C.P. 241.6(7) (failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). 

II. 

The hearing panel approved the board's recommendation that Bauder be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and as a further condition of reinstatement, demonstrate that he has paid the costs incurred in the 1997 proceeding. 

Under the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 & Supp. 1992) (ABA Standards ), """"[s]uspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a client or a party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding."""" ABA Standards 6.22. However, disbarment is warranted when a lawyer """"(a) intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession."""" Id. at 8.1(a). 

The 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline. See id. at 9.22(a). Other aggravating factors include Bauder's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, see id. at 9.22(g); his substantial experience in the practice of law, see id. at 9.22(i); and his indifference to making restitution, see id. at 9.22(j). Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence, no mitigating factors were found. 

The lawyer respondent has defaulted and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings. We elect to accept the board's recommendation. See People v. Rishel , 956 P.2d 542, 544 (Colo. 1998). We are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo reinstatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public. Accordingly, we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel. One member of the court, however, would impose more severe discipline.

 Reply in good faith to Ninlil from Srirangam99 

  Dear Ninhil, I thank you very much for intervening... at least this much is accepted by a neutral arbitrator that in case two authors differ in their versions, both versions must be allowed to be retained.  Since you wanted specific instances, in the book named Ancient India (1956) by K.A.N.Sastri, he has stated clearly while describing Rajendra Chola I that among the list of conquests (at one point he stated clearly thus:) 'next was the turn Satyasraya who was defeated and banished out of his capital'.  This can be contrasted with the statement in this Article that Satyasraya was able to control Chola aggression basing his contention on material from author Suryanath Kamath, without commenting on the accuracy of Suryanath Kamath's version, I accept your verdict that both versions should be allowed to be retained.  Dinesh is also erring badly when he writes subsequently in this article about Jayasimha also fighting hard with the Cholas (in fact Rajendra Chola ruled during the time of Satyasraya as well as Jayasimha and has claimed to defeat both) and also goes on to add that both sides lost and won but both K.A.N.Sastri and Rajendra's inscriptions at the Tanjore temple (courtesy the summary of Prof. Huntzsch, noted epigraphist appointed by the Archaelogical Survey of India, a body of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Govt. of India, whose finds are given in detail at inscriptions.whatsindia.com/ - a site despised unnecessarily by Dinesh Kannambadi as a POV site because its findings go against 'historical events and their conclusions' of his liking) state that he emulated his father in winning the 'seven and a half lakshas of Rattapadi' and where Prof. Huntzsch has clearly arrived at the conclusion (after reading Chola inscriptions from the times of Raja Raja Chola because it was from his time onwards that there were several wars between the Cholas and Chalukyas) that winning seven and a half lakshas of Rattapadi meant winning the war and levying tribute on the losing Chalukya king.  Satyasraya lost twice, once to Raja Raja Chola when the Chola army was led by his son Rajendra and once to Rajendra, who also went on to defeat Satyasraya's successor Jayasimha II and Prof. Huntzsch once again attests the expression by Rajendra Chola I in the inscription at the Tanjore temple, a World Heritage site ': """"the seven and a half lakshas of Iratta-padi, (which was) strong by nature, (through the conquest of which) immeasurable fame arose,[7] (and which he took from) Jayasimha, who, out of fear (and) full of vengeance, turned his back at Muyangi and hid himself"""", as the Chola once again winning the war (this time it was over Vengi with the Chola army first routing the Chalukyas near Rajahmundry and subsequently at Masangi (called Muyangi in the Chola inscriptions in Tamil langauge), causing their king Jayasimha to banish and then levying tribute on the defeated Chalukya.' These have been attested by both K.A.N.Sastri and R.C.Roychowdhuri in their two books of the same name i.e. Ancient India.  

To repeat the above, the author R.C.Roychowdhuri in his book Ancient India borrows heavily by quoting extensively from K.A.N.Sastri - this unfortunately, goes against the thinking of user Kannambadi who is repeating blindly that I have no sources - I can assure you certainly I can read and write. It is very poor in taste, the expression of Dinesh Kannambadi who has gone on to justify my previous blocking, as is evident on my talk page dear Ninhil, this was done by user Blinguen an admin probably, who barged into my talk page and blocked me without giving any reason the second time i.e. he violated two rules of Wikipedia which are being advocated by Dinesh Kannambadi and another clique at work in wikipedia, first they ask people like us, who draw from sources and post at times historical events which are not palatable to them,  that we should first post on the discussion page, but in my case I was straight away blocked on the first occasion by user Blinguen who certainly did not discuss with me on the article discussion page nor did he discuss the topic itself with me.  The second time Blinguen entered my talk page, left a comment that he did not like what I wrote for he thought what I wrote was a personal commentary (when in actuality, it was a summary of Chola historty from which I drew from Prof. Huntzsch's summary from inscriptions.whatsindia.com/ but had made the mistake (I am not shy of admitting I make mistakes) of not posting the source, but before I realized and re-entered the Chola page, I found first that I was not able to edit and found to my horror that Blinguen has arrived at a certain conclusion and blocked me without giving me a chance to explain, discuss or argue with me on the concerned topic and its contents, just as Dinesh Kannambadi is trying to do now by painting anyone whose findings",0

More than ten minutes of recorded output, for another. A label. Right now, the whole thing smacks of blatant self-promotion, and that isn't what Wikipedia is for.  

is there a way i can get that page(s) back so i can save it and re-enter it when they have more references?

Notability of Acropolis (band)
 A tag has been placed on Acropolis (band) requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time.

 Block 

Hi Will. I am hoping you can help it seems both my ip (which I have obviously changed) and my """"matriarchal"""" account - have been blocked by the admin below for the reasons stated:

You have been blocked for continued edit warring on the TM article after being warned. Plus your account is only three days old and you're already making threats and and personal attacks. Use this 72 hours to figure out how to edit constructively in a consensus based environment.  —  • Talk •  

I was never """"warned"""" and  I am struggling to see the personal attacks - except those made to me repeatedly. You are also aware, I think, that edit waring was being done by the others - and the original edit was done as part of the being bold editing process. The removal of the primary sources was of course correct under med referencing guidelines, the users were told in advance and the person really involved in the edit war agreed with their removal!!.

I suspect, that the admin in question has not even bothered to read the page - they certainly didn't notice an admin around or the the page was being monitored as part of informal arbitration, or that LB is my second login!

Anyway, I was hoping - if of course you agree with me - that you might have a """"whisper in their ear like"""" and explain the background of the situation. 

I think, as can be clearly seen how, without trying, I can circumnavigate the IP ban, that if I had wished to truly be a """"disruptive influence"""" it would not be very difficult.

Anyway, if you think it is worth pursuing on my behalf please do and if not, well at least it may get them doing something constructive with the article.

During the """"ban"""" I will not - although I easily could, do anymore editing - indeed I may simply not bother fullstop.

 I need an advocate and help with mediation 

Greetings,

I need an advocate who will walk me through the mediation process.

I am trying to get the following added to the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.  Max Tegark is a renown physicist and a PhD profressor of cosmology at MIT.  He agrees with my addition.

I am having problem with an editor by the name of Lethe who follows me around Wikipedia reverting all my edits without commentary.

I have tried reasoning with him on discussion pages, but he refuses to read what I write.

Advantages of MWI

If Hugh Everett's theory was just another interpretation of Quantum Mechanics it would have no followers, especially since it proposes the existence of countless other universes which theoretically can never be observed. Because it is not falsifiable it seemingly violates Popper's criteria for a good scientific theory. The reason it has so many adherents is because it offers numerous advantages over the Copenhagen Interpretation, among which are the following:

1. Quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory making it more compatible with the theory of relativity and all other physics theory to date which are all deterministic. The Copenhagen Interpretation introduced indeterminacy and randomness into science. Aside from the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics there is no scientific theory that includes indeterminacy or randomness. Einstein particularly objected to this aspect of the Copenhagen Interpretation. In response to it, he said, """"God does not play dice with the universe.""""

2. It eliminates the """"measurement problem.""""

3. It eliminates Von Neumann's """"boundary problem"""": where to draw the line between the micro world where quantum mechanics applies, and the macro world where it does not. Shortly before his death in 1953, Albert Einstein wrote: """"Like the moon has a definite position whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects.""""

4. It eliminates the special place for an observer and human consciousness.

5. It restores objective reality of the universe between measurements. Shortly before his death, Albert Einstein also wrote: """"Observation cannot CREATE an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.""""

6. The wave-particle duality paradox evaporates. It simply and naturally explains the double-slit experiment. Richard Feynman said, """"[the double-slit experiment] has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality it contains the only mystery."""" David Deutcsh wrote: """". . . the argument for the many worlds was won with the double-slit experiment.""""

7. Schrodinger's Cat paradox evaporates.

It seems Einstein's main objections with quantum mechanics had more to do with the Copenhagen Interpretation, than with quantum mechanics itself. While MWI does not quite generate the kinds of worlds necessary to justify the anthropic principle, it is a step on the way to Stephen Hawking's No Boundary Proposal and Max Tegmark's All Universe Hypothesis which do justify the anthropic principle.

 WikiProject Ireland 

 WikiProject Ireland 

  Participants are requested to VOTE each month for their choice of Showcase Article and Showcase Picture.It only takes a minute - please participate!  

 Scope and Motivation 
Some Wikipedians have formed a project to better organize information in articles related to Ireland.  This page and its subpages contain their ideas; it is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of other Wikipedians.  If you would like to help, please inquire on the talk page and see the to-do list there.

The vast majority of this project was unashamedly ripped from another project: Wikipedia:WikiProject The Beatles, and the  of this project extends recognition for the tireless work involved in formatting, text, policy and many other aspects by ,  and himself.

For more information on WikiProjects, please see Wikipedia:WikiProjects and Wikipedia:WikiProject best practices.

This project has been created in an attempt to improve existing articles relating to Ireland, and to help with the creation of needed articles. It aims primarily to provide information in consistent format for articles on places in, or related to Ireland.  On top of this, it aims to get the main Ireland article to featured status, whilst aiding the maintenance and improvement of the Ireland Portal.

 Northern Ieland has a population of approximately 1.7 million.

 One of the greatest aids in this project for assessment and improving of articles, are the  logs found here Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Ireland articles by quality/1 and here Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Ireland articles by quality/2. Please take a look at the entries there as it will guide you on which articles need assessed, and will also guide you as to what might be necessary to improve individual articles.

Articles and categories relating to Ireland are extensive and work needs to be/is being done across a multitude of areas.  In order to gain the benefits of collaboration, please update this page with any relevant """"to do""""s.

Recent developments

 Belfast has been successful as the Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography's collaboration of the month. For anyone who's interested in helping to get the article up to FAC standard, there are many resources and a guide available on the UK Geography Project page.

 This Ireland Project is currently being re-vamped in line with the Belfast one.

 Belfast has been nominated as the UK geography project's collaboration of the month. Please feel free to comment and add your vote of support.

 Cheers TJ.  Actually I'd been thinking of starting an article on Brunswick Tunnel. The pictures are missing from that link now however there are some here so there are two references to link to as evidence.  But at the moment I'm held up with another job. I'm no expert on trains and tunnels so if you feel like starting the page, let me know and I could weigh in and do just those bits of tidying which prevent new pages from being tagged and deleted. Don't know if you've started new articles yet - but the main tactic to avoid deletion is to have an intro that says """"Brunswick Tunnel is a so-and-so and it is notable for so-and-so"""". We don't have pictures for the article, but we could get a photo of that plaque in Harrogate near Trinity church, and of the island in the road in Harrogate where the tunnel-end is underneath. There is more information here. But no pressure - just thought it might interest you. If nothing else it's a good read. Cheers.  """,0

And what is even more interesting, is that it occurred on August 24, just after you'd posted fallacious FoF about me and voted to indefinitely topic-ban me from the Tea Party movement article. 
Why is it, do you suppose, that I, for one, would not be interested in such information about you?
Clearly there is a question as to your WP:Competence, as far as I'm concerned, but I will defer to Jimbo Wales on that point for our purposes here, as you are undoubtedly aware that there is an appeal of the decision you are heavily implicated in on his Talk page. 
At any rate, I have to get some sleep now, so I will simply ask reviewing admins to visit Jimbo's Talk page and follow the links. I've linked to you Talk page there as well. 
As far as I'm concerned, and I have stated this on the Tea Party movement PD Talk page, WP:SPADE is the operative policy here.
I've merely repeated information you'd posted long ago on your User page and recently deletedfor whatever private reasons.

 Why compare only to Windows 2000 features? 

As this issue has clearly caused quite a bit of confusion, I've decided to address it here. Windows XP is in the unique position - compared to all other Windows releases I can think of - of being at the convergence point of two separate Windows product lines, that of Windows NT and the old, MS-DOS-based Windows 9x. However, the core code in XP is based on the former and not the latter (hence XP has an internal version number of 5.1, while Windows 2000 has one of 5.0 - among numerous other things). A list of every single feature included in Windows ME (the last of the MS-DOS based versions) but not in XP would be quite long indeed, and also quite pointless, because it would be comparing operating systems of two very different architectures. (There's also the fact that comparisons between the other """"List of features removed in Windows"""" articles and this one would actually be made far more difficult.)   """,0

Haven't the AMA guidelines been updated to include minium HDL levels of 40mg/dl of serum (blood)?  I love joe harry frederick thompson

Since it is likely that many people will come to this page because they have high cholesterol, is it reasonable to include a checklist for lowering cholesterol? e.g.

The American Heart Association suggests the following steps to reduce cholesterol levels:
 Watch your caloric intake by eating a wide variety of foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol.
 Eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day.
 Eat six or more servings of cereals, breads, pasta and other whole- grain products.
 Eat fish, poultry without skin and leaner cuts of meat instead of fatty ones.
 Eat nonfat or 1% milk dairy products rather than whole-milk dairy products.
 Enjoy 30–60 minutes of vigorous activities on most (or all) days of the week.
 Maintain a healthy weight.

These 7 points are copied verbatim from a page linked from the American Heart Association page that this article already links to. In theory people can find it, but only if they follow the external link, scroll to the bottom, and follow the next link. (Perhaps we can't include these for copyright reasons, even though it is fully attributed and not very large? I'm not sure of the limits on fair use.)  18:54, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Total cholesterol to any other cholesterol ratio is unit-less, so why is it expressed in mg/dl? This needs clarification.
 21:32, 1 Jan 2004 (UTC)

The quantity of cholesterol in foods is clearly wrong.  Egg yolks can't have cholesterol 1234 mg/g, as that would be more than 100% cholesterol.  A quick search on the internet implies that this is off by a factor of 100, but I have no good data source I can cite.

Is there a standard?  I would've thought SI units would be preferred, but I suppose that mg/dL is still very prevalent in the literature so perhaps it would make sense to just follow each measure with the mmol/L in parentheses.  Lets be consistent anyway.

 Cholesterol intake 

On suggestion, this has been removed from the Rosuvastatin article:

Roughly 50% of the body's cholesterol is derived from dietary sources, while the remaining 50% is from this de novo synthesis.King, Michael W., Ph.D (October 7, 2004). Biosynthesis of Cholesterol from the Medical Biochemistry Page hosted by Indiana State University.  Retrieved 2005-03-20.  NOTE: This is a secondary source.

yet on the same page, """"Normal healthy adults synthesize cholesterol at a rate of approximately 1g/day and consume approximately 0.3g/day."""" Is 23% """"roughly 50%"""", or is there something else going on here? Furthermore, the page indicates that synthesis varies to maintain a """"relatively constant level of cholesterol in the body (150 - 200 mg/dL)"""", indicating that changes in dietary cholesterol should have a minor effect on serum cholesterol, i.e. that cholesterol consumption is a non-issue. I've seen mention of similar effects in other lit reviews. Evidence suggests, to me, that dietary cholesterol should only be mentioned as to the effect that it has to reduce synthesis.  18:28, 28 June 2006 (UTC",0

There has to be a balance between the details that clearly explain a character, and the fanish devotion that inspires an entire website.  In struggling to maintain that balance, we editors often find ourselves in conflict.  I believe that's what is happening here.  Jason's 'importance' is POV.  He was barely mentioned in the original crisis, and only because his return to life was attributed to Superboy-Prime did his return elicit Infinite Crisis attention.  We have no idea how important he'll end up being in Countdown, since they change these things on the fly, and we'd be speculating if we were to state anything beyond what has happened.  Remember, this article should not be a substitute for reading the comics.  Now I do agree that character development, including the predicament with his parentage, should be addressed, however there's no need to make a wholesale change when addressing one situation at a time would be more productive as a fellow editor.
I disagree about 'inappropriate' language in the Death in the Family section. It looks fine to me, and since it links to the main article, were more detail can be read, there's no need to expand it further. 
I found your entry overly detailed in that it included many quotes, most of which that did not serve to do more than elaborate on what was already written, and it suffered from poor editing with your non-standard subheaders.  Much of the information was useful, and some, if trimmed down to manageable portions, would be useful. I like your elaboration on Catherine Todd, and while the intro paragraph is nice, that information is already in the preceding section, and repetition is unneeded.

When defining Hemmorhoids, which is the better introductory sentence?
Hemorrhoids are varicosities of [veins] in the [rectum] and [anus].
Hemorrhoids (also known as haemorrhoids or piles) are varicosities or [swelling] and [inflammation] of [veins] in the [rectum] and [anus].
You tell me.  You are trying to make us define abortion with a sentence much like the first, by supplying only the purely scientific terms (like varicosities) and not the commonly understood terms (like swelling and inflammation).  I am trying to define Abortion with a sentence like the second one, with both the scientific terms AND the commonly understood terms, so that situations like the multiple accounts listed below don't happen to our readers from a lack of information.

This has been done because the article seems to be about a person or a group of people, band, or club, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add  on the top of the page (below the existing db tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.

"""*E-dog, on another page, you wrote: 

Thanks for your message on my talk page. When I voted keep for Tom G. Palmer, I justified it by writing that """"Google returns 13500 hits for the query """"Tom G. Palmer"""" cato [3]."""" """"Tom G. Palmer"""" alone returns 34,900 hits on Google [4]. So on this point, my vote is not necessarily inconsistent (34,900 > 19,000).
Well, sure, but that's weak""""35000 is notable, but 19000 isn't"""". Come on. That's not serious.

But even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don't know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.
Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, """"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right."""" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.

Agreed. I amended the article after the chessbase article came out. I think it's only fair to report it, without endorsing or refuting the possibility that Topalov did, in fact, cheat. Dionyseus has never understood the difference between saying, """"Topalov was accused of cheating"""" and """"Topalov cheated"""", so it is possible that he will now delete my edit, arguing that Topalov didn't cheat. It's frustrating and time consuming, arguing with characters like that. And while I had plenty of passive support last year, I'd appreciate some more active support for inclusion this time around, should Dionyseus choose to make another big stink. Apparently, Dionyseus interprets neutrality as the censorship of negative information, no matter how factual. Of course, this is the same guy who, last year, edited Kramnik's article so that it started with a list of his match losses. Of course, I wouldn't want to infringe upon wiki's tradition of love, charity, and respect; so, I feel I should clarify my position insofar as I absolutely DO NOT regard Dionyseus to be 1) a blight on wikipedia, 2) a mental degenerate, 3) incapable of lucid reasoning, or 4) incapable of language use.

 The difference between a first serialization and a reprint 

The difference is that there's a difference.

It is as simple as anything to say that the relevant stories were published as first serializations in such and such a periodical on such and such a date. Badabing, badaboom, done. And that's how to put it accurately.

Specific words for specific rights mean specific things in any kind of intellectual property field.

In writing, if I have """"first serialization"""" rights and I publish a """"reprint"""" without owning the rights to """"reprint"""" or having permission from the entity that does own the rights to """"reprint,"""" I'm up a creek.

If I, as an author, sell my story as """"first serialization"""" rights to a magazine (customarily, it would be something more limited like first serialization rights for North America), then I retain all other kinds of """"first"""" rights to my story.

The distinction wouldn't matter if we were talking about Wolfowitz's or someone else's personal blog where they referred to whatever as a """"reprint."""" That would be oh, whatever, he didn't know the difference and just used the wrong word.

Contracts for stories or books are real specific about exactly what rights are going to be owned by who, and under what conditions and for how long. That specificity is why the terminology matters.

This is not Wolfowitz's personal blog. This is an encyclopedia. In a personal blog, the distinction between """"first serialization"""" and """"reprint"""" don't matter. In an encyclopedia, it does.

Hey, thanks for your responsiveness about the """"Stolen Earth"""" images.

It would be a bit similar to the """"Last of the Time Lords"""" one we fought over so hard, but unlike in that case, here you'd actually have the """"critical analysis"""" in place, because the scene is covered substantially, and not just in the sense of a renarration of the plot. How about one of those with Rose holding the dying Doctor in her arms, like here, caption along the lines of: """"The climactic final scene, described as a """"bitter moment of high emotion"""", as the Doctor is seemingly dying in Rose's arms. (bah, a bit long, but you get my drift.) (Trouble is, if you want it in the infobox, you'll probably want a longish caption to make the analytic significance transparent. In my opinion at least, it really helps if the caption refers explicitly to the analytic aspect, rather than just to the plot.)  ☼

New Additions and Changes
After a long time away from this article waiting for the peer review to be finalized, I've returned to work on this article. Just wanted to list some of the additions and changes.

The biggest one (IMHO) is the change citations from parenthetical to footnote/bibliography style. Also, the footnotes and bibliography are in a reduced font, done in a style that can be seen in Hugo Chavez. Given that the Chavez article won featured article status, I'm going to take the """"if you can't beat'em, join'em"""" approach. 
I got ahold of a decent biography of Suharto that really illuminates Suharto's pre-presidential years. It's R.E. Elson's Suharto: A Political Biography. I plan on making some further additions using this book as a reference.
In tandem with the Elson book, I managed to find some halfway decent pictures of him that I believe should be public domain, if not fair use. So now we have a lead photo again! They're from the Department of Information and State Secretariat of Indonesia. If anyone has a halfway decent knowledge of Indonesian intellectual property law (besides the lack of any enforcement), it'd be very appreciated.

For the future, I am looking to fatten up the portion on Suharto's military career, but eventually it will be exported to its own article (e.g. Military career of Suharto), much in the same way the Civil War and New Order sections got fattened up, exported, then trimmed.

After that is done, I hope to do another round of peer review, and then based on that nominating this to Wikipedia:Featured article candidates  """,0

1 See, any hope [of capturing] him must be disappointed; One is prostrated by the very sight of him. 

2 There is no one so fierce as to rouse him; Who then can stand up to Me? 

3 Whoever confronts Me I will requite, For everything under the heavens is Mine. 
4 I will not be silent concerning him Or the praise of his martial exploits -Meaning in Hebrew Uncertain- 

5 Who can uncover his outer garment? Who can penetrate the folds of his Jowls? 

6 Who can pry open the doors of his face? His bared teeth strike terror. 

7 His protective scales are his pride, Locked with a binding seal. 

8 One scale touches the other; Not even a breath can enter between them. 

9 Each clings to each; They are interlocked so they cannot be parted. 

10 His sneezings flash lightning, and his eyes are like the glimmerings of dawn. 

11 Firebrands stream from his mouth; Fiery sparks escape. 

12 Out of his nostrils come smoke As from a steaming, boiling cauldron. 

13 His breath ignites coals; Flames blaze from his mouth. 

14 Strength resides in his neck; Power leaps before him. 

15 The layers of his flesh stick together; He is as though cast hard; he does not totter. 

16 His heart is cast hard as a stone, Hard as the nether millstone. 

17 Divine beings are in dread as he rears up; As he crashes down, they cringe. 

18 No sword that overtakes him can prevail, Nor spear, nor missile, nor lance. 

19 He regards iron as straw, Bronze, as rotted wood. 

20 No arrow can put him to flight; Slingstones turn into stubble for him. 

21 Clubs are regarded as stubble; He scoffs at the quivering javelin 

22 His underpart is jagged shards; It spreads a threshing-sledge on the mud. 

23 He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron; He makes the sea boil like an ointment-pot. 

24 His wake is a luminous path; He makes the deep seem white-haired. 

25 There is no one on land who can dominate him, Made as he is without fear.

"""== Cohanim J2 - Eleazar - Phinchas - Zadok ==

 Agree. Dr. Karl Skorecki have the final word about Cohanim genetic signatures. He, more than anyone else, is the most credible person that can publish articles and true informations about Cohanim genetic signatures, not Jheald. He was the one who discovered the CMH in 1997. After 10 years, he came out to announce in 2007, that """"he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2"""". Katz, Kaplan, Rappaport, Shapiro, Kovacs,Konh, are all J2. Those surnames and families are the most prestigious Cohanim families today. They are all Cohanim J2. J2 Cohanim is much more common than J1 Cohanim. """"Skorecki reported that Pinchas the zealot mentioned in the Bible may be the origin of J2"""" This is a very important information that confirms matematical, historic, and genealogy facts. Phinchas was the son of Eleazar. Itamar was his brother. Out of the 24 Cohanim houses, 16 did belong to Eleazar-Pinchas, while only 8 came out from Itamar seed. Eleazar-Pinchas (J2) had a much larger population than Itamar. All Cohanim genealogy were divided into those two houses, until the destruction of the second temple. So, if Phinchas is the origin of all Cohanim J2, than it makes sense, since his Cohanim seed produced much more descendants than his brother Itamar. So, it is very normal and logical to understand why genetic cohanim signatures presents two CMHs wich is the caracteristics of the two houses of Cohanim. All genealogic tree for Cohanim since Aaron until today are still divided into these two houses: Eleazar-Pinchas and Itamar. During the 1270 years of the cohanim services (Mishkan and Mikdash) the Cohanim jews were always selected by the 24 houses. 18 from Pinchas, and only 8 from Itamar.

78.101.90.200  

Agree. Dr. Karl Skorecki of the Ramban/Technion Medical Center in Haifa, who is renowned for his discovery in 1997 of the Kohen genetic signature, reported in 2007 that he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2. """"Pinchas, the zealot mentioned in the Bible, may be the origin of J2"""" he suggested. 
The extended CMH-12 is established for J1 Cohanim only. If somebody in J1 also has CMH-12, then he is likely to have Cohen ancestry. J1 Cohanim form a tight network around CMH-12. But this is not the case for J2. The CMH-12 does not apply to J2. If a J2 is in CMH-12, it tells us nothing about one being a Cohen. In J2, the CMH-12 has no special status. The J1 lineage of Cohanim in CMH-12 could be much more recent.  Jewish Cohanim in J2 form a much larger network around CMH-6  than Jewish Cohanim in J1 do. Cohanim Jews belong mainly to haplogroup J2 because Cohanim as a group (J1,J2) have a high frequency of J2. The J2 Cohanim have much more ancient common ancestor, according to the *observed* mutation rate (which is three times faster than the standard, """"effective"""" rate). J2 Cohanim serves as the deep background of the priestly Jewish caste (J1,J2). “The finding of J2 among contemporary Cohanim can lend credence that today’s Cohanim (J1,J2) may be descendents of two different founding dynasties – including coalescence to Phinchas as the founder of J2 Cohanim” concluded Dr. Karl Skorecki.

Why the confirmation that Phinchas may be the orign of J2 Cohanim is so important?

“Pinchas, son of Elazar, son of Aharon the Kohen turned back My anger from upon the Children of Yisrael, so I did not destroy the Children of Yisrael. Therefore say - behold, I give to him My covenant of peace” (Numbers 25:10 - 30:1). “God gave to Pinchas a new permanent priesthood, for him and his descendants for all generations.” (Zohar HaKadosh 3:124a). God indicated that Phinchas had acted justly by rewarding him with the most counter-intuitive form of blessing - an all-new form of priesthood. He is given the Divine Covenant of Peace and the gift of eternal priesthood. Zadok, a des",0

 Basques and more... 

If anybody knows why Claret is also called Bordeaux and is so popular in England, then perhaps we should include Basques (e.g. Piers Gaveston).  Basques entered English society at the same historic time as the Irish.  I also find it odd that Normans should get monolithic mention, without Brittany.  The Duchy of Brittany was a feudal subdomain of English Kings from the Norman Conquest until the 16th Century, in one capacity or another.  Aside from that, we all know the British (Welsh) connection that practically makes them who they are by definition.  Saint-Pierre and Miquelon has a flag and coat of arms which match English ethnic cousins on the Continent, because virtually all of New France was founded by those """"Frenchmen"""" once under English yoke (north and west coasts of """"France"""").  England's arms supposedly include Aquitaine and Gascony as well as the well-known Normandy.

IMHO:

Normandy has best ethnic transferance with England.  Both Scandinavian.
Brittany has best ethnic transferance with Wales.  Both Romano-Briton.
Aquitaine and Gascony has best ethnic transferance with Ireland.  Celtic/Basque connexions (hmm, Queen Mary's marriage with Spain).

All of these domains were of great post-Conquest importance, with added Scotland under Stuarts.  The union of the crowns under James (after the Tudor-Habsburg struggle) marked the divergence of a merely English people and it is from there, that a new British people was formed with participation in the Dutch and German dominions.  As far as I know and now think, the new """"British people"""" is mostly a network of upper class/parliamentary aristocrats and their personal heritage.

I am proud to sport a 1/8th Aquitainian/Poitevin (although Huguenot) ancestor.  I don't know further genealogy to find a recent Parisian (non-London) French (what is called France, but has English character) ancestor.  You know what side this ancestor would have fought on if Buckingham's war with France got serious.  This opens up a window to the past glories of the Angevin Empire for me because although I sport a Scottish colonial American wife, my own specific heritage does not leave the bounds of the three leopards of the Plantagenet dominions.

What some people should look at, is the French Wars of Religion maps.  Huguenots are numerous in Aquitaine/Gascony and Toulouse, both former Angevin areas.  One wonders if this Protestantism is an Albigensian Crusade relic, an Arian Visigothic vs Catholic Frankish relic or both combined with a culture of English resistance to the Capetians.

Also, if mentioning the Danes we shouldn't neglect the Norwegians.  I think the Royal Website summarizes our English ethnic roots by explaining them dynastically and the personal unions that encouraged a compatible mix of people.  That is why I believe the """"French people"""" are reasonably well related; to nitpick or split hairs on it is just ridiculous.

The blog owner is a 3rd year law student and I don't think he would misquote a federal judge.  Isn't there a way to use that source, with whatever notations?

My statements of views are merely responding to yours.  You write """"I did write that the CA rule creates a double standard, because it does.

ECF, which pro ses are frequently not allowed to use, 2.) pro se forms, which  pro ses aren't required to use.  An attorney could probably use the pro se forms if they wanted. 3.) appellate appendixes  in pro se cases the entire case file is sent over and there is no provision for joint appendixes, a disadvantage for pro ses.  There are also other procedures for pro ses, which are not in the rulessee the appellate procedures which I quoted from the case manuals. As I read the California manual, it seemed merely to instruct the judges to provide more explanation.  I don't remember reading anything that seemed to indicate that a pro se paper would be processed but the same paper from an attorney would be dismissed.

If someone is jailed for disrupting a court, the Federal Rules require that the court say what the disruption consists of, so there should not be a question of what it was.

Please give me an example of a court order that you think a person can be jailed for not obeying, other than not paying alimony or child support, or not testifying when subpoened about a crime or not responding to a subpoena by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   """,0

That Op-ed is 90% about criticism of the US system and I'm not sure that is relevant to this article.

He's saying he doesn't like the US response, not that he agrees with the verdict.  The lengthy criticism section I put together wasn't necessarily intended to go in as is.

It has been proposed several times to fully protect archives. The reason it is not done is because 1) it would be a large burden that is generally not necessary because few people try to change the contents of archives and even common vandalism in archives is almost non-existent; and 2) there are legitimate edits to be made to the page, even outside of removing real names or potentially libellous statements, such as archiving additional sections, re-factoring, or changing headers, that would be impeded by protecting the page and likewise create additional burden if there were a scheme to have administrators protect and unprotect these pages. —→talk •

 Wally the Green Monster 
Hey,
I'm not sure why you keep deleting the Wally the Green Monster edits. Susan Widak is the orginal creator of Wally and holds copyrights form the mid-1990's. Her hats, t-shirts, biibs, cups, pants, etc. were all sold at in around fenway park for roughly 5 years. I'm gonna actually scan some of her designs for your overview. I'm not sure who you are, but don't you think it's slightly out of line to erase all of this factual information that's being posted???

First, your addition needs to be verifiable in published third-party sources, like books and magazines, references to which should be included in your edit. See Wikipedia:Verifiability for more information. Second, your addition needs to be written in a neutral point of view. The beginning of the paragraph is fine in this respect, but everything after """"Although Susan humbly refuses to claim credit..."""" is written as though it were an addressed letter from you personally to the world.

WP:NPF 
Wikipedia also contains biographies of people who, while notable enough for an entry, are not generally well known. In such cases, exercise restraint and include only material relevant to their notability, while omitting information that is irrelevant to the subject's notability. Material from third-party primary sources should not be used unless it has first been published by a reliable secondary source. Material published by the subject must be used with caution. (See Using the subject as a source.)

Material that may adversely affect a person's reputation should be treated with special care. In the laws of many countries, simply repeating the defamatory claims of another is illegal, and there are special protections for people who are not public figures.

Thank you for taking my suggestion by coming here to Talk instead of just reverting without explanation. I have indeed reverted some changes by Jayjg.  However, these changes were not actually improvements.  Briefly:
 act-now.org is brought up as an example of how """"circumcision advocacy"""" is a term used by some advocates, whereas Jay's version makes it sound otherwise.  Regardless of the subjective quality of the web site, suppressing any mention of it would be POV, hence unacceptable.  WP:NPOV is not negotiable.
 The definition of circumcision advocacy is accurate and not OR.  If you have some sort of specific complaints, I suggest altering the text instead of removing it.
 The article already mentions masturbation, you would like to omit the relevant and cited fact that masturbation is harmless and NOT prevented by circumcision.  Omiting this would be POV and WP:NPOV is not negotiable.
 Actually, what's reintroduced is the history with regard to advocacy, which is entirely relevant.
In short, these deletions all serve to harm the neutrality and comprehensiveness of the article.  Therefore, I will be forced to continue restoring the text if you attempt to remove it without an acceptable explanation.  Your explanations thus far are not acceptable.  Thank you for understanding.  """,0

Totoro and Shinto
I don't believe the section """"Totoro and Shinto"""" is necessary. Totoro has nothing to do with anything religious. Even though there appears shrines and a tree with a shimenawa, it doesn't mean that Totoro has shintoist themes because you can see shinto shrine everywhere in Japan. Regarding appearance of shrine as Shintoism is just a misunderstanding by foreigners who have little knowledge of the Japanese way of religion. Obake has nothing to do with shinto either. No Japanese people regard obake as a part of shinto. If you call Totoro religious, almost all Japanese anime and manga will be religious. Do you call Inuyasha religious just because Kagome lives in a shrine? Or do you call Yu Yu Hakusho religious because Yusuke became a ghost and there're many yokais in the show? Or do you say Shrek has Christian themes just because there's a church? Calling something shintoism just because it is traditional is nonsense. Even if Totoro seems to have shintoist themes to the westerners' eyes, it just means Totoro is a movie set in the Japanese countryside and it is nothing worthy of special mention.  

You may believe most Japanese people are shintoist, but it is not necessarily true. They go to shrine on New Year's Day not because they believe in shinto but simply beacuse it is Japanese tradition. The same thing can be said about the appearance of the shrine in Totoro. The appearance of shinto shrine or that of obake cannot be connected to shinto. Believe it or not, it is true that there's no Japanese word for """"shintoist"""" although there is the word for """"Buddhist"""", bukkyouto. In other words, Japanese people don't regard them something like """"shintoist"""". To Japanese, shinto is not something you believe in or you don't blieve in. There's no bible or dogma. Shinto is nothing like Christianity, Islam or Buddhism. It is even doubtful whether it is proper to say that shinto is a religion. 
Totoro is nothing religious. Repeat, the appearance of the shrine doesn't mean Totoro has shintoist themes. I must say that to see Totoro religious is only a biased viewpoint. If there're no dissenting opinions, I will erase the section """"Totoro and Shinto"""" on the 24 of April, a week after my first note on the issue.  

True, Totoro is not religious, but there are significant Shinto themes throughout the film. The Totoro are forest/nature spirits, the tree where they live is part of a shrine, and so on. Having Shinto themes does not mean Miyazaki was trying to get across some religious point. Rather, I imagine he was trying to evoke images of a lost past (as it is set in the 1950s) when things were simpler, and trying to get people to remember their roots and not forget their traditions. As you wrote yourself, Shinto is not so much a religion anymore (except to a very few), but more of a set of traditions with some religious elements. Totoro can have Shinto elements without being a religious film. I don't think anyone is arguing the film is religious. You're the only one who's said anything about that. I do find it odd how you reply to yourself above, and appear to be arguing with yourself.···? · Talk to Nihonjoe 

No, I didn't talk to myself. I wanted to say some more. That's all.  

Although I reverted the deletion of this section (see following thread), I have no familiarity with this topic and no opinion whether this section belongs in the article or not.  ☎ 

I agree with Michael Friedrich. All the spiritual creatures appearing in Totoro (totoro/troll, cat-bus, etc.) have as little resemblance to traditional Japanese/shinto spirits as monsters from Nausicaä in contrast to those from Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away that have more expressly Japanese looks and names. 

In either way, unless the author of the section have reliable sources to back up his interpretation of this film in there, it should be removed. A couple of sentence that cite McCarthy's article may stay, but the rest appears to be a product of original research.

"OVERVIEW:

Crunch (AGT Crunch Acquisition, LLC) is a fitness-based enterprise that is focused on making entertainment an integral part of the exercise experience. Established in New York in 1989, today the Crunch brand has 27 locations in 7 major urban centers in the United States: New York City, Brooklyn, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles. As a strategy, Crunch has concentrated on expanding inside of these urban centers: its penchant for innovation resonating especially well with the various demographics therein.  Because of these factors the brand is often associated with descriptors such as “hip”, “edgy”, “urban” etc. and has an air of inherent coolness that the majority of its competitors cannot claim to.

FEATURES:

1)TABGROUP FITNESS CLASSES
Since its inception Crunch has maintained a focus on its group fitness program as the brand’s cornerstone. As such, it has built an extensive catalogue of classes that are characterized by their broad appeal and inventiveness. Numbering in the hundreds, these classes are organized into three different categories: Action Sports, Chill Outs and Dance Rhythms. Examples (taken from the official Crunch website) include:
Urbanathlete (Action Sports)
This circuit-style class is based on Men’s Health Magazine’s Fitness Challenge.  In it you’ll work through obstacles and exercises that were inspired by various cityscapes and come to see just about any sprawling metropolis as a big, concrete playground. 

Antigravity Yoga ‘Wings’ (Chill Outs)
Wings’ will have you stretching further and holding challenging poses longer, using only a fabric trapeze to do so.  And, by employing simple suspension techniques you’ll move into poses that are seemingly impossible.  However, the goal isn’t just to turn you into a human pretzel: those poses will help to relieve compressed joints and align your body from head to toe.

Cardio Dance Blast (Dance Rhythms)
Get your groove on in this sixty-minute class that’s been cleverly disguised as a dance party – one with a soundtrack comprised of the best in hip-hop, reggae and top-forty music.  You’ll melt away fat while bringing your dance skills to the next level and beyond.
In addition, Crunch offers private versions of their classes for small groups.

2)TABPERSONAL TRAINING
Each Crunch location has a staff of personal trainers available to its members for individual or semi-private sessions. Crunch divides these personal trainers into four different categories based on experience and certifications earned. (All of Crunch’s personal trainers are required to have a minimum of professional experience and certifications earned prior to being hired.) Collectively, these trainers have expertise in a broad range of areas. Quoting from the company’s press kit, “All Crunch clubs are staffed with first-rate fitness professionals – personal trainers with certifications in a wide variety of specialties: strength training, yoga, boxing, kickboxing, pre/post natal, kettle bells, physical rehabilitation and much more.”

3) EQUIPMENT
All Crunch locations feature a wide array of fitness equipment produced by the industry’s leading manufacturers: Precor, Life Fitness, Netpulse, Expresso, Icarian, Hammer Strength etc. This equipment is updated with an eye toward keeping current with emerging technologies and trends. For example Crunch is phasing in Life Fitness’ treadmills with built-in iPod functionality. Select Crunch locations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles feature Pilates studios equipped with both Reformers and Wunda Chair Systems and locations in all markets feature Yoga studios. Additionally, certain facilities have more elaborate features: full-sized boxing rings, swimming pools, indoor tracks, basketball courts, saunas, hot tubs and sundecks.  

4) SPECIAL EVENTS AND UNIQUE OFFERINGS
The following is taken from Crunch’s current press kit regarding special events and unique offerings: 


Crunch health clubs are home to a unique fusion of entertainment and fitness, one that we have pioneered from our inception and continue to explore through a number of different channels. In-gym parties and performances (by students of Scratch DJ Academy), an outdoor summer concert series, partnerships with cutting-edge theatrical productions like Spiegelworld and Fuerzabruta and our Broadway Dance Series are all hallmarks of this exploration. Additionally, we’ve developed a number of events that take place outside of our gyms, like field trips (which are held year-round in all of our markets and vary greatly in destination) a",0

Else we will be going nowhere. You don't seem to understand it but Wikipedia is a consensus ruled community. And consensus can only be achieved by honest constructive discussion, ability to accept others' viewpoints (specially when these are reasonable) and ability for compromise.
Andronico (the mediator) can't make a ruling: he's no judge nor referee, just a mediator, someone who will try to get our positions to gather at a reasonable middle or wider point. 
If mediation doesn't work, there are only three alernative ways:
Aplication of the supermajority principle (alternative to consensus when this is not available)
Arbitration (ArbCom)
Application of the Disruptive Editing policy what actualy leads to ArbCom and possible community ban for the disruptive editor(s).

Hey Folks:  Dan56 may work for a record company, or is just a very enthusiastic fan for the artists he likes.  He constantly vandalizes apges where he does not like the review.  On """"aaliyah"""" the album, he somehow twisted Metacritic's 76 rating, which means Generally Favorable- and said the album received """"highly positive"""" reviews, which is not borne out in facts.  On Nicki Minaj's Roman Reloaded, which he clearly dislikes, he said Excellent reviews by Rolling Stone and Spin are inconsequential- and insisted Metacritic was the most important factor.  he's full of sh**t, to be frank.  And he's a bully.  And when he disagrees, such as he does hear, he begins to name call, whine etc.  He has a few supporters who he rallies around to beef up his bogus assertions on these talk pages.

"Suspected Sockpuppeteer Turns Out to Be a Human
Shocking news break.  It turns out that the person who originally supplied the information in ISM is me!  A real 

person.... not a 'sock puppeteer.'  There are no socks and no puppets.  Just a real person who thought that a 

business was significant enough to warrant a pace on Wikipedia.  Someone who actually understands the business he is 

in, unlike the editors, who have no experience in the field whatsoever.

It turns out- or so we can surmise, that there are lots of people who want to learn about this company.  Oh no!  

This can't be!  It's a business... not an encyclopedic fact!  

But an encyclopedia like Wikipedia should include everything in the world.  otherwise, why does it exist?  

Encyclopedia Britannica and the Oxford Encyclopedia are perfectly sufficient.

Geekish editors have said that listing this company is 'blatant advertising.'  Yet other advertising companies, like 

Modernista, BBDO, DDB, Ogilvy, etc. are all here... blatant advertising.  So, how big does a company have to be to 

be listed on Wiki?  The answer- there is no answer.  It's all up to the whims of people who have no knowledge nor 

experience in business, who call themselves Carbuncle, Smeff, Dongfart, and the rest.  This is surely detrimental to 

the Wiki.

Why do people have such a Pyongyang attitude towards this?  The very idea of limiting what is shown here- censoring 

pure facts arbitrarily- is against the very idea of a global Wiki.  The great big idea is that this site is 

developed by the people of the world, and includes all the things that the published encyclopedias, which have been 

around for hundreds of years, do not or cannot include.

To my mind, and all the other sane, normal people of the world, this is all ridiculous.  

Please cite the arguments of What Wiki is Not and all the rest.  It is a shortcut to thinking.  And clearly there is 

very little thinking here.  

I have had repeated emails from people around the world asking why they cannot find ISM on Wikipedia, and many from 

people who either wanted to add information on the company or were looking for information for research.  Everyone 

was rebuffed.  What kind of person would do this- what kind of person would sit in their little room, hiding 

information from others, and trying to keep reality away at any cost?  Sock Puppets?  Suspicious users?  Legal 

threats?  What kind of cowardly fool says these things without simply engaging in a dialogue with the person who 

originally wrote the article and who always- ALWAYS - asked for editor input and support?

Go on- look at the history.  You will see that editor input was always taken at first, despite the fact that all 

editors here are wholly unqualified to make a decision on this subject.  When asked to explain themselves, no one 

had the nous to do so.  Delicious Carbuncle, BlueBoy, Todd1, Fisher Queen, etc.   All refused to answer for their 

actions.  Cowards and buffoons who have no sense, courage, nor intelligence. 

Anyone who makes an attack on another person, as these 'editors' have, and runs away without facing the person they 

have attacked, is  not deserving of their powers.  

I am now convinced that Wikipedia, despite it's noble origins, is just a place for fools to feel power in a world 

where they are unable to have any in reality.  Go ahead and add your ridiculous little code to me and my site.  You 

have no argument and have no intelligence- if you think you do, face me like a real human- talk, discuss, and the 

rest.  Or be a true Wiki editor and make a stupid, sarcastic comment and run away... hiding... and never respond to 

your comments.

Matt and Lohan Shan-Tung end up in the Basilica de Nossa Senhore de Nazare in Belem, Brazil and Pedro and Scott ended up in the Abbey of San Galgano in Italy.
Ten years have passed since the destruction of Hong Kong, and the Old Ones have revealed themselves to the world, as the war is slowly destroying humanity, and, as predicted, humanity forms a resistance to them, the """"World Army."""" Baker, President of the United States, is opposing this resistance, leading to all out warfare with rebels and government forces.

He tries to warn the resistance's leader.
Scott is converted to the Old Ones and lures Matt and Richard into captivity. Richard works out the purpose of the tumi Inca knife and plunges it into Matt, killing his present form but bringing his past form 10000 years into the future to continue the fight.

In answer to WBardwin: As to a good source on effects of Little Ice Age, my background is of decades of taking field archeology classes, while living in the area of the """"anasazi"""".  None of the things I could cite are in writing, such as books, it comes from lectures.  Of course, the """"anasazi"""" did not leave written records, or the entire subject would be much more clear.  
Currently I teach ceramics (pottery) at Eastern Arizona College.  I make """"anasazi"""" reproductions that everyone raves about.  I could say I am the incarnation of an """"anasazi"""", which I personally believe, and it would be taken with the same disbelief as suggesting that the Little Ice Age (please see the Wikipedia article on this subject)could be causative to the abandonment of the """"anasazi"""" homelands.  
A New York Times article of this date (Vanished: A Pueblo Mystery)does mention Little Ice Age, but generally dismisses it as causal, preferring a way more complicated explanation.  Unfortunately the field is filled with a LOT of subjective information, even or perhaps especially, by the """"experts"""".  I do believe that a mention IS in order, even if others disagree, particularly since it IS plausible, with verification from European sources.
A Google search of """"anasazi little ice age"""" leads to several confirming articles, but who knows the credentials of the authors?

"These conditions are problematic, as evidenced by the current ANI discussion.

Questioning minor 1st paragraph edits?
Re: John Roberts, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sandra Day O'Connor
This is a small matter.  I don't understand the reasons for 's recent minor edits of articles about each of the Justices of the Supreme Court.  After some time, there has been no response to inquiries posted on this editor's talk page nor has there been feedback from similar postings on the talk pages of each of the nine articles about a sitting Justice and the one about retired Justice O'Connor.  Rather than simply reverting this """"improvement,"""" I thought it best to solicit comment from others who might be interested. I found your name amongst others at Talk:Supreme Court of the United States.

I'm persuaded that 's strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is unhelpful in this narrow set of articles  that is, in Wikipedia articles about Justices of the Supreme Court. I think my reasoning might well extend as well to others on the Federal bench.  In each instance, I would question adding this information only in the first paragraph  not elsewhere in the article.  

In support of my view that this edit should be reverted, please consider re-visiting articles written about the following pairs of jurists.
 A1. Benjamin Cardozo
 A2. Learned Hand
 B1. John Marshall Harlan
 B2. John Marshall Harlan II
The question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not.

Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty do wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. 

Less humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.

As you can see, I'm questioning relatively trivial edit; but I hope you agree that this otherwise plausible """"improvement"""" should be removed from introductory paragraphs of ten articles.  If not, why not?

Putin wants to keep South Ossetia under his wing that way he can build his Natural Gas Pipeline through South Ossetia without Georgians permissian. Russia is a BULLY and needs to repect Georgias sovereignty. Putin is too occupied with becoming the new OPEC.""""

Now I see your logic behind calling it a """"civil war"""".

And, what I like most about you, Xeeron, is you have a wonderful persistency in your mistakes. Let's look at your """"sources"""".

Blog of a fotographer, having his contacts in huge letters on the 1st page: Timo Vogt, Fotograf, +49-5863-******, ***[at]randbild[punkt]de. Do you still consider blogs to be reliable sources?:)))) - 1 for providing a non-reliable source.

3) We're not going to discuss source that tells it's """"defending Marxism"""", right? Why don't you just go and write an article about politics based on sources that underline they are """"created to defend neonazism"""" or """"neocons"""" then? I think reliable source should be at least not biased. Defending """"-ism"""" is biased. So - 1 again for providing a source that is """"created to defend Marxism"""".

4) Eurasia.net - wow. A really interesting source. Would it be their opinion, that would be almost enough to claim """"some sources say SO war of 1991-1992 was actually a civil war"""". But, to my dissapointment, these are just words of another fotographer: """"Jonathan Alpeyrie is a war photographer for Getty Images."""" I mean, I adore Getty, I'm even their client for the last two years, but I never knew they were a think tank, did you? A reliable server, but another fotographer that does not count. + 0 again.

Total: - 2 points. 

Now back to the point. See what sources do not consider 1991-1992 SO war to be a civil war: Radio Free Europe , openDemocracy.net (featuring an article of the English professor of Caucasus studies) , The Guardian , and - finally, that's what your beloved BBC thinks of the war:

"""

 I contend that in the first section, yes Legalese makes a valid point that he does majorly include points to support his edits also, but my assertion that the second section (""""Be civil IAF"""") is meant solely for a personal attack. It merely has the cloak of redundant information i.e. which was already posted earlier by Legalese in another section, and its main aim (as the title itself suggests) is to lecture me about what he percieves is """"civility"""". On this, Legalese definitely deserves a warning .

Again, I may repeat that I have dealt with utmost consternation AND with due respect (while mentioning the Hon'ble SC) my opinion on the judgement which may qualify as Contempt of Courtsomething which Legalese has not and probably does not even bother to looking on the Talk-page. The purpose of repeatedly levelling baseless charges of Contempt of Court, despite my clarification on the same in the talk-page earlier is beyond my comprehension.

The charge that I am not being a """"good"""" editor can only be levelled as a matter of opinion only, (which I too can leve back at him) and not as a complaint because Legalese is NOT an admin, has no authority, has had no authority on wikipedia on matters related to the judgement of the quality of articles, and even final arbitration on what constitutes as """"good editing"""" or """"Objectionable behaviour"""".

His lecture to me on civility (that too publicly on a talk-page and not on my user:page) is itself very appaling to me-who has been contributing to wikipedia since more than a year now. What is even more appaling is his assumption of a role as the Moral Guardian and as someone who discerns the quality of edits. For attempting to accuse me of AND impose the norms of """"civility"""" and that too incongruous on a talk-page of an article and not personally on my own talk-page, Legalese deserves a warning.

Besides, I never said that I find the """"word-war"""" offending to me on part of Legalese. So an Unconditional Apology on my part does not arise at all. """,0

 9  Bridgette  - she was one of my favourite's in TDI by being a good player, but has dropped because of her lousy effort on TDA.
 8  Tyler  -  even though he didn't make it far, his self determenation and courage is what makes a mgood person to han around.
 7  Lindsay  - Lindsay's kills, such as forgetting names, betraying enemies and having a very girlish attitude are what makes her funny.
 6  Gwen  -  i like her relationship with Trent and her attitude towards everyone. she had the skills to win TDI, but lost over brownies.
 5  Trent  -  when Trent is mysterious i like his attitude. his relationship with Gwen is by far my favourite.
 4  Courtney  - she has a very strict attitude, which i like and also i like how she started the relationship with Duncan. 
 3  Cody  - i like him because of his cool personality and what he does to try to get Gwen's attention. Ples, he started the Gwen & Trent relationship.
 2  Katie  - she is very funny, especially when she has those fights with Sadi, but it was a sign of racism as she was voted off over overweight, untalented Sadie.

 While others and I may agree with your opinion that """"Tetrapod-like features in fish are remarkable"""", our opinions are ultimately irrelevant. Unsourced promotion of opinions, as well as the original synthesis (novel interpretation) of published material, violates Wikipedia's policies of neutrality, due-weight, and no original research. Unless the entire list or at least the tetrapod-like traits are reliably sourced (e.g. """"Smith (2001) lists these 11 traits as key tetrapod characteristics"""") the appearance is that you alone are advancing the view that all of these species and/or their traits are remarkable for their supposed tetrapod-like nature; assertions which may never have been explicitly made in reliable sources, and thus the list appears to be original synthesis.  The facts themselves are certainly appropriate in each species' article, but combining them in a novel fashion to reach a conclusion(?) unsupported by sources is synthesis.  If you're concerned that interesting behavior or anatomy is not being highlighted, you might expand coverage in relevant sections of Fish locomotion or Diversity of fish. It's fine to say something like """"the Zob fish ventures onto land"""", or even """"The Zob fish is a classic, textbook example of a tetrapod-like fish (Smith, 1980),""""  but it would be synthesis and non-neutral to say (or imply) """"The Zob fish interestingly resembles tetrapods because it ventures onto land"""" without any citation.

"First off, I was not edit warring. I cannot 100% be sure now without access to deleted logs, but I am quite sure I added the info once, then complained about its removal on the talk page. And if you look at the talk page, my issue was with needing to add the creation time, I wasn't even thinking about Giano (had I known adding his name was such an issue, I would have left it off, had I known I was going to be accused of harassment, I would never have even thought of adding it). As for WP:V for making claims about people, I just find that seriously bizarre. You are saying Wikipedia logs are not reliable sources for what Wikipedia editors do? That's pretty ridiculous. The log information stating exactly that information is precisely what readers would have to have had to look at (if they knew how to do it) to even understand the article. Finally, as for not using self references, look at the article context. It was quite clearly nonsense not to refer to the fact that that article had only existed for a few hours. How can you not self reference in that situation? Or are you honestly saying that was not pertinent information, about a claim being made about an article having existed or not? The situation falls squarely between the radio host example and the Siegenthaler incident. Adding a self reference was the only way that paragraph could be written to make any sense.",0

"I'm sorry about the urgency, but, as I explained, it wasn't more urgent than removing my posts. I agree with you about the wristband not being part of shiatsu, and therefore that source is not valid for shiatsu, and I'm sorry to have included it. However, if we are going to be clear about words, acupressure does not exist, since the meaning of the word is needle pressure, so unless you are pressing with needles, the word is used incorrectly. Almost everyone has agreed that the word is used for pressure on acupuncture points. So I believe that, when a source mentions acupressure massage, it could be used for shiatsu, since shiatsu, in part at least, presses acupuncture points.

Mick I think knows this subject more than I do, although I am more or less one of the major (at least frequent, anyway) editors relating to religion and Christianity. Also, in some of his statements, like his accepting the """"Apocalypse of John,"""" is is clear that he definitely qualifies as """"former"""". There are also a variety of Jewish Christian groups, although there is no evidence Dylan belonged to a group that has been described as such. This subject has been extensively discussed before, and in fact led to an editor being banned at one point. He did achieve a great deal of press coverage, and thus notability, for the albums he issued during his """"Christian"""" period, and it is seems on that basis that his """"Christianity"""" be noted. As he has never conclusively subsequently officially renounced any form of Christianity, there is a good chance WP:BLP might enter into our moving him into Category:Former Christians or anything like that, because he has never himself that I know of described himself unequivocally in such terms. In short, this is still a matter of some ambiguity about the subject, particularly taking BLP into account, and I think the current categorization schema was arrived at after those really lengthy, and frankly extremely contentious, discussions. And we really don't have a category of Category:People who have been described as both Jewish and Christian, so this seems to be, basically, the only way to go. Some sort of FAQ template at the top of the page might be useful here, but, in general, I think Mick is among the most productive editors on this article, and I trust his conclusions based on the amount of material he has personally reviewed and his conclusions.

""" is known as the al'Buraq wall to Muslims. I do not doubt in any way that is is known by this name by many Muslims, particularly some Palestinian and Jordanian Muslims. However, from everything that I've read, the name is of rather recent provenance, and was never known as such among Muslims until the foundation of modern Israel. If memory serves, it didn't really have any circulation until the last two decades or so.  from the obscure claims of Mujir al'Din that the Buraq was left there when Mohammad ascended to paradise, which itself is a legend derived from Sahih al'Bukhari, the provenance of the hadith itself being regarded by some as an addition of a later editor; that's of little relevance here, though. I see this has been mentioned on the talk page already in passing, and I don't advocate any necessity of removing it. However, the attribution itself is sixteenth century, and actual naming of it as the """"al'Buraq wall"""" is incredibly recent. I think we should at the very least clarify this, add another source aside from an obviously politically motivated fatwa for the name, and perhaps move it somewhere besides the lead so we can elaborate on all of this. I just skimmed it, but I'm not even sure the fatwa actually names it as such aside from the title (nevermind, it does). For all I know, it may itself be the origin of the name, with this article helping to disseminate it. Since this, like every Jerusalem-related article, is contentious, I thought it best to get some discussion before I did anything.   

Yes, its a point of contention. See above, it is discussed both in the """"Lead"""" subsection of the """"POV Issues"""" section and in the """"Rashid Khalidi"""" section.  

Jordanian occupation 1948–1967
I was wondering, from whom did the Jordanian capture the old city of Al-Quds and the wall? and why was the Jordanian rule over it considered occupation, while Israeli rule is considered sovereignty? I don't find this neutral? This should be changed.   
The answer is in the article.  
It is referred to as the Jordanian Occupation, because their annexation of the site was not internationally recognised, hence occupation. And while Israel's presence is also not recognised, (the last UN resolution on the matter calls for Jerusalem to be internationalised), in reality, Israel excercises its sovreignty over the site. As this matter is disputed, I did want to add a section on the current legal status of the wall and suggestions mooted during peace negotiations relating to future ownership of the site, but I could not find any good sources.   
Jordan exercised its sovereignty over the wall for the period they controlled it, i think both should be changed to sovereignty or occupation. The Israeli rule is not internationally recognised either and if I'm not incorrect then the Western wall and old city were part of the West bank. Which is under occupation.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 90.193.16.207   
Jerusalem is viewed differently from the West Bank. See Positions on Jerusalem and Occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan. This subject matter is so extensive and there are so many diverse """"postions"""" on the subject, I am not really qualified to determine the correct descriptions. But for the sake of neutrality, I believe Yamanam does have a valid point. Even though the artricle on Jordan's rule calls it occupation, I suggest changing both to """"rule"""" which would hopefuly solve the problem.   
Yes i belive that could be an acceptable compromise. i would prefer it if you did it as edits by account members are more respectable.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 90.193.16.207   
I will. But why not become an editor yourself? It only takes a second!

 Geneology Nightmare 

The beginning of this article confuses Alexios the first with his grandson of the same name. It says that he was the son of John II, when John II was in fact the son of Alexios I. Alexios the grandson was the son of John II. The top picture entitled """"Depiction of Alexios as a young prince in Hagia Sophia, Istanbul"""" is also of Alexios the grandson (who died young, hence why he is frowning), and not Alexios I. 

I should also note that the lady Anna Dalassena is listed as the mother of Alexios I. This is correct. But it says that she fathered him with her grandson, so that needs to be taken care of.

Speaking of taking care of this problem, I created my wiki account just now to address this problem. Since my experience with wikipedia editing is so new, I regret to say that I have absolutely no idea how to change it to make it right. But clearly, it needs to be fixed.   """,0

Hence, Congressional relocation funding. So, the bottom line was money, and questionnable technical feasibility. The study is probably cited in the hearings for the funding legislation.

 Sound of jewellery 

The sound of jewellery has played an enermous part in many stories, poems, and religious literature (more details and sources to come).
Different jewellery creates different sounds, ie plastic bangles create a high pitched clink sound, while others such as baxelite produce
a """"clunck"""" sound. Knowing how a particular piece of jewellery sounds can help someone identify whether or not a piece of jewellery is fake.
Indeed people have written about the sound of """"fake gold"""", and jewel makers such as Sharon Alouf, a famous jeweler have praised the high frequency pitched noise of gold bangles(most likely real gold she is wearing).

", as I promised here is a brief discussion of the different types of distillation used in the hydrocarbon processing industries that I am very familiar with ... i.e.,  oil refineries, petrochemical plants, natural gas processing plants (extracting natural gas liquids known as NGL's), and other hydrocarbon processing industries. Those industries probably have perhaps 80% or more of the industrial distillation columns in existence.

Other industries such as the pharmaceutical industry, the alcohol distilling industry and the fine chemicals industry also use quite a bit of distillation, but I am not familiar with those industries.

Major Industrial Distillation Types: The two primary types of industrial distillations are Continuous Fractionation or (Continuous Distillation) and Batch Distillation. The industrial Continuous Fractionation distillation towers are typified by the large, vertical, cylindrical columns as can be seen in the oil refinery photograph in the Fractional distillation article. Please note  that by continuous, I mean 24 hours a day for 1 to 3 years before being temporarily shut down for maintenance ... and we are talking about towers with diameters ranging from about 65 centimeters to 6 meters and heights ranging from about 6 meters to 60 meters or more.

There are many subsets of the Continuous Fractionation primary distillation type, such as: 

 Fractional distillation
 Vacuum distillation
 Azeotropic distillation 
 Extractive distillation
 Steam distillation

The above subsets would be of approximately the same size range is the primary Continuous Fractionation towers. The vacuum towers require reinforcement (provided by a number of steel beams encircling the tower exteriors) so that they can withstand the difference in pressure between the exterior atmospheric pressure and the interior vacuum. 

As for the vapor-liquid contacting trays or plates used in industrial distillation towers, it is virtually impossible to explain bubble-cap or valve trays (or sheet steel structural packing) without drawings or photographs.  We need someone who could make such drawings. We also need someone who can make a drawing of a typical kettle-type reboiler commonly used as the heat input to a  distillation tower (although there are other types of reboilers such as fired furnaces, horizontal or vertical heat exchangers, bayonet heat exchangers, etc.).

Finally, if you look at the the simple sketch that I made of a typical fractionation tower overhead system in the Fractional distillation article, that sketch needs to be made longer so that it shows the feedstream  entry (at about the center height of the tower), and the bottoms exiting the tower and entering the kettle reboiler .... with the final liquid bottoms product leaving the kettle reboiler and the reboiled vapor returning from the kettle to the tower. -",0

 Website display 

I'm just curious, especially because I've been seeing several editors doing this, but why would you change """"Evanescence.com"""" to """"www.Evanescence.com"""" (as you did here), when the former is a perfectly valid link to their website and is much more visually pleasing? —  (t @ c) 

The infobox doc has the standard format as """"www.example.com"""" and the Official link at the bottom of the page was directed to www.ev.com so I followed that pattern as well.  Also, as you mentioned, most other pages have the www. on there as well. Most of the time the reasoning is because when visiting the domain without the """"www."""" subdomain, it redirects to it with the """"www."""" anyway.  Apparently this is not the case with the Evanescence website (as I have just verified).  I was really just looking for consistency, though.  Since the Ev pages all had """"www."""" listed, I kept it consistent by making the infobox the same.  I agree that Evanescence.com looks better.  However, all official channels such as their official twitter page (as well as Amy Lee's official twitter page), the official youtube page, and even the WindUp records website links to """"www.Evanescence.com"""". I believe that we should follow suit. ~ [ Scott M. Howard ]:[ Talk ] ~ 

Okay, that's fine. For most any modern website, the """"www"""" is almost completely redundant, and I personally loath such things, but it really makes no difference for our purposes here. The infobox doc makes no sense to me with that """"standard"""", since IIRC http:// and https:// could technically direct viewers to two different websites, so why not require that part as well? Feels like over-standardisation. —  (t @ c) 

I just figure consistency throughout Evanescence is best.  If that's how they advertise themselves, I guess that's how we should.  On the subject of """"www"""", I agree that it's completely redundant.  The only reason it exists seems to be out of habit. lol  It even sounds stupid on radio or TV when people are advertising their sites """"Go to double-you double-you double-you dot ..."""" Got a studder, pal?  I dunno.  It sorta goes with my want to use metric in the united states... but we know THAT will probably never change as a standard either. ah, well. =D ~ [ Scott M. Howard ]:[ Talk ] ~ 

Indeed! Why oh why can't we just switch to metric? I'm not sure what you mean by """"advertise""""? You mean how the site is presented by the group in other media?

""""Alternative hip hop, like all genres of art, is a social construction and as such the definition is open to debate.""""     

If with the term """"social construction"""" in this sentance, the statement """"Alternative hip hop, like all genres of art, is a social construction"""" is meant to convey that any musical work one calls """"alternitive hip hop"""" happens to be the product of an agent operating under certain social conditions (as opposed to working in a vacuum), or if it is meant to establish that the term """"alternative hip hop"""" was created by such an agent, then the statement is quite true.  However, a """"social construction"""" typically is opposed to a """"natural kind"""" in that it is only conventional.  In this sense it is not altogether clear if in fact the statement is true:  take the art genres """"Oil Painting"""" and """"Punk Rock"""":  it is not merely as a point of convention that we say these two genres are different, there is a matter of fact about it.  However, in neither of these senses does it straightforwardly follow that """"as such the definition is open to debate.""""  I do not mean to contend that the definition isn't open to debate, but only that its openness to debate isn't tied in any direct way to whether it is a """"social contruction"""".  In the first case, consider the terms """"integer"""" and """"one"""": both terms where surely created by agents in a social setting, yet their definitions are particularly rigorous.  As for the second case, i might say that a man is jewish just in case his mother were jewish.

Aside from being an oddly specific notability requirement, being on the NYT bestseller list the longest doesn't erase the fact that her work has nothing to do with Filipino-Americans. She complains about being the target of racism, but actively criticizes Asian-Americans to the point that she herself has been called racist. She is relevant in an article on conservatism perhaps.

"It's been a long time, SummerPhD 

Remember me? It's been a while, so you probably don't. My original account was GreenBayPackersfan09. That was my first Wikipedia account (I was 11 year old when I first used that account in 2009, and 14 when i lasted used it in 2012). I'm 17 years old now.  I remember when I would used to create a lot of articles, notably on actors who starred in shows that I watched (wizards of waverly place, hannah montana, etc.) We first crossed paths in 2009 (and parted ways in 2012, looking at your last edit on that account userpage), when you nominated a good number of them for deletion (some of them got deleted). If you look at the talk page on the GreenBayPackers account, you'll notice that I actually got vindicated on a good number of the articles you nominated for deletion – a lot of the articles are intact, and in fact have been expanded with pictures, more sources, etc. such as the Harry Shum and Simon Curtis article. I forgot the password to that account, and later used sockpuppets (which I remember you blocked me for, lol). So, how have you been? I've been well. I've started editing a broad multitude of articles productively (I'd argue I was editing productively with that other account as well, and that you were being a tad overzealous). I now edit articles on current events, public figures, politicians, etc. I've learned a lot about Wikipedia's rules, and have made a good number of productive edits. I just stopped by to say it's amazing you're still around. Some people retire after a well. Anyway, just wanted to let you know.",0

"""== Article flagged - could use a photo of a pit bull in attack mode ==

Before we get into discussing this article there is some background information that everyone needs to understand. First,statistically, pit bulls are less agressive (naturally) than, beagles, german shepards and other breeds. Secondly, the dogs only want to please their owners, that is why if you watch the [disgusting] videos of dog fighting you will see 90% of the dogs are wagging their tails because they hear their owner(s) encouraging them to fight. A perfect example is the Michael Vick case, his dogs were taken and put into kennels, as per a federal jury they were not killed because of the [high] profile of the case. Out of the 66 dogs there were taken 8 were put down; which means that is only 12%. Out of the other 58 dogs they have all been adopted to families along with being trained for hospice and hospitals to help raise self esteems on patients. The best saying to sum up the Pit Bull breed is too """"Blame the Deed NOT the Breed"""" which means dont classify ALL pitbulls as fighting agressvie dogs, just the one's that are beaten and treated like crap by the owners and bred for fighting. Pit bulls are NOT agressive by nature. If you look at american history we used to LOVE Pit Bulls, I mean there was Petey (little rascals) and betty boop had a pitbull. Plus many other famous actors/actresses.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

The article discusses at length the dangerous nature of pit bulls, but lacks a picture of a pit bull attacking or behaving aggressively. The photo of a muzzled pit bull is a start, but is insufficient. I realize it may not be easy to obtain a such a photo in the public domain or by permission, but I'm adding a request in any case.   

 Why does the article need that? Any dog breed can attack.  There's nothing special about the way that a bully breed attacks. The muzzle image is fine; it illustrates that fact that some bully breed individuals do have aggression tendencies which need to be addressed if the dog is in public.  Talk 

 A photo of an agressive dog would be better suited for a dog fighting article.  To place a photo of an aggressive dog in an article describing a breed would be similar to using a photo of a soldier shooting an enemy during war on the Human article...  Or a Jew in a concentration camp, or I suppose a photo of a mugging would compare to animal aggression, but those wouldn't be true to Human character would they?   

Isn't a photo of a muzzled dog more relevant to a discussion of dog muzzling laws? Some places, such as some public parks, require all dogs to be muzzled while attending, regardless of breed, so a photo of a muzzled dog can have different interpretations. As I wrote in my first post, for an article that discusses pit bull attacks, an illustration of such would not be improper to accompany the text. Wikipedia:Images: """"Images must be relevant to the article they appear in and be significantly relative to the article's topic."""" Here are a couple of news media stories that felt it appropriate to use such images: http://www.ktul.com/news/stories/0108/485244.html and http://dallasmorningviewsblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2008/02/mandatory-confi.html. Perhaps a pit bull owner out there would be proud to have such an image of their guard dog in attack mode displayed in the article or perhaps a kennel owner or victim of an attack was able to snap a photo that they would donate and upload to Wikipedia Commons. I remember there used to be a photo of a """"smiling pit bull"""" in the article (see archive Nov 1, 2007). We could return that in the positive press section at the same time to maintain balance.   

A single screenshot image could also be obtained from a television news report about pit bulls and included under fair use. Research: Wikipedia:Image_copyright_tags/Non-free_content and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Non-free_television_screenshot Template:Non-free_tele",0

Butter alternatives
In response to 's request for justification on adding a section on butter alternatives, I added statements from and links to scientific studies talking about cardiovascular benefits of substituting other things for butter as well as some layman reports by health authorities which also have published on the concept of butter alternatives.

I integrated the health history into this new butter alternatives section as well. It might be the case that a """"butter alternatives"""" article should be created independently and that various articles should link to it, but even in that case, I feel that it is merited to summarize publications on this topic in this article. Thoughts? (talk) 

Where profits are involved one must be very careful about the claims by and on behalf of competing products. We should not be implying that one product needs to be replaced with another. Listing alternatives without saying why (in that part of the article) is thus a problem. There have been many studies suggesting all sorts of things about butter and its competitors. We can report what reliable sources say about it, but cannot take a position on the matter. Also, if we imply that butter needs replacing because of alleged problems, we really need to apply equivalent standards to the alternatives. Potential problems have been found with at least some of the alternatives. To just list alternatives, thereby implying that butter is problematic, without mentioning issues with the alternatives, is unacceptable. It would probably be going too far to list ALL the issues, so I'd suggest leaving the alternatives out.   
I hesitate to take your suggestion to leave the alternatives section out entirely but I would like to respond to your concerns in some way. My first thought would be that I could fork this into an article called Butter substitution, then have the list, a health discussion, and advice from organizations about doing the substitution.
About profits - there are areas on Wikipedia where there is risk of commercial intervention but I do not see unbranded food concepts as being particularly high risk at this time. I should mention that I am sharing this information on behalf of Consumer Reports, the United States equivalent of your Australian Choice (Australian consumer organisation). We publish food and health information from the US government and medical organizations, and I came to this butter article because of our own work. My organization does have a bias which says that people should consume less fat. I would like to make a health claim here that says that health organizations commonly give the advice that people should eat less butter. I cited the Cochrane Collaboration, Mayo Clinic, National Heart Foundation of Australia, and my own organization as saying this, but to go into more detail would be as you said, undue.
How would you feel about my forking this content into its own article, putting everything there, and then keeping a statement in this article which said something like """"Many health organizations advise that consumers should use less fats in their diet and cooking and eat less butter because of the cardiovascular problems caused by the fat in many people's diets. In addition to eating less butter, these organizations recommend replacing butter with butter substitutes which are purported to have fewer adverse effects."""" I would also look for information about the health benefits of butter, if I can find any sources. How does this strike you? (talk) 

Are there no conflicting opinions, even scientific ones? Are your """"proposed"""" butter alternatives 100% harmless for all people in all situations?   
I want to assume that there at least are defined positions taken by various organizations and associated with various re",0

[ Herb Miller Orch ] 
né: John Herb Miller (he used the form: J. Herb Miller) 
b. 1915, d. 1987. Age: 72 (Stroke) 
Overview 
Herb Miller, Glenn Miller's younger brother, was born in North Platte, Nebraska, and, like Glenn, studied music in High School. Herb worked his way through college by playing the trumpet. He spent a short spell working in his brother's band, doubling as trumpeter and also as business manager. Herb then accepted an offer to play trumpet with Charlie Spivak. Herb did have a band of his own in the early 1940s. In 1943, he and his band appeared in a movie called """"Spotlight Scandals,"""" starring Harry Langdon (about a year before he died), and featuring singer Bonnie Baker. William Beaudine was the director. Late in the 1950s, Herb formed his band and toured the U.S. with appearances in hotels and ballrooms, including the Aragon Ballroom in Ocean Park, CA, the Jerry Jones Ballroom, and the Rendezvous Ballroom in Salt Lake City, UT. Yet, despite Herb's best efforts, the band only met with moderate success. The only album cut by the band, in America, was on Herb's own label, Millertone. While Herb's band never came even remotely close to the fame that his older brother Glenn achieved, it is still active and quite popular in England today (1999). After WWII, Herb settled in Pacific Grove, California, and made that his home base for about 25 years. 

Mr. John Lovejoy, a former student of Herb's and onetime member of his band, recalls: 
""""Herb didn't form his band while his brother was alive, and not until many years after his brother's death. He was so devastated by his brother's disappearance that he got out of the commercial music business and moved to Pacific Grove, where he got a job as an elementary and junior high school music teacher in the Pacific Grove Unified School District. 

""""I first met Herb when I was in fourth grade and became a beginning trumpet student of his. Herb's son, John, ( -John Arthur Miller, who today still leads the Herb Miller Orchestra in England), was my best friend in grammar school. Herb was a very talented music teacher, gruff but fair, and the kids all loved him. He also was the leader of the Monterey Civic Band, to which most of us Herb Miller Orchestra members belonged. (NB: Mr Lovejoy has advised that circa 2002, the orchestra was re-named the """"John Miller Orchestra"""".) 

""""Herb, for some reason, decided in the late 1950s to form his own band, and his own children were a part of it. John (known as 'Jackson') played bass and sang; Mary Luann, his eldest daughter, who went by 'Luann', also sang and played piano; Richard 'Richie' Miller, his younger son, played trumpet; and Janet, or 'Jannie,' his youngest child, sang. His wife, Ann, was band manager. Some of the rest of us were his former students who were still in high school or had recently graduated; other members were area teachers. One of his trumpet players, Tony Venza (whose playing sounded like Harry James), drove a moving van for a living. 

""""Initially, Herb was quite ambivalent about using his brother's fame to boost his own image. He actually used to claim that his band and Glenn's were not at all alike. But, in fact, they were almost identical. Herb looked and talked like Glenn ('And now, something a little old, new, borrowed and blue...'), although he was shorter in stature. He played Glenn's most famous songs, and his own arrangements sounded just like Glenn's. The only difference was that he used only two trombones instead of four, as Glenn did. 

""""The first record Herb made was called 'First Steps Of A New Miller' on the Millertone label. It was a failure, of course, since he paid for it out of his own pocket, and distribution was limited. And, of course, even in the 1950s-'60s, his music was dated. He thought it was because of rock and roll, which he fervently believed was a communist plot. He reasoned that the communists introduced rock and roll into American culture in order to put 'legitimate' musicians out of work and thereby ruin the American economy. 

""""Herb had a few other idiosyncrasies, too. For instance, when people found out he was Glenn's brother, they would inevitably mention Glenn's death. Herb would explode, 'Glenn's not dead! Don't ever say that again!' Later, a few years after he'd started his own band, he seemed to have accepted his brother's death. That's when he started drinking and when he started trading on his brother's name. 

""""After moving to England, he really went overboard on comparing himself to Glenn. He even had a poster made up with him posing exactly like the famous picture of Glenn, holding a trombone and looking over his shoulder. This was kind of strange because Herb's main instrument was the trumpet. 

""""Herb was one of the most intense and driven people I've ever known. And, he was",0

 Sorry that you feel this way, Malangali. I don't suppose that I can persuade you, but I did try and do my homework. Iringa is not offically designated a city at present (unlike Mwanza, Dar and Arusha); you asserted this in the article, but it is simply factually incorrect. A seperate question is whether Iringa can be referred to as a city outside of the Tz government's definition. OK. First, I assure you that """"urban"""" can imply either town or city, particularly when contrasted with """"rural"""": see urban area. I checked two English language travel guides for Tanzania, both of whom use """"town"""".

Are you the one deleting this chunk that I've added to the Global Warming article?

While some skeptics of Global Warming declare that Global Warming is a hoax in its entirety, some who admit that the global temperature is rising argue that it is not attributable to man, and that it is a natural phenomenon.  One argument for this theory is that a simultaneous phenomenon is happening on the planet Mars, Mars Hints at Solar, not Human, Cause for Warming, Scientists Say, by Kate Ravilious, 2/28/07, National Geographic via nationalgeographic.com.  which suggests that Global Warming may not be limited to the only planet where human interaction could have influence.
In addition, while Venus is the token example of an Earth-like planet globally warmed by excessive C02 in the atmosphere, there is no man-made industrialism or other sources of greenhouse emissions present on Venus.

 A request... 

Just completed the latest lesson for the VC.  Would you proofread/edit it please?

BTW, I've looked over your contributions again.  Your participation in deletion debates is good.

The main objection in your RfA was """"Lack of policy experience"""".  The basic reasoning is, that it is impossible for avid editors to read pages without editing them, so if you've read the policies and guidelines, that would show up in your contributions.  On guidelines you can generally make minor changes directly to the guidelines themselves.  With policies, unless it is fixing grammar or typos, you pretty much need to post the edits you want to make to the talk page for approval - but that becomes habit after you get used to it.  So my advice is that you start proofreading the P&G;'s, and see where that takes you.  I see David Fuchs has prepared a nomination for you.  Before you accept another nom, you should probably get in around 1000 meaningful edits to policy and guidelines pages and their respective talk pages, and about 500 edits in dispute resolution RFCs, s, some mediation, etc.  Then ask '''''""",0

 I heard you like hamburgers. 

  The Hamburglar is a McDonaldland character who features in McDonald's commercials. He is a close friend of Ronald McDonald, Grimace, and Birdie. Even though he has always attempted (and failed) to hoard all the hamburgers in McDonaldland for himself, he has always been looked upon as a valued member of the McDonaldland community.

History
Despite a few changes made to his appearance over the years, he has always been endearingly loved by fans all over the world. A pint-sized burglar who first appeared in March 1971 and was one of the first villains on the commercials. He was dressed in a black-and-white hooped shirt and pants, a red cape, a wide-brimmed hat, and red gloves. His primary object of theft was hamburgers, hence his name. The character, like Grimace, started out as a villain, only he was old, had a long nose, gray hair, and was called the Lone Jogger in some 1970s commercials, sporting a shirt that said """"Lone Jogger"""". Hamburglar spoke in gibberish which was often translated by Captain Crook.

He was revised in 1985, when his look changed from a trollish old man to a red-head Dennis the Menace-type child who spoke and wore a shorter-brimmed hat and a black cape with yellow on the inside. His previously-unintelligible muttering was now the familiar """"robble robble."""" In """"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald,"""" he took on a new, sporty appearance wearing green goggles, a leather jacket, striped shirt, shorts and sneakers. He loved playing tricks on his friends and still loved burgers. The last appearances of Hamburglar on television were prime time commercials promoting the dollar menu. Hamburglar was voiced by Howard Morris in most commercials, Charlie Adler in some 1980s commercials and """"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald""""; and Carl W. Wolfe in some 1990s commercials.
Hamburglar 2015
In 2015, new images were released by McDonald's depicting the Hamburglar as a grown man wearing a fedora, a macintosh jacket atop a black-and-white t shirt, with black jeans and with high-top sneakers. He still has a mask, but his face now also sports a good half-inch of designer stubble. The character will be in commercials for the first time since 2002.   """,0
"""

You are spot on Leladax. Some with a strong FYROM POV around here argue that 'Republic of Macedonia' is the only official name in use and wish to lock it in at Wikipedia.

While true many nations and NGO's have chosen in the interim to use """"Republic of Macedonia""""... all nations in principle agree to honour whatever name FYROM/Greece can hammer out. When it comes to Wikipedia itself all names should be used if NPOV was actually being observed... especially since the dispute is still ongoing.  Many countries around the world still officially use FYROM (including even the US which still uses both names at times (the US Senate resolution last year condemning FYROM actually used the FYROM name).

What I really think is missing from the article is that technically speaking FYROM is currently in breach of at least a few of its original UN brokered terms with Greece. (This incidentally is exactly why I the why the US government passed the resolution last year condemning FYROM for breaking terms,  why the Greek government vetoed FYROM's  recent attempt at NATO membership, , and why it will probably veto EU membership as well.)

Agreement Violation #1: FYROM was supposed to stick to FYROM for external use

FYROM citizens are now trying to be recognized exclusively as """"Republic of Macedonia"""" even though in Article 7 of the original UN brokered agreement (which their own leaders signed) specifically states

""""the Party of the First Part reserves the right to object to any membership referred to above if and to the extent of the Party of the Second Part is to be referred to in such organization or institution differently than in paragraph 2 of the United Nations Security Council resolution 817 (1993). (which is still be FYROM I believe)

Agreement Violation #2:: Refrain from propaganda against Greek cultural heritage and territory

Article 7 and 11 of the UN agreement between Greece and FYROM state:.

""""Each Party shall promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by State-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility against each other.

If either Party believes one or more symbols constituting part of its historic or cultural patrimony is being used by the other Party, it shall bring such alleged use to the attention of the other Party, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action or indicate why it does not consider it necessary to do so.

The article should probably include a few real world examples to show the complaints are very real. I myself recently heard someone from FYROM claim Aristotle was actually Slavic on a forum but there are literally thousands of examples of irredentist behavior to be found. (a small subset of some recent examples that seemed relevant, verifiable and seemingly demonstrate the argument beyond the abstract) 

There exists a steady stream of FYROM supporters on the Alexander_the_Great article history page claiming Alexander wasn't Greek.  

Top ranked FYROM websites  almost universally are writing revisionist histories that suggest Alexander was not Greek  (quote taken from the website)
""""Contrary to modern Greek claims, Macedonia was never part of Greece, and the ancient Macedonians were not regarded as ancient Greeks.""""

Current FYROM Prime Minister welcomes Pakistan “Macedonian” Prince Ghazanfar  and uses it as """"proof"""" of their ancient Macedonian roots. That one really made me cringe considering not so long ago everyone was being assured by FYROM leadership...

'""""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.""""' Kiro Gligorov (FYROM's first President)

'""""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are a Slav people and our language is closely related to Bulgarian... There is some confusion about the identity of the people of our country""""'. Gyordan Veselinov  (Canadian ambassador to Canada in interview to Ottawa Citizen in 1999)

(incidentally both quotes appear extremely relevant to the article. I tried to add them myself to the article but they were removed without justification. You are welcome to try.)

"From User talk:Mathbot/Feedback on the summary bot:
 I do put a summary in if I think of it, it's not something that's automatic to me.  I think most times if the changes were important to me I'd be more inclined to add a summary, if it was just minor corrections on things such as style, grammar, etc I didn't put anything in.  

 Forgive me for pointing this out to a long-time, respected Wikipedian, but edit summaries aren't for the contributing editor, they're for the folks reviewing edit histories, to help them skim over what happened when without laborious paging through each edit. It's far from perfect, but it can be a real time- and server-saver. (With all the maintenance work I do on Wikiquote, and to a lesser extent on WP, the lack of edit summaries has become a bête noire for me, so I'm happy to see Mathbot tackling this.) ~  (talk)",0

"""Why is it that a page that can garner such passionate attitudes, as they concern the treatment and consuming of animals, cannot stick to the subject matter?  Surely, even the most ardent supporter of animal rights can see that this is simply supposed to be a list of material facts about an aspect of human behavior that has existed in one form or another since the dawn of time?  There are many other places on Wikipedia where they can read and contribute their individual viewpoints on the ethical, moral and practical points of animal consumption.  I do not wish to enter into personal attacks, and will not on an individual level, but there seem to be quite a few people who are either too stupid or too self-centered to leave their personal opinions out of an encyclopedia article.  Can anyone imagine opening a copy of an Encyclopedia Britannica to the """"Slaughterhouses"""" entry only to find a jumbled mess of a few verifiable facts mixed in with opinions and hysterical rants about how terrible are slaughterhouses and meat eaters?  Why can't these people understand that this is simply a webpage that is attempting to describe what is a slaughterhouse, what it does, where they operate, how they operate, and what types of animals they process?  There would be no opinions stating that slaughterhouses are wonderful, desirable places that exist for the pleasure of some sadistic monsters who kill simply for the pleasure of it.  Likewise, there will not be any sections condemning slaughterhouses and all people who either work there or utilize the products that are produced in such a place.  This article, once completed satisfactorily, will simply be a repository of verifiable facts about slaughterhouses, their genesis, their necessity (as it stands right now in our modern world), and their operating procedures.  Yes, there will be facts about the historical conditions, including, I am sure, mention of Upton Sinclair's """"The Jungle.""""  Also, there will most likely be a small section that notes these vegetarians' and vegans' attitudes and activities concerning slaughterhouses.  In this aforementioned small section, I can imagine that there will be external links leading to Wikipedia pages that support these vegetarians' and vegans' points of view.  Now, what is wrong with that?  A place for everything, and everything in its place?  Oh, and if you are still confused about what is a fact and what is an opinion, an """"opinion"""" is explained in detail on a (what else?) Wikipedia page residing here: """"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion,"""" and it says something like this, for starters: """"1. An opinion is a subjective statement or thought about an issue or topic, and is the result of emotion or interpretation of facts...""""  NOW do you see the difference?  Please say, """"Yes!"""" so that we may move on to more productive pursuits.  I have to admit that all of the extremely emotional opinions and diatribes are exhausting me, so CUT IT OUT!  Please?

Here is the original Arabic text from Ibn Baz's official website 

""""وبلغ أمير الأحساء وتوابعها من بني خالد سليمان ابن عريعر الخالدي أمر الشيخ، وأنه يدعو إلى الله، وأنه يهدم القباب، وأنه يقيم الحدود، فعظم على هذا البدوي أمر الشيخ، لأن من عادة البادية -إلا من هدى الله- الإقدام على الظلم، وسفك الدماء، ونهب الأموال، وانتهاك الحرمات، فخاف أن هذا الشيخ يعظم أمره، ويزيل سلطان الأمير البدوي، فكتب إلى عثمان يتوعده، ويأمره أن يقتل هذا المطوع الذي عنده في العيينة، وقال: إن المطوع الذي عندكم بلغنا عنه كذا، وكذا!! فإما أن تقتله، وإما أن نقطع عنك خراجك الذي عندنا.!! وكان عنده للأمير عثمان خراج من الذهب، فعظم على عثمان أمر هذا الأمير، وخاف إن عصاه أن يقطع عنه خراجه أو يحاربه""""

And this is how it translates (punch it into an automatated translator or show it to a friend if you don't believe it):

""""And news of the Shaikh reached the emir of al-Ahsa and its dependencies from Bani Khalid, Sulaiman ibn 'Uray;ir al-Khaldi, and it came to his knowledge that he called to God, and that he brought down the domes, and that he instituted the hudud [punishments], and so the matter of the Shaikh disturbed this bedouin, for it is the habit of the bedouin - except those whom God has guided - to rush to commit injustice, bloodshed, expropriation, and violation of prohibitions, so he feared that the power of this Shaikh may increase and do away with the power of the bedouin prince.  And so he wrote to Uthman, threatening him, and ordered him that he must kill this mutawwa that is with him at 'Uyayna, and said: 'this mutawwa that is with you, such and such has come to our knowledge about him!!  Either you kill him, or we cut off the dividend that you have with us', for the emir Uthman had [an annual] dividend of gold in the custody of [al-Khaldi].""""

 Kid Buu is The Strongest Form of Buu 

Kid Buu is the strongest and the original form of Majin Buu which is clearly stated by the Supreme or East Kaioshin which ever you prefer to call him. So please stop changing it saying he's the weakest of the forms he's clearly not the weakest form he beats up Goku, Vegeta, and Majin Buu at the same time. He doesn't even get tired matter of fact he gets bored and waits for Goku to get up and starts fighting him again.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Except, you know, Kid Buu is not the strongest form of Buu. The Kaioshin stated Kid Buu is Majin Buu's original form, and he's at his most DANGEROUS like this, not the most powerful. There are many, many instances that outright prove that Super Buu and his various forms are more powerful than Kid Buu. 

Saying he beats up Goku, Vegeta and the weakest form of Majin Buu at the same time is hardly proof that Kid Buu is strongest. ANY version of Majin Buu save for possibly Fat Buu could have done that easily. In fact, Goku outright states that if he and Vegeta were to fight Super Buu while at their most powerful, they would die. Yet, when Buu reverted back to his original """"Kid Buu"""" form, they were no longer worried, and Goku KNEW he could defeat him on his own.

Hell, he and Vegeta even played rock, paper, scissors in order to decide who wiould fight him first. That's how unafraid they were. 

Look, just because you like Kid Buu best doesn't mean he's the strongest. It was stated that Kid Buu is the most unpredicatable, violent and wild of all the forms. Why isn't that good enough for you?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 74.245.133.209   

Sorry but I don't do favortism I tell it like it is. I took he time to watch the entire Kid Buu saga and he is clearly the strongest form. If you would take the time and recall Goku begged Kid Buu to stong with his death ball attack and Kid Buu smiled because he knew Goku couldn't stop it. This just begins the fact that Goku couldn't beat Kid Buu by himself if he could have he would have turned Super Saiyan 3 and gave it his all to stop Kid Buu from blowing up the Earth. Also he even forced Goku to lose his Super Saiyan 3 transformation which caused Vegeta to step in and fight. He also caught the spirit bomb which had Gohan's, and all the other Z fighters including all the people of Earth and the Namekians. No matter how crazy you are if you can't deal with power it will overcome u which was not the case with Kid Buu he took is seriously and started pushing the bomb back. He would have succeeded if there had not been 1 wish left and Goku would have possibly been killed. So how about you watch over and over again and realize that Kid Buu is the strongest form, crazy doesn't give you the ability to beat people up it just means that you have no rationale which he doesn't have but no matter how crazy you are if you don't have the power than you can't dish it out.

 On recent edits regarding English section 

I have reverted some edits by Capnprep.  I'll address a few of his concerns:

1.  Do as aspectual auxiliary.  This is the only function of DO as an auxiliary verb and is its primary function within the language.  The non-durational aspects in English (everything not progressive/continuous aspects) are marked by the aspectual auxiliary DO followed by its subordinate in bare form.  English has two aspectual auxiliaries, DO & BE.

2.  Do is not a modal auxiliary.  It does not express emphasis / emphatic mood.  Rather, DO when used as an aspectual auxiliary may be emphasized just like any other word in a sentence.  There is no emphatic modal auxiliary in English.  English simply uses vocal stress (or in type, boldface or ALL CAPS) to emphasize the desired element.

3.  Perfection / perfecting auxiliary is valid.  Perfect is not an aspect but rather a verb in any aspect may be perfected.  Perfection is a grammatical category used to express completeness of a verb.

4. I have changed the repeated phrasing """"Most auxiliaries"""" / """"Most modals"""" to ...some... because this sort of generalisation is simply untrue and unfounded.  If anything, of the modal auxiliaries, those that subordinate to infinitive form are at best in approximately 50% distribution to those that do not.

5.  In the discussion of the various forms following make, I have once again removed the claim for passive voice.  That usage is not in passive voice at all as BE is not acting as a vocal auxiliary but rather BE+MADE is acting as a single unit forming a modal auxiliary.  Whereas MAKE as a modal auxiliary conveys internal force and subordinates to bare form, BE+MADE expresses external force and subordinates to infinitive form.

6.  Within the section on defective verbs I have eliminated some poor and misleading examples while rewording others.  That section comes close to conflating infintives with infinitive form and as worded was misleading.

Please do not revert any of these changes without first addressing and resolving these points here on the talk page.  """,0

"Who is Obrides Wedding Dress & Evening Dress Factory

 Welcome to visit Obrides Wedding Dress & Evening Dress Factory.

A tag has been placed on Romeo Niram requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

There is no research that says that """"amount of intelligence"""" is distributed across the population in the same way as a normal distribution, but this is the way IQ-tests are made.
For example, if a small country suddenly gets a high influx of highly intelligent immigrants, suddenly more than 50% of the population would have an IQ of 100 or higher. But instead of changing the normal distribution, the next time when they standardize the IQ-test, they take a representative sample of 1000 or 10,000 inhabitants, and the ones that have an average intelligence get IQ 100, the 2% most intelligent people get IQ 130 or more; the 2% least intelligent people get IQ 70 or less.

Imagine finding an article in which every single word is wrong and you will imagine my pain at reading the current Martin Heidegger article. Nor am I the only one who thinks this. Please see the section immediately above this article. Or better yet, spend the next 24 hours reading the first sections of Sein und Zeit and you will see the ridiculousness of the article as it currently stands, which demonstrates no understanding of Heidegger, and leaves everyone who reads it dumber than  when they began and knowing less about everything. This is so atrocious that essentially the entire article as it stands needs to be deleted and began again. I have no more time for this.   

I tried to move the Dreyfus to the main article and now apparently all the material is destroyed. Do you have any comprehension of how bad this article currently is? One would have no idea that Heidegger was ever read anywhere outside of France from the current article. No summaries of Heidegger's important concepts are given. No understanding of any of Heidegger's ideas are conveyed. Since you have decided to destroy my work, you can keep your poor article, which reads as if it was machine-translated from a foreign language. You do not even let someone in the middle of working finish before you destroy their work. No wonder zero academics contribute to this site and your articles are so atrocious. Anyone who reads the article as it currently stands comes away knowing less about Heidegger than they did before because of all of the obvious distortions and gross inaccuracies. You have not even succesfully explained a single one of Heidegger's terms or concepts here, or why anyone should care who he is. This article is an embarassment indeed.

Even so, that does not imply that: Mexico could not possibly use any """"generous financial support"""" to buy the arms, ammunition, or other war supplies for the very reason that the U.S. was the only sizable arms manufacturer in the Americas. To make matters worse, Germany could not be counted on to supply Mexico with war supplies directly, as the British Royal Navy controlled the Atlantic shipping lanes.

As the editor 148.247.186.142 has pointed out, Mexico could buy weapons produced in Argentina, or use the Argentinian companies as intermediaries. Moreover, as the same editor also pointed out, the 75% of the fuel used by the British Royal Navy in 1917 was produced in Mexico. Hence, without fuel the British Royal Navy could not control the Atlantic shipping lanes at all. Actually, it is not a coincidence that the UK took Persia in the partition of the Ottoman empire of 1918, considering the fact that the Anglo-Persian oil company was founded there in 1908; and the UK had learnt the lesson: it is really dangerous to depend exclusively on the oil produced in only one foreign country. Well, they learnt the lesson until the oil crisis of 1973. Finally, let us also recall that the US made plans in 1917-1918 for invading Mexico and taking control of Tampico oil fields, but the US also calculated that Mexicans would set in fire the oil fields before they could arrive there; the classical scorched earth technique applied by the Russians against Napoleon and Hitler.

In my opinion, you're confusing different policies. You say that everything you write there is sourced; for the sake of the argument, I shan't dispute that (even though a very good point is raised there, regarding the difference between sourced and attributed). However, sourcing is required to comply with Wikipedia's policy on verifiability. Soapboxing, advocating and giving undue weight, on the contrary, are not permitted under Wikipedia's policy on neutrality. So, even if everything you state there is sourced, it still can't be included if it violates WP:NPOV.
It's not a matter of not liking what sources have to say; it's just that they are only opinions. I don't think criticism should be hidden or Amanda's guilt taken for granted. Actually, I don't even know if she did it, because, quite frankly, I never studied the case, but I'm convinced that if a Court of law convicted her, there must have been sufficient evidence to warrant that. Italy's not Soviet Russia... My point is that the article shouldn't mainly revolve around criticism of the trial or attempts at soiling Guede's reputation, by implying that he was a lone killer, as that, primarily, violates WP:BLP. Wikipedia is not there to retry Amanda. As I've said, I agree that criticism should be reported; it is notable and rather easily sourced. However, that should not be the focus of the article.

Is it me or is a substantial amount of this article simply a series of criticisms of Ms Nash, presumably by a constituent with unrealistic expectations?

I'm not going to charge in and remove all of this information as I don't have much context about her but I am concerned about the general quality and neutrality of the material in this article.

Elen, thank you for proving my point.  Meant seriously in saying so.  And no, I am not finished.

1, if Wikipedia is not a publisher of THE TRUTH (TM), it cannot then call itself an encyclopedia (Pillar #1).  It can, at best, and using your own definition here, Elen, be a publicly-accepted repository of publicly-accepted """"facts"""" accepted by the public.  I said that three times to make a point.  The repository is only made by publicly-accepted parties, the facts are also only those the collective shall accept, and the amount of verification is similar.

I point to the Wrestlemania XXVIII dispute.  This user has decided to use wikia-level """"evidence"""", but, since the public has accepted his stand, I am not allowed to challenge it.  And he's lying on top of it!  And if that, and other places I've attempted to edit, are any indication, this kind of conduct probably goes on all over the site!

The problem with the """"sports organization"""" (the BCS case) is that if that organization has removed the valid sanction of an event, then it creates an inconsistency between verifiability and damnatio memoriae.  If Wikipedia fancies itself an encyclopedia, then, it grants a sanction which no longer exists  in fact, it basically grants a status of """"fact"""" to something now ruled complete fiction due to the misconduct of one of the teams involved!  (And solely because the public accepts it.)  The problem comes in that Wikipedia, as an encyclopedia (and I will call this site on that again and again), grants a statement of """"fact"""" on something which is now fiction, because the public has decided that the event, since it physically took place, cannot be reversed, even if all evidence points to the fact that it should've been.

(And, yes, I will find the same farcical situation in many sports articles.)

And if I must find a """"published fact"""" for something, then personal knowledge becomes irrelevant to the process.  (The Final Fantasy case.)  If we are not going to trust the general public to do research (WP:OR), how do we trust the general public not to manipulate the """"published facts"""" (which see Mania XXVIII)?  Personally, speaking generally, I don't trust most members of the public (far beyond Wikipedia) to spell """"CAT"""" if they are spotted the """"C"""" and the """"A"""".  How am I going to trust them with a public repository of the """"facts"""" when they get to determine what is """"fact"""" and who gets to post it?  (Throwing out Pillar #2)

Ah, needs to be something the lawyer has signed.  I assert that hasn't happened in Cena-Rock, myself.  (One of my (ignored) claims was that the level of """"promo"""" of that match is the same as the level of promo in the Daniel Bryan intended-cash-in!)

And in stating """"These are some of our rules"""", you openly abdicate Pillar #5 by your own statement.  The choice is yours, not mine, because the public apparently gets to determine everything in Wikipedia as I said above.  How can I carry on an intelligent and informed conversation with someone like ChristianandJericho, who basically does not know proper English and chooses to type like a 12 year-old girl into a cellphone?  He probably doesn't even understand what I'm saying to him, frankly!  And how can I come to a consensus with a group of people like-minded to that?

At minimum, it's going to take a TBAN on pro wrestling and at least two IBANs on the two other users, for starters.  I can probably come up with at least a PBAN on a celebrity for a prosecuted 1998 criminal threat on top of it without even taking initial action on the page!    """,0

 Analysts concluded that Georgian Buk missile systems were responsible for downing four Russian aircraft—three Sukhoi Su-25 close air support aircraft and a Tupolev Tu-22M strategic bomber—in the 2008 South Ossetia war. U.S. officials have said Georgia's SA-11 Buk-1M was certainly the cause of the Tu-22M's loss and contributed to the losses of the three Su-25s.Georgian Military Folds Under Russian Attack By David A.

 Hyperactivity and Neural Development - Censorship 

Two recent studies indicate problems in hyperactivity and neural development of children.

Yeah, so I add two interesting and important new, relevant references to an article which indicates potential harm to pregnant women on the Paracetamol page. These are removed because you guys don't like primary sources? This is ridiculous and frankly an extreme case of what is wrong with Wikipedia. My wife is pregnant. I for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. I would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the """"first do no harm"""" idea. The fact that you Wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. I've continued to run into this kind of thing. You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place. The fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply.   """,0

What bothers me the most is your refusal to consider my point. I never said you don't use the quran. I said you're not an arabic speaker. If you were you'd realize that the tafaseer do not see this as an eclipse, nor does Yusuf Ali's translation match the arabic text. there is neither """"engulfed"""" or """"buried"""" or even """"darkness"""" in the verse in question. There is only the verb khasafa, which means darkened. That's where the word for eclipse comes from """"khosoof"""". The classical interpreters' work is good enough for me. None have suggested it's an eclipse, as i've pointed out in our discussion. As to the charge of personal attacks - I reject it. I said you're neither an arabic speaker nor a muslim. I may be wrong about the latter, but it's obvious you're relying on yusuf ali's translation rather than the original text. I've also said you're vandalizing the page I started, and violating its intent and philosophy. The reason I say this is that you insist on adding your view to the main body of the article before we've settled it first in the discussion page. Now that's vandalism. And I'm more than happy to let the admins settle this between us.

"Dimitri & Nina 

Well, thank you so much for your reply. I hoped you would! About six months ago I noticed how badly ballroom dancing in general was being treated on WP, and decided to do something about it. I had been taught dancing by someone who had taken tuition in the latin dances from Pierre & Lavelle, so I knew their names from being a teenager in the 1950s. I wish now I had taken the trouble to meet them, but I didn't. Since I'm something of an expert on Cuban music I decided to start with the group of dancers who started LA dancing in England, from where it has spread all over the world. 

I soon discovered the lack of reliable reference sources was the main problem. I kept seeing references to Pierre, but it was ages before I had enough to put up the page on WP. I still don't have enough for Lavelle. With difficult cases I start a Word file offline. Anything on WP gets copied by bots and plagiarised widely. Even these personal pages.

I've got copies of all the books written about LA dances at that time, including both Dimitri's books and Pierre's book. I don't know where you are, of course, but if you are somewhere in England, we might arrange to meet, and you could have a look at the books. It sounds as though you don't have a copy of his first book.

Avoidant vandalism Removing {{afd}},  and other related tags in order to conceal deletion candidates or avert deletion of such articles. Note that this is often mistakenly done by new users who are unfamiliar with *fD procedures and such users should be given the benefit of the doubt and pointed to the proper page to discuss the issue.
Changing people's comments Editing signed comments by another user to substantially change their meaning (e.g. turning someone's vote around), except when removing a personal attack (which is somewhat controversial in and of itself).  Signifying that a comment is unsigned is an exception. e.g. (unsigned comment from user)

Talk page vandalism Deleting the comments of other users from article Talk pages, aside from removal of internal spam, or deleting entire sections of talk pages, is generally considered vandalism. Removing personal attacks is often considered legitimate, and it is considered acceptable to archive an overly long Talk page to a separate file and then remove the text from the main Talk page.  The above does not apply to the user's own Talk page, where users generally are permitted to remove and archive comments at their discretion, except in cases of legitimate warnings, which they are generally prohibited from removing, especially where the intention of the removal is to mislead other editors.

Many people, even famous ones, say many things, much of it nonsense. That does not mean their nonsense should be given credibility in the Wikipedia. 

Comparing a movement to Lysenkoism implies that it contradicts the scientific consensus but has state or politically connected support. The enviromentalism that Crichton criticises indeed does have the support of most states and politicians, but it is also the scientific consensus. If anything Crichton is the one who can be compared to Lysenko. His anti-environmental views contradict the scientific consensus and in this he has the support of many top politicians in the US, possibly even the current President. Frankly though, making analogies with Lysenkoism  should be done sparingly. Lysenkoism was a dreadful period for many people living in the former USSR. Only the worst excesses of state-supported pseudo-science should be compared to it. (Nathan Geffen)

"Block 

I have just been blocked by user FeloniousMonk for issues surrounding the entry on Christopher Michael Langan. This entry has been fraught for some months, but my contribution has been confined to the last week or so.

I acted several days ago on a longstanding request by the subject of the entry to remove what he considers a potentially libelous section of the entry. User Jimbo Wales judged the section to be blatant original research and deleted the section. This followed many months in which several editors, including FeloniousMonk, refused to see any problem with the section. Some editors were needless to say displeased with this correct decision by Mr Wales, and argued against it, although they did not try to re-place the deleted section.

I have provided extensive arguments on various other content issues to do with the entry. Progress was being made toward improving the article, but some users whom I consider clearly biased against the subject of the entry, had difficulty accepting these arguments. Other editors agreed with my arguments, which were extensively but politely put. Some editors changed their position on some issues, such as the issue of whether to include certain links, which user Arthur Rubin originally opposed the inclusion of (deleting them with little reason given), later acknowledging that inclusion of the links was legitimate.

FeloniousMonk is an editor involved with the entry, and he is blocking for reasons of a content dispute. This is in violation of policy. In addition, he has not provided any arguments why my edits are sanctionable. I do not believe there was a problem with my edits, the vast majority of which were confined to the talk page of the entry, and I would ask any administrator to examine my record. My userpage contains some links at the bottom to recent important edits in relation to this entry, including many by myself.

Some users implied that I was in fact a sock-puppet for the subject of the entry. I realised just before this block was placed that a checkuser request was conducted a couple of days ago that showed I was unrelated to Langan. I in fact live outside the United States, do not know the subject, am not a proponent of his ideas, and am not a proponent of intelligent design. I have stated this previously on several occasions. A link to the checkuser request is located at the bottom of my user page.

This block is a clear violation of policy by an administrator, and an abuse of power.",0

This article was formerly listed as a good article, but was removed from the listing because there aren't any references.  Otherwise it's great.   

I used entirely on-line sources when I wrote the article. Since I have a bit of a bias against that, I labeled the section external links.

 """"No animal is safe, even big cats

In the long run, though, you'll find that the WikiSyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. Here are a few links to get you started:

How to edit a page
Editing, policy, conduct, and structure tutorial
Picture tutorial
How to write a great article

There are a lot of policies and guides to read, but I highly recommend reading over those first. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a message on my talk page. Please be sure to sign your name on Talk Pages using four tildes (~~~~) to produce your name and the current date, along with a link to your user page. This way, others know when you left a message and how to find you. It's easier than having to type out your name, right? )

I hope you enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. We can use all the help we can get! Have a nice day.

Here is an excerpt of one of Duncharris's abusive messages to my userpage.  You can check my userpage log history or duncharris's userpage where I reiterated it back to him.  It wasn't the first.

Here it is:

""""Look mate, I can respect you for not losing your rag. Now, I'm fairly clueless about this whole matter, but having dealt with a lot of creationist nonsense, I think the nonsense threshold of fundies is low.""""

PBS - Why do you continue to insist the onus is on me to demonstrate/provide proof that the definition for the terms are different?  You are suggesting a change here.  The onus is on you to demostrate/prove the terms are the same.  
 I do understand your point.  I do accept that often times """"military occupation"""" and """"occupied territories"""" are terms that go hand-in-hand.

If you can find for me some source stating that """"all occupied territories involve military occupation"""" and """"all military occupations create occupied territories"""" I'll join your effort.

  Re Article 6 of GCIV - Again, I think perhaps you are being a little to legalistic regarding your definitions.  Remember that terms like """"Murder""""/""""execution""""/""""occupied territory""""/""""crime against humanity"""" have legal definitions, and definitions in the popular psychi defined outside law.  Starting from a legalistic definition is a good idea, but we shouldn't be entirely focused on that definition.  I think a useful way to go about looking at the popular psychi is by examining news articles, and seeing how they treat the terms.
 Shuki -  Consensus on something that is not verifiable is simply the majority of 'seems to me'.  I think you realize that in discussing definitions of terminology WP:V is often difficult/impossible.  Furthermore, I'm simply stating the opinion that """"It seems to me the terms are different."""" and asking PBS to verify otherwise. I think the only option here will ultimately be to seek consensus.

 Ragusa- Dubrovnik- has never been in Italy!
This article's statement in the part of """"Maratime Republics"""" claiming that Ragusa was in Italy and therefore implying that it was an Italian republic is clearly a mistake.
One just needs to go into the Sponza palace, the Ragusian state archive in Dubrovnik and see any of the official documents. The laws regarding inner policy are clearly stated in Croatian: Those regarding foreign policy are written both in Croatian and Italian. All of the ruling families of Ragusa from Sorkocevic to Gucetic to Restic etc were Croatian. The greatest Ragusian poet and writer Ivan Gundulic, an aristocrat and one of the rulers, famous for his book """"Suze sina razmetnoga"""", was one of the greatest Croatian nationalists.  Source: """"Dubrovnik, a history"""", written by Robin Harris 2006.
According to the Robert Harris book Malta was independent until 1808 when Napoleon annexed it. According to Harris Dubrovnik with it's fleet of 700.000 tons (surpassing Venice in 1660) was the main hated rival of Venice in the Adriatic and always resisted the invasion plans of Venice. The last Venitian rector was sent home packing- politely but firmly- in 1351. According to Harris the recto packed his belongings in a hurry.

Some reflections  on this issue are necessary

First, it is necessary a reflection on the very concepts of Nation and State as these two terms are commonly considered near-synonyms and therefore used interchangeably. They have, instead different meanings. The term Italy refers to booth meanings. Italy as State was born in XIX cent, but Italy as Natiom is much older. Almost true, Ragusa never belonged to Italy-State except the Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy (1808-1809), but was seen for some centuries a part of Italy-Nation in the beginning of its birth process. Today Ragusa/Dubrovink, as well as Split and other Dalmatian towns, are out of Italy-State and out of Italy-Nation as well, they belong both to Croatia-Nation and to Croatia-State. On the other hand Lugano (Switzerland) and San Marino (independent republic) are out of Italy-State and still part of Italy-Nation. I suggest the book: L. TOMAZ, """"Il confine d'Italia in Istria e Dalmazia. Duemila anni di storia"""" and the SSRN working paper: ARNALDO MAURI, Historical, Geopolitical and Economic Factors affecting State and Nation Boundaries: Foreword on Italy's Borders in Istria and Dalmatia.,  Of course, Ragusa as port city had a multiethnic population: besides Italians also Croats, Vlachs, Serbs, Albanians. Similar situations could be found in Istanbul, Alexandria, Izmir, Odessa. To be the birthplace of poets or outstanding men is insignificant. Tommaseo was born in Dalmatia, as many other great Italians, Garibaldi and Massena were born in Nice, the Greek poet Kavafis in Alexandria. Venice was rival of Ragusa, but was also rival of Genoa on the sea and of Milan on the mainland; also this point is insignificant to the discussion on Ragusa belonging to Italy-Nation in past centuries.87.9.19.187  

Romanians in 2007/2008

"This is the lead as it currently reads: Lance Edward Armstrong (born Lance Edward Gunderson, September 18, 1971) is an American former professional road racing cyclist and triathlete. He won the Tour de France seven consecutive times (1999-2005) but was stripped of those titles by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and banned from cycling in 2012.

We have basically two things to consider: whether this is factually correct and whether it provides the proper emphasis. I'd say that the first clause of the second sentence is at the very least misleading since 1) there is now a consensus in the world at large that Armstrong did not properly win the Tour de France ever and since 2), as far as official racing he is concerned, he did not win the Tour de France at all. It would be far more accurate to say that Armstrong was once considered to have won the Tour de France seven times. This state of affairs is very unlikely to change. As for emphasis, at this point Armstrong is more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else. As time passes this is bound to  intensify. Since it is now obvious that Armstrong achieved his original fame by cheating and committing fraud, there is no reason he should not be more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else.",0

 Example: Somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide, the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court, never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case.

 Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by the Nuremberg Tribunal.
 As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when:
 the commission of genocide is established by an international court and
 the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred
Is the commission of Armenian genocide established by an international court?   """,0

 It's really rather sad 

That I can ask an otherwise legitimate question on a talk page like this, but because one person does not like the way I phrased it, it is suddenly """"vandalism"""" and deleted completely.  If anything, you could say I was rude in the way I asked my question, but as far as I can tell, vandalism = intentionally disruptive edits, and, more importantly, edits to actual articles.  These talk pages are intended to talk, are they not?  The standards of writing something in an encyclopedic manner do not apply here.

At least from my understanding.

But even if they do, assuming that my post was solely created as a vandalism, when I was asking an otherwise legitimate question, is completely unnecessary.  Or are those policies such as """"WP:Assume Good Faith"""" or whatever all for show after all?  Seems very seldom that people actually do assume good faith around here.  They're just as happy to tag anything they don't like as vandalism, even more so if the person posting it isn't a regular.

I dunno, just a few observations.  I'll admit that I don't edit here often, so if I've somehow missed something that somehow changes the situation completely, feel free to let me know.

"""

Observation duly noted, with this response...

It isn't just that """"elements"""" of French's affidavit is based on other people's stories,  the fact is he swore that """"all facts and statements contained in this affidavit are true and correct.""""  And that included second and third-hand gossip about Kerry's military record in Vietnam.  This guy is  an officer of the court; I find it hard to believe he didn't know what he was doing. 

As to his claim about Kerry lying on MTP in 1971 about his unit being engaged in """"atrocities,"""" let's consider what Kerry actually said:

 SEN. KERRY: There are all kinds of atrocities, and I would have to say that, yes, yes, I committed the same kind of atrocities as thousands of other soldiers have committed in that  I took part in shootings in free fire zones. I conducted harassment and interdiction fire. I used 50 calibre machine guns, which we were granted and ordered to use, which were our only weapon against people. I took part in search and destroy missions, in the burning of villages.  All of this is contrary to the laws of warfare, all of this is contrary to the Geneva Conventions and all of this is ordered as a matter of written established policy by the government of the United States from the top down. And I believe that the men who designed these, the men who designed the free fire zone, the men who ordered us, the men who signed off the air raid strike areas, I think these men, by the letter of the law, the same letter of the law that tried Lieutenant Calley, are war criminals.   

Those sorts of things took place, and were documented as taking place - and in fact were mostly SOP. Even SBVT member William Garlow found  Hoffmann's tactics distasteful . French is not being truthful, or is at best being disingenuous if he simply doesn't think these things should be referred to as """"atrocities,"""" a term that Kerry was quite clear in qualifying. 

And compare French's description of Kerry's """"mutiny"""" remark with what he actually said:

 The fact of the matter is that the members of Coastal Division 11 and Coastal Division 13 when I was in Vietnam were fighting the policy very, very hard, to the point that many of the members were refusing to carry out orders on some of their missions; to the point where the crews started to in fact mutiny, say, """"I would not go back on the rivers again"""" ... 

A little different from claiming that he said """"crews at An Thoi were involved in amutiny,"""" isn't it?  We know for a fact that there was plenty of disgruntlement over SEALORDS policies (read Brinkley, for instance), and officers did refuse to carry out some of Hoffmann's orders .  Is Al French prepared to say no crewmembers ever refused to go back up certain rivers or on particularly foolhardy missions?  We know for a fact the lack of air support was so bad that RF/PF forces  refused to go on patrols without helicopter support.   French is knocking down his own strawman.

I think there's plenty to question in the other affidavits, especially Elliott's and Letson's, but again, I have no problem including them alongside all the other interviews and accountings in the reference section.   """,0

 Corm Capital SPEEDY Deletion 

Dear Darkwind (!),

This page is not unambiguously promotional and definitely does not deserve deletion! The page was NOT created by Corm Capital! That said, reading it and now that it has been created, its purpose is not about promoting Corm Capital but giving a different perspective on the company. Corm Capital is a company with over 1 billion USD in private funds and extremely well established in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA). Furthermore, S&P;/Bloomberg conducted in-depth research on the company, its subsidiaries and senior management before including it in its ultra-selective S&P; Capital IQ database (public link available at http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=238637949). And the list goes on and on...

Bottom line: Corm Capital is a company founded in 1998 with private funds over 1 billion USD and extremely well established in MENA. Having not created this page but having stumbled upon this deletion message, I strongly contest the deletion of this article on the grounds that Corm Capital DESERVES to have a Wikipedia page on it like so many other smaller, less interesting and less established companies that have one. If the content is the problem (I noticed that the description was a taken from our website), PLEASE allow my team some time to arrange it according to Wikipedia's guiding principles.

Also, please note that my grandfather's Wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Corm) has been online for years and has been visited by thousands if not millions of people (my grandfather is in most offline encyclopedias). I personally guard his page when """"incorrect"""" material is inserted in his Wikipedia page so I am well aware of Wikipedia's SPIRIT and GOVERNING PRINCIPLES.

Please trust my sincerity with regards to this deletion matter and please feel free to suggest steps you recommend I/Corm Capital take in order to avoid such an undeserved action (your warning page is impossible to understand!).

I have been a staunch supporter and promoter of Wikipedia for the last 10 years.

Once again, I urge you to remove your deletion of the Corm Capital page to give time to my team to write a """"Wikepdia friendly"""" page.

Kind personal regards,
Charles David Corm""",0

 Angels and Christian Angelic Hierarchy 

  Hey, you deleted my stuff because I didn't cite sources. But my claims were never """"scholars believe this"""" so I don't think I should have to cite anything.

 Demonising Turks 
It is obvious from certain Wikipedia articles that many people are using it as a vehicle to demonise Turks. Wherever possible articles derogatory to these people are being written, media and writings manipulated so that when a search is done of Google - only one version - a completely Christo-Armenia, Greek Othodox version can be found. It is seems that as in America, Armenian and Greek lobbying is alive and well here, too. What a shame that Jews, who found solace in the Turkish Ottoman Empire, while the rest of Europe was have progrom festivals have come on board, too. It seems that all that it needs to get the Jew and the gentile on the same wagon, is to beat the tired old donkey issue of the barbarious Turk. 

It wears thin.

 that's exactly it, i think.  it's a paradigm difference.  some people see creationism as morally and factually wrong because of their PARADIGM, and others see it as morally and factually right because of THEIR paradigm.  and they're throwing falsifiability and bias and everything else at each other ... but when it comes down to it, it's a PARADIGM difference.  At the same time, however, one, the other, or something else IS factually true.  And so what SCIENCE needs to do is keep as BROAD a paradigm as possible in allowing itself to go through the process of falsification.  A scientific community that ASSUMES Genesis is true will be limited in its ability to falsify itself ... because it will always say, """"well ... we just haven't figuredn out how to justify that assumption yet  but we will!""""  Similarly, a scientific community that ASSUMES God does not exist will say the same thing.  I think what science needs to do is take a position of NEUTRALITY regarding the hypotheses of a creator  and allow falsification to take its course.

 where this leads me is this.  the falsifiable assertions of evolution are: """"Evolution is false where there are clear and distinct boundaries between """"kinds,"""" across which macroevolution cannot occur"""" and """"evolution is false where life, by its very nature, can never arise from non-life.""""  In my opinion, IF the theory is falsified in that way, ID becomes the """"improved theory""""  because it takes ALL the contemporary evidence that is explained by evolution, AND explains abiogenesis and macroevolution  making it that new path integral formulation to F=ma.

However, ID requires the PARADIGM shift that there IS a creator.

What do you call everything you do FeloniousMonk? That is, if it's not a political campaign on your part, what is? The POV campaigning I see here is a radical left-wing campaign on your part. My only goal is to bring things into balance here on Wikipedia because most outsiders regard it as highly unreliable and biased. Why don't readers have the right to know the type of group CRESP is ideologically speaking and who they associate with?

What's the problem with showing the political biases of groups you support, say compared with your baseless accusation that people like Paul Weyrich or James Dobson want to impose Old Testament law upon the United States? I thought that if something was factual and verifiable, it was kosher. That's what you told me about TheocracyWatch. If Paul's a theocrat, then maybe you could find a first-hand reference of the kind I provided. Are you not aware that United for Peace and Justice was founded by the Communist Party USA and a number of Marxist groups, and according  to the Commmunist Party USA Web site Joelle Fishman an officer of the CPUSA is a member of the steering committee? Tell me, why are you so worried about people knowing that CRESP belongs to an organization populated by the Ruckus Society, CodePink and the Communist Party USA?
The vast majority of the UNFPJ's members are pretty extreme on the Left side of the spectrum. The important thing about UNFPJ is who founded it.
For me to a belong to a group on the right akin to the UNFPJ, it would be akin to belonging to a group founded or run by the Nazis. Are you afraid of the truth?

Deal with the substance here, not my personality, or your efforts to railroad me with a phony RfC signed by your friends. Let's stop applying the rules differently when they make you uncomfortable. 

Why is it poisoning the well to point out the fact CRESP is involved with a pretty radical group? Are you afraid of the truth? NPOV doesn't mean just FeloniousMonk's point of view. I'm for balance, and diversity of opinions, expressed fairly is a good idea, don't you think?

TheocracyWatch can't prove it's claims, but I can prove these.
 
There's nothing for me to learn from the RfC except some people are afraid of having their worldviews challenged, or from being restrained from pressing their anti-religious political agendas. If you don't like my """"POV campaigning,"""" then why do you do it yourself? 

What do you call your series of hit pieces on the Christian Right about the supposed threat of """"Dominionism,"""" if it's not POV campaigning? Why is it every article you have posted on politics or religion expresses a Left of center POV? If I missed one, show me. I guess that's not POV campaigning, right?

Just in case you hadn't noticed, 49 of the 50 states say God is the ultimate authority, and it's spelled out in their constitutions.

How is expressing a more neutral perspective that is closer to the center of the political spectrum a threat to Wikipedia? What makes your POV superior to mine?  """,0

 Needs references, balance 

Hello. I'd like to suggest some edits. I tried editing Wikipedia a long time ago and had a terrible experience, and I can't even remember the protocol since it's been so long, so I thought it'd be safer to post suggestions here and let someone else who's more in the know roll with them if they'd like to.

 The introduction states, """"The prescribing labels of some SSRIs note the possibility of 'intolerable' discontinuation reactions. Some patients have extreme difficulty discontinuing use of SSRI drugs.""""  Not only are these claims not referenced, but they're misleading, given that the vast majority of patients, if they experience this syndrome, do not find the reactions intolerable and don't have """"extreme difficulty"""" discontinuing. The introduction also says studies demonstrate """"statistically and clinically significant indications of difficulties with the discontinuing of SSRIs,"""" thus further espousing the difficulties of discontinuing SSRIs without balancing that with the fact that most people don't have major problems.

 In the history section, last paragraph, fluoxetine is said to have """"the highest number of drug dependence reports."""" The WHO site was down when I tried to check the reference, so I don't know what year that report was from or whether it really says people become dependent on fluoxetine (given that the quoted paragraph above this claim, from WHO, seems to dispute that notion), but to my understanding, it's generally accepted that people do not become dependent on antidepressants, in the way that the general public thinks of dependence.

 The controversy section is completely one-sided. Arguments from critics are explained in detail, but the other sides are not. There is no indication that these criticisms are from the minority or have evidence against them.

Overall, parts of this article seem misleading to me, and it concerns me because many myths and baseless fear mongering is out there about antidepressants already. People who are depressed deserve to know the facts, and to understand that these drugs are approved because the benefits far outweigh the risks, according to mainstream medicine. This is literally a life-or-death topic and must be handled in an unbiased manner. I'm obviously not arguing for side effects and concerns to be deleted. I'm urging for them to be presented appropriately, with the weight that most experts believe they actually carryno more and no less.""",0

The idea that one can distinguish the 'thesis' and 'theory' of intelligent design is puzzling. While I don't have access to Jones' Encyclopedia of Religion, there's an entry from 2003 (listed as 'forthcoming') on Dembski's list of writings on ID. Note that this is pre-Kitzmiller, and is typical of Dembski's writings of the time - Sagan, Paley and Kant. Assuming that this is substantially similar to the final version, there's nothing about thesis vs. theory.
Beyond this, John Carter appears to misunderstand the idea of """"theory"""". There are I think perhaps several other areas of what might be called """"theoretical biology,"""" such as parts of astrobiology, which also have a total lack of any hard evidence to indicate that they even have something real to study, in that case alien life. No. That's not what theoretical biology is. Take a look at the TOC of the Journal of Theoretical Biology. Or try Acta Biotheoretica. Or even check out the journal Astrobiology. Theory isn't about """"things that lack total evidence"""". 
This entire section about 'thesis' vs. 'theory' of intelligent design appears to be based on both a misunderstanding of what Dembski was saying (pre-Kitzmiller, when he was predicting the overthrow of """"materialistic"""" science and a department of ID at a major university within a decade) and a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference of what constitutes theoretical biology, and how it differs from unfounded speculation and science fiction.

"Energy certificates  It is assumed there is some reason why users continually refer to energy credit while it has been pointed out that this is a misnomer in regard to Technocracy ideas. 
Energy Accounting is a hypothetical system of distribution, which would record the Energy used to produce and distribute goods and services consumed by citizens in a Technate. The units of this accounting system would be known as Energy CertificatesThese would replace money in a Technate, but unlike traditional money or currencies, energy certificates could not be saved or earned, only distributed evenly among a populace. The amount of certificates given to each citizen would be calculated by determining the total productive capacity of the technate and dividing it equally. The Energy Certificates themselves would probably not have to be physically used by the populace, as the system would be computerised. In energy accounting the Technate would use information of Natural resources, industrial capacity and citizen’s purchasing habits to determine how much of any good or service was being consumed by the populace, so that it could match production with consumption.

The reason for the use of Energy Accounting serves to ensure the highest possible standard of living as well as equality among the Technate’s citizenry, as well as prohibit spending that is beyond the productive capacity of the technocracy.Energy Accounting An article on Energy Accounting as proposed by Technocracy Inc. Technocrats point out that energy accounting is not rationing; it is a way to distribute an abundance and track demand. Everyone would receive an equal, abundant (i.e. far more than they need), amount of energy certificates. Technocrats predict that at today's rates of energy conversion, no person will rationally be able to spend all their energy certificates.",0
"The Google search? No. It's not a reliable source, and comes more under the heading of original research. There are articles which use Google hits, frequency of Google searches, etc. to prove a point, but never as the sole source for something's notability. I don't think I can help you. I did do a Factiva search yesterday evening and came up with nothing. Whatever the Serbian editors say, highly-popular political songs do get newspaper coverage outside their country if they really are that notable, even if they're in a foreign language. Der Steuersong, for example, a satirical German song about ex-Chancellor Schröder (in German, with lots of untranslatable German puns), turns up 67 hits on Factiva. Germany may be richer, but then we were at war with Serbia, so I really do believe that someone would have taken notice if the song's notability was as high as is claimed. (talk)",0

Resolution Must be Made

I have been an observer of this article on Abbas Babei since the start of this conflict. I want to point out that we this issue needs to be solved otherwise both users will face blocks. Hooperag has offered a proposal that makes logical sense, Imagine this was the article of Barack Obama, we can't just say: """"Obama is notorious for his merciless treatment towards the minters of parliament who oppose his policies"""" (that's a totally random example, but whatever). It is more appropriate that if you wish to include a subjective statement like """"Babaei was """"notorious for his merciless treatment of the pilots and officers"""" considered disloyal to the new regime"""", you include some background info on who made that statement (add more context). The word """"merciless"""" is very subjective (opinion based) and if it is to be used you can't use it as if it was fact based, when you say """"Babaei was notorious for his merciless treatment of the pilots and officers"""" you are making a strong statement about him that makes it seem as if it is a 100% true fact that he was merciless.
 For these reasons I suggest we rephrase the sentence to be something along the lines of Hooperag's suggestion whish was to rephrase it something like this: """"According to the famous historian Tom Cooper whom interviewed various Iranian pilots, Abbas Babaei was considered """"merciless"""" in his treatment towards pilots disloyal to the new regime"""".

I wish to make it clear that I do not endorse any party, neither Hooperag nor the IP. However the proposal sounds reasonable and has been the only proposal to resolve this dispute so far.If this issue is not resolved with in the next 24 hours or so and the conflict continues, I will request to an admin that both users be blocked.134.39.77.59

My response: 

This is absolutely outrageous.  The ICC is virtually a home for torture: it is as bad as anything Mengeles thought up in the concentration camps: we're dealling with helpless children.  I have contacted the ICC in the past, and Columbia Presbyterian, and it was clear from my conversations with pediatric surgeons that staff there were ashamed of what they carried out: basically in vivo experiments which amounted to torture.

Wikipedia may have a neutral policy but the information you have inserted, and insisted on re-inserting, is wrong.  It may even lead to the death of more children by misleading people into believing the ICC is a safe home for children. It most certainly is not.  There were people such as yourself involved in the Inquisition and the SS!  You cannot defend a """"neutral"""" policy when it amounts to covering up the sadistic treatment of children.  You should be asbolutely ashamed of yourself.

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh",1

"As I understand it, a civilization as it continues to advance and reaches a certain point it is no longer broadcasting into open space (as we have been doing since the 1930s), and instead reaches a point where all telecommunications are directed from space-bound craft back to Earth (think about our cable and satellite TV and radio overtaking conventional broadcast TV and radio). A Dyson sphere is the ultimate form of this concept. So, basically it is important for our planet to intentionally broadcast these types of scientific messages, as our unintentional broadcasts become less prevalent. An advanced civilization out there should be theoretically as quiet as we were in the '20s and '30s. There's a small window of opportunity to get some thing from them. And they could have the same philosophy as Wnt and Stephen Hawking warn us about- be quiet and don't contact other peoples.

Mjpresson initiated the ANI proceedings and got other editors riled up so another editor took care of the formality of proposing a ban; check it out if you want to verify that.

Congratulations to Mjpresson on not being personally a cigarette smoker; neither were Nixon and Reagan who pursued the war against cannabis alias """"drugs"""" to benefit the cigarette industry; how does Mj administer hash without a one-hitter or a vaporizer?

Time running out on the anonymous Public Liebrewery computer forced me to stop 40 minutes ago, therefore the """"unsigned"""" incomplete message; to continue:

My conjecture (which I will be so bold as to share with you here) is that Mj's agenda includes:

 Using Wikipedia to promote the interests of the cigarette industry (through his advocacy in 44 detailed articles about the chain-smoking movie-maker José Mojica Marins whose main character Ze do Caixão (in English """"Coffin Joe"""" sound like Joe Camel?) commits serial murders for sex and personal vindication).  I personally couldn't smoke enough tobacco to stay awake sitting through 88 hours of those horror flicks.  To reference another BRIC country: a 2004-05 study showed 89% of all movies made in India contained depictions of """"tobacco use"""" (almost always cigarettes).

 Trying to remove from Wikipedia cannabis-related articles any information about possible Harm Reduction alternatives to hot burning overdose """"joint"""" smoking such as one-hitters, kiseru, midwakh etc. """"joint"""" and rolling papers are a handy Industry strategy to get children oriented to cigarette smoking.

 Trying to delete information that could serve as a warning against mixing cannabis with tobacco (for example, an edit deleting a reference in the hashish article to an Australian Department of Health study indicating that that practice could lead to unintended nicotine addiction (which is of course what cigarette companies want it to do).

This may explain why, in May 2010, Mjpresson nominated the One-hitter (smoking) article for deletion (reason: """"It's just a bad article."""") (vote: 4-1 for Keep).  By October 2010, after pictures of midwakh, kiseru etc. were added, the article ranked ninth in Category:Cannabis smoking with 1191 hits a day according to a rating survey.  This week, expecting to win the vote against Tokerdesigner at ANI, Mjpresson has deleted over 50% of the One-hitter (smoking) article, including pictures (all-important!) showing what a one-hitter is.

At ANI I have referenced the May 30, 2011 World Health Organization press release claiming that """"tobacco"""" (mainly cigarette smoking of course) will kill 6 million human beings in 2011, and scheduled to rise at present rates to 8 million a year by 2030; so if Mjpresson says Tokerdesigner is a """"single-purpose editor"""" at least you'll understand why.

So again, congratulations for opposing putting a picture of a """"joint"""" atop the [[Cannabis (smoking) article (especially without any warning that there may be tobacco mixed into it), but beware, you have doubtless attracted """"their"""" attention and Big 2WackGo may be after you.

 Note: beware of 3-R's, i.e. by simply reverting mJ'S edit three times you may violate a WP rule aimed at preventing edit wars; better strategy is to change something, add something different with each edit, trying to improve things each time in the interest of a positive solution.  Mj is a stickler for following the rules and will get you for that.  Though I consider him a stooge of the world's leading genocide-for-profit conspiracy I also recognize that Mj is talented and industrious and may do much good someday (after being """"forgiven on grounds of insanity"""").

 Try to find more pictures (make a JPG file and upload to Wiki Commons, I don't have that technology yet) which show better what a one-hitter is (quarter-inch or 6-mm screened crater for 25-mg single servings, instead of 500 mg in a joint every time you want a smoke! avoiding heat shock and carbon monoxide and dopy """"stoner"""" symptoms blamed on cannabis etc.)  Mj objects to the midwakh picture because it is traditionally used for tobacco, not cannabis, but he also deleted it from the one-hitter article where it was clearly described as used for tobacco.  The kiseru picture is a bit indistinct and doesn't show how narrow the crater is.  The major fear of the tobacco industry, even more than cannabis legalization, is the de facto legalization of harm reduction utensils which eliminate the need for high-profit cigarette papers.

 I have  read various pieces by Dr Mehdi Khaz'ali and listened to various  interviews with him, and must say that he comes over as a fantasist. He  just says things that some people badly want to hear, and that seems to  be the only thing that keeps him afloat in the media. Regarding Mr  Ahmadinejad not having served in the War, it is not true, but from a  technical point of view Mr Khaz'ali's story may contain some element of  truth. The fact is that Mr Ahmadinejad was not fighting as a regular  army soldier or officer, but was working party as a military logistic  engineer and partly as a military intelligence officer from behind  enemy's line. If my memory is not failing, during the War years he spent  some time in Kirkuk,  Iraq, amongst members of the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan or Kurdistan  Democratic Party of Iraq  - both groups  were fighting alongside Iran against Saddam Hossein. The fact that after  the War he, i.e. Mr Ahmadinejad, became the Deputy to Governor-General of Maku  and Khoy  (West Azarbaijan Province has a sizeable Kurdish  population), and later Advisor to Governor-General of Kurdistan,  have direct relationship to his War-time experience in Iraqi Kurdistan.  Thus, indeed Mr Mohsen Rezai may not have been technically wrong in  saying that Mr Ahmadinejad has not been """"at the front"""" (assuming that  indeed the alleged statement is due to Mr Rezai), but to say that Mr  Ahmadinejad has lied about his War efforts, is just a false and  defamatory statement. Let us assume for a moment that Mr Ahmadinejad has  lied about his War efforts. Is it at all conceivable that a young man  from Tehran would get so early on so high up in the highest  administrative offices of Maku, Khoy and Kurdistan, from all places? As I  said earlier, Mehdi Khaz'ali is just a fantasist who seems to believe  in his own fantasies (there are some videos on YouTube  in which he says things that no one in his position could possibly  know).

"Basically, Community de-Adminship - the community being allowed to put forward the de-sysoping (removal of system operator status) of an admin - in a kind of reverse of the way the admin was accepted (ie by community votes). The admin status and tools are removed. It's much needed symmetry that will automatically make all areas of Wikipedia more accountable in my opinion. Admins will no longer have emeritus status. It had the most support here, so people created Wikipedia_talk:Community_de-adminship/Draft_RfC. Previously, to remove a 'bad apple' a complaint had to be made at WP:RFC to get arbcoms attention. The CDA proposal is likely to be put through RFC to get attention too. It's more about removing bad apples though - it is something that will make admin think twice about the arrogant way they act. People will think twice about whether they want to be one. Bureaucrats will think twice about the judiciousness of their final decision to check for fairness/consensus (if it goes that way, and I think it it may have to).

 A message from the UN regarding this """"UN"""" geoscheme 

Dear Bart

Thank you for your email.

The geographical groupings used by the United Nations Statistics Division follow the M49 Standard for Area Codes for Statistical use, details of which can be found here: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm

The designations employed and the presentation of material at this site do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the Secretariat of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. The assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories by the United Nations.

""""Regions"""" are so drawn as to obtain greater homogeneity in sizes of population, demographic circumstances and accuracy of demographic statistics (another example is Russia  it is in the continent of Asia but it belongs in the Eastern Europe """"region"""").  This nomenclature is widely used in international statistics but it is by no means universal.

I hope this is useful.

Best regards,

The UN Demographic Yearbook Team. It seems the geoscheme, that was created for internal use of one UN  agency is being not only over-quoted on Wikipedia, but also abused.

There isn't really an easy way to do this. I generally use a combination of Illustrator CS and a text editor, and any knowledge on basic SVG specifications for basic types (such as default parameter values, so that certain data can be excluded). I used to use Inkscape, but it felt too clunky and produces really bloated SVG code—it is sad to say (since I support free software) that I really appreciate Illustrator, since it is slick and produces very clean SVG code. Certainly, Adobe authored the SVG specifications, so it is not surprising that Illustrator writes the best output (in my opinion). However, when opening SVG files in Illustrator that were originally saved in the Inscape SVG format, Illustrator will usually retain the """"sodipodi"""" metadata, which is specific only to that application (and Inkscape). I try to remove the sodipodi data using a text editor to keep the code to the standard SVG coding, then reopen/save in Illustrator. Another method is to save the figure as an Illustrator AI or PDF file, then reopen/save in Illustrator again to shed the sodipodi metadata. If this fails, and it is a simple circle, I redraw the object. Often I'll name objects, but remove """"Layer 1"""", since multiple layers are not needed for logos. If you can, find original artwork in PDF format, and simply open it up in Illustrator, and edit then save in SVG. This way you can avoid doing too much tweaking to get around Inkscape's annoyances. +t """,0

 Celine Dion Signings 

Please do not change Celine's signings in the infobox. The infobox should only pertain to signings and not imprints traced to the artist around the world. The reason why Celine was imprinted with Columbia and not Epic in Europe and Canada is because her catalog is actually sold by her original signee, Sony Music Canada, who uses the Columbia label. The content creator on the other hand is pic records up till 2007, and 2007 onward Columbia Records. Columbia Records as a standalone company exists in two places: NYC (original standalone company for many decades) and London (a division of Sony Music UK). Every other """"Sony Music (insert country name here)"""" company uses it as an A&R; imprint, they don't operate actual companies or standalone divisions called Columbia. Celine's first sony affiliate signing was in 1986 to CBS Records Canada, (CBS became Sony globally on jan 1, 1991), and Sony Music Canada used the Columbia logo on her (worked with the """"columbia"""" a&r; team at Sony Canada). Then Celine went on to sign with Sony affiliates in the US, but in the US they operate as standalone companies since there's many of them (there's just not one central """"sony music"""" company). However, even though she signed other sony deals in another country, her original signee (sony music canada) is still the worldwide sales agent of her work, and hence passed along their """"columbia"""" item to europe sony affiliates. Notice in the infobox it indicates she is still on sony music canada, because for as long as she's involved with sony in the US, she is still tied to sony canada. Furthermore, even without this explanation, it is irrelevant what label is used in other markets where the artist isn't signed for the infobox. For example, in Japan, Sony does NOT have the rights to the Columbia trademark, hence every single Sony artist ever, whether Columbia or any other label, was released there with the Epic imprint instead by Sony Music Japan. Does that mean we go to every sony related artist and insert Epic?? Indeed not. """,0

We seem to have a few issues under discussion at the same time here, and I think it would be helpful to separate them.   

Maintaining """"old"""" FAs
As  said (00:14, 11 December 2008), this article was promoted to FA in 2006, when standards were less demanding, so work is needing to keep it close to current FA standard.

Unfortunately the """"committee"""" process advocated by  doesn't work if the """"committee"""" is slow to respond. In Oct 2006 I pointed out some serious scientific errors in Dinosaur, another """"old"""" FA; nothing happened so in Jan 2007 I gave notice of my intention to fix these points; a few days later, after nobody objected, I fixed them; and a few days later the corrections were reverted, so that the article again contained the errors I'd pointed out 3 months earlier.    

Quality of images
This one has the potential to run for a long time. I have no strong objections to the image per se, but I'm not sure the article needs a reconstruction of a juvenile T rex'.   

Selection of images
Wikipedia is not a picture gallery, and images need to be used selectively. IMO if we have have plenty of images, as we appear to for dinosaurs, we  should use those that illustrate the content rather than just providing eye-candy. In many cases diagrams should take priority over pure pictures.   

Size and placement of images
There has been recent disussion of this at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#Forcing Lead image (plus a more general Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style item that's now archived and I can't find it) and at Wikipedia talk:Accessibility#Image position. To sum up my own views:
Images that illustrate specific content should be alongside that content.
Layout of pages that use images has become more difficult as widescreen monitors have become more prevalent, as increasing the text width reduces the height of paragraphs, sections, etc.
I dislike left-floating images, as this makes the text less readable by changing the postion of the start of the next line, so that users have to search for it rather than jump to a familiar X co-ordinate.
The functions of images vary. Sometimes they convey a lot of detailed info, and a larger size than the default is needed. On other occasions they need give only a general impression of what something looks like, and a smaller size than the default is adequate. The majority of readers are unregistered and therefore cannot set preferences for image size or anything else. Hence editors have to pick image sizes that are appropriate for the purpose.
Accessibility to users with poor vision (but not functionally blind) is irrelevant, as they will either have their browsers set permanently on """"zoom in"""" or have software that zooms in for all apps.
 makes ugly gaps in the text and reduces the readability of articles.
IMO all these points indicate that MOS cannot dictate a """"one size fits all"""" solution and editors should be free to set image sizes.   """,0

If you do not accept this, then you have to drop the narrow focusing on the geogrpahic limits and start admitting that the crimes committed by polisario are done in relation to Western Sahara and therefore can be extended in this article.

Nobody is arguing that a candidate with a majority of first preferences is passed-over in favor of a weaker candidate, nor that some valid ballots are simply ignored...yet that is the impression that Abd's choice of words leaves with most readers. His summary of the issue does not capture the thrust of the main claim that exhausted ballots can lead to sub-50% winners, nor even the much rarer claim that candidates with much less core support, but broader secondary support, may get eliminated.

WP:COI concerns and solutions for this article
User:Lordradish asked a question about my possible conflict of interest - WP:COI.  First, always look at Wikipedia policies if you think there is an issue, don't just go away angry. I know that I'm still learning Wikipedia policies and just reading the above I can see that in 2007-2008 period I was somewhat confused about a couple of them. The longer you are here, the more sensitive you become to all of them through experience.

Re: COI questions, usually its better to start that on a talk page per WP: """"The first approach should be direct discussion of the issue with the editor, referring to this guideline."""" Actually, I thought this issue explicitly had been dealt with here before, but reading through I see I evidently confused it with a related COI question elsewhere. Anyway, I'll respond in interest of full disclosure, outline questions I think have to be asked on the talk page of any editor here who gives any indication of being familiar with the issue, and suggest some possible ways of dealing with WP:COI issues here.

My possible WP:COI
To answer Lordradish's question, I have contributed 43 blog entries to the secessionist blog Vermont Commons over the last 38 months. I have not been paid.  My blog entries have been more generally related to the topic of secession and occasionally make passing references to Vermont and its secession issues, including in comments on others' entries. I don’t live in Vermont and don't intend to. I don't consider myself a member of any Vermont Secession group. As far as I remember, I only have corresponded with the Vermont Commons editor, and that by email. I get some irregular Vermont Commons email and mailings and occasional Second Vermont Republic snail mails. 
I also have suffered a couple years of vicious and even libelous off wiki attacks from the anonymous blogger who does vermontsecession.blogspot, including because I edited this page, and including at another blogspot page he set up just to ridicule me with incredible sexist ire. Therefore I have come to know far more about what types of individuals may be making very POV and COI edits to this article than I would have otherwise.
I do feel I have sufficient COI to make sure I declare it, as I now have, and to be very careful of my edits per WP:COI#Editors_who_may_have_a_conflict_of_interest. 

Possible WP:COI of other editors 
In the 2007-2008 period there was some extreme POV editing of this article by individuals who I believe had very strong personal and financial connections to Vermont organizations and individuals, far stronger than mine. They are strongly motivated to trash or downplay the significance of Second Vermont Republic and don't care much about Wikipedia policies.  Therefore here are some questions that might have to be asked on such suspected persons' talk pages (or here, but guidance on that appreciated). And I hope it’s ok to outline these general questions given the track record of this particular article.

General questions include: are you the anonymous blogger who does vermontsecession.blogspot.com which, while using some information from reliable sources, has a track record of unrelenting nasty, exaggerated and unprofessional attacks on individuals, often with little or even contrary evidence presented; is that person a close personal associate?; do you work for or with that person in some other capacity, such as at a publication or a blog or a sometimes paid campaign staffer?; are you a Democratic or Republican Party activist or contractor or potential contractor who fears that secession candidates running in 2012 might take votes away from Democratic Party candidates and throw the election to a Republican. (According to official returns the candidate Pete Garritano mentioned in th is article got 3.7% of the returns, something not yet in the article.)  Depending on whether a candidate was a more right or left winging secessionist, such a 2012 candidate could away enough votes to sway an election to the opponent of someone support by the editor.

If other editors who seem to be too pro-Vermont Secession arise, obviously relevant questions could be asked of them on their talk page or here.

Dealing with special WP:COI concerns of this article
Given the problems described above, I can think of possible solutions:
 I am going to ask some neutral editors - those who have not been active opining on the secession topic or me - to look at this section and opine.
 If Wikipedia:Pending changes is implemented, this article may need to be put on the list.
 In the interim, any time individuals who may have COIs make questionable edits, perhaps a trul",0

I doubt you would find a list like this in any other encyclopedia (not necessarily a reason to remove it - Wikipedia has lots of good stuff not in other encyclopedias), and it would be inappropriate to have a list like """"warning signs your neighbor may be a serial killer"""" or """"how to tell if your best friend is gay"""".  It may be better to find a site that has a list like this (you could probably find something like it on the APA web site, a good source) and provide a link at the bottom of the page.  I also am not comfortable replacing """"factual"""" with """"common sense"""".  Thank you, by the way, for avoiding an edit war.  I generally think it best to move stuff like this to talk pages until resolved because it promotes action, and it moves possibly false information out of the article.  - 05:36, Aug 29, 2004 (UTC)""",0

""". If you want to talk about linguistic issues in the Spanish State, or about terrorist bands linked to nationalism, do so at their right articles. The way you try to shove those topics in an article about """"Nationalities in Spain"""""""" looks like you´re trying to inject your personal, unfavourable to those independentist movements POV in this article. Please stop doing that.  

My dear 81.202.96.146, please stop asking me to stop from doing this or that, for it is not your duty to tell me so. Give your opinion and defend it as you may, as I am doing, and put the full stop after it. Now, it seems that we cannot insert anything here that raises the slightest doubt against the legitimacy of """"those independentist movements"""". Sorry, I won't bother creating an article entitled """"Terrorist groups linked to X nationalism""""; but I do believe that if there's an article that deals with """"X nationalism"""" or """"Nationalities in Y"""", which includes """"X nationalism"""", it is only right to talk about those terrorist groups. To your accusation:

 I already assumed above that I was biased, as anyone else (my quote: """"Of course, this I'm saying is only part of the story; but it corresponds with the same reality and nothing about it is being said in this biased article."""").
 I haven't edited the article yet, because I think the subject is worthy of a discussion, no matter how ridiculous the article itself seems to me.
 Due to 1's """" as anyone else"""", your accusation can bounce back at you with a very slight variation: you are trying to prevent obnoxious information about nationalism from entering the article, thus unveiling your point of view... So, what's wrong about it?
 The problem with your POV is that you already stated something false about the article to defend your position and I refuted it. Your only answer now is to say that my views should belong to another article.

I don't know what your reasons are for defending the accuracy of this article; clearly not the article itself. My own are simply that, if we are to talk about such a delicate subject as """"nationalities in Spain"""" we'd better document ourselves and tell everything that ought to be told.

 

 Why can´t I ask you to stop doing something I find incorrect? You are in fact, doing the same, by asking me not to do it. See the irony? I wasn´t issuing orders, just asking kindly for you to stop doing that. If you don´t want to, it´s ok.
By order:
1- Everyone is biased, that´s ok. But Wikipedia is not a soapbox. If you want to voice your personal concerns about """"spanish speakers opressed in Catalonia"""", that´s fine with me, but please don´t do it in an eclyclopedical article right? When we contribute to a wikipedia article, it´s not enough to go """"OK I´m biased because I think this and that, so let the battle begin"""". No, we try to put aside our differences and be as neutral as possible. I´m not trying to point out my ideas in an article, as if I were hoping to clash with you and eventually """"reach a middle ground"""" in the article´s content. No. I´m trying to be objective in this article, and you´re not, because you´re admiting to be biased AND allowing your bias to affect your output in this article.
2- That´s very respectful of you, and I think it´s the right thing to do.
3- No it doesn´t. I am not trying to push an agenda here. I am just pointing the OBVIOUS LOGICAL fact that articles should talk about the topic they´re about. If I, for example tried to hide the racialist doctrines Sabino Arana had, in an article about Sabino Arana, you could rightfully accuse me of """"preventing obnoxious information"""" from getting into the article. But asking for an article named Nationalities in Spain to talk about those nationalities and not about terrorist gangs that claim to defend some of the ideologies that support independentist claims based on the actual nationalities we´re talking about in this article, is just asking for something entirely reasonable. See the far away link between your proposed """"terrorist issue"""" stuff and the actual content of the article? As I said, create an article about Terrorist gangs linked to nationalist claims in Spain, and everything will be fine. By your same reasoning, anyone could end up talking about the IRA in an article about Catholicism.
4- What did I state that was false? I made only one comment before this one, just to ask you to stop trying to shove terrorist stuff in an article that is not about terrorism. Seems perfectly reasonable to me. Bye

"A few weeks ago, in anticipation of Millennium Park regaining its featured topic status, I broached the idea of CUP credit after the last article was promoted and you indicated that credit would not be granted.  It is my belief that I misrepresented the work done to regain Featured Topic status at a time when one last article was needed.  It is also my belief that you rendered a decision that getting credit for getting one last article promoted was gaming the system.

The winner of this contest could come down to whether you grant me Featured Topic points for Wikipedia:Featured topics/Millennium Park. I earned FT points for this topic when it was first promoted.  At that time the topic was 15 articles and the requirement was that 1/3 of the articles be WP:FC and all be at least WP:GA.  Thus, I was acknowledged for bringing 5 of 15 topics to featured status.  However, during the year two articles (Park Grill and Grant Park Music Festival) were added to the topic and the requirement was increased to 1/2 of the articles needing to be featured. Thus, I had to ensure that the two new articles be promoted to good article (which I did without a lapse in topic status) and that a total of 9 of the 17 articles reached featured.  Thus, I helped raise McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink (March 23), Harris Theater (Chicago) (June 12), Millennium Park (August 31) and Exelon Pavilions (September 25) to featured.

"Estee Lauder Contract and the phrase 'lesser capacity'
In 2001 Hurley was replaced as the face of Estee Lauder with Carolyn Murphy. However, Hurley stayed on with Estee Lauder and in doing so, ended the tradition of the company having a 'face'...after all, there were 2 faces. In the years following, Gwyneth Paltrow and Liya Kebede also joined the company as models, rounding out 4 faces. Currently, the company is fronted by Murphy, Hillary Rhoda, Paltrow and Hurley. The phrase 'lesser capacity' is misleading. Hurley models perfume, cosmetics and skincare for the company, something which Ms Murphy does not do (she does not model cosmetics), nor does Ms Paltrow (who does not model skincare). Only Ms Rhoda models all 3 as Ms Hurley does, but Ms Rhoda does not serve as the face of Estee Lauder's Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign. Thus, it is not that Hurley works in a 'lesser' capacity, she simply works in a 'different' capacity, in actual fact, her workload has increased! Therefore, I am changing the phrase 'lesser' to my original edit that she 'remained with the company'.",0

The removed paragraph 
Slovakization is often rationalized as a response to forced magyarization, which happened mainly after the Ausgleich (Compromise of 1867). While no one now considers magyarization a positive trend, for several reasons the rationalization of slovakization as a response to it is questionable: magyarization happened during the times of the monarchy, and it happened in a time period when human rights were not considered nearly as universal as now. Slovakization is happening since then and it was as severe under communist dictatorship as it is now in democratic

"Opinion sought 

Hi sleepless. I am contacting you, somewhat at random, as I noticed you have closed several AFD recently and as you are generally regarded as a good admin. The page User:GabrielF/911TMCruft has been serving as a de facto noticeboard for people proposing and following AFD's on a particular topic: 9/11.  To an extent has begun to broaden its focus into politically related articles in general, serving as an AFD conservative noticeboard. Among several recent examples, the Yellowcake forgery nomination was listed there as it went on AFD. This sort of private noticeboard strikes me as quite counter to the ideal collaborative and neutral spirit of AFD. I doubt, for example, that we would permit a WP:AFD noticeboard on topic X. Isn't that what AFD itself is for? So, I personally take issue with a user-space page which is serving the same role of co-ordinating editors with a particular outlook.  There seems to be quite a lot of pre-discussion among editors watching that page, almost all of it off the relevant article talk pages. An unwiki lack of transparency, in my opinion. 

Enough intro. What I'd like your opinion about is whether such a userpage is suitable to put through AFD itself. I've never seen such (userpage, not article), but I'm not sure how else to go about getting it deleted. Can it be speedied? Or am I just nuts, and this sort of thing is ok?

Question about Edit

Where is the proper place to put forth an individual and allow his talents to be fully utilized? Would you suggest I use the edited text as the basis for an RFA? Surely any poly-degreed Oxforder with 18,000 edits in 22 months can be, indeed is, a formidable Wikipedian exerting a vast influence on the quality and tone of the project. Here is the meat of the text - I would appreciate any guidance you might be willing to offer:

I think this project could possibly use the help of the Editor . He has not one, but Two, degrees from Oxford - has written several books [Love Songs and Other Mysteries (1991) - Bad Choice (1989) - Sorry, No ISBN numbers exist to link to ...] and has made just a hair under Eighteen Thousand edits in 22 months at Wiki. 

As he has frequently invoked the """"Superior Authority"""" of his multiple Oxford degrees and education and on numerous occasions brandished his Oxon academic honors to defend and enshrine his edits in Wikipedia and to eliminate the need for discussion, perhaps he could be of some use here - building the entry for his alma mater. Surely an American 'emergency responder', author, 18,000 count wiki Editor, and pedigreed intellectual with the rare accomplishment of two Oxford post graduate degrees would be of special use to the project.  

""""With respect, I went to Oxford, so i am fairly well aware of Brit English...penultimate being the climax of the story."""" - Arcayne

""""Regarding the 'penultimate' stuff - not worries - as I said, it's just a word. I always thought is was used as next to the end, as in right before the ending. A slightly different meaning has become popular, like how the original phrase """"buck naked"""" (meaning, naked as a male deer) becoming mispronounced so often that now people say """"butt-naked"""". It would render me a crabby old man to decry the loss of the word meanings. It was also make me something of a jerk. Words evolve. - Arcayne  14:34, 3 July 2008""""

""""I did attend Oxford. I did graduate from there with the two degrees I have previously noted"""" - Arcayne

These are the two degrees Arcayne previously noted:
the EU is not a single nation, nor is the UN or UAE. They are actually something called NGO's, or non-governmental organizations.  - Arcayne
 The EU is nothing BUT a governmental organization. Its purpose is to politically unite the countries within the European Community. ... it is a united entity. Ditto the UAE. Kapowow 
Are you seriously trying to suggest that the EU is not an NGO? ... If you consider me throwing my political science and international relations degrees at you to be derogatory, then I have to say that I am sorry you feel that way. I am not a potted plant; I know the policies of which I speak,' ... - Arcayne'''

I trust the Project will be the better, as has Wikipedia in general, with such a confident and industrious Oxonian on board.

Surely Wikipedia, or the Oxford community, have a place for those such as Arcayne, who are able to place 18,000 edits in 22 months as the very public face of Oxford Wikipedians.75.57.205.135  """,0

 Untrue Wikipedia statements need correction 

 Wikipedia on  Nicolaus Copernicus now states:

Born 19 February 1473(1473-02-19),
Toruń (Thorn), Royal Prussia, Poland 
Died 24 May 1543 (aged 70),
Frombork (Frauenburg), Warmia, Poland 

The city of birth was Thorn Thorun in the country of Prussia. 

It was not Poland (even though western Prussia or Prussia Occidentalis or Royal Prussia or West Prussia, was for a time protectorate of the crown of Poland-Lithuania and Wikipedia also has much wrong onesided POV, (enforced by a large group of Polish speakers) in those articles). 

The part of Prussia where Nicolaus Copernicus lived, worked and died was the Prince-Bishopric of Ermland, Latin Warmia and the name of the city where Copernicus lived for most years and where he died was Frauenburg in Ermland in Prussia. Again , it was not Poland. 

Prussians in all parts of Prussia (western, eastern and Ermland) held continous PRUSSIAN INDIGENAT-Prussian citizenship - NOT POLISH.

Wikipedia article repeatedly disregard International Law in articles about history and people from east of the Oder-Neisse line, making everything and everyone east of the Oder Neisse appear as Polish. 

Wikipedia mainly reflects Polish POV most of it from books from Communist Polish Historiography POV. 

The irony is, that honest Polish writers distance themselves from the Communist Polish Historiography, yet Wikipedia has become Communist Polish POV's greatest perpetrator and now spreads it as """"universal knowledge"""" all across the globe by multiple mirrors. An Observer(70.133.67.155  )""",0
"Request for comment: Wikipedia article on Pottery

This dispute is concerned with definitions of the term pottery and the way that differing definitions of the term should affect the content of the Pottery article.

The term pottery is defined narrowly by some reputable authorities to exclude everything but pottery vessels; pots, dishes and suchlike things. Other equally reputable authorities define the term more widely, to include such things as figurines, statuettes and tiles. 

The question of when and where the first pottery was made is a highly contentious one in some quarters. Attempts have been made on one side to prove that the earliest pottery is that represented by ceramic figurines found in the modern-day Czech Republic, while others have sought to prove that the earliest pottery is that represented by ceramic vessels found in modern-day Japan.

A protagonist in the dispute holds the firm opinion that only vessels can be pottery and from this argues that the pottery article must present without qualification the view that the Japanese vessels are the world's earliest pottery.  

Another protagonist in the dispute holds the view that the wider definitions of the term pottery should be taken into account and that mention of the Czech figurines should not be excluded from the article.

This matter has been discussed since February of last year under many headings on this page and at User_talk:Brunnock.",0

Stabbed Kercher getting axed
Hello, Wikid77 here. I am contacting a few admins about this. Now that User:Zlykinskyja has been hounded away from editing """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""", the wholesale axing of fully-sourced text has begun. See: removal of forensics. The apparent WP:Wikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman, with legal expertise, trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms. I warned beware of """"colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia"""". Perhaps if American student Amanda had been """"Adam Knox"""" then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20? misquoted infamous statements. (I didn't know any evidence in December 2009, now I know much, and some seems falsified in Italy). Zlykinskyja tried to add how """"Donald Trump"""" rejected the verdict (+source), but that was quickly deleted. Some US officials are conducting a mock-trial by judge to compare verdicts, but I doubt that could be explained in the article. Then some prankster this week posted at top, """"Breaking news: Knox dead in prison from suicide, details not confirmed"""" (from an IP edit in the London area), and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that. I wish we could split the article into several low-target subarticles (I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles). The talk-page has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on """"Amanda Knox"""" and naturally, a prior subarticle was AfD deleted.However, I suggest the following:
 """"Amanda Knox"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article with civil suits, appellate trial, and college coursework in prison.
 """"Raffaele Sollecito"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article, noting he completed his computer degree while in custody, and they met, at a classical music concert, because he looked like Harry Potter.
 """"Prosecution of Amanda Knox"""" (new) - would contain all the pro/anti-Knox text, moved from edit-wars in the Kercher article.
 """"Investigations of Kercher murder"""" (new) - would be a forensic article, with fingerprints, Low copy number DNA, luminol, unidentified DNA/prints, listing exact quotes+sources, etc.
 """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""" (reduced) - would be trimmed into an overview, linking sections to subarticles.
I have seen how other articles, split into subarticles, greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details, so that forensic details would likely match the sources, when viewed there. This message is just a general notice, sent to a few admins, and I don't expect an immediate response. Also, feel free to delete this, knowing it was posted in a 1 May talk-page revision: as a May Day warning about axing of Kercher text. Thanks. -  """,0

(I hope this is the right way to reply)
Good question. No, of course, it does bump up the principal. How about this thought experiment: for continual compounding, what if the payment is not made continuously? I only mean this rhetorically. The fact is, the payment period and the compounding period do not need to coincide at all; the compounding period is a convention. I hope I express this properly, and I do not do this on a day to day basis, but my understanding is:
 The compounding per se is on a six month basis, but can be calculated at any time.
 So, if you are late three days (and no grace period, etc), the amount payable is added to principal for this period of time. If you ask the bank (and their systems are up to date), you can determine new principal, which is old principal plus payment amount plus accumulated interest to that day.
 If you pay on the third day, you will have interest payable on the original principal plus the delayed payment for three days at the six-month compound rate (expressed as a fraction of days / six months).
 In fact, this is basically identical to interest on a given sum for x% annual interest for y days. You would pay interest of principal times x% times y/365. It just doesn't get compounded for the interim days (for example, on a daily basis).
 Why six months, etc? I have no idea. That was the convention a long time ago and it has stuck, and I think at one point """"they"""" chose to require banks etc to all quote and calculate on the same basis, rather like an APR.
 The point being any rate/compounding period can be chosen, the calculations are just extra work often dictated by convention/regulation. Hope this is clear. """,0
"This page is dedicated to the Gnome Owl.
MEASUREMENTS: The Northern Pygmy-Owl has a body length of 7 - 8 inches, a wingspan of 15 - 16 inches, and weighs about 2 - 2 1/2 ounces.  
HABITAT: This owl can be found at forest edges near meadows, lakes, coastline, and forest clearings in deciduous and coniferous forests of western North and Central America.  
DIET: The main diet of the Northern Pygmy-Owl is small birds and rodents, and large insects. Occasionally, they will eat reptiles and amphibians. Pygmy-owls are diurnal(active during the day) and crepuscular (active at dusk and dawn) hunters. This owl will search for prey from a perch, pouncing upon it from a close distance when prey is found. 
REPRODUCTION: The Northern Pygmy-Owl nests in tree cavities. The female usually lays 3 - 5 eggs. Unlike most owls, which start incubating the eggs soon after the first eggs are laid, the pygmy-owl does not start incubation until all the eggs have been laid. In about 29 days all the chicks hatch within a short time of each other. The young owlets fledge at 30 days and are independent of parental care 20 - 30 days later. The young owls become sexually mature in less than a year.  
NAME DERIVATION: The scientific name comes from the Greek words glaux, indicating a little owl; glaukidion, meaning to gleam or glare, and may refer to the eyes of the owl; and gnoma, referring to knowledge, reasoning, or an opinion. The common name indicates the size of the bird and its northern range. This owl has also been called a Gnome Owl. 
INTERESTING FACTS: 
Unlike hawks, falcons, and eagles, owls do not have an expandable part of the esophagus, called a crop, to store extra food. Therefore owls, like pygmy-owls, will cache the remainder of their food in a hiding place and eat it later. This is especially important for small, high-energy species that must eat frequently.

Since pygmy-owls are active during daylight, they rely on their sense of sight to hunt. Consequently, this owl did not develop a good sense of hearing, silent flight, nor exceptional night vision, like nocturnal owls.",0

"""

What I appreciate about this discussion, is that it is being conducted by people who demonstrate a great deal of concern for the issues involved - both the subtleties and the sweep of the issue. I believe this is appropriate (though admittedly tiring) because, in legal matters, a great deal often hinges on a comma, or the inclusion/exclusion of the word """"not,"""" or other such maddening technicalities. Ergo Shakespeare's famous dictum about lawyers.

Consejo de Salud Playa de Ponce v. Rullan does provide federal precedent, and a framework for discussion and debate. However the Rullan ruling is not ultimately dispositive of a U.S. constitutional question or territorial status issue, since the U.S. Supreme Court is the court of ultimate (and binding) jurisdiction in both of these areas.

The language of the Rullan ruling did not grant full constitutional privileges to Puerto Ricans living on the island itself (as opposed to those living on the mainland). The Rullan court stated that """"Congress today, thus, must afford Puerto Rico and the 4,000,000 United States citizens residing therein all constitutional guarantees.""""

However, as stated earlier, Puerto Rico is subject to the U.S. Congress' plenary powers under the territorial clause of Article IV, sec. 3, of the U.S. Constitution.U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2 (""""The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States ...""""). 

The Rullan ruling occurred in 2008. Three years later (in 2011), insular Puerto Ricans have neither U.S. Congresspersons nor U.S. Senators, and they cannot vote for a U.S. president. Therefore insular Puerto Ricans are not fully-enfranchised U.S. citizens, and they have not been extended """"enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U.S. Constitution.""""

It is thus clear that (in the exercise of its plenary powers) the U.S. Congress has chosen to ignore the Rullan ruling.
 
The operative word in this discussion (and I understand the frustration on both sides) is the usage of the word """"must"""" in the Rullan ruling. As forceful as that word sounds, it was mis-used by the Rullan court, because the U.S. Congress clearly ignored it.  

Again...a lower federal court is not the court of ultimate jurisdiction for the issues addressed by Rullan. The U.S. Congress ignored it. Puerto Ricans (on the island) are not fully-enfranchised, and therefore do not have """"enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U.S. Constitution.""""

I agree. The entire section titled """"Bridging the Second and Third Reichs in German South West Africa"""" looks like WP:OR. Although I'm sure some authors have touched on the subject, our article gives it undue space. In addition, lots of items in the table look like pure speculation. Descriptions such as """"Heinrich """"worked"""" in German Southwest Africa, and Hermann was a """"well known member"""" of the NSDAP""""; this guy """"originated the slogan Lebensraum while in GSWA in 1910, a sympathizer who influenced the NSDAP since 1923""""; or even """"member NSDAP in 1933, founder of German East Africa"""" (this article is not about German East Africa). Enumerating every single person who visited GSWA and later had some role in WWII does not seem especially remarkable or particularly informative and the entire section could be reduced to a paragraph or two summarizing the arguments for the link that some authors have provided. Remember, this article is about German South-West Africa - i.e. narrower in scope than German colonialism and wider than the Herero and Namaqua Genocide.  (''talk) """,0

 Rename article, reorganize subcategories, and incorporate Jesus in Islam as a mainstream """"portrait"""" 

The article's title is misleading. It leads us to believe it will be an article on historical (historicity) of Jesus. In fact, it is an article on Historical Portraits of Jesus, and should be named as such. 

Secondly, the subtitles need to be renamed/reorganized, and some material needs to be shifted into different categories. The entire """"cultural background"""" subsection is Christian POV and should be named as such. Historical elements needs to be largely removed, since this article is about portraits, and some of the further subsections of that category are already covered in the Historicity of Jesus article, and are in fact duplicated there.

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.",1

". The obvious mistake in the inadequate use of “prosecute” in the translation of the French Rabbinate can be analysed as an unconscious confession and denunciation of the falsification committed by the rabbinical ancestors.

TABFor when he dictates his Commandments, the Eternal does not play with double meanings. Then here on the Sinai, the historical context is that of abandonment of circumcision until Gilgal. Therefore, only the bad faith of the fanatic victims of circumcision could twist the text in a misinterpretation that nobody should ever have imagined. For in order to restore circumcision, the rabbis were compelled to conceal the veritable meaning of the Second Com-mandment through falsifying the sense of the most sacred text of the Torah since directly written by God. The manipulation of the faithful is obvious. The sole attenuating circumstance would be pathological denial of the reality of the meaning of the Second Commandment, due to blind faith in Abraham’s commandment and to the deep psychological trauma its implementation provokes. It is indeed high time to put an end to it.

TABBesides, it is possible to word a hypothesis about the two versions of the Second Commandment, that which forbids circumcision and that which does not mention it. Until today, the authenticity of the Book of Deuteronomy has been considered warranted by the fact that the manuscript was found again buried in the temple of Jerusalem at the return from the exile in Babylon. But it is impossible that God should have varied in his formulation of the Ten Commandments; the Levite rabbis varied, not God. The redaction of the book of Deuteronomy has certainly been altered, truncated from the ban of circumcision. One must think that the discovery in the temple was a whole performance intended to warrant the return to circumcision. For the rabbis only knew the book of Deuteronomy, a book of rules of boring reading whilst the book of the Exodus was well-known to the people; it was the source of religious education and it was impossible to falsify it, only its interpretation could be changed. The version of the Book of the Exodus is both the authentic version and the one written at the intention of Nebuchadnezzar. Indeed, at the time of captivity, those who obeyed the divine will to respect the human body were likely still numerous. The Jews were divided about this point and the version of the Exodus enabled the rabbis to explain the fact to Nebuchadnezzar, while distinguishing the Jews from the Egyptians in order to avoid slaughter. The version of the Book of Deuteronomy was made up at the return from exile in order to warrant the new orthodox interpretation of the Second commandment of the Book of the Exodus.

TABAbolishing the commandment of Abraham, the Second Commandment makes the right to physical integrity the first of the rights of man. One can even think that in the Third Commandment that comes right after this condemnation of circumcision:

“You will not invoke the name of the Eternal your God to support lie...” (20: 7, French Rabbinate),

Moses reproaches Abraham for having perjured saying that God would have ascribed him circumcision. A shrewd reader of the Bible, Mohammed took up this accusation in verses 4: 118-119 of the Koran (see below). For if God ever ordered Abraham circumcision, he forbade Moses to do it. Either it was not the same God or he changed his mind between both Alliances, or still Abraham lied and no God ever ordered circumcision. The Book of the Deuteronomy confirms that God did not impose circumcision to Moses",0

Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave.

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

I think generally it's probably not wise to follow precedents on other articles (in which case we would still ironically end up with a UK/US listing by just copying the IMDB countries), because they all have different standards of editing.

 mgts 

Next generation wireless networks are evolving into """"all-IP"""" architectures, and SS7 over Internet Protocol (IP) is becoming more prevalent as intelligent gateways become the de facto technology used to interconnect wireline and wireless networks. The MGTS™ is the leading product for testing wireline and wireless network convergence. It is a multi-user, multi-protocol programmable test system that emulates any SS7/PSTN entity or SS7 application database, and measures the functionality and performance of signaling and media gateways. The MGTS uses powerful underlying platforms, a diverse line of network interface cards, and an extensive library of protocol test modules to significantly reduce product development time, lower production costs, and ensure conformance to telecom industry standards.

MGTS reduces product development time by allowing multiple users to perform their tests concurrently. Early in the product lifecycle, the MGTS can emulate prohibitively expensive or difficult to locate network equipment. Farther along, the MGTS can support load testing to measure how much traffic the equipment can handle. MGTS also supports traffic flow monitoring between nodes in live networks. The MGTS is a flexible platform that can be customized to provide the test scripts, software protocols, and hardware needed to solve each new challenge.

Testers can create complex, multi-protocol test sequences using the Protocol Adaptable State Machine (PASM™). PASM is a complete development system that constructs common test cases by defining protocol message formats, sequencing, and operations. PASM can create any type of protocol message for use in test case sequences against a device under test (DUT). With PASM, users can easily and simultaneously test circuit and packet switches over multiple interfaces. The created test cases can be executed in either simulation or load mode for functional and system integration testing. PASM helps significantly reduce the time needed to develop comprehensive 3G, VoIP and SS7 load tests.

The MGTS supports a wide variety of applications:

    * Design and feature verification: Does the device being tested provide the desired features and functionality?
    * Conformance Testing: Does the device conform to industry standards?
    * Interoperability Testing: Will the device work with other equipment in the network?
    * Load and Stress Testing: How will the device perform under load and overload conditions?
    * Installation and Acceptance Testing: Is the device ready for installati""",0

 """"Peace and tolerance"""" are underpinned by their belief that muslims should unite against their common enemy which they believe is Western dominance of Islamic Ummah, in particular US and Israeli domination/occupation. This resonates with the call by the late founder of Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini for Islamic unity and resistance against the West, and that's also one reason the Houthis are claimed to be supported or influenced by Iran. The other ground for their tolerance is their opposition to Salafism/Al-Qaeda which is widely known as an intolerant, extremist and terrorist Islamic group which has engaged in sectarian infighting and division in the Islamic Ummah rather than staging any real, honorable resistance against Western domination. They have in fact destroyed the public image of Islam by committing all sorts of wrongs and excesses such as indiscriminate violence against non-Salafists and non-mulims and pretty much anyone who doesn't adopt their ideology. I'm elaborating on this to help better make sense of the Houthi ideology and such characterizations offered by the Yemeni professor. Also see how this is in line with the Newsweek identification of Houthi descent cause as being shared by all Yemenis. Houthis are genuinely inspired by Shia Islam but that's also exactly why they are striving for indiscriminate well-being of all muslims. You need to study about Shia Islam to understand this, especially Shia distinct appreciation for reason and universal justice.    """,0

A merger makes no sense, based on article size.  Wikipedia has is fair share History of articles.  I can't see a reason to get rid of it.  *shrug*  
Oppose merger. Articles that try to cover too much become long and overly complicated to read. Basically I like the Mesopotamia article. Although it could benefit from some expansion and clarification, it is a good summary article.   
the point is that as the ToC was organized, the 'history' article is the """"main"""" article of about 90% of this article. That doesn't make sense. Maybe change """"history"""" to """"timeline"""", and make this one the """"ancient Mesopotamia"""" article.  (ᛏ)

If someone else feel the urge, it would be greatly appreciated. The entire set can be found here:

 Enlil 

Under the section on Mesopotamian gods, it is stated that Enlil is the most important god in the Mesopotamian region. I believe that statement is somewhat misleading. To my knowledge, over the thousands of years of Mesopotamian history, that honor changed hands quite a few times depending on what particular group held power. It should either be qualified or changed; if I have some time later, I will try to come up with a more constructive suggestion for changing it, but for now I wanted to pose it to discussion group to make sure I wasn't just splitting hairs.

Chile

Cielo Estrellado please please do not support Al Andalus on this. The word Mestizo is never used in the hispanic world to describe people who are predominantly European as is the case for most Chileans. 

Firstly, as you may know, in Latin America it is used for those who are predominantly amerindian in their ancestry. (It would apply in Mexico and Central America). 
Secondly, there is no defined ethnic group in Chile which can be defined as mestizo, there are just people with more or less Indian bood, Spanish origin being nearly always the larger part of the ancestry. There is no sense of common belonging shared exclusively by people with amerindian ancestry which excludes people who dont have this ancestry. This is a vital characteristic of an ethnic group.
The word mestizo is pejorative in our language and should be used as little as possible. Ill give you an example. When the movie """"Harry Potter and the half-blood prince"""" came out in the Spanish speaking world, it was translated into Harry Potter and the Prince, because of the negative connotations that the word mestizo implied.
Finally, in our cultural community, Latinness, Spanishness (or if you want to use racial terms """"whiteness"""") is an expansive concept which does not exclude people placind then in a different ethnic group on the basis of their blood being """"tainted"""" as happens in the Anglo Saxon world. Although, I agree that that in certain countries where racial divisions have been stronger due to a much larger Amerindian community, (such as Peru or Guatemala) leading to implications regarding identity and ethnicity..

Anyways I hope you understand my position and we can establish some dialogue on this issue which transcends the narrow (and in my opinion racist) perspective of Genetic studies.
I also hope you are not a sock puppet of user: al andalus! This would make things much harder:-)

(He seems to think that Wikipedia is his whole world and is the entire internet, and it is not. Nice. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html ) Anyway, Matt's only response was to make off-topic childish remarks and  here's the genius part  when Matt's own childish remarks (similar to Matt's reply above) are repeated back to Matt in an effort to show Matt his childishness (and to mock Matt) Matt becomes mad and remains clueless.  I suppose Matt thinks that when he does this, he's done something very clever. Sadly, Matt's debating style is much favoured by schoolchildren: make off-topic childish remarks and stalk accurate writers with his """"nah-nee-nah"""" voice. It is amusing, though, to see Matt (a grown-up?) do it.  Here are the points that Matt never addresses, does not dispute, but always tries to delete so that other wikipedians will not know: 

 1. Dr. Rex Curry showed that the USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the """"ancient Roman salute"""" is a myth. http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html  

2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html

3. Francis Bellamy (author of the """"Pledge of Allegiance"""") and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel """"Looking Backward"""") and Charles Bellamy (author of """"A Moment of Madness"""") were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement in the USA, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" and their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party"""" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute.  """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html

Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas rely on a false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not use the word """"swastika,"""" but called their symbol a """"Hakenkreuz.""""

Over the past several weeks he has visited many many many articles and removed all material from Edwards, Parker, Nicholson, Butz etc. 

However, there are some legitimate Duplication concerns.  The problem is that sources explain that during the formative years of Early Christianity 75 ancient witnesses testify to the fact that there was a Hebrew Gospel in circulation. Google Link Over 12 different witnesses testify that it was written by the Apostle Matthew. Google Link No ancient writer either Christian or Non-Christian challenges these two facts. Google Link 

Nicholson, Parker, Edwards, Bütz and others agree with Jerome. Thus the Hebrew Gospel is the basis for a number of topics. How do we go back to the fountainhead without duplicating material? The matter is further complicated by the fact that the Catholic Church and a number of scholars believe that Jerome was wrong and that the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible was written by Matthew.  As a sign of good faith I have removed most of the material objected to until we work out a solution.   

Comments
Two Ways
I offer a simple observation, born of my personal experience. There are TWO WAYS (see the Didache).  One path leads to assumptions of WP:AGF on the part of all editors and a focus on improving article content.  The other path, the dark path, leads to arbitration.  Once you start down the path of poisoning the well, you will end up drinking deeply from its water.  Hang in there.   
Thanks for the kind words. My problem is that although I have a strong grasp of the sources and references, I am truly dim witted when it comes Wiki-warring techniques. I need admin help to allow me to focus on the scholarship. -   

While we're talking generalities, my further observation is that I don't think you understood my """"blending"""" point about NPOV.  Trying to judge and weigh sources often leads to unintentional synthesis, which is forbidden.  Even experienced editors often do not understand this point, and attempt to suppress POVs that are, in their opinion, out of favour, to the detriment of the readers.  As I said, all significant views should be represented.  From your response I'm not clear that you understood that.  If you did, my apologies. I would hate to see you sanctioned in any way (and this is not a threat from me, BTW, but an observation about what others may do), but you need to familarise yourself more with the Wikipedia policies, or else you are likely to be be reported at ANI with undesirable consequences. It takes awhile to get into the Wiki-style. If another editor reprimands you, claiming that you are in breach of policy, it would be a good idea to presume that they are correct for the next 6 months or so. There is a lot more to policy than just avoiding content forks.  For instance, reacting to an edit war by reverting is not the answer, but would be judged as edit warring itself if you were reported.  And that's the sort",0

Croatian Women's Cup finals
I stumbles upon a Croatian newspaper archive. http://library.foi.hr/nv/default.aspx?G=1&u;= Those newspapers cover football at like 3 pages per day. I wondered if one is able to find results or at least runner-ups from 1992 to 2001. As i don't speak Croatian and don't know the dates of the finals, i can't come up with good searchterm to create few good results. Maybe you could have a short try at that site? Something like women's cup final, women's football, year final, or cupwinner + final or something. Thanks in advance. -

 Article importance assessment drive... 

Whoa! I was this close to raising an issue with the WP 1.0 bot, because it looked like it was almost 100 articles off, and noone is assessing that many articles a day... -)   
All in a day's work ;-) Mind you, 99% of everything I assessed received a low importance rating. It would sure be easier to keep them in check if WP:CRO templates were marked """"low importance"""" (and """"stub"""") by default, requiring manual input only for quality/importance upgrades. Speaking of which, if one wanted to adapt WP:Germany's version of the table depicting importance scale, where would one paste it at WP:CRO project's page? Should I just put it on talk page until we find a better place for it?   ([[User talk:Timbouctou|talk]]) 
From time to time I assess a couple of articles, and usually it's """"low"""" because these are easy to pick: villages, barely notable films and such. Yeah, it's a chore, but in this case occasional (or semi-permanent, to be honest) backlogs don't really hurt either...
Well, the only proper place for the table is surely Wikipedia:WikiProject Croatia/Assessment, i.e. the assessment subpage (currently used for something slightly different, but this is easily fixable). Maybe the time to introduce it has come... I'm not sure myself, the project might offer an answer.   
Just noticed you tried to add the quality scale... I've wrapped it in , which prevents it from messing up the main page. Not really a solution - ideally the assessment page and what is displayed in the Assessment frame should be entirely different things - but it works, kind of.   

 Re: Maps in infobox settlement 

There's an intermediate template that you'd have to create, or use a parameter of the existing Template:Location map Croatia. If the coordinates match, the latter could work. But, I don't know offhand if and how this extra parameter fits into Template:Infobox settlement parameters.   

 Henlein 

I found out that while with Građanski Zagreb, the Austrian Karl Henlein was actually a coach/player. He is former Austrian international. Here (3rd paragraph) is says that Gradjanski had 2 Austrian internationals, refering to Henlein and probably Rupec. That makes me doubt if Jaroslav Šifer (Schiffer) ever got to play with Austria, as he played in this same period as well in the club, thus, if Sifer was Austrian international, they would have been 3, and not 2, as mentioned. All sources say that J. Šifer was only Yugoslav international, but the only source claimng he played for Austria, that I know, is RSSSF. Any ideas?

Well, I'm sorry that I reverted all of the info, but some of it was either unsourced or non-neutral. I edited the page again, so let me know what do you think.

"It slows trains down because the existing speed limits already have a significant margin of safety built in so the engineer can exceed them by small amounts and still remain safe.  With PTC such fluctuations over the posted limit will trigger an overspeed alarm with the result that crews will check their speed several mph below what is authorized.  PTC does not increase capacity except possibly on low density lines that were previously not signaled.  ACSES does not actually handle any sort of anti-colision duties.  Those are covered by the legacy fixed block cab and wayside signaling system.  On non-ACSES routes the PTC unit is attached to the wires leading to the wayside signal.  If reliable enough this can provide the same functionality as cab signals, but at a far higher price point. Just because wireless data is involves does not mean PTC is the same as moving block or CTBC.  Finally because of the reliance of wireless links, PTC systems are prone to disruption just like your cell phone or WiFi or digital TV signal.  It is a whole raft of components, all with their own failure rates that will require contingency operations when they stop working.  If those systems were never installed those instances of degraded operations caused by PTC and only PTC would never be encountered.",0

"The Zafarnāma /zəfərnɑːmɑː/ (Punjabi: ਜ਼ਫ਼ਰਨਾਮਾ, Persian: ظفرنامہ‎, Hindi: ज़फ़रनामा, lit. Epistle of Victory) was a victory letter sent by Guru Gobind Singh in 1705 to the Mughal Emperor of India, Aurangzeb after the BATTLE OF CHAMKAUR. The letter is written in Persian verse.

Guru Gobind Singh sent Bhai Daya Singh to Ahmednagar to give it to Aurangzeb.

In this letter, Guru Gobind Singh reminds Aurangzeb how he and his henchmen had broken their oaths sworn upon the Qur'an. He also states that in spite of his several sufferings, he had won a moral victory over the Emperor who had broken all his vows. Despite sending a huge army to capture or kill the Guru, the Mughal forces did not succeed in their mission.

In the 111 verses of this notice, Guru Gobind Singh rebukes Aurangzeb for his weaknesses as a human being and for excesses as a leader. Guru Ji also confirms his confidence and his unflinching faith in the Almighty even after suffering extreme personal loss of his Father, Mother, and all four of his sons to Aurangzeb's tyranny. Guru ji invited Aurangzeb to meet him in Kangar village near Bathinda (Punjab) and said no need to worry as Brar tribe will not harm him (Aurangzeb) as they are under his command. On the way, there will be no danger to your life, For, the whole tribe of Brars accepts my command. (59)

Of the 111 verses, the maximum numbers of 34 verses are to praise God; 32 deal with Aurangzeb’s invitation for the Guru to meet him and the Guru's refusal to meet the Emperor – instead the Guru asks Aurangzeb to visit him; 24 verses detail the events in the Battle of Chamkaur, which took place on 22 December 1704; 15 verses reprove Aurangzeb for breaking promise given by him and by his agents to the Guru; In verses 78 and 79, Guru Gobind Singh had also warned Aurangzeb about the resolve of the Khalsa not to rest till his evil empire is destroyed; 6 verses praise Aurangzeb.

Guru Gobind Singh wrote this letter from village Dina in Malwa region of the Punjab. Guru Gobind Singh spent few days at Dina and then moved to Dod, Kotkapura, Dhilwan Kalan, Jaitu, Muktsar, Lakhi Jangal, and Damdama Sahib. Guru Gobind Singh's last fight with Mughal Army happened at Khidrane Di Dhaab now called Sri Muktsar Sahib.",0

"Reverting other editors 

Hi there!
You appear to be engaged in an edit war with one or more editors according to your reverts at Alien (creature in Alien franchise). Although repeatedly reverting or undoing another editor's contributions may seem necessary to protect your preferred version of a page, on Wikipedia this is usually seen as obstructing the normal editing process, and often creates animosity between editors. Instead of edit warring, please discuss the situation with the editor(s) involved and try to reach a consensus on the talk page.

If editors continue to revert to their preferred version they are likely to be blocked from editing. This isn't done to punish an editor, but to prevent the disruption caused by edit warring. In particular, editors should be aware of the three-revert rule, which says that an editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page within a 24-hour period. While edit warring on Wikipedia is not acceptable in any amount, breaking the three-revert rule is very likely to lead to a block.

Please be informed that a  Dispute resolution has been filed on this page, and further edits should be kept to the talk page until it is resolved.

Thanks! And have a wonderful time on wikipedia.",0

Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC): Electronic Plagiarism Detection
http://www.jiscpas.ac.uk/apppage.cgi?USERPAGE=6588
JISC completed a plagiarism project in 2001, and they are establishing a plagiarism advisory service as a result of this experience. There were 4 parts to their plagiarism project, and they include:
1. Technical review of free-text plagiarism detection software 
2. Technical review of source code plagiarism detection software 
3. A pilot of free-text detection software in 5 UK institutions 
4. A good practice guide to plagiarism detection
A listserv has also been to continue discussions dealing with academic dishonest and plagiarism issues.
A copy of JISC's Technical Review of Plagiarism Detection Software Report can be accessed at http://www.turnitin.com/static/pdf/luton.pdf.
.
JISC Plagiarism Advisory Service
http://www.jiscpas.ac.uk/
JISC Plagiarism Advisory Service is a new offering that began in September 2002. It is based in the Information Management Research Institute at Northumbria University (UK). New materials are constantly being added to this plagiarism portal, but it currently offers advice & guidance, educational materials for students and other online resources. A plagiarism detection service, supported by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) until August 2004, is based on the turnitin.com platform and allows instructors to conduct electronic comparisons of work complete by students.
JPlag
https://www.ipd.uni-karlsruhe.de/jplag/
Guido Malpohl initially developed this software which is designed to detect academic dishonesty. The software does more than merely compare the text of documents. JPlag also looks at program language syntax and program structure so it can also be used to detect stolen software parts. Instructors may use JPlag for free, but they must first set up an account in order to prevent unauthorized use by students.
Library Electronic Databases
http://www.library.uiuc.edu/orr/
The Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign provides access to numerous electronic resources for students and faculty. Instructors may want to consult these resources when checking for plagiarism. Full text databases like EBSCO and Expanded Academic ASAP (InfoTrac) are two obvious starting points when checking undergraduate assignments. One thing to keep in mind is that some resources that are not full text but provide abstract information are often used by students.
Moss
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~aiken/moss.html
Moss or Measure of Software Similarity is a tool that has been used primarily to detect plagiarism. The way it works is that it detects similarities of C, C++, Java, Pascal, Ada, ML, Lisp or Scheme programs. Moss is free to use for instructors and staff of programming language courses only.
Plagiarism.org
http://www.plagiarism.org 
University of California Berkeley students and alumni created plagiarism.org to be used to detect plagiarism. One thing to watch out for is that the software doesn't differentiate between quoted materials and original writing. 
The Plagiarism Resource Site
http://www.plagiarism.phys.virginia.edu/
Lou Bloomfield, Professor of Physics at the University of Virginia, is the sole author of The Plagiarism Resource Site. The goal of this site is to """"help reduce the impact of plagiarism on education and educational institutions"""". Numerous links are provided to sources on how to deal with plagiarism.
Turnitin
http://www.turnitin.com/
Turnitin, a plagiarism.org partner, considers themselves to be """"the world's most widely recognized and trusted resource for helping prevent Internet plagiarism"""". Free trials are also available, and subscription costs vary depending on the type of plan chosen.
Turnitin is currently the subject of a copyright controversy. For more information, check out the following article, """"A Plagiarism Detection Tool Creates Legal Quandary"""" at http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i36/36a03701.htm.

First of all SarekOfVulcan still did not get back to me to disscus """"civilized"""". Instead NotARealWord added some non-sense. It seems that this is your style, how many, 3-5 editors keep moving around """"replying"""" to me. Anyway I CANNOT BELIEVE MY EYES READING WHAT NotARealWord just wrote above. 
NotARealWord said, quote """"What do you mean? The statement about their """"100% clean award"""" is cited."""" Are you for real, or you want to insult my/users’ intelligence? What, you have another set of policies about reliable sources and self promotion means? WHO MADE THAT STATEMENT ABOUT 100% CLEAN AWARD? Can you answer me SAREKofVULCAN?

Conclusion: my belief is that (I cannot pinpoint) or/and there is a matter of incompetence from the editor's part, some Wikipedia/Softpedia interests or just a vendetta.

Disputing """"Job Guarantee"""" Section
Chartalists don't guarantee a job.  They merely argue that the role of government in cases of underutilization is to provide the necessary demand to resolve that situation, since otherwise you have unused capacity and net economic loss.  It's quite a jump to take that and conclude the government hires everyone who isn't employed; in fact, it often means the government becomes the customer of a lot of businesses.  If you are in a state of underutilization that represents an economic loss, and it's due to a demand problem, it means you must have some net fiscal expansion from some source in order to drive utilization.  If the private sector is attempting to build assets (run a surplus) and you have an external deficit, the only mathematical means of accomplishing this is public deficit, that is, the government is either hiring people or buying from the private sector.  So the section I've marked for expert review needs to recognize that Chartalists prescribe that government deals with unemployment not by guaranteeing a job, but by hiring more and/or spending i.e. buying more from the private sector.  Things could easily, and likely would, weigh more towards the second option.   (posting on behalf of one Filburt)""",0

Please, Buspar, stop trying to use IPs to hide your identity. If you continue like that, you'll be reported. I think you played enough.  

Ah, finally you use your true identity. 

Even though your usual IPs are from Pittsburg and this last one was from Duke University, I can't help but see it as highly suspicious that yet another IP comes and suddenly gets interested precisely in the 3 articles in which, just days before, you started edit warring under the guise of various anonymous IPs. 

Besides, I have already noted similarities in the behavior of this IP and yours (suddenly calling me a """"vandal"""" without any justification, arguing that this is """"important"""" while it is not...). So please, stop pretending.

If you're are accused (whether mistakenly or not) of a 3rd act of sockpuppetry, the only person to blame for this is you, and only you. You started to act under the guise of anonymous IPs, so don't complain if the other IPs that magically appear to support you (while they had never touched these articles before) are also suspected. Had you not used IP sockpuppetry twice, you wouldn't be suspected now.

You're also not in position of accusing me of anything, since the previous 2 IPs you used can unmistakenly be linked to your account. So don't draw unnecessary attention on your case. I'm not sure the admin board will be happy to see how you've already commited 2 acts of sockpuppetry that are certains. The 3rd, I admit, is debatable for technical reasons, but otherwise, given the context, it is highly unprobable that yet another anonymous IP that acts exactly like you wouldn't be you. Besides, the fact that you decided to magically intervene just after I spoke to the IP yesterday, is yet another element against you.

After all, I could also post with the IP of a UK university (while I'm in France) if I wanted. It's not rare to find this kind of IPs in proxy lists. So please stop trying to frighten me, and face the consequences of your acts. You've already used twice a form of sockpuppetry, don't try saying you're going to accuse me for stating it, it's only making me laugh.

So don't talk of """"NPA"""" and don't even try to argue that it would be an """"insult"""" to say that you would go to such length to """"pretend"""". Because you've already pretended twice before.

For the rest, I've got nothing to add besides what I've written yesterday. You made these edits under the guise of anonymous IPs only to take your revenge for our previous quarrels. I cannot see how they could be constructive in anyway. The nature itself of your edits is illegal, since you did them using a form of sockpuppetry, which is not tolerated on WP. That's why they were reverted in the first place.  And then, I cannot see what would be the use of these edits, because first they're all unsourced, and then, they have no use, no importance, no encyclopedical relevance, they were only made in a revenge attempt. And finally, please have the decency to stop talking about """"consensus"""", because first you have always ignored them (I remind you everyone was against your fansub edits, you did them nonetheless), so reading """"consensus"""" in one of your post will always make me laugh. And second, I don't think we can talk about """"consensus"""" when the the only people that support you are yourself and your own sockpuppets. 

So, just get over it. This is over. Don't try to take your revenge, it's useless, and you'll be the only one hurt in the process.  You have now commited enough policy violations, if we add sockpuppetry to your constant edit wars and disruptions of Wikipedia (and now, the fact that you try to alter and modify people's comment in your favor). In your own interest, you should stop that, because the only one who will be blocked will be you.  14:06, 27 June 2008 (UTC""",0

"No this is not right. And the entry must be changed back. I never implied that most of the warming wasn't human induced or that most of the warming was human-induced. This is not what the argument was about.

You see if it WAS....... that would have been a reasonable argument. That's probably why you have tried to characterise it in this way. Many arguments have a little bit of promise on either side. This is not one of these arguments. My opposition knows full well that they are lying. That is why they don't debate me directly. The wording should be that it is not all human-induced and not all non-human induced. I didn't have a problem with that. It is the liars who had a problem with that.

 Historians are incapable of second guessing Hitler's inner thoughts 
There may be some who believe that historians are capable of deciphering Hitler's inner thoughts, i.e. Hitler's religion.  This is ignorance and stupidity.  They write things such as """"while historians such as Ian Kershaw, Joachim Fest and Alan Bullock agree that Hitler was anti-Christian"""".  They do not even provide quotes of Ian Kershaw, Joachim Fest and Alan Bullock saying that Hitler was anti-Christian.  All they are saying is trust us in our opinion the opinion of Ian Kershaw, Joachim Fest and Alan Bullock is that Hitler was anti Christian.  A far better procedure is to rely on the opinion of Hitler himself as to his religion.    """,0

"Most of the material on the page was from a rewrite I did a few month ago. I am busy so I do not have time to work on the article so I will just give a few short notes on your rewrite. To be honest I have some issues with your edits. I answered you question above and fixed your error in the introduction of the article. 

There are two methods to define the topology of a LCTVS space: using a family of seminorms and using a local basis of locally convex, balanced and absorbend sets. Both methods should be present in the article on equal terms. The family of seminorms is useful to view LCTVS as generalizations of normed vector spaces. The definition in terms of a local base is useful if you are coming from the more abstract topological vector space concept.

The definition section is now too long and detailed. I think the subject is specialized enough so that we can assume the reader is familiar with the basic concepts which are now explained in detail in the definition.

The article was not perfect before but you introduced errors and made the article less readable, at least from my perspective.",0

You gave link references and I replied to your link references in talk page that you delete and added more link which i reverted back. 

What is the point in  deleting Ramdasia Sikh Gotras and adding chamar link to it. You also did the same in Jatt and khatirs sections where you projected them too  as chamar. You say Ramdasia and Ravidasias are same which is false. You can goto the most popular Matrimonial websites -

http://shaadi.com/

http://punjabimatrimony.com/

Both have separate section for Ramdasia and Ravidasia . The Ramadsia Gotras are aslo different than Ravidasia Gotras .

Ramdasia Gotras: Nar, Badhan, Rajju, Rattu, Heer

Ravidasia Gotras: chumer,Chumber,Singhmar,Sheemar,Jassal ,Jassy Kainth.

The thing you are doing is the thing that most Ravidasias do ie; pretend to be Ramdasia and then spread false info that both are same. This can be see on matrimony websites where for eg  kainth and other listed Ravidasia castes people add themselves into Ramdasia section.

You give references to chamar books and chamar websites and no neutral source that supports your view.

The Fact Remains that  Ramdasia are weavers(Julahas) whereas Ravidasias are chamars(Leather tainers)and both are not same at all.",0

Hi Bishonen, 

Actually, the """"wink-wink, you know exactly what I'm talking about"""" was directed to Jossi, not you.  My questions to you were about the other quotes of Rawats.  I'm very discouraged to hear you say that you find them too ambiguous to know just who he was talking about.  He was Guru Maharaj Ji.  He was the Perfect Master.  He Was God incarnated, Saviour of Mankind and so on.  In fact, Jossi still thinks he's all of that.  If you would please spend just a little time reading the section of EPO or the Gallery of quotes I linked you to earlier, you'd see this in spades.

Anyway, Jossi is a liar through and through.  He knows full well that Rawat was referring to himself. I mean, really, who else do you think he might have been talking about?

I'm very, very frustrated as you can tell.  I'm a lawyer.  Words and logic are my stock in trade.  Plus I was in this stupid cult for years.  I know it inside out.  This Wiki article is a joke and it's being guarded by dishonest cult members.  Now how much more do I have to say before I can truly be banned from this place and wash my hands of it forever?""",0

"Deleted Article 

Dear disconspinster,
I do see you're a pretty efficient contributor/fixer here in Wiki and well-recognised as well, but the article Interrelated Demand and Supply which you just deleted and redirected had additional information that was not present anywhere in Wikipedia at all, which focuses on the definition of the different types of relationships for complementary goods.

Of course the original stuff that i wrote on Interrelated Demand and Supply should probably go somewhere on Elasticity or Complementary Goods, but i wanted to provide more information without sullying the neat and organized data on those above two pages, so i'd created another page and hope someone tidies it up a bit and merges it with the other articles. Didn't expect it to get deleted though. I'm going to revert the original back and hope someone with better economic knowledge will come along and merge it somewhere, since I'm new at this wiki formatting thing.",0

""""how you would classify any title given by leading newspapers as """"emotional""""?""""
 Here are some of the headlines from Times of India today: """"Future of Indian bowling is bleak"""", """"Ranbir Kapoor is hard to please"""", """"Why Indian men rape"""". That doesn't mean we are going to include things like these in the intros of the articles on Indian cricket team, Ranbir Kapoor or Indian people. Facts, not opinions, should be included in the intros, plain and simple.

 """"Delhi tops the list in crimes among all states of India, followed by Maharashtra""""
 You haven't read the article you linked to. Quote from the article: """"UP accounted for the highest 33.9% of the total crime reported in India last year followed by Andhra Pradesh (13.9%) and TN (11.4%).""""
 It does say that as a city, Delhi, followed by Mumbai, tops the crime list among the """"mega cities"""". Like I said - such a statistic is meaningless unless you consider per capita. Please read my comment again.
 You cannot say that """"Tamil Nadu is more crime-oriented than Goa because TN is #3 on the list, far ahead of Goa."""" If the population of Goa is 10 times less than that of TN, it won't be surprising if 1000 cases were reported in TN as opposed to only 100 in Goa. Delhi and Mumbai are the most populous cities in India, so it's not surprising that the highest number of crimes are repored in these cities.
 Another example: India's GDP is higher than that of Australia, Canada, Singapore and several other countries  that doesn't mean that India is the among the richest countries in the world. The per capita figures are the true indicator.

 """"If so then even London is capital of UK does it mean crimes in London could be ignored?""""
 That's a straw man argument. Who said anything about crimes being ignored?  The demographics section of the article on Delhi already mentions that """"Delhi accounted for the highest percentage (16.2%) of the crimes reported in 35 Indian cities with populations of one million or more"""" and """"Delhi accounts for 15.4% of crime against women in Indian cities."""" We are talking about inclusion of POV statements like """"rape and crime capital"""" in the intro of the article. If you want to add a section to the article, go ahead. See New York City#Crime for an example.

 """"Livemint is also not a valid news paper or recognized source like TOI or The Hindu""""
 Mint is published by HT Media (of Hindustan Times fame), in collaboration with the The Wall Street Journal. Anyway, that's not what we are discussing here.

""""TOI has given latest stats (2012). Hence your info is out dated compared to mine.""""
 Nope. Like I said, you haven't read the article you are referring to. It's dated 2011. And I've already discussed the article contents above.

 """"new comers should be made aware of these to protect their lives by taking caution or avoiding the city""""
 See WP:AGENDA. If you want to launch an awareness drive about the crimes in cities like Delhi or Mumbai, or states like UP, Andhra and Tamil Nadu, please start a blog.

 """"u are worried about all proofs""""
 """"threatening me to stop me
 """"interfering in freedom / rights to express""""
 Please stop the Wikipedia:Drama. I am an Indian, but I wasn't born in Delhi, neither have I lived in Delhi.  Torreslfchero and Anna Frodesiak aren't even Indians. So, there is no reason why should we be """"worried"""".

 Disney Channel Controversy 
On December 23, 2011, a rebroadcast of the episode """"Party It Up"""", where a female character complimented CeCe's brother, Flynn, with the line """"'I could just eat you guys up...well, if I ate"""" aired on the channel that evening. Former Disney Channel star Demi Lovato, who left Sonny with a Chance in the fall of 2010 for counseling because of personal issues, commented on the episode, criticizing the network through Twitter for including a joke about eating disorders when she had struggled through the issue herself, and as one of the reasons for leaving the company's fold. Disney Channel's public relations account responded to Lovato by stating that that episode and an episode of So Random! which had an eating disorder joke would be pulled from the network's airing cycle and reviewed further.https://twitter.com/#!/DisneyChannelPR/status/150418514426081281 Later in 2012, the episode started airing regularly on Disney Channel with the offending joke removed.
Disney Channel did not broadcast """"Quitting Cold Koala"""" on its originally scheduled date of May 17, 2013 and showed a rerun of """"Kids Don't Wanna Be Shunned"""" instead. The episode did, however, appear on the Disney Channel website, """"WATCH Disney Channel"""", and on """"Disney Channel On Demand"""", the channel's video-on-demand service. Disney Channel announced on their Facebook page """"We are removing this particular episode from our regular programming schedule and will re-evaluate its references to gluten restrictions in the character's diet"""". The edited version of """"Quitting Cold Koala"""" aired on July 5, 2013 as part of a 2 episode spectacular. All gluten jokes were removed in the revised version.
On January 28, 2014, Disney Channel announced that a TV episode of Good Luck Charlie will feature two lesbian moms in """"Down a Tree"""". This caused a protest from the conservative group """"One Million Moms"""" who told the Disney Channel company to not include it. Despite the protest, Disney Channel featured it anyway. Other people including actors Miley Cyrus and Evan Rachel Wood praised the episode and supported it.""",0

 The argument from majority 

Fine, this is Wikipedia and not primary literature, so the argument from majority is not automatically considered a logical fallacy. OK.

But how many people have rejected the DC hypothesis for reasons other than """"bah, yet another long-range proposal""""? (Again, the fact that the Proto-Caucasian and Proto-Sino-Tibetan reconstructions used are difficult to test is in the article – you're welcome to move it to a more prominent position.) Sure, Trask has, mainly because his reconstruction of Pre-Basque is different. (I will mention this more prominently in the article.) But besides?

Here is a post by Stefan Georg on when a hypothesis on language relationships should be considered accepted. For the record, Georg is currently most famous for fighting against the Altaic hypothesis (though he accepts a Tungusic-Korean-Japonic grouping as likely), rejects Nostratic, rejects DC, but accepts Seefloth's Uralo-Siberian because it's based on morphology. Here is a follow-up by Trask, here one by Vovin, and here another one by Georg.

To be an Indo-Europeanist, you have to know a lot about each of the branches of IE. How many people, other than the late Starostin, have anything near that kind of knowledge about East Caucasian and West Caucasian and Yeniseian and Sino-Tibetan and so on? Bengtson seems to be working on it, but he almost completely limits himself to Basque, the two Caucasians, and Burushaski (which he finds to be closely related), but he almost never mentions Sino-Tibetan or Na-Dené. That makes about one half of a person that is capable of judging the DC hypothesis (as a whole) beyond finding mistakes in the data from one of the supposed members. For that matter, Starostin himself largely ignored Na-Dené, Basque, and Burushaski.

Is there (already) a paper that takes the proposed evidence apart? If so, I'll be glad to cite it. (For the record, here is a discussion of a paper that shows, IMHO quite clearly, that what little evidence there was for including Omotic in Afro-Asiatic was wrong. A link to that paper is included.)

Here, incidentally, is an introduction to Burushaski – secondary literature – which makes favorable comparisons to Yeniseian and Sino-Tibetan.

In sum, I don't see anything wrong with presenting the hypothesis (in its latest incarnation) on Wikipedia. It is a controversial discussion subject, so (comparatively) many people will find it interesting.

In the meantime, I'll add some morphological evidence (suppletive pronoun paradigms, noun class prefixes) to the Macro-Caucasian section of the article, provided that Bengtson tells me that this paper is actually published. I'll also try to make more mention of the hypotheses that combine Sino-Tibetan with geographically adjacent families and thus contradict DC.  """,0

 Background 
21st Century Democrats started out relatively small but has quietly grown in size and significance in the last few election cycles.  In 2004 election cycle, according to the Political Money Line, it was the 13th largest Political Action Committee (PAC) in the United States raising nearly $7 Million.  Among progressive ideological PACs, it ranked fourth behind America Coming Together, EMILY's List, and MoveOn.org.  The group's long time Executive Director Kelly Young left the organization in 2007. Former Executive Vice President Mark Lotwis took over as Executive Director in July 2007.

Unlike traditional PACs, 21st Century Democrats focuses on recruiting, training, and hiring field organizers to organize grassroots campaigns on behalf of candidates for local offices, statewide office, and even targeted presidential swing states.  The strategy enables the group to get a value added return on its investments, and has proven to be successful. 21st Century Democrats wins the majority of its races, even though they focus on tougher, competitive races up and down the ballot.  The group has strong ties to veterans of Paul Wellstone's campaigns, as well as Democracy for America, which grew out of Howard Dean's failed presidential campaign. {{| url = http://democracyforamerica.com/about}} ,

 """"September 11 denial"""", whatever that may mean, has nothing to do with Mr Ahmadinejad! Please care to search on e.g. YouTube (see, let us say, this page) and notice that there are Americans who are propounding conspiracy theories about the September 11 atrocity. Further, I should point out that during his one but last visit to the headquarters of the UN in New York, Mr Ahmadinejad asked to visit the location of Twin Towers (i.e. the Ground Zero), to pay respect to the dead, but the New York authorities declined his request, citing """"security reasons"""" as their reason for declining the request. Be it as it may, to my best knowledge no one has ever denied September 11 happening, however there are some who question the official explanation as to who stood behind the event. It could be that Mr Ahmadinejad has also questioned the official explanation, but there is a world of difference between the denial of the official explanation and the denial of the event itself. Lastly, I should point out that there were also Iranians amongst the dead on September 11. In this connection, you may wish to search for the Iranian feature film The Ziggurat Goddess (about which here), 2004, with Shahab Hosseini in the main role. This film revolves around the life of a young Iranian man who has lost his wife and the only child in the September 11 atrocity, and in fact the film begins with the scenes of the attacks and contains flashbacks of the last telephone conversation that this man has had with his wife and daughter minutes before the first attack in which they were killed.

This has been done under section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read our the guidelines on spam as well as the Wikipedia:Business' FAQ for more information. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

"Use of Images 
User  seems intent on railing against various edits I've made throughout the PS series of articles - and without discussion - another being the addition of the non-free template to the top of this page.  I have removed it once, and will do so again, but figured I'd offer an explanation before I did so.  He cited the WP:NFCC guidelines, but nowhere on that page does it say that the use of the images in this article are in violation.  The article is not using any more than ONE copyrighted image from each topic it is covering.  As the overall subject matter of the article is broad, it can be expected to use multiple images.  My final argument for the use of the images is that they improve the aesthetic quality of the article.  Any re-addition of the non-free template without a discussion will be regarded as engaging in a senseless revert war, and may warrant administrative intervention.",0

 You are right in your assumption that there is a group of Mormons who audit these pages.  However, the idea that we suppress critical points isn't quite true.  More precisely, we tend to edit out misconceptions about Mormon beliefs.  For example, I'm not sure where you got the idea that we believe that elephants once roamed North America or that American Indians were descended from the Jewish race.  The word elephant appears once in the english version of the Book of Mormon, but that may or may not refer to what we currently call elephants.  As for American Indians being a descendent of the Jews (Book of Mormon people), that is also not quite true.  We believe that some of the descendents of the Jews survived the Book of Mormon times, but that may or may not include the American Indians.  It may also include South America as well as various islands.  With all the intermarriage that has happened over the years, finding a """"pure"""" blood line would most likely be difficult.

I have withdrawn my suggestion that Russell's description of the pamphlet was inaccurate.  The Historical Association apparently updates some of its older pamphlets occasionally, and it could well have done so with its Common Errors in History (although I have no evidence for that, other than Russell's description itself).  I did try browsing through the Australian National Library's collection of the  Historical Association's later pamphlets without finding anything else relevant.  But since the National Library's collection is incomplete, that doesn't mean very much.
It might be worth contacting the Historical Association itself to see if they can provide any further information.

"Vandal  

Dear WP Sysop Stifle,

, an ordained teacher of the Hamsa Yoga Sangh cult has been creating havoc for the past weeks by relentlessly inserting the name of his guru, his guru's book, quotes from his guru's book, and external link to their website on the following articles Kriya yoga, Mahavatar Babaji, Nath, and Adi Nath when the majority of the editors (actually all of them) who are experts on the subject agree that his guru is illegitimate, his inserts does not enrich (add anything substantial) the already existing articles, and only aims to promore the personal interest of their organization.

This  wants to turn WP into a propaganda material for a highly questionable (possibly harmful) pseudo-Hindu cult while pretending to be an impartial concerned Wikipedian who only wants to enrich it. The situation is really bad. He has just been banned but as soon as he gets unbanned he begins to relentlessly vandalize the pages with irrelevant and immaterial cult propaganda once again.

It is futile to try and protect the integrity of an article when someone like this person , like the Energizer Bunny, keeps on reverting them and gets away with it without being taught a lesson.

To see for yourself that Hamsacharya dan is really an ordained teacher of the cult he keeps on inserting to the articles and not just a concerned Wikipedian with no alterior motive, please see the following website [List of Authorized Teachers] and scroll down a bit for Hamsacharya Dan Kogan.

"Volunteer Marek, stop pasting material that has no consensus without discussing it.

Is this more than last year, or fewer than prior? What meaning does it have, if it has any at all? Russia still has a largely Soviet-era nuclear arsenal, ergo, most of its ballistic missiles are technically past the expiry date and RF has been supposed to DEcommission hundreds of missiles each year for the past 20 years or so (which is not to say it has been doing it!). Meanwhile, as far as is publicly known, it has been commissioning about half a dozen, or a dozen on a good year. Thus overall, its nuclear arsenal has steadily shrunk.

It depends whether we want Wikipedia to be cutting-edge. It is clear to anyone studying Time Cube that Dr Ray's discovery of the Ineffable 4-Corner Truth renders him worthy of the positions of Greatest Thinker and Wisest Human; he is thus granted the authority to bestow a doctorate upon himself. The only reason not to recognise this doctorate is compliance with the general stupidity that has precluded rapid acceptance of Time Cube.

Well, I myself am not so keen on dumbing down Wikipedia for the stupid and closed-minded people; although some people do seem to be, as evidenced by the censorship of the following material:

In late 2004, and in the midst of a prolific period of Time Cube evaluation marked by his creation of new and inspirational Cubic scriptures, Dr Ray took the Cubic disproof of religious concepts to the next level, by solving the major philosophical question: """"Why something rather than nothing?"""" The answer, as published by him on his Time Cube website, related to the principle of opposites (in this case, static rather than dynamic/cyclical opposites), an important element of Cubic geometry: """"Between the opposites, all things are created. As an entity, they exist only as a big zero, seen from space as something and nothing from every possible view.""""

It appears that the religious zealots want there to be a lack of solution for """"Why something rather than nothing?"""", so that they can use it as a proselytisation/brainwashing tactic. Thus, when the solution is revealed, they cover it up as part of their efforts to prevent awareness of the Cubic Truth, which, as we know, disproves God and exposes religion as an evil Word-scam. 

It seems a pity, but in reality, great things don't come easy. We must all fight to break the Word-shackles of religious and Academic-induced 1-corner ignorance, and force teachers to teach Cubicism above evil cubelessness. Humanity's sole hope of salvation lies with 4-corner Cubic knowledge.""",0

 Cleaning up 

Here's what I'm about to do to clean up this messy page.
First of all, sporange does not rhyme with orange, as clearly stated in the usage note. I will be moving it into the list.
Secondly, the section regarding orange, purple, silver, and month will be retitled """"Words with obscure perfect rhymes"""".
Thirdly, the terms bulb, eighth, elbow, and of will be removed. Here is my justification:
No matter how obscure the rhyme, if it has a perfect rhyme, it must not be one the list. Bulb rhymes with culb, so it will be removed. Simple as that.
Eighth is a perfect rhyme for weighth, an alternative spelling and pronunciation of weight- compare heighth.
Elbow rhymes with beelbow, as was pointed out above.

"Hello, Zwack GB, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions.

I notice that one of the first articles you edited  appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been reverted for this very reason. 

To reduce the chances of deletion, you might like to draft your article before submission, then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. To start creating a draft article, just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in, and edit that page as you would any other. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.

The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. If your username does have such a name, it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.

If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! You can also just type  on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

""":::Mike Brown clearly knows that he can't get away with naming a planet (-like thing) after a character from popular culture, which is the main status of Eris the Discordian goddessfrom her appearance in The Illuminati Trilogy.  So the fact that he only points to the Greek origin of the namei.e., the origin that would be seen as legitimate by the IAUis not particularly strong evidence that he didn't have any other origin in mind when he suggested the term.  That Brown would change the name of the moon from Gabrielle to Dysnomia does indicated a somewhat playful nature.

On the other hand, if you were to ask a randomly selected representative of nerd culture who """"Eris"""" was, I think you'd find a lot more people referencing The Illumninati Trilogy than the Trojan War.  This is not to do a mind-reading act and say that we know something about Brown's intentions that he's never mentioned, but to suggest that the Discordian connection is a significant association that deserves a few words in the name section.

Several editors there have expressed concerns with the MedCab process, so Wikipedia:WikiProject Environment (perhaps after creating a dedicated taskforce) would seem a good place to discuss organization of the whole family of articles, and RfC/U or ArbCom would be good for discussing editor conduct.

 Freedom House comment in introduction 

I deleted a paragraph in the opening of the article; this was promptly re-inserted by another user.  The text is: """"Israel is a democratic republic with universal suffrage that operates under the parliamentary system. According to the international data reported by Freedom House, the degree of political rights and civil liberties in Israel makes it the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, consisting of a multi-party system and separation of powers"""" 

I believe I had good reasons for removing it:

(1) The very same text - verbatim - is repeated later in the article.  This is reason enough for deleting it from the opening.  Without citing chapter and verse of Wikipedia policies, obviously a well-written article cannot be repetitious.

(2) A conclusionary statement about civil liberties is ipso facto a value-judgment.    This is obviously going to be endlessly controversial whatever the country involved (see point (3) below).  It is churlish to place this kind of comment right up there in the introduction.  Common/significant views about political rights are much better dealt with (less tersely) under the Government heading. I myself do not seek to contest the view that Israel has a high degree of political freedom, so if you disagree with me, deal with the point I make about the reasonableness of reporting this sort of evaluation in the opening of *any* country article.

(3) Where the very same text appears in the Government section, it is immediately followed by a contrary viewpoint, which the author(s) of this section thought was equally significant: """"Conversely, the research group Minorities at Risk (MAR) characterizes Israel's system ...""""  This gives a nice indication of how controversial the Freedom House opinion is, or at least appears to be to other Wikipedians.  Indeed, I'd like to ask: does the person who reverted my deletion of the same text from the opening think that its stupid to allign the Freedom House statement with opposing viewpoints (maybe because the Freedom House statement is 'incontrovertible', or whatever), and if so why did he/she not remove the 'Minorities at Risk' comment from the Government section?

(4) The text is a quote from Freedom House, which is widely regarded as a US-lead, organisation operating to promote a particular policy programme.  The Times (hardly a fringe opinion) has described it as an """"outpost of American soft power"""": .  Unlike, say, the Human Development Index there is hardly any global consensus support for its reports.  Giving its views such decisive prominence - treating them as the bottom-line on the country's political status by placing them in the opening - seems unencyclopaedic.  

I suggest that unless consensus forms against me on this, I should remove the offending text from the introduction.  There's presumably no objection to the same text being under the Government section (as it currently is - as well).

I am not very experienced in Wikipedia, but I feel this recent incident with the park ranger is a significant event, as important as him shouting baby killer at someone.

Now, most of these people are frustrated and confused.

I was planning on expanding on the equipment used (I.E. talking about ableton, reason, midi controllers, choas pad etc, which electronic drums used), history of band, and basically just adding more about EOTO to the page, because there seems to only be one paragraph on the band, and the rest is about Jason and Travis.

The reason I removed it is he is not a member of the first team and not listed in the navbox so the navbox should not be on his page. I also removed it from several other players pages and included a transclusion check link and source on the template page. Do you think I'm wrong? I was just doing some article maintenance.

Harrassment, I did not do.  He posted a question or whatever and I replyed, I was never rude, I never cussed, I never said anything rude to him or about him (if you want to count """"are you 5?"""" in that, OK, I admit that one).  

The edit warring...I was removing posts on the KDKA-TV page that did not belong.  Newscasts on WPCW, whether produced by KDKA or not, do not belong on the KDKA page.  I tried telling User:Kd lvr this, he didn't continued to post.  He was putting information that I couldn't confirm.  Such as former KDKA anchor Jennifer Antkowiak is now """"working with Leslie Sansone's In Home Walking Program"""".  I looked this site up and could find no mention of Ms. Antkowiak.  I did a Google search, same thing.  This is inaccurate and unconfirmed (if it is true) information.

The assuming bad faith, I had backed off on when it was found that User:Kdkatpir2 and User:Kd lvr were not one in the same.  I thought they were, I didn't agree with it, but I had to accept that.  When User:Kdkatpir2 was blocked for sockpuppetry, then I knew than that it was as confirmed as it could be that User:Kd lvr was up to no good.  Had User:Kdkatpir2 not been blocked, I would not have done anything and would have gone back to updating pages like I have done.

I make it a point not to be rude to users here (there are other users for that), I make it a point to pass problems off to an admin so I don't get in trouble and cause I don't want to deal with it.  I was reverting posts on the KDKA page cause I thought it was the best thing to do at the time and prior to being blocked, I was actually updatign the KDKA page, so that the back and forth that User:Kd lvr and I were doing (which was annoying the hell outta me) would come to an end (and also make the page easier to read as well).

If I was only here to berate people day in and day out, I would have been blocked long ago.  I have been blocked only once before for a 24 hour 3RR violation, which I admit I did and I took something too far.  That was my fault that time, but I did nothing wrong here.  I was doing what I thought was right, reverting information that was incorrect and inaccurate and attempting to stop a user (who was ultimately found to be a sockpuppet by an admin) before harm was done by his behaviour.

If I seemed like I was being rude or I was breaking a rule, then I apologize.  I am sorry.  I didn't mean for my actions to come off in that light.  If my actions seemed wrong, I apologize.  I didn't mean for them to and I had no and have no ill-will toward User:Kdkatpir2 and User:Kd lvr.  If I have broken a rule, then again, I apologize, that was not my intention.

I, again, ask that my block be lifted as I did not mean for my actions to be taken in the way that they were and I was not trying to break any rules with my actions.  I, again, apologize. -  (VT) """,0

By now I've written (or rewritten) most of the """"People's Park"""" article.  I was there from the beginning because Jon Read, my former employer, was the landscape architect responsible for the park's initial design.  He also provided the tools to build it and donated many of the materials. 

That first weekend was terrific!  I drove my truck (the one pictured in the """"Hippie: Travel"""" section) up to the site and parked it in the middle of the park as it developed around me.  My good friend David Garthwaite convinced his sister, Terry, that they should play music, so """"The Joy of Cooking"""" jammed all day. I cooked food for the crowd in my truck and worked laying sod.  Returned home at the end of the weekend, tired and happy.

When they fenced off the park, my truck was still parked in """"The Boneyard""""a place at 5th and Delaware in Berkeley where a number of people were building boats, vans and so on.  My neighbor, Alan Blanchard, had said goodbye to his wife, Sheila, and gone up to Telegraph Ave. to work at the Berkeley Reperatory Theater doing carpentry.  He heard some noise on the street, went up to the roof to see what was happening and was immediately hit by a volley of buckshot fired by an Alameda County Sheriff's deputy.  He never saw another thing, as he was permanently blinded.  James Rector, who was standing next to him, had seen the deputy point his shotgun at them; he turned and was running away when the blast hit him in the lower abdomen.  He died four days later.

I was in Sproul Plaza for Rector's memorial service just after he died.  The National Guard troops surrounded the plaza and pointed their bayonets inward, while helicoptors dropped CS gas directly on the thousands of people who had assembled.  Walking home after this gathering, we were assaulted by National Guard troops.  That night I defied the curfew and drove my truck all around Berkeleyno one was permitted on the streets after dark, and it was obviously a """"hippie truck""""yet they never stopped me, even at the roadblocks, which I ignored.

While the idea that the UK is the instigator of the war is delightfully odd, the OP does have a point - the article briefly alludes to the existence of earlier bombing (first para, """"Change of strategy"""") but never explicitly mentions it. However, the official history does explicitly connect the August raids to the start of the Blitz, even if they weren't the sole reason:

It would, of course, be too much to see in these raids on Berlin the whole cause of Hitler's next move; but they unquestionably added to his anger at the activities of Bomber Command. it would not be long now before D-day. What better policy, then, for this final phase, than to enjoy a swift and sweet revenge by hurling the Luftwaffe in force against London. For if the British capital could be reduced to chaos, the task of the invading armies would be enormously simplified (...) 'The British', he screeched, 'drop their bombs indiscriminately and without plan on civilian residential quarters and farms and villages. For three months I did not reply because I believed that they would stop, but in this Mr. Churchill saw a sign of our weakness. The British will know that we are now giving our answer night after night. We shall stop the handiwork of these night pilots.' Three days later, on 7th September, the Luftwaffe abandoned its offensive against the sector stations and began the assault on London. From the point of view of winning the battle, Dowding himself could not have made a more satisfactory decision. (pp. 182-183)
