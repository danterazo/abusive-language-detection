 Talk:Josephus 

I noted your concerns in respect of the attempt to strip """"Josephus"""" of his Jewish identity by relegating his Hebrew name to a footnote and the use of the Christological date references.

I invite you to read my comments hereafter addressed to another user; and all of the contents of the """"discussion"""" of Josephus. talk 

I am really offended by the ex post facto """"christianization"""" of this article. How can this possibly be justified? The article in question is a Jewish history article; and the arguments to remove Jewish references are so weak that an inference of bigotry is manifest. My recent interest in the article is that I had forgotten Josephus' Hebrew name; the current form of the article is not encyclopedic. talk 

As you can see, this is an old dispute. Let's sort it out at the article's talk page. ← ну? 

I have carefully read, and re-read, the discussion page; and, I'm afraid that the only conclusion possible is that the users promulgating """"AD"""" over CE, and relegating the Hebrew name to a footnote, are antisemites pure and simple. If necessary, I will demonstrate this; but I think any reasonable reading of the discussion fails to accept an alternative conclusion. It appears that you have made too many concessions in the past. Generosity is admirable, but not to the point of diminishing logic, well established historical conventions, and Jewish dignity. I am not sure what course of action to take.

Yes, Jdvelasc, it's a little hard to figure out what your objection actually is here.  If this sentence is not a formalization of what it's asserted to be a formalization of, then there just is no such thing as a formalization in first-order logic.  No first-order sentence can fix its interpretation.
Your original claim is that """"x can't be a natural number due to the soundness theorem"""".  But that's not so — the soundness theorem says only that there is really no such natural number x.  It does not refute the possibility that the theory T happens to prove that there is such a natural number.  T may prove false things (and, if it's omega-inconsistent, must prove false things).  The soundness theorem does not refute that, because the soundness theorem applies only if all the axioms are true, and some of the axioms of T may (in fact, in this case, must) be false.   """,0

Merge of Emerald Ash borer """"Infestation"""" with Emerald Ash borer
Kingofaces43, the formation of a separate page was necessary at this time because many of the subject facts covered in second page regarding Human actions induced by EAB does not fit the first. Eventually both might be merged into a streamlined example such as one completed about Dutch Elm disease. I think you would agree one of the most prevalent items making up today event is the unbelievable amount of misinformation continually supplied to the public Consciousness about this subject, including unproven theory from the best of tree Experts. So my goal is to utilize scientific peer review and field studies, along with other proven facts to correctly educate. Including successes and failures along with details about control through treatment also. Or are we supposed to produce a unique wiki page covering facts of how scientists properly apply insecticides. Yes even some facts seperatly belong within their specific wiki pages, like possible extinction of American Fraxinus placed on Fraxinus page. Or each page for 43 individual arthropods co-extinction caused by loss of ash. Separate """"Infestation"""" page would have been central location where temporally collected items regarding main subject could be kept. Lets work together, thanks.   
Hi . First off, please remember to put new sections on a talk page at the bottom (this is done automatically by using New section). That and other things are outlined at WP:TPG and help make sure things stay ordered. For content on the EAB page, there's a bit behind all those edits I made awhile back, so stick with me:

I realize a lot of stuff I condensed was your previous work, but right now everything seems to fit together well. The merging was mainly based on parsing things down, but also how we deal with scientific content at Wikipedia. It's definitely the ideal for Wikipedia articles in general that we summarize what the scientific consensus is on topics such as this. If you haven't already, I highly suggest reading WP:SCIRS, which gives a good outline on what we should be trying to do with scientific content. Essentially, we're striving to summarize what other reliable sources say for an encyclopedia. That means pulling from review articles since they do that for us. However, part of that is because we don't generally regard primary sources (i.e. research articles) as reliable because those are communications within the scientific community. That's because those articles are intended for other researchers to evaluate, and the general public (e.g. Wikipedia editors) are not qualified to assess whether the study was valid. For us as Wikipedia editors, we cannot assign what we call due WP:WEIGHT to an idea or specific study until it's put in context through other researchers commenting on it or giving it validity (e.g. review articles). Now an introduction section can count as a mini-review article, but we generally don't need that in this topic since we have a few review articles to pull from. 

With all that said, it is not our goal to describe what the primary research is. That's why I cut down a lot of the content as it was reading more like a journal than an encyclopedia (see WP:NOTJOURNAL). It's very different writing content for say an academic paper than it is for a Wikipedia article. From what I've gathered about your edits, you're very interested in generating very detailed information, which is perfectly normal for someone just getting their feet wet on scientific content here. However, the general goal of an encyclopedia is to have summarized information with references that lead to the more detailed information. A lot of the edits you're probably interested in including still largely fall under that question of due weight such as whether we even include the content or how much detail does it get. It's a learned skill, so I'm happy to explain things further at the EAB page is it's directly related or here if it's more general (i.e. Wikipedia's policies and guidelines) if you have questions or something isn't clear.

Hey. Excellent work on this article, and I was wandering whether you would be inteterested in a GAC nomination?  
Its easy to nominate, see the instructions at WP:GAC. And of course, continue the article further! Thanks,  

 George Kay 

I have expanded this article to cover his management career esp. at Southampton and Liverpool, but the section on his playing career is rather brief. As you appear to be a West Ham United fan, is there any chance that you could add something to expand this section? It would be great if we could bring an article about someone from the (relatively) distant past up to FA standard.   
Thanks for the work you put it, especially for sorting out the confusion between Belfast Celtic and Distillery. Do you think the article is now ready for Peer Review? If so, how do we go about it? Cheers.   
I've now put the article up for peer review at Wikipedia:Peer review/George Kay. We'll see what response we get. Thanks for your help.

""":::: There should be some priomordial quality mandate.  Wikipedia should want quality verifiable references.  If [WP:VER] is intended to be weaponized then a bot could be made that deletes pages and sections based on whether the section contains an insufficiently prestigious reference.  Treating WP:VER as an intentional algorithm would allow an attacker to delete perhaps as high as 90% of wikipedia without even needing to look at the content.  No one could invoke any objection to the mass deletion if the literal interpretation of WP:VER is the most important rule on wikipedia.  Vandalism becomes impossible if criteria for removal applied to a science page can be robotically applied to a philosophy page.
 The above attack would meet a common sense interpretation of vandalism.  The only possible protection from the mass deletion attack is if [WP:VAN] is considered to have higher priority for literal interpretation than WP:VER.  There should already be a common sense acceptance that Vandalism is more dangerous and objectively assessed than the quality of referenced material, and as shown above, rejecting the statement binds wikipedia to a suicide pact.  Its my view that the recent deletions are indistinguishable from robotic vandalism and they deleted high quality and verifiable references based only on the content hosting platform.
 If Vandalism and Verifiability are to be equally considered in actions, then restoring the content and tagging it as needing better sources should be done.  Also if there is to be a defense from robotic deletion of the majority of wikipedia, then """"deletors"""" that have shown no previous contribution to the page should be treated more suspiciously than those who have helped build it.

In many respects, the Jewish Messiah becomes nothing but a catalyst, even a figurehead, for Paulinism's own agenda. Paul's new religion had the advantage over other salvation-cults of being attached to the Hebrew Scriptures, which Paul reinterpreted as forecasting the salvific death of Jesus. This gave Pauline Christianity an awesome authority within the period culture that proved attractive to Gentiles thirsting for salvation. MacCoby, Hyam, The Mythmaker, Paul and the Invention of Christianity (ISBN 0-06-0155825)

A.N. Wilson, among others, contends  that Paul invented the Eucharist A.N Wilson, Paul:The Mind of the Apostle. (The contention that the eucharist originates in the religion of Mithras has been widely canvassed since at least the 2nd century when Justin Martyr disputed the allegation .)

He argues, likewise,  (ibid.)  that the idea of justification by faith was his and which can be contrasted with passages in the gospel and elsewhere where doing the will of God is paramount. 'Not everyone who says to me """"Lord, Lord"""", will enter the kingdom of Heaven but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.' - Matthew 7:21)cf. James 2:18ff  

Those who characterize the tenets of Catholic Christianity as """"Pauline"""" compare it with its alternatives, beliefs that Christian theologians called heresies.

It is argued that the Paulines were responsible for the marginalisation of James, the leader of the Jerusalem church, in favour of Peter. The small scattered Jewish Jerusalem Church was disbanded in 135 with the banishment of the Jews from the region by the Romans, having been decimated during the Jewish revolt of 66-70AD.

If you are familiar with MIS (the church's membership database), you'll notice that when they reach the age of eight they are removed from membership roles if they are not baptized within their eighth year. However, if their parents are still members, their names are kept in MIS (not as members, but part of a family who has a member) with the parents until they are 18. Non-Baptized spouses are also included. If I remember the designations for these are """"Child of Record,"""" (0-8) """"Unbaptized"""" (9-18) and """"Non-Member"""" (18+). They used to have an """"unaccountable"""" designation as well for those with disabilities who don't need to be baptized, although I've not seen it recently (no """"unaccountables"""" in my last ward that I'm aware of), and they'd also be included with """"Child of record"""" in my opinion. Church statistics are more accurate than most other denomination's """"estimates"""" and the computer system designates and distinguishes quite easily.

 DEAR Anonymous EE Guy,
 
Well, I don't know if you really mean to give a full picture of the case, but we could include this one:
 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm
 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/
 
Who are the web site of Jean-Pierre Voyer, a kind of model person for mister Messager/YBM, and who spred a quiet special form for ideologie, which goal is to play with words and how to defend and argue about things who do not exist, how to play with words and """"fuck others"""" as phrased on his web site, and essentialy, how to display a superior attitude in order to effectively use the communication on internet to their full interest, by using the circumstances frame of the dialogues. This include displaying lies as being facts with such a forcefullness as to convince others.
It is called: postsituationnisme, ideologie who is followed by YBM, together with a sympathie to the 3rd reich, and a, by some, called pseudo-Hégelianism.
YBM run his forum where he defend the man and his positions, with as much furore as he dispells those of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
You will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of """"mass communication"""" and a weapon to convince anyone of anything.
 
I am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle.
 
I hope you will excuse my very late assertion or révélation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years.
Actually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
 
No need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed.
 
Why so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met?
They were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions.

Here are some other links who do compleete the picture:
The first attacks of Voyer and YBM against XAVIER, the writer:

YBM Web site:
 http://aeamh.free.fr
Site Voyer:
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/

I consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J. Baez paper on the subject if it hadn't been for Messager and Voyers' questionnable work in the name of very questionnable motives, all accomplished to serve a completely useless ideology.
I think that this will teach us all a lesson regarding objectivity and our hability to evaluate a given problem properly, and to be able to use our sense of sceptisisme ans sound judgement.  On a more general way and even more central here, our power to distinguish between agreeing to a given opinion based on facts, and being manipulate in doing so for all the wrong reasons.
 
This information compleete the picture and gave it its true mening, even if it is by showing how meningsless a huge part of this affair was.

I wrote the paragraph quoting Lindley that Peter finds puzzling. Bayes' theorem can be expressed in the form

Posterior probability = Prior probability x Likelihood

If the prior is zero then so is the posterior, since zero times anything equals zero. A similar argument applies if the pror is 1. The likelihood is the part which mathematically models the information content of the data. In the case where the prior is zero it makes no difference what the likelihood is, since it just gets multiplied by zero to make zero. So by choosing a prior probability of zero (or one) you cut yourself off from the ability to take on board the informaton contained in the data. I hope this helps. 23:21, 19 September",0

 Talk: WikiProject Comics

Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics is on the watchlist of numerous editors, so if you could stop crowding it with nonsense that would be nice. Cheers.   
It wasn't nonsense. A topic was brought up regarding the contents of a certain story arc, and since it extensively quoted my story, character archetypes, scenes, etcetera, I very honestly filled in what the thematics were, as I am chronically upfront and very impulsive, but also tend to rethink and fix things I do that might have been a bad idea.  
Some of the involved people (or at least Kurt Parker used some of their catchphreases regarding me, whereas I remember Joe Quesada mentioning that he considers """"Spidey"""" his favourite fan several years ago), censored it.  I do have a problem with that the ones responsible didn't just talk with me directly from the start and explain the situation clearly, rather than attacking, and then didn't even have the decency to actually stand for the very statistically unlikely yet real ridiculously extreme hate-tirade against me.

Yet I've apparently got lots of western comics crossover, movies, tv series, computer games, books, and manga inexplicably focusing extensively on me in some kind of vendetta for a long time, which is extremely confusing for somebody literalminded with limited sensory filters like myself.

 Incorrect translation of quotations and improper combination of quotations from source 

In the discussion of the Pope's positions on poverty and inequality, there is an overly literal and incorrect translation of a quote from La Nación. When interpreting or translating, the goal is to accurately convey meaning and ideas, not words, from the source language to the target language. Also, the Wikipedia entry takes from the La Nación article two different quotes and combines them as if they were a single quote. It is inappropriate to treat exact quotations in such a manner. The discussion of the Pope´s comments about the poor should be re-written as follows: During a May 2010 speech in Argentina regarding the poor, he chastised """"the comfortable"""" whom """"avoided considering""""  the poor, saying: """"We have no right to look away, to turn down the arms raised by the desperate."""" rodneygriffith""",0

 Stillman inference 

a paragraph in the article, citing pp 14-16 of Stillman's 1979 work, reads as follows:

According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself and avoid being accused of double standards given the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir. Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.

however, the only relevant discussion i found was this (p.15):

When all hope was gone they [i.e. Qurayza] sought to surrender on the same terms as had the Naḍīr. This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā c at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery. Muhammad then declared that this was none other than Allah's decision. Actually, it is clear from the Muslim sources that the Qurayza's fate had been decided even before their surrender. One of Muhammad's emissaries, Abū Lubāba, who had advised the Qurayẓa to give up, had to perform penance for hinting to the Jews what their real fate would be.

Stillman doesn't state or imply that Muhammad deferred judgement to Sa'd in order to avoid accusations of double standards (especially when he openly endorsed the decision), so i believe this is original research. what seems more apparent is that, because of the Awsites protesting, it was Sa'd (Aws chieftain) who was chosen to pronounce the judgement, as they may have been more accepting of the decree if it came from their tribal leader.again, with the second sentence in the article, i do not see how the solitary sentence discussing Abu Lubaba substantiates what has been written, or where Stillman is making any """"infer[ences]"""" that Banu Qurayza's fate had already been decided by Muhammad before their surrender.  
This is clear from the last two sentences of the excerpt. The first sentence states the conclusion; the second contains the premise.  Or 
could you also address the first point?  
This is clear from the following setences:This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery.
 Or 
i have provided that extract above, and commented on it: Stillman doesn't state or imply that Muhammad deferred judgement to Sa'd in order to avoid accusations of double standards (especially when he openly endorsed the decision), so i believe this is original research. what seems more apparent is that, because of the Awsites protesting, it was Sa'd (Aws chieftain) who was chosen to pronounce the judgement, as they may have been more accepting of the decree if it came from their tribal leader.

Elonka and I have seriously different intentions for this article, and that difference should be worked out by discussion.

 I think the harcourt article is excellent, both because it provides additional context (particular in regards to the '19 and '28 weimar law), and in fact directly agrees to the basic premise of the argument.  It is widely accepted (harcourt, library of congress) that the early laws were targeted directly against the Nazis, and other paramilitary groups that were threatening, and attempting to overthrow the weimar republic. (The government having effectively disarmed by the surrender terms of wwI was unable to control the armed groups engaging in what we today would probably term gang warfare). As late as '32 Heinrich Bruening attempted to ban the SA and SS (see rise and fall of the 3rd reich) (Ironically setting up the situation that enabled the Nazis to legally take control). The subsequent laws enacted by Hitler were to a) rearm the nazis, in particular the private army SAs. 2) ensure familiarazation of  the about to be conscripted public with firearms usage. 3)ensure the  disarm all political opponents, specifically calling out jews.  Harcourt repeatedly and explicitly gives up the game - sure he disagrees with the NRAs use of nazi imagery in modern debate. Yes he says """"the nazi's were not in general pro gun control"""".  Both of those prior arguments are straw men, which do not in any way disprove the core history being argued - the core history which Harcourt specifically and explicitly admits to """"Hitler imposed regulations prohibiting Jewish persons from possessing any dangerous weaponsincluding firearms. The Nazi regime implemented this prohibition by confiscating weapons, including guns, from Jewish persons, and subsequently engaged in genocide of
the Jewish population"""" or """"To be sure, the Nazis were intent on killing Jewish persons and used the gun laws and regulations to further the genocide"""". Nobody disagrees that Hitler armed his private army (SA, party), while disarming the people he was about to exterminate. Harcourt discusses this directly as well, quoting The Nazi minister of the interior """"“If these provisions guarantee that no enemies of the National Socialist state possess any weapons, then it is justifiable and appropriate to relax the current limiting provisions of the Weapons Law for the population faithful to the state"""". To  (Saul)WP:FRINGE You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. (/Saul) What part is fringe? That the nazis implemented gun control?

WhoMe's new introduction

After the last few days many of us from both sides of the fence had worked out an informative introduction that was both clear and covered the main points. Most importantly it described the view of the official body for naming astronomical nomenclature and combined both their working definition for extrasolar planets and their more recent definition for out own solar system in a clear fashion to inform people in the opening paragraph. The new intro is junk. Please can we amend this without having an edit war.  

Having looked at the lastest changes/reverts/whatever made by yourself, I find the recent changes to be much clearer than when I originally started discussing this controversy.  Despite many objections on both sides, the article is much clearer.  I'm assuming here that what is currently is what you want the article to look like.  I certainly won't start an edit war over it! I've never participated in an edit war and I don't intend to start now. —  (comment)  

Actually, I would have preferred just listing """"A planet is officially defined as..."""" but now it has been amended so:
a) there are links a the naming dispute both in the first sentence as well as the sandbox
b) it is not listed as the official definition, just as a definition by the IAU
c) it is noted that this is recent and also that there were alternate lists before this
d) there is link to the astrology article that defines planet differently
e) there is a quantifier to say it may not be universally accepted.
I think not to address the IAU definition in the introduction is more POV than including it, giving its significance. We have already given it far less credit than all reports in the mainstream and scientific media.  

Well at least one entry (d) does not need to be there.  I added it to the disambiguation page, so that should be sufficient.  There is no need to list it on this page explicitly. —  (comment)  

I felt that seeing that the astrology term described many of the same objects as the astronomy term there should be a direct link, especially given the dispute over Pluto, which, as you rightly pointed out, will still be counted by many astronomers. However, if you still feel it should be taken out I won't object. And for the record, despite the initial clash of heads I've enjoyed working with you on this and you have persuaded me to be a lot closer to your view. Thanks.  

I'm not terribly concerned about the astrology link, one way or another.  It isn't intrusive.  As for this discussion, I really havn't even been editing the article or really following the changes as closely as others have been.  This discussion is so time consuming!  When I first ran accross the article I was deeply concerned with the slant, but there has been a lot of work.  I still have issues with using the word """"official"""", since only 424 persons out of 2,411 (approximately 18%) who attended the IAU assembly even voted on the issue and there are enough published articles showing the controversy that the vote has caused.  With that said, the introductory paragraph does a good job at mentioning the lack of a historical scientific agreement for the definition of planet.  This balance may be sufficient to show all sides on this debate.  I might like it if it was the """"official scientific body"""", because surely there are no other organizations that can make that claim and it still leaves room for """"unofficial cultural definitions"""", such as those widely used by the general public. Ironically, I think the article may now focus a little too much attention on the naming controversy.  I would put """"Definition"""" and """"Disagreement"""" under the main heading of """"Etymology"""".  I think it would flow better and put less emphasis on the controversy.  Afterall, the definition of the word is what Etymology is all about, and the controversy occurred chronologically after the information currently under the heading of Etymology. —  (comment)

"FK Vardar 

FK Vardar is a Macedonian Football club, the club changed its name several times during its history, from original Vardar in 1911 to Citizens Football Club Vardar or just Citizens( Gragjanski in Macedonian ) in 1920, then Football Club Makedonija in 1946 and finally back to FC Vardar in 1947. By the name FC Citizens( Vardar ) the club won 4 championships from 1936 till 1939. About Yugoslavia, you have to know that Yugoslavia was a federation of 6 Republics -countries together and each Republic had its own championship, and there was a Federal League where teams from the Republics competed together. Each Republic had its own Cup and the cup winners competed in the Marshals Cup, that cup was held in honor of Joseph Broz the marshal of the Federation, and its was called the Cup of the Marshal. How ever FC Vardar never won the Federal league ( League made of Federation of 6 Republics best teams ,thats why its called the Federal League, and not Yugoslavian League nor Yugoslavian Cup). The title in 1987 was won by FC Partizan Belgrade , you can check in any official statistics or documents. The second federal league was made of two Second Federal Leagues , East ( 3 Republics competed, Serbia ,Monte Negro,Macedonia and two Provinces- almost the same as Republics but yet without a nation ,those were Kosovo and Vojvodinship ) and West ( 3 Republics, Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia, sometimes clubs from province Vojvodinship  would compete in the West depending on the federation decisions ). In the period of 1922 till 1929, present day Republic of Macedonia was established as 4 provinces within the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes, those 4 provinces were Skopje, Bitola,Shtip and Vranje prvinces. These 4 provinces established the Macedonian Football Federation in 1926,and they held 3 championships. In 1929 these 4 provinces joined in one Duchy and this championship was held in the Duchy ( Banovina ) for 11 times.During the WW2 the championship was held under German Occupation, and the German government recognized this League. After the WW2 the very same championship was tranformed in to Republic Football League ,just the Province of Vranje was separated from the Republic as Macedonia transformed from Duchy to a Republic and the province of Vranje was under the newly made Republic of Serbia in 1946. The bottom line is since the Federation of 6 Republics split in the 90s, Macedonian Republic League was transformed in to Macedonian First League. So it is the same League that changed names and competition format during the decades, and now it came to this Level. Its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the Macedonia and other Republics in the Federation , by the Serbian side. Serbian official politic is to show that Yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on Serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football. They are trying to show the world that there was Yugoslav nation ( Serb ) and only Yugoslav Football league ( Serb League ) denying the Federal League second Federal League and Republic Leagues. They want to show only Yugoslav League and not the real Federal League. They hold all the champions from the Federal League as Serbian Champions in every competition. For FC Vardar at this point of view considering that  Macedonia is not in the Federetion for more than 20 years,and it wont be in the future ,the most important are the titles and trophies won in the Macedonian League , and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the Federation ,the period before 1991 you should write the precise information. Second Federal League East is the name of the competition, and you should put the Macedonian Flag from that period of the time next to it,instead of the federal flag, simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation. About the cup , you should write down the real proper name as it was called ,Marshals Cup also fallowed by Macedonian flag from that period of the time, you should put a notice that in the Federal Second League East , clubs from Serbia Macedonia and Monte Negro competed including the provinces of Kosovo i Vojvodinship.",0

 ISBN of Portrait of the Cheshire Lines Committee 

Hi, following up on your revert of my (and 's) changes to Ainsdale Beach railway station.

"""*I want to echo reading over the reliable sources guidelines. The problem is that almost all of the sources you added to the article for Devil Shit are inappropriate for Wikipedia in general in various ways. Merchant sources such as iTunes are wildly inappropriate to use as sources in any way, shape, or form. Their primary purpose is to sell you something and regardless of the information they impart, they should never be used as a reliable, trivial, or even primary source. Secondly, the YouTube links are almost entirely unusable as many are not uploaded by the people that created the music or represent the artist. This is seen as a copyright violation and it's also something that shouldn't be linked to. In almost every case the only time you should link to a video is if it gives notability... which none of these do. Thirdly, the rest of the links are primary, which will never, ever, ever give notability. Never. You could have a primary source that establishes that someone won a Grammy for a devil shit song, but it still can't give notability. You should only list primary sources after you have a reliable source posted by a non-involved second party. The other problem is that with a lot of these sources the claims of devil shit aren't backed up in the actual source. For instance, this Twitter account doesn't say anything about the artist creating anything in this music genre. Saying that the artist performs devil shit based solely on the Twitter account is considered to be original research. You need reliable second party things that back up the information, but even then you have to understand that verification that the genre is performed by notable or non-notable persons is not enough to show notability for the genre to have an article. A genre can exist, but existing is not notability. Even if you re-add all of the sources and the performers without Wikipedia articles, that won't show that the genre is notable. If anything, it actually does a little more to injure the case here than to show notability. If you have 80+ sources, all of which are unusable for notability purposes and most of which are linked to performers that don't have articles (which many automatically presume means """"non-notable"""" even if this isn't the case), then this tends to make many automatically assume that the topic in question is less notable, which means that they might not search as hard as they otherwise would. It's not right that this happens, but it happens. Sometimes in AfDs less is more.    (｡◕‿◕｡)

 Problems in section Governance/subsection Law 

The following paragraph reads:

""""France does not recognize religious law, nor does it recognize religious beliefs or morality as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. As a consequence, France has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws (the latter being abolished in 1791). However, """"offenses against public decency"""" (contraires aux bonnes mœurs) or disturbing public order (trouble à l'ordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution. With such emphasis on public order, laws sentencing racism, sexism or antisemitism are also old and important. For instance, laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881.[93] Some consider however that hate speech laws in France are too broad or severe and damage freedom of speech.""""

This has to be removed, or at least re-written, because it is incorrect, and not supported by the source given. The fact that France does not recognize religious law is true, this can and should stay. The fact that is doesn't recognize 'morality' as a source of law is not. If so, why was adultery illegal until 1975?? Even worse, why were 'children born from adultery' discriminated in inheritance up until 2001(!), when France was forced to change its law by the European Court of Human Rights ?? In regard to sexism, which is addressed here - France was one of the last Western countries to recognize the rights of women - vote for women only in 1944, women could not work without the consent of husband until 1965, leniency for 'crimes of passion' under the Napoleonic Code etc. Let's not even open this subject... Also the source given does not support what the paragraph is saying, it only explains some laws against racism and antisemitism. I'm removing the paragraph.  """,0

"Ernie Smith writes Æµ§œš¹

Æµ§œš¹, I have a point of information.  Is the “In an exclusively US context” section a part of the article being discussed?   For, in this section I find the following very misleading statement: “In 1996, the term became widely known in the U.S. owing to a controversy over a decision by the Oakland School Board to denote and recognize the primary language (or sociolect or ethnolect) of African American children attending school, and thereby to facilitate the teaching of standard English.[12] Thereafter, Ebonics seems to have become little more than an alternative term for African American Vernacular English, although one emphasizing its claimed African roots and independence from English, a term linked with the nationally discussed controversy over the decision by the Oakland School Board, and one avoided by most linguists.[13] “   I pose this question because I have just received a translation from the Romulus and Remus Linguistic Institute.   It appears there is an effort being made to cover–up some very, very inept and ersatz scholarship at Wikipedia encyclopedia by simply declaring my analysis of the Oakland Ebonics Controversy as something that pertains only to that article when in fact the words “For more details on this topic, see Oakland Ebonics controversy” , the words Oakland School Board (twice) and  ‘sociolect’, ‘ethnolect’ and ‘African American Vernacular English’ appear under the heading “In an exclusively US context”.    My analysis of the Oakland Ebonics controversy” was about  ‘Ebonics’ the langauage of limited English proficient (LEP) English language learners (ELL) of African ancestry in the OSUD African diaspora.   I maintain that when a counterfeiter puts the name ‘Rolex’ on a one jewel, gold plated, Hong Kong watch, this does not make a one jewel, gold plated, Hong Kong watch a genuine Rolex.  I likewise maintain that when ignorant white trash and dumb Negro Sheepdogs that nurse at the udder of white supremacits trash use the word Ebonics as a synonynm for and African American Vernacular English this does not make Ebonics an African American Vernacular of English.

"""Pseudoscience Category ==

I feel strongly that this article should be moved away from the pseudoscience category, as it does fulfill any of WIkipedia's requirements of pseudoscience. Wikipedia states:

Other things usually should not be called pseudoscience on Wikipedia:

Alternative theoretical formulations: Alternative theoretical formulations from within the scientific community, such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics as opposed to dark matter, are not pseudoscience, but part of the scientific process. Such theoretical formulations may fail to explain some aspect of reality, but, should they succeed in doing so, will usually be rapidly accepted. For instance, the theory of continental drift had quite a lot of evidence, but was heavily criticised because there was no known mechanism for continents to move, and thus such evidence was dismissed. When such a mechanism was discovered, it became mainstream as plate tectonics.

To determine whether something falls into the category of pseudoscience or merely an alternative theoretical formulation, consider this: Alternative theoretical formulations generally tweak things on the frontiers of science, or deal with strong, puzzling evidence which it is difficult to explain away, in an effort to create a model that better explains reality. Pseudoscience generally proposes changes in basic scientific laws or reality in order to allow some phenomenon which the supporters want to believe occurs, but lack the strong scientific evidence that would justify such major changes. Pseudoscience usually relies mainly on weak evidence, such as anecdotal evidence or weak statistical evidence at just above the level of detection, though it may have a few papers with positive results, for example: parapsychology and homeopathy.

""""AIDS denialists"""" are not proposing a new form of science based on non-scientific methods, they are merely disputing that the claims that other scientists make, and these disputes arise ENTIRELY from science. In fact, """"AIDS denialists"""" claim that MAINSTREAM scientists are not using science correctly. In fact, all they are doing is asking for scientific proof of what the mainstream scientific community insists exists but can't verify.

As the editor 148.247.186.142 has pointed out, Mexico could buy weapons produced in Argentina, or use the Argentinian companies as intermediaries. Moreover, as the same editor also pointed out, the 75% of the fuel used by the British Royal Navy in 1917 was produced in Mexico. Hence, without fuel the British Royal Navy could not control the Atlantic shipping lanes at all. Actually, it is not a coincidence that the UK took Persia in the partition of the Ottoman empire of 1918, considering the fact that the Anglo-Persian oil company was founded there in 1908; and the UK had learnt the lesson: it is really dangerous to depend exclusively on the oil produced in only one foreign country. Well, they learnt the lesson until the oil crisis of 1973. Finally, let us also recall that the US made plans in 1917-1918 for invading Mexico and taking control of Tampico oil fields, but the US also calculated that Mexicans would set in fire the oil fields before they could arrive there; the classical scorched earth technique applied by the Russians against Napoleon and Hitler.

Usually people does not take into consideration that Mexico had a super-weapon in 1917: the oil fields, because mass production of oil in Saudi Arabia began until 1945.189.203.69.72  """,0

Seksen the 10,000 turkish-cypriots who were protesting a few months ago (see this) were not protesting against the world (no country imposed any embargoe on North Cyprus). The protests were aimed at Turkey and the imposed austerity measures and the fact that they want to be independent and manage their own affairs. So effectively they feel they're not independent but under occupation (or if you don't like the word, under the """"control"""" of Turkey).  Back to the issue, the Nicosia article should have the same information/structure as the Cyprus article. In fact the the TRNC (or the occupation for that matter) isn't even mentioned in the Cyprus infobox. That's why North Cyprus exists. We have to be consistent. Otherwise what's the point of having North Nicosia? Lefkoşa Distict should be mentioned there.

"Hi Mary. I'm not going to bother adding anything to the Trance page, as that fellow Roux and his minions monitor what I say, to silence it before the public gets to read it. I suspect this has to do with the somewhat decline in Trance popularity starting in 2008. Last year I would go on this page to write about the trends of Trance, and they experienced a backlash, as their chosen leader (Armin) had not lost the polls yet. They couldn't believe that the trends could possibly be changing for the next generation in the dance scene. They experienced personal feelings of hatred towards me, thinking I was a House only propagator. In reality I am actually a Trance DJ, but don't tell them this, as it makes the whole situation even more fun for me. That said, there is no point in me adding stuff to the page because it will be deleted. I am currently writing a very complicated article on dance music if you want to proof read it, find a way to provide me with an e-mail address if you want.

The history of Trance is very complicated. For one thing, to put it simply, Trance isn't really a genre of music. (I hate to put it this bluntly and it kind of sounds crazy). This is why you can't find information. The Snoman section on Trance in his published book is mostly false hopes. When people do write about it, it is often from the perspective of industry interests who have equity stakes in the genre, so they often 'invent information' in attempts to keep the label in the media. Most of these clever music terms are the inventions of the English ) Sneaky buggers.

As Armin puts it, it is more 'A state of trance' like his show is titled. This observation is correct. It doesn't matter what its called, as long as its good. What he means when he says Trance is a state of mind, is that it is not some formulaic equation that determines what is and what isn't. All of these labels are just styles and buzz-words. You will find difficulty locating written information on Trance because it is just another offshoot of House, one of the many. The articles that you will find are probably from punters who came out of the Tiesto generation. Tiesto is in fact a House DJ, but don't tell punters this, or they may commit suicide. Many have currently experienced heart attacks or early menopause, when they found out Tiesto went back to a House sound now. Good Luck.",0

Comment.  It's confusing enough that I am not sure what """"disagree"""" means in this conversation.  A quick run through my sources indicates that """"folk costume"""", """"folk dress"""", """"national dress"""", """"ethnic costume"""", """"traditonal dress"""" etc. are all used pretty much interchangeably.  I would support a move to """"folk costume"""" or """"folk dress"""" for the reasons cited above, but """"folk costume"""" should not be a subset of """"national dress"""" since modern political boundaries do not necessarily match either ethnic boundaries or political boundaries as they were at the time that folk dress was ossified (at least in Europe - as mentioned, some folk dress is still evolving).

[For what it's worth, I wouldn't characterize square dance clothes or bolo ties as folk dress - western wear is a modern retro concept based on romanticized notions of 19th century clothing, and bolo ties are a modern invention!  But bolo ties and cowboy shirts are certainly regional dress.]

By the way, the use of narrow use """"costume"""" to mean """"theatrical costume"""" is about as common as the use of """"dress"""" to mean """"a woman's garment with a skirt"""".  Both """"costume"""" and """"dress"""" have these narrow, non-specialist, everyday definitions which make it really difficult to decide what terms will be understood by users of Wikipedia.  """"Clothing"""" is probably the most neutral and inclusive term, but we struggle in choosing """"Medieval clothing"""" vs. """"Medieval costume"""" vs. """"Medieval dress"""".  And """"folk clothing"""" is not used in the specialist literature and sounds really dumb.  In the museum and art-historical worlds, """"costume"""" and """"dress"""" are both preferred terms.

OED definitions are pertinent here: 
COSTUME: The mode or fashion of personal attire and dress (including the way of wearing the hair, style of clothing and personal adornment) belonging to a particular nation, class, or period.
DRESS: Personal attire or apparel: orig. that proper to some special rank or order of person, or to some ceremony or function; but, in later use, often merely: Clothing, costume, garb, esp. that part which is external and serves for adornment as well as for covering.

 is right, in that there isn't a simple solution; we're going to have a ton of redirects and alterate terms whichever way we go.  Gievn the OED definitions, I'd say """"Folk costume"""" is more accurate.  But I personally prefer """"Folk dress"""", and I'd choose that over """"National dress"""". -   """,0

One thing that is needful to attain NPOV is to avoid stereotypes. You've just created one (above) though I doubt that you did it intentionally, as some other editors regularly do.

There are actually these extreme judgemental fundamentalists on both sides of the issue; only the guys in the white hats trade with the ones in the black hats. Witness the pro-homosexuals who use judgemental epithets (even on these talk pages) like bigot and homophobe. To get the page into NPOV we have to get past the stereotypes and the epithets.

Nancy Reagan

I didn't want to revert your edit without asking why you thought that we shouldn't refer to Ron Reagan as """"the late"""". This means the guy has dies, which is true. 

I think that we need to address a couple of issues there. To begin with, I understand your reasoning for not referring to a deceased person as """"the late so-and-so."""" To begin with, we aren't the World Book Encyclopedia; we are Wikipedia, with a different Manual of Style. I see nothing in there that directs us not to refer to the deceased as I have. The very fact that you have had long arguments about this suggests that it is a matter of contention, and not one that has been resolved with any finality. That being said, I did inquire with the Manual of Style folk regarding this matter. If they come back with the determination that """"the late"""" is not appropriate, i will remove the reference in the article myself. until then, I am going to reinsert the comment as is. 
As to the comments that most already know reagan is dead is not an entirely valid argument, aas WP is not a collection of links. We cite our work, yes, but each article should be able to stand on its own, without assuming information. There are people who don't know John McCartney was in a band before Wings, or that Jimmy Carter was a former US President. We assume nothing at Wikipedia. As well, we are not here to improve the print encyclopedias, and I am not sure where you arrived at that assumption.
As well, I am curious as to why your user page says that you have retired from Wikipedia when you are still editing.  

I can tell from the number of edits you have performed over this issue that you don't agree with my edit. I think that if you wish to address Wikipedia policy, you should do so in either MOS or at the Village Pump. If you wish to discuss the matter, then do so in the Discussion area for the article. Please do not assume an editorial policy that is not in existence. 
Again, why does your User Page state that you are no longer contributing to Wikipedia?

Referring to the recently deceased as """"the late"""" belongs no where in Wikipedia.  Thanks for taking notice of this overused and imprecise phrase and deleting it throughout Wikipedia.

I gave the links out before on Jimbo's page but here's one person who should have been blocked indef. That whole block log is a joke. So he continues today making personal attacks, rude and aggressive comments (,) and he's allowed to roam free - all because the founder isnt tough enough. In addition to that ofcourse other users () and so on. In trying to tolerate dissident voices as you said, we're now in a situation where other editors have to take in abuse from trolls who are well aware of the power they command here.

"JON R. CAVAIANI
SERGEANT MAJOR (RETIRED)
Jon R. Cavaiani was born in Murphys, Ireland and sent to England in 1943.
He came to the United States in 1947 and in 1953 moved to the small farming community of Ballico, California to be with his stepfather, Ugo Cavaiani. In 1961 Ugo formally adopted Jon and in 1968 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

Jon Cavaiani joined the U.S. Army in 1969. He volunteered for Special Forces where he spent the next 17 years. Cavaiani was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions while a platoon leader on an isolated radio relay site deep in enemy territory. Jon was serving with the studies and observations group (SOG), an elite reconnaissance unit when he was written up for the Medal of Honor for his actions on 4 and 5 June, 1971, in Vietnam. Eleven days after this action, wounded and still trying to evade the enemy, Jon was captured and spent the next 23 months as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.

His other assignments included tours in the Middle East, South America, Europe and Southeast Asia. Jon spent three years in Berlin, Germany as the Senior Operations Sergeant Major for British, French and U.S. Forces. He was selected and assigned to the United States’ most elite Counter-Terrorist Force.

Upon retiring, Jon has made time available to serve as the 6th region director of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. Cavaiani recently graduated with honors from the culinary arts program in Columbia, Ca., where he and his wife Barbara live. Jon has three grandsons and two granddaughters.

Among his numerous awards and decorations are the nation’s highest award for valor, the Army Medal of Honor; the Legion of Valor, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal (Valor), Purple Heart with oak leaf clusters. Jon was a freefell and static line jumpmaster and has over 5,000 jumps all over the world.",0

 Perhaps the addition of a discussion of Jerry Pournelle's Iron Law of Bureaucracy will provide sufficient amplification of the typical American attitude toward this institution to account for the negative connotation almost universally accorded the concept of bureaucracy in American culture, in which the bureaucratic imperative — however it manifests — is utterly despised. Indeed, Pournelle's relatively dispassionate criticism of bureaucracy may not go far enough to accurately convey the pure hatred held by the average American for bureaucrats and everything having to do with the institution of bureaucracy in both the private and the public sectors. It does not (for example) address the bureacrat's propensity for sloughing responsibility:

""""There's a reason bureaucrats are seen as ass-coverers whose foremost priority is to ensure that they're never accountable for anything. It's because many bureaucrats really are ass-coverers whose overriding priority is to ensure that they're never accountable for anything. As a corollary, if things go wrong, support for the idea that you predicted it may be helpful in building your bureaucracy's importance at the expense of its rivals.

""""This is as true within corporations as it is in the public sector or the military. If you've spent much time in the working world, you've seen this tendency in action."""" 

 ...which is (in American eyes) particularly despicable for its abject cowardice as well as its wastefulness, ineffectiveness, and inherently obstructionist effects.

 Hm. And while we're at it, how come we're not discussing the sheer Vogosity of bureaucracy?

 This attitude toward the bureaucrats doesn't really seem to be an exclusively American peculiarity at all, does it?""",0

"USS NAUTILUS SSN-571 Collision with USS ESSEX CVS-9, April 1967 

I was a junior officer serving in ESSEX in 1967 as a CICWO. At the time of the collision I was soundly asleep in the junior officer bunkroom tucked under the flight deck in the forward section of the ship (We were standing Port and Starboard watches under Condition 1 AS, a modifified form of anti-submarine battle stations) when a loud noise was heard and a brief shudder passed through ESSEX, a 29k ton anti-submarine aircraft carrier. ESSEX went promptly to general quarters which is standard operating procedure for protecting a naval ship in the case of a collision of unknown proportions or a fire not under control as the crew immediately mans their battle ststions, including manning damage control parties, and sets Condition Zebra which secures all water-tight hatches throughout the ship.

ESSEX, her task group comprised of several destroyer and destroyer escorts, and NAUTILUS were conducting exercises in the Virginia Capes Operations Area (VACAPESOPAREA. ESSEX was being replenished underway by a fleet oiler and both ships were being screened by the escorts. The wind was backing and the UNREP ships were altering ROMEO CORPEN (replenishment course) five degrees to port to put the relative wind 355 degree relative to their ship's head. NAUTILUS successfully penetrated the screen and was simulating torpedo attacks when she apparently miscalculated either her submerged depth and/or the course of the mainbody. NAUTILUS's conning tower struck ESSEX which draws 29 to 30 feet depending on how she is loaded, on the forward port quarter of her bow-mounted SONAR. NAUTILUS was believed to roll to starboard and to pass under ESSEX keel rerighting herself as she executed an emergency surfacing procedure in he vicinity of ESSEX elevator on her starboard side, some 500-600 feet from her bow. 

NAUTILUS appeared as though the forward leading corner of her sail area had been bitten cleanly off. Injuries were minor to two NAUTILOS crewman and to a Sonarman First Class in ESSEX. NAUTILUS did not suffer any apparent damage to her nuclear reactor or powerplant. No leaks of radioactive material were reported as testimony to her thorough construction. ESSEX's bow mounted sonar was badly dented/deformed but the ship's water-tight integrity was never breached, and she transited to the Boston Naval Shipyard for repairs and deployed in late May 1967 for an EASTLANT NATO Anti-submarine exercise (ASWEX).",0

1. Karadžić was/is esteemed as an ethnographer, reformer of Serbian langauge and culture, as well as folklorist.

2. Karadžić's work consisted, among other things, in misappropriation of Croatian cultural heritage 8the balald """"Hasanaginica"""", first published by Fortis, has nothig to do with Serbs-or, Bosnian Muslims, for that matter. It is a purely croatian song which VK """"sold"""" as a """"Serbian song"""".) Also, his work in lexicography is unthinkable without Croatian heritage-for instance, in his 1847 translation of the New Testament, he explicitely stated he had coined ca. 300 new words. Later investigations http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~vbockho/vbockhopublikationen.htm have shown that Vuk has simply took more than 90% of his """"new words"""" from Joakim Stulli's Croatian dictionary.

3. but, it's the ideology that matters. Starčević had completely unmasked Karadžić's myth on štokavians-Serbs. And this part of Karadžić's ideology is what even contemporary Croatian linguists find reprehensible: http://www.matica.hr/MH_Periodika/vijenac/1999/135/tekstovi/08.htm, http://www.matica.hr/MH_Periodika/vijenac/1999/138/tekstovi/06.htm

Questioning minor 1st paragraph edits?
Re: John Roberts, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sandra Day O'Connor
This is a small matter.  I don't understand the reasons for 's recent minor edits of articles about each of the Justices of the Supreme Court.  After some time, there has been no response to inquiries posted on this editor's talk page nor has there been feedback from similar postings on the talk pages of each of the nine articles about a sitting Justice and the one about retired Justice O'Connor.  Rather than simply reverting this """"improvement,"""" I thought it best to solicit comment from others who might be interested. I found your name amongst others at Talk:Supreme Court of the United States.

I'm persuaded that 's strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is unhelpful in this narrow set of articles  that is, in Wikipedia articles about Justices of the Supreme Court. I think my reasoning might well extend as well to others on the Federal bench.  In each instance, I would question adding this information only in the first paragraph  not elsewhere in the article.  

In support of my view that this edit should be reverted, please consider re-visiting articles written about the following pairs of jurists.
 A1. Benjamin Cardozo
 A2. Learned Hand
 B1. John Marshall Harlan
 B2. John Marshall Harlan II
The question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not.

Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty do wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. 

Less humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.

As you can see, I'm questioning relatively trivial edit; but I hope you agree that this otherwise plausible """"improvement"""" should be removed from introductory paragraphs of ten articles.  If not, why not? 

Would you care to offer a comment or observation?   """,0
"""

These are still very weak sources. Apart from the piece by Lloyd, which appears to be an undergraduate project as discussed above, what you've added is the abstract of a non-peer-reviewed paper presented at the annual meeting of an association, and a lecture handout that appears to have been put online by its author. None of your three sources support the sentence """"The Roman constitution had three main powers...""""; as I've already discussed above, Lloyd describes Polybius as seeing the Roman constitution this way, not Montesquieu. So I'm going to remove this sentence, again.

The rest of your additions can remain, I think, and I will also format the references you added.  (talk) """,0

i would suggest to remove the passage about the mode of action of deet.this is speculaton and not proven. based on the NOR guidelines i cant say its wrong, but my data suggest that it might be not correct (blood substitute with ATP as sole attractant is also 'protected' by DEET (while there is no lactic acid...).   

Removed the """"natural alternatives"""" or actually added a question mark. Added refs to show that these """"alternatives"""" do not work. Also removed various distinctions between """"natural"""" and """"synthetic"""". There is no difference between a molecule synthesised chemically and naturally. Last: DEET is a repellant, NOT an insecticide.  

Made new page on DEET, using material gleaned largely from the CDC and EPA pages, and a couple of studies on health effects and insect-repellant effectiveness (from Google).  Although a bunch of the pages say one should be careful only to wear DEET when necessary, not under clothing, etc., they don't spell out why they're concerned.  I'm guessing DEET is chemically nasty (is it an organo-phosphate?), and so may have carcinogenic or other unfortunate properties.  If someone knows (and ideally can show) what these suspected effects might be, I think a short (hopefully rational) addition to the DEET page is called for.   15:03, 20 Oct 2003 (UTC)

What was Charlie Coll's contribution? Some Canadians think he invented the stuff.  22:13, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Is it a poison? If so, what is the LD_50? Is it liquid or a gas or solid (at room temp and standard conditions)? Thanks.  

As mentioned in the article, its effect on the human body is not yet fully understood; it's ?gay? (eh? - Ed) and not an organophosphate (as seen from the chemical formula image) but the effect seen with leeches provides a clue as to what might happen if enough of it entered the body. The effect on leeches is added from my own experience, using a concentrated DEET stick (like a deodorant applicator) and only needing to touch the leech for it to convulse off. It's a liquid at rtp, as far as I can tell.  10:10, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
Be careful adding from your own experience. That basically violates the Wikipedia:No original research policy. But that's simple to avoid, since if you've seen the effect, most likely someone else has. Wikipedia needs to be a secondary source, citing other published sources. So find a published source that finds the same thing, and the addition would be much better. Also it is liquid, as long as the repellant product bottles that say they are 100% deet really are. Also, just eyeballing from it's structure, liquid looks about right. I read a bunch of studies on DEET, and they all basically say it is safe as far as they can tell, but avoid overexposure as much as possible. A very small percentage of the time, some people (12 if I recall the study correctly, out of a large population) have a reaction to DEET. Basically the 60 years it has been used and the large amount of usage is strong evidence that at least the stuff is not really really nasty. So the article looks pretty accurate in that respect. -  Talk 12:00, Jun 13, 2005 (UTC)
Whoops, didn't know about that. Thanks. I'll leave it in for the moment and will try to remember to do backup research when I get home; if anyone believes that the information is unreliable enough please feel free to mark it out, and I'll just have to find a better source than word of mouth from my parents at the time ;)
Later: Researched. Found a fair bit of anecdotal evidence but not enough hard evidence to keep my previous addition in. Also a 1998 study shows DEET may actually accelerate absorption through the skin, so going to revert the edit. Putting in a link with lots of detail I found to make myself feel better ;)  16:38, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
No worries. Now you know and can make great contributions. There are plenty of things to help out with, so do some research and add what you can. If you don't feel like doing that, just fix formatting errors and help link all the related concepts, etc. -  Talk 17:37, Jun 13, 2005 (UTC)

I would change a couple of the wordings from """"pesticide"""" to """"repellent"""" or """"chemical"""" so it does not imply that DEET functions as a pesticide. There seems to be a lot of confusion about that on various sites so perhaps it would be",0

Calm down, don't exert pressure when you can talk in normal tone.  Anyhow, I did provide evidence, but I guess your idea of evidence is a photograph or a video tape showing Shahrbanoo being dragged on sand by the Arabs.  So Ali knew Persian, eh?  I suppose you have evidence for this?  The page you asked me to click says Ali knew persian and furthermore it quotes a Shia hadith which claims the following masterpiece of comedy:
Ali, then came up to the princess and asked: """"What is your name?"""" The princess replied: """"The daughter of Jahan-shah"""". Ali said: """"and so Shahr-banuyeh you will be called"""" (""""the bride of the land"""").

Do you honestly believe that?!  That claim is embarrassingly stupid.  So what evidence you have that Ali knew Persian?  And what evidence you have that Shahrbanoo, who was clearly captured by the Arabs, married Hussayn willingly? Oh, and for your good information, there is plenty of solid historical evidence that her name was Shahrbanoo, and the Arabs didn't gave her that name.  Even if and Arab knew some Persian, what are the chances they knew the difference between the double meaning of """"land/country and city"""" for """"shahr""""?  At any rate, the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo, and if her name was given by Ali to her, the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name. Besides, didn't it occur to your brilliant mind that  if Ali was going to give her a name, he would have given her an Islamic name not  a Persian name?   06:52, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0

"Deletion review (Simon Strelchik) ==

Calton, it's hard to say what to do here. I have the feeling the whole sockpuppet thing is sort of like the O.J. case: the LAPD framed a guilty man. In other words, if all the puppets were subtracted from the three AfDs, I'm still not sure what the result would be. I'm guessing it would not be a consensus for deletion. (No, I'm not willing to do the math, but it looks like there have been a few attempts, themselves possibly puppet-infested.) 

I don't think the presence of sockpuppets supporting an article necessarily justifies its deletion, if the article is otherwise supportable. I think Canadian Federal election candidates from the major parties can reasonably be considered suitable for articles, but I can be persuaded otherwise. We'll see how it goes. In any case, thanks for the clarification about the accounts confirmed by CheckUser to be socks. (I agree that the whole VaughanWatch think, unlike Simon Strelchik et al., was totally out of control.) Cheers,  

Sir,
Having read your comments on this Deletion review, may I politely ask how many edits it is necessary to have undertaken (and am I right in assuming that you would only count constructive and unchallenged/unreverted edits) before one is qualified to comment on DRvs (and, I would assume, also AFD and similar issues) ??

Well first I am going to address some basic stuff that will help you ion the future.  Whenever you want to add a new topic to someones talk page, either click on the """"+"""" at the top of the page, and then fill in the header, or you can just add == (your header) == after clicking """"edit this page,"""" and then type your what you want under the header.  This creates the header that you see, which helps to keep convos organized, and after the 3rd or 4th header, your page will automatically have a table of contents, which helps for organization.  Secondly, and most importantly, whenever you add info to a talk page, always sign under your statement  by either typing ~~~~ or by clicking the little signature button in the edit toolbar, this generates your signature and a timestamp which links to your user page.  Now to address your concerns about the info into the article.  The main thing here on Wikipedia is that we cannot have original research which means that information cannot be added unless there is a respectable source to back it up, such as a website, news article, etc.  Just because someone read it somewhere or saw it on TV, doesn't mean it can or should be added to this encyclopedia.  Also Wikipedia is trying to clean up its trivia sections, because for the most part this type of information is not notable enough and it tends to be random.  These trivia sections also tend to be just lists of random information, which Wikipedia is not.  I would recommend that you just let it go, as more than likely, in some time (hopefully sooner than later) all this trivia information will be removed or added into the articles.  I hope you keep on editing though and try to make sure that you stay away from trivia, and to always source your edits.  Thanks!

Controversy:  Your point here is well taken but for the fact a person can be well aware of possible distinctions in terminology and still call a magazine a clip.  In actuality, it is the """"firearm experts"""" that insist on a controversy by way of insisting on their terminology.  In other words, because they have taken issue with the layman's wording they have indeed made it controversial and not the other way around.  So while the distinction in wording may not be controversial within their circle of buddies they are in fact responsible for the controversy.  

M-W Dictionary:  When I say """"the dictionary"""" clearly I'm referring to """"the dictionary"""" I cited before in this case M-W.  I am a """"cognitive miser"""" like anyone that takes short cuts when I can, just as you shortened it to M-W.  Rather than grasp at straws in dissecting ones arguments let us focus on the big picture when we know what each other means.  I agree the dictionary isn't for giving an exhaustive description, that's what encyclopedias are for.  However in this instance it does shed some light on """"the controversy"""" as it does indeed define a clip as also a magazine.  The reason for including it is not to give people a better understanding of the differences between types of clips or the different types of magazines.  The purpose of including it is to show the other side of the controversy and according to my research within Wikipedia this is entirely acceptable.  

Agreement: Clearly some people don't agree with M-W just as you and I don't agree with SAAMI's statement that people sometimes refer to """"cartridge clips"""" as """"magazines"""".  The """"experts"""" on weapon's have this fact somewhat backwards and are incorrect as they should state that people refer to """"magazines"""" as """"clips"""".  Just because you and I disagree with SAAMI's statement doesn't mean it should be taken out as a reference and I'd never suggest that.

What I suggest is a compromise.  I agree with you about the references regarding Remington and Marlin as that does seem to fall under OR.  M-W however doesn't fall under OR as it is a published source and being a leader in its industry it could be argued is the authority on word use.  Do you have any suggestions on how it could be incorporated so as to show how this controversy is perpetuated?  Without saying it's wrong because it clearly isn't according to common usage.  I'm thinking something like this....Clip technically defined.....use to describe magazine is controversial....however M-W defines it as such.

This allows readers to see their is a difference in terms, there is a controversy, and why it potentially exists or is perpetuated.  I think this is fair.  Note well that I never attempted to remove any sources that backed up what you're saying here.  I'm not interested in destroying your view, only presenting both sides fairly.  """,0

I thank you for your warning and I respect you administrating articles. However, I do not personally see my edit as vandalism. I do admit, however, that openly saying he is a """"crazed lunatic"""" was the incorrect way to go about doing things. I believe in the merits of wikipedia and that it should strive for truth and excellence. There is absolutely no place in the current article about Camping that states science disagrees with his statements. Instead, the only mentions of disagreement are """"As a result, some individuals have criticized him for 'date-setting'"""" and """"they [a ministry] believe his entire method of Bible interpretation is flawed."""" If you would like, I can pen a section about the invalidity of his arguments from a fact-based scientific stance. If I cannot do it, someone most certainly should. Otherwise, wikipedia is no more than a medium for which inaccurate science can propagate through the minds of the public. When looking at a page such as homeopathy's, the second sentence reads """"The collective weight of scientific evidence has found homeopathy to be no more effective than a placebo."""" Do you not think statements such as those made by Camping should get the same treatment? On a final note, 24 hours from now nearly the entire article I edited will be proven nonsense. The second sentence under this text box states """"Encyclopedic content must be verifiable."""" Yet, despite this, the second paragraph of his page states: 

""""He has used Bible-based numerology to predict dates for the end of the world.[2] His current end times prediction is that the Rapture will be on May 21, 2011 and that God will completely destroy the Earth and the universe five months later on October 21.[3][4] He had previously predicted that the Rapture would occur in September 1994.[5]""""

The only verifiable thing regarding these predictions is that they are wrong, yet that statement is nowhere to be found. Tomorrow evening, or Sunday if you wish, please add the sentence """"He was wrong about both of his previous predictions"""" to the opening paragraphs of his page.

This is one of those instances in which reductio ad absurdem is a helpful and persuasive rhetorical argument.  I get it.  I understand your point-of-view, and I'm sympathetic.  I'm not even disagreeing.  I only explain that disambiguation for the ships of the CP fleet is informed by a consensus:
(a) I understand that this consensus is not one which you unquestioningly accept. 
(b) You clarify the ambit of this """"consensus"""" by pointing to Wikipedia:Naming conventions (ships). 
You announce that your background has to do with articles about military ships, and this informs my measured and somewhat cautious response.

However, the relevancy of lawsuits, even when they are through and the court has published an opinion, requires interpretation by another party prior to their being used as a reliable, secondary or tertiary source in an encyclopedia article.

When editors say that the company is controversial and add multiple lawsuits filed against the company as direct support of the controversy the editors are providing their original research and opinion about the company. Wikipedia has a policy of No original research, and all of these lawsuits must be removed and the underlying statements that are supported solely by the lawsuits must be removed.

"Hi Scorpion,. I'm a bit aggravated as I provided a valid source from Canada's Walk of Fame saying that Ryan Reynolds will not be inducted on October 1, 2011 like it states in your edit. The way that you put is that we should ignore the source and just merge the columns on  the night of October 1, but according to sources, Reynolds will be unable to attend and he will be inducted at a later date, and will not be featured on the televised gala. It states that he will be inducted at a later date whether it be 2011 or 2012. (We don't know the specifics) If you merge the two columns on October 1, you are providing an untruth with regards as not all announced 2011 inductees will be inducted on the same day.  WWe should keep Ryan Reynolds seperate from the other inductees until we know for sure when he will be able to get his star.

I'm sorry to get angry at you, but I think I am within the right to add this edit on to the page because I provided a valid source from the official commitee that says that one person's involvement has been postponed, and all that you are doing is reverting my edits, trying to sweep this fact under the carpet. As you said in your previous edit, why should it matter if the two columns will be merged in a month? Well, I thought Wikipedia was based on facts and sources, which I thought I had provided and you are selectfully omitting certain details thus allowing some inconsistencies in the article itself. You are the one that will be merging the two columns, and I don't think it would be fair and truthful to just merge Ryan Reynolds along with the other 2011 inductees into the main grid, if we still do not know when he will get inducted. That's what's getting me upset at your ways at handling the page. I did nothing wrong, just provided a valid source and I truly believe that tthere should be some sort of indication on the page at least that Ryan Reynold could not attend on October 1 due toi a scheduling conflict until we know of what will happen with Ryan Reynolds and Canada's walk of Fame.

+170º Elevation?

So with the turret facing forward, after the gun becomes completely vertical it can now swing to point literally backwards to form a 10º angle with the upper part of the rear of the vehicle? That would be an almost ridiculous design (for starters, why would a 90º+ degree elevation be desirable at all? Maybe someone thought the vehicle should be able to self-destruct that way?). Obviously there's a mistake, both in the article and the source. 

The vehicle has a +70º elevation, which seems more logical. (FOSS, CHRISTOPHER F. """"Jane's Tanks and combat vehicles recognition guide"""" 2ed. Harper Collins 2000, pp.432)

"Jim

I am new to Wikipedia but seek to make sure the informamtion is correct.  According to BPL (SIC?) rules any information that is unsourced or of a dubious source is to be removed.  In the article Jung Myong Seok I take issue with citations 11, 12, and  13.

11 Is attributed to a French sociologist Ms Nathalie Luca.  Problem is the citiation page does not support the claim that JMS was a member of the Unification Church. Additionally there is an out of place British flag on the top of the citation page which does not fit CNRS country of orgin- France. Therefore,  I do not only doubt the authenticity of the citation but it does nothing to support the claim made in the body of the article.

12 Citation leads to a link titled Radio Australia with 5 poorly written sentences that describe a supposed historical timeline.  The article has no reference to primary sources AND does not even have a listed author.  It gives me the impression that someone robbed a page from Radio Australia and wrote whatever suited their needs. Furthermore, the information contradicts what was written in paragraph 3 of the JMS article.  Mr Jung was not fleeing justice but was carrying out missionary trips.  The sentence associated with this citation clearly portrays Mr Jung as a criminal on the run.   This is a shameful act of intellectual dishonesty and it is travesty to leave this libelous information posted with an inadequate citation.

13  The citation link is no longer available and can not be used to verify the statement in the body of the article. What accusations reached other countries and why was he investigated by Taiwanese authorities?  The answer is not stated in the wikipedia article but the implication is that he committed sexual assault or some similar crime in other countries.  These 3 sentences( associated with citation 12 and 13) flow with the clear intent to slander Mr Jung without 1 single  properly referenced source. 

Please remove this slander and libel from Wikipedia that the truth may be known.

Kindly respond to my email the way you did the first time if possible as I do not want to miss your response.

Deletion from the Ritual section

Reason: there is nothing to substantiate this at all. The only thing I have come across that suggests that leaving a piece of skin was at once considered """"ideal"""" is from the Hagakure, and even there it was not a matter of disgrace. In fact, in the Hagakure, Yamamoto Tsunetomo advocates cutting all the way through - better to do the job properly than risking botching the job: """"In the practice of past times, there were instances when the head flew off. It was said that it was best to cut leaving a little skin remaining so that it doesn't fly off in the direction of the verifying officials. However, at present it is best to cut clean through.""""

HHHH Here is a clarification. The original Semitic people came from Arabia, they moved north and east. After time, the Semitic people devised many dialects of """"Semitic"""".

The line was supposed to be """"I'd never want to be killed by you of all men, absolutely not!"""" but was changed to """"Disgusting"""" after a question from Anno. The situation as commented by Miyamura (voice of Asuka) is: 
At last Anno asked me, """"Miyamura, just imagine you are sleeping in your bed and a stranger sneaks into your room. He can rape you anytime as you are asleep but he doesn't. Instead, he masturbates looking at you, when you wake up and know what he did to you. What do you think you would say?""""

It's a cool way to move things forward, like that movie, but hoefulyl much less trite. Anyhow.. what's the good word with you today? I think of our battles more like the old warner brothers cartoon with the coyote and the sheepdog, punching in before they set out to undermine one another. Because that's whats happening here, I'm actualyl writing some pretty solid stuff here, and you and will beback are bending over backwards to break rules and uphold them agaijnst me. Look, over at biff rose, there was a flargrant violation of the 3rr standard, and I pointed out that to Will beback that each time i made that violation, i was blocked and banned. i see that the person who did it this time was not blocked or banned. so you know, I've got a whole list of these that is being sandboxed by another ip, to follow up on, as i told will, you need to play fair for me to adhere to any standards you want to uphold. you can't just block an article, because true information is being disseminated through it.

 Carol Kivler testimonial and mechanism of action 

I have removed new content on the mechanism of action and an endorsement from Carol Kivler.  Medical content on Wikipedia is strictly governed by guidelines and policies. I'm not sure the Kliver testimonial, or any testimonial, is appropriate for an evidence-based article. A very important guideline is Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources (medicine). The source (Perrin et al.) for the mechanism of action content does not conform to that guideline.

Perrin et al., an fMRI study of ECT and frontal cortical connectivity in severe depressive disorder, is not appropriate for the claims the new text makes. Per the guideline I linked to above, we rely on expert reviews to put such results into context. This study can be mentioned once a review has done that, if the review gives it sufficient importance to warrant inclusion.

Also, it's important to be very precise in paraphrasing sources. The recent edit said, """"The group's findings confirmed the hyperconnectivity hypothesis of ECT"""" which is stronger than the source's """"The findings reported here add weight to the emerging “hyperconnectivity hypothesis” in depression...""""  

I'm not contesting the veracity of any of the content. But to be included in Wikipedia, the relevance and accuracy of all medical content must be supported by sources that conform to the above guideline - usually systematic reviews, graduate-level textbooks, national or international professional guidelines, or similar, that can be expected to accurately reflect the current scholarly consensus.

Your contributed article, History of rome empire
 Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, History of rome empire. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Roman Empire#History. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Roman Empire#History - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

I think I have a way to resolve this unfortunate Billy the Kid issue. If you will give me a moment, I first want to explain how we got to this point from my perspective. A lot has been made over my alleged failure to adhere to the preferred Wikipedia manual of style. That failure on my part is simply not being as well versed on the various Wikipedia guidelines as I probably should be. I am not trying to disrupt your standards. Indeed, I would appreciate any and all the help I can get, along with the active participation by experienced Wikipedia editors to bring the Billy the Kid article in line with Wikipedia standards. 

I am not trying to defy or insult anyone. There seems to be a misunderstanding that suggests I seem to think that I have some kind of """"ownership"""" over the subject of Billy the Kid. This is not true now - and it never was true. Perhaps some of this misunderstanding stems from a sentence I could have worded better which read as follows: """"All I was trying to do was provide the most accurate template on the subject of Billy the Kid that others could work from."""" 

If I could take back the word """"template"""" I would, since it was clearly construed as meaning something totally different from what I was trying to state.  What I was trying to state comes down simply to accurate """"facts and dates"""" regarding Billy the Kid, and bringing the state of those many """"facts and dates"""" up to date to this point in time. Before it was removed, my Wikipedia article reflected the status of Billy the Kid research as it exists today. There were 147 detailed citations, which sourced the work of such noted Kid historians as Philip J. Rasch, Robert M. Utley and Frederick Nolan among many others. Before it was last removed on December 17, that version that I was working on contained the most accurate version of the Kid's life that has yet appeared on Wikipedia. That version of the article contained contributions by several researchers - not just me.

Then it all went away, when the article was removed for reasons that make no sense - at least not for anything contained in the article itself. I attempted to restore the version that I had been working on at 11:47 17 December 2015. I attached a note that read: """"Please do not delete this version of the Billy the Kid article. It contains the contributions of several respected historians, and remains the most comprehensive, and accurate treatment of the subject that has appeared on Wikipedia so far.""""

My restoration only stayed up for 4 minutes and and was once again removed at 11:51 on 17 December 2015.

I made what turned out to be a final attempt at restoration six minutes later at 11:57 17 December 2015. This time I left a note that said """"The continued deletion of an article by myself, and several other contributors, goes beyond vandalism and borders on being criminal."""" The crime was against historical honesty, accuracy and, indeed, the goals that Wikipedia is supposed to stand for. The total lack of respect to those who contributed to the article goes without saying.

This time, for my troubles, I was blocked - and my blocked status remains in effect until Dec. 24. Merry Christmas.

The irony is that when the version of the article I last worked on was deleted,  on December 17, I was done with it. I had no plans for further changes. I had hoped that others would then jump in - particularly those who possess the Wikipedia editorial skills I lacked to make it go along with your manual of style and other Wikipedia preferences.

Billy the Kid, as you all know, was born in lower Manhattan in New York City. I would like to use New York City as an analogy for how I view Wikipedia. Since the early 1960's I've spent a considerable amount of time, off and on,  in New York City. Those of you who have been there frequently know that there is always construction going on. Indeed, change is a constant in New York City. Change is also a constant with any Wikipedia article. As stated, it was never my intention to """"own"""" the article. I never expected, or wanted, it to remain frozen in place with my contributions. I was looking forward to contributions from other historians and researchers who could provide further info on the """"facts and dates"""" contained in the article, as well as working with experienced Wikipedia editors who could correct any mistakes that didn't go along with your preferred """"encyclopedic"""" standards.

Anyway, we seem to have ended up, at least for now, at cross purposes. Why it got to this point I don't understand. I am not looking for adversaries, at Wikipedia - I am looking for the collaboration of any and all who truly want to make the Billy the Kid article the best it can possibly be today - and, with the continued contributions of others, in the years that follow.

The quickest way to make this happen is by taking my",0

 Section needs to be edited 

This line about New Hampshire is not very accurate:

On January 17, 2000, for the first time, Martin Luther King Day was officially observed in all 50 states.[4] Prior to that New Hampshire and Arizona did not observe the day.

In fact, New Hampshire passed """"Civil Rights Day"""" in 1991, to honor Dr King, and other civil rights activists like Rosa Parks and Malcolm X.  Since the article states clearly that other states, such as Utah, have different names for the holiday, including combining it with Confederate military heroes, this sentence does not seem justifiable.  The article leaves the impression that New Hampshire was some sort of bigoted state, that was one of the last to recognize this holiday.

It is important to distinguish the RBA from the US Federal Reserve, because as I understand while the Fed Act Section 31 reseves the right to amend or revoke the Act by Congress, there doesn't appear to be anything about accountability beyond reporting to Congress (Congress doesn't appear to be able to overrule policy without amending the Act, wheras in Australia there is a legislated procedure for disagreements).

YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION

This is the most """"contructive"""" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.""",0

""":I think the definition is fine (though it could be generalized a bit).

Forwarding is the process of actually sending data. It depends on routing, but routing can occur without forwarding.

Routing does not depend on having an aggregatable address.  For example, prefixes blocks on the Internet today are becoming less aggregatable.  This is a problem for BGP's scalability, but it doesn't make BGP less of a routing protocol.  In fact, there exist routing protocols which need no concept of an address at all, such as ROFL , distributed hash tables, many ad hoc routing protocols like DSDV, and various proposals in a research area known as """"compact routing"""" . In these protocols nodes have unique names but not addresses.

"Wage Slavery in Canada Today
Shouldn't this article mention the wage slavery conditions prevalent in Canada today? Such as the countless ads, for example on Craigslist (anytown) Canada, calling for 'live-in caregivers' where pay is $8.00/hr and they charge you rent?  Slavery is alive and well today, only difference is you are paid just enough to scrape byor less.  Fore example say you live in Vancouver, BC and you work at any minimum wage job8.00/hr, which after taxes nets you $1,000/mo. Ohby the way a studio flat here costs $1,000/mo. so hope you have a trust fund to draw upon if you are paid anywhere near minimum wage in BC. Mountains here are nice though! I'm sure they're trying to figure out a way to charge us all for looking at them...we should have to pay a corporation for this privilege, shouldn't we? Yes, most definitely!",0

Afterwards, It became apparent that the beginning of the article had to be re-written since there was really no definition of a mandolin. So I did this (footnoted also). Now as for the question left in the sandbox regarding mandolinos and mandoras, I will leave it to another to rewrite the definitions and histories of those instruments. When that is done, there will be no need to add to the mandolin's definition to try to expain why it is different from these similiar instruments.

Concerning removal of a lead pic 
this has been pasted from talk page of  Elekkh:

Architecture 

Concerning your removal of one of the lead pic that was added today: I have been looking for an appropriate image that contrasted a modern city with the wide view of Florence.  

The two pictures (and their captions) refer, in one case, to the impact of a single architect and a single structure on a city and on architecture and the architect.   The second picture demonstrates very clearly the uniformity created by 20th century structures of the so-called International style.  Although in the body of the article, almost every building is individually notable,  and such is not the case in that picture, the picture demonstrates a significant trend in architecture.  

The article is not simply about significant buildings.   In each case, the significant buildings has been selected to demonstrate the aesthetics or principals of a wide region and era, or an architectural philosophy.  

I want to emphasise that the image of Florence Cathedral has not been selected simply on the grounds of it being a great representative work of architecture (like the Parthenon, St Peter's Basilica or the Taj Mahal). It is not simply an iconic building.  It is the building that launched the notion of the """"architect"""". 

The homogeneity of the Manhattan skyline is the antithesis of the image of Florence.  Read the two captions. I believe they make the point, without labouring it. 

  
I understood your intention, but still that image is not a good illustration of international style, neither is it a very good quality picture. T  

To say again what I said above:
""""The homogeneity of the Manhattan skyline is the antithesis of the image of Florence.  Read the two captions. I believe they make the point, without labouring it.""""  
While I agree that the image is not as high quality as it could be, the two images complement each other in terms of colour and appearance.   It is the picture of Lower Manhattan which in terms of colour and proportion fits best with the image of Florence. It includes the Twin Towers which were so much part of that landscape. 
And while I agree that the image may not show International style as well as an image of a single building might, it illustrates extremely well the affect of the style in transforming cities.  Lower Manhattan is """"iconic"""" in that regard.

 list of interpretations 

From my reading of it, the third item in this list doesn't fit with the way the list is introduced:

The contemporary scholarly debate about race and intelligence involves both the relatively uncontroversial experimental results that indicate that average IQ test scores vary among racial groups, and the relatively more controversial interpretations of these IQ differences. In general, contemporary interpretations of the """"IQ gap"""" can be divided into three broad categories:

 """"culture-only"""" or """"environment-only"""" interpretations that posit only non-genetic causes (e.g., socioeconomic inequality or minority culture membership) that differentially affect racial groups; and
 """"partly genetic"""" interpretations that posit an IQ gap between racial groups caused by approximately the same matrix of genetic and environmental forces that cause IQ differences among individuals of the same race.
 """"insufficient data"""": no meaningful interpretation can be made based on available evidence.

The problem seems to be that #3 isn't an interpretation, but rather the lack of an interpretation or the inability to empirically distinguish between alternatives #1 and #2. I've been brainstorming for a simple fix, but I can't think of one. The best alternative I can think of is to remove #3 from the list and add a follow up sentence saying something like """"a large minority think there is insufficient data and no meaningful interpretation can be made based on available evidence"""".

 Early Republic; 2nd paragraph 
Right,
For the 2nd paragraph, the why (for what needs to be done), and how (suggestions) -
1st, the why:

besides the 1) excessive number of bibliographical citations in Portuguese, which I claim to be unneeded, since there is abundant literature in English dealing with the subject;
My suggestion is that (keeping the paragraph short, btw depending on the option to be chosen, even shorter), must be also fixed:

2) the truncation of the narrative, referring to fix the correlational gaps of
2.1 the beginning of the republic and the military rebellions of the 1920s, and to
2.2 the mentions about all revolts of the 1930s, and not just the communist one, 
Or 
- 2.2.1 - to maintain coherence, don' mention any (1930s) revolt specifically , in the manner suggested below

3) (Regarding the briefness of the paragraph); remove the excess of detail inferred from a source in Portuguese. Details that can be contained in other more specific articles of Wikipedia, related to the history of that period
I refer specifically to this passage  """"The repression of the opposition was brutal with more than 20,000 people imprisoned, internment camps created for political prisoners in distant regions of the country, widespread torture by the government agents of repression, and censorship of the press.**"""" ; 
which can be summarized as suggested (see suggestion about Point 3) below 

My suggestions for How -
Regarding to: 
Point 1, use the abundant literature in English dealing with the subject, as some which I used

Point 2.1, a variation of what I had proposed:
 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, through various civilian and military rebellions, that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt."""" 
Or, shorter 
 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, that by 1930 it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt."""" 

Points 2.2, 2.2.1 and 3 (bold letters)
 """"Vargas and the military who supported him, were supposed to assume the power temporarily, but instead they closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with their supporters, having defeated between 1932 and 1938, 3 major attempts to remove them from power. Being the 1935 communist one served as an excuse for they preclude elections, launching a coup d'état in 1937, making their regime a full dictatorship, with all that this entails. """" 

Thus (following the justifications above), one possibility of how the entire paragraph could be:

 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt. Vargas and the military who supported him, were supposed to assume the power temporarily, but instead they closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with their supporters, having defeated between 1932 and 1938, 3 major attempts to remove them from power. Being the 1935 communist one served as an excuse for they preclude elections, launching a coup d'état in 1937, making their regime a full dictatorship, with all that this entails. """" 

Note that, besides Not contain the defects stated above, even With the phrase  """"in the wake of the murder of his running mate, """" - this possible version is by far a shorter paragraph than the present version.

 It seems heavily slanted in favor of Greenpeace. For example:
- the article states that they activists """"attempted to board,"""" but not """"trespassed.""""
- """"Certain pharmaceutical drugs are kept in a safe. The Russian authorities broke the safe after they took the vessel.[36]"""" Sounds like it was written by GP. Relies on a GP source.
- """"Two activists managed to attach themselves to the platform and attempted to climb despite being blasted with water, whilst another activist was unable to attach themself to the platform."""" Aside from the poor style, the poor construction, and the awkward attempt to make it gender neutral, it reads like the person that wrote the sentence wants the reader to cheer for the GP activists. What does it mean """"to attach oneself to a platform""""? 
- """"Russian authorities forcibly took control of the Arctic Sunrise, which was boarded from a helicopter by fifteen Federal Security Service officers in balaclavas, armed with guns and knives."""" Is it unusual that the Federal Service would wear balaclavas or arm themselves with guns and knives? Given the task that they were performing, such a uniform seems routine.
- """"At the time of the boarding, the Arctic Sunrise was in Russia's EEZ but not within the safety zone around the oil rig, and permission was not sought to board it from the Arctic Sunrise's flag state, the Netherlands."""" Does Russia need permission from NL to board a ship that is clearly dedicated to enabling activists to trespass on a Russian oil rig? It's implied. If it's true, it should be noted. If not, it should be removed. 
- """"It is alleged that crew members and activists were punched and kicked during the forced boarding."""" Alleged by whom? Why were they punched and kicked? Were the guards using more than the necessary amount of force to subdue non-cooperative and/or combative arrestees? 
- The use of the monicker """"Arctic 30"""" implies a sympathetic viewpoint. Just because certain media have used the term, doesn't mean that WP should also. Just because certain media organizations are sympathetic doesn't mean WP should be also. It becomes a biased article when it uses such monickers that are intended to create sympathy for those arrested. 
- Nearly the entire """"Responses"""" section is irrelevant except for the responses and requests from the Gov't of NL. Seriously, does anyone really consider it WP worthy that a reporter wrote something on Facebook?
- The """"Greenpeace Announcements"""" section seems like a thinly veiled medium for advocating GP's position. Perhaps a """"Russian Government Announcements"""" would balance the article a bit, but the idea of such a section seems silly. 
- International Reaction section. Again, seems like a thinly veiled medium for listing anyone and any no one that supports GP. I don't see the relevance. Additionally, how is this section different from the """"Responses"""" section?""",0

I'm happy to believe that the name """"Blackbeard"""" is used to describe a character in an upcoming movie. The issue for this article is why that is sufficiently significant to the modern cultural understanding of Blackbeard, for it to warrant inclusion in the article on the historical figure. Simply stating that Blackbeard is mentioned in a modern-day film/book/comic/play doesn't tell us anything about how the historical figure is interpreted, and risks being indiscriminate information which does little to advance our understanding of the topic. I suspect before we include the fact that Blackbeard wll be mentioned in yet another modern movie, we would need to know how this mention is of enduring cultural significance. I also doubt that the real-life Blackbeard can be presented in a historically accurate context in the otherwise fictional universe of POTC> More likely, and with all respect to Ian McShane, it is likely Blackbeard will simply be a large black-bearded pirate who has matches in his beard and says """"Yarr."""" An entertaining figure no doubt, but not one that advances this article, which is about the real-life Caribbean pirate.

I don't mean this to sound snarky, so my apologies if it comes across that way. It's just that articles like this can quickly amass extensive and fairly trivial lists of mentions, including every time the subject is even referred to in sitcoms and the like. Check out the page history from about a year ago, to see what I mean. I'd prefer not to return to simple lists of mentions, even when Blackbeard is a major character in the film/novel/comic/TV episode. Instead and for what its worth, I support Parrot's suggestion of mentioning it at the film's article, where it has apropriate context.

As someone who has performed cost accounting analysis for multinational manufactures of these products; as well as auditing these costs as an external auditor, I can assure that these kosher certification costs are, when “spread” over all products produced, (i.e., products sold, ending inventory, and “spoilage”), are so small that they do not enter corporate financial statements. In accounting and auditing terms, these kosher certification costs are not “material.”

Unless, you are a financial analyst, cost accountant, auditor, or CFO, these kosher certification costs should be of no concern to the consumer.

“Meals and entertainment” costs, corporate aircraft costs, and other extravagant costs commonly incurred by these companies that I have done accounting work for are objectively obnoxious and “material” in that they show up as a line item on financial statements; whereas kosher certification costs are so immaterial that they are lumped together with other marketing costs.

""": Hi Hanely, and others,

First, a further clarification on the concept behind wikipedia, neutrality is a fundamental pillar, but there are two others as well, no original research and verifiability.  This takes us into the """"weasel words"""" you mention, which it's true is an area where improvements are needed with the article.  A reader should be able to independently check everything written in a wikipedia article should they want to, and as such, wikipedia is more about providing verifiable information rather than what a given editor simply thinks or believes is """"true.""""  You specifically cite the Criticism section, and I agree.  """"Plagiarism"""" has evolved the furthest of the three subsections IMO and is solidly referenced with verifiable sources (I think the believer stance(s) aren't presented as well as they could though), and the same should probably be done for """"Science"""" and """"Revelation"""".  For instance, one thing that can be done for """"Revelation"""" is cite the low book sales and distribution of the TUB instead of the simple current statement that it isn't widespread.  """"Peacock terms"""" have been an ongoing challenge from my perspective, commonly inserted throughout the article in a way that aggrandizes the book, but I think this is currently toned down.

What I'm hearing from you Hanely overall is a suggestion to focus on TUB alone, make the article perhaps a book summary with some history added, and put everything else in other articles.  It is one way to go, and you specifically mention Criticism-related topics as being placed elsewhere.  This would also need to be true of the adherents section and anything """"pro"""".  I don't agree with this tactic however, for reasons of wikipedia policy and overall usefulness to the average reader.  What makes TUB interesting and worth writing & reading about is that it purports to be more than a typical religious book, and people accept it as such.  I think that is a highly intertwined element of the TUB topic, and it fits in this article, and by the same token the reasons people *don't* accept it as such is part of the story.  I think it is a challenge to have the article reflect these differing perspectives, but that's a basic challenge involved with wikipedia articles in a nutshell.  Writing separate articles for separate points of view is discouraged.  See POV forking.

I think there needs to be a top-level article that is a summary of The Urantia Book basics, its teachings, its history, and those who are pro and con on topics related to it.  Other articles can then develop certain topics in more depth, if needed or wanted.  I don't see why the top-level article shouldn't be this one, it already serves as that, and other similar topics on wikipedia are structured the same way (for instance A Course in Miracles isn't a simple book synopsis & some words about the history, but covers pro and con viewpoints, as does Book of Mormon, which also has a plagiarism section).  I certainly do not accept that for some reason everything to do with Criticism should be tucked away in separate articles.  This is inherently biased toward the idea that the main wikipedia article is only for those seeking viewpoints where nothing negative is said.  Audiences also come to learn about contrary viewpoints, and those viewpoints are just as valid.

On the points you brought up, my thoughts:

1.  I've seen a tendency over the 1+ year I've followed this wikipedia article off and on for people to add many digressions to the article.  And understandably so, TUB is enormous and has thousands of interesting details and side stories.  But not all will fit in the main article.  I've seen multiple people each add a few sentences here and there, and over time, the article has become enormous and unfocused with all sorts of illogical disorganized digressions.  Like you say, this article can stand to be streamlined (you should have seen what it's been like before!).  IMO, the Lucifer rebellion story, while interesting, doesn't quite make the cut in terms of being essential enough to mention on the main page.  Perhaps an article summarizing TUB's view of the history of earth is worthwhile to build up?  The Lucifer / Caligastia / Satan story would fit in article such as that, for example.

2.-5.  Like I've said, Criticism is appropriate to have, as is the view of believers, and a POV fork is contrary to wikipedia standards.  In terms of Gardner specifically, despite any opinions on his conclusions about TUB, his book is one of the few published about TUB to analyze it from a nonbeliever perspective and it's entirely appropriate to use and cite as reference material for the article.  I say that even though I'm not personally convinced by arguments he makes.  I've read his book, have access to a copy, and can make edits regarding i",0

Boolean logic involves the theory of sets. And as far as I can see, all information, all communicated scientific information can fit into either or both of the two categories fact, or opinion. So when I get information, I immediately try to fit it into those 2 category sets. But I'm human and live with uncertaincies, and believe in luck, and have hunches etc, which are not consistent with Boolean logic. And I've dealt with the mathematics of probability and know that if we went through that formalized process every time we had to make a decision we'd never get anything done. So as senator Eagleton said about action in the Senate """"We muddle along"""". But using strict Boolean logic in today's concepts about scientific phenomena wouldn't get us very far. It would bog down at the travelling twins paradox. But if we took a computer and told it """"Stick to rigid physical logic and go as far as you can and then call me, rather than jumping into hypothetical nonmaterial alternatives, we might be able to move the level of real physical entity calculations down into the level of detail that it would need to really explain some of these natural events.

And so ends the most competitive first round we have ever seen, with 38 points required to qualify for round 2. Last year, 19 points secured a place; before that, 11 (2012) or 8 (2011) were enough. This is both a blessing and a curse. While it shows the vigourous good health of the competition, it also means that we have already lost many worthy competitors. Our top three scorers were:

, a WikiCup newcomer whose high-quality scans of rare banknotes represent an unusual, interesting and valuable contribution to Wikipedia. Most of Godot's points this round have come from a large set of pictures used in Treasury Note (1890–91).
, a WikiCup veteran and a finalist last year, Adam is also a featured picture specialist, focusing on the restoration of historical images. This month's promotions have included a carefully restored set of artist William Russell Flint's work.
, another WikiCup newcomer. WikiRedactor has claimed points for good article reviews and good articles relating to pop music, many of which were awarded bonus points. Articles include Sky Ferreira, Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus and """"Wrecking Ball"""" (Miley Cyrus song).

Other competitors of note include:

, who helped take Thirty Flights of Loving through good article candidates and featured article candidates, claiming the first first featured article of the competition.
, who claimed the first featured list of the competition with Natalia Kills discography.
, who takes the title of the contributor awarded the highest bonus point multiplier (resulting in the highest scoring article) of the competition so far. Her high-importance salamander, now a good article, scored 108 points.

After such a competitive first round, expect the second round to also be fiercely fought. Remember that any content promoted after the end of round 1 but before the start of round 2 can be claimed in round 2, but please do not update your submission page until March (UTC). Invitations for collaborative writing efforts or any other discussion of potentially interesting work is always welcome on the WikiCup talk page. Remember, if two or more WikiCup competitors have done significant work on an article, all can claim points equally.

Quran qoute should be deleted
In the section Position on use of armed strength to achieve aims
This Quran qoute should be deleted:

The Qur'an states, """"Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not do aggression, for Allah loves not the aggressors. Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but begin not hostilities. Lo! Allah loveth not aggressors. And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter. And fight not with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship until they first attack you there, but if they attack you (there) then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers. But if they desist, then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah. But if they desist, then let there be no hostility except against wrongdoers."""" (Al-Baqarah 190-193)[85]

The qoute is from a non Hezbollah-affiliated website and thus it is irrelevant to Hezbollah's stance on the use of armed strength. Hezbollah may also use this surah to legitimize the use of armed strength, but one would have to cite directly to a Hezbollah source to prove so. You can probably find some usuable qoutes in Naem Qassem's book Hizbullah: The story from within published in 2006 or from Hezbollah website.

It does not take three weeks to acquire sources for this type of basic topic, and even if it does, I don't see why you would remove the tags, since they could incite others to fix the article and inform readers that they should be wary about the facts stated here. I don't understand what would possess you to try to sweep this under the rug. Keep in mind that you still don't own the article.
And """"sufficiently discussed""""? There was no discussion when the article was filled with """"background"""" and there wasn't even a majority supporting the idea in the RM vote. If we were to ignore the fact that we voted on a subjective fait accompli-version rather than a neutral dabpage which had been around far longer and is in line with all other similar... no, identical language/ethnicity terms, this would never have happened.
And you have some really strange notions about the edit history. Read up, please. It's been a proper dapage since September 2004. The verbosity you and others inserted came along only this summer, and that was based on the last version of the original dabpage, not the other way around.

 Interaction ban? 

You are the one who posted this. Does that make you the """"admin who imposed the ban"""", or would it be someone else? I'm asking because I'm curious what the proper mechanism is (if any) for reporting possible violations of interaction bans. I asked at AN, and they told me to ask the admin who imposed the ban. ← What's up, Doc? carrots→ 
By my recollection, that rfc was re-closed by someone else. (Apparently, when they reverted the closure I had done, they neglected to place their own name on that page you linked to.)
Regardless, afaik, there is no restriction that places one admin solely as responsible for enforcing any user sanctions. And afaik, that's part of  what WP:AN is used for. After all: """"There is always another admin"""".  Feel free to link to this response on WP:AN at your discretion. -  
They basically sent me your way, so I'm just going to let it simmer on the back burner for a while longer. ← What's up, Doc? carrots→

 Richard III  

Now is the winter of our discontent 
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house 
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; 
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; 
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings, 
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. 
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds 
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty 
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; 
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, 
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up, 
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover, 
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain...

Richard II

This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, 
This other Eden, demi-paradise, 
This fortress built by Nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of war, 
This happy breed of men, this little world, 
This precious stone set in the silver sea, 
Which serves it in the office of a wall, 
Or as a moat defensive to a house,
Against the envy of less happier lands, 
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England, 
This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings, 
Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth, 
Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
For Christian service and true chivalry, 
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry, 
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son, 
This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land, 
Dear for her reputation through the world,
Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,

Hi. I notice that your article, Temesgen was moved out of the encyclopedia and into your user space.

"""Hi. You should be aware of the following official Wikipedia policies - this is an excerpt from WP:EL:

 Links normally to be avoided 
 
Except for a link to a page that is the subject of the article or an official page of the article subject—and not prohibited by restrictions on linking—one should avoid:
 Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article would contain if it became a Featured article.
 Any site that misleads the reader by use of factually inaccurate material or unverifiable research. See Reliable sources for explanations of the terms """"factually inaccurate material"""" or """"unverifiable research"""".
 Any site that attempts to surreptitiously install malware on a visitor's computer.
 Links mainly intended to promote a website.
 Links to sites that primarily exist to sell products or services. For example, instead of linking to a commercial bookstore site, use the """"ISBN"""" linking format, giving readers an opportunity to search a wide variety of free and non-free book sources.

You recently added a link to Western honey bee that violated the last two of these restrictions; I know the temptation to use WP to promote your site is strong, and you can claim that your site includes useful information, but it STILL self-promotion, and you SELL things on that website. You can't link that on Wikipedia. Note the following additional excerpt from the same policy page:

 Advertising and conflicts of interest 

Due to the rising profile of Wikipedia and the amount of extra traffic it can bring a site, there is a great temptation to use Wikipedia to advertise or promote sites. This includes both commercial and non-commercial sites. You should avoid linking to a website that you own, maintain or represent, even if the guidelines otherwise imply that it should be linked. If the link is to a relevant and informative site that should otherwise be included, please consider mentioning it on the talk page and let neutral and independent Wikipedia editors decide whether to add it. This is in line with the conflict of interest guidelines. Note that since Wikipedia uses nofollow tags, external links may not alter search engine rankings.

This is not personal, it's simply a matter of an official WP policy, and everyone has to play by the same rules.   """,0

Hello, I would like an admin to see the pages Jajce and Alija Izetbegovic and judge whether the sourced information that was removed by user Rochass is justified. 

On the Jajce article, he removed a cited statement about a church being destroyed even though it is cited and there is even a picture of the demolished church. He claims it is irrelevant information while it is very much relevant: there is a paragraph on the Bosnian War and this very much falls into that category.

As for the Izetbegovic article, he: 1) removed historical information (the original birth country), 2) changed """"Bosnian mujahideen"""" for """"Arab Volunteers"""" when there is already an article on the former, 3) removed two """"citation needed"""" notices, 4) removed a quote by Richard Holbrooke, US Envoy, about the issue of the aforementionned Bosnian mujahideen, 5) Added """"Serb Nationalists"""" as those who petitioned the ICTY to indict Izetbegovic so as to make it seem unjustified when in reality he died before the investigation ended.

 The problem that deeply concerns me is the fact that fox news attempts to claim neutrality when their own newspaper, the New York Post, claims that they are conservative.

 Gabriel Olutola 

There are some issues with Gabriel Olutola, which I just deleted.

I had previously identified some concerns with this article. You seem to understand that there were issues and agreed to address them. We let some time elapse so you could address them, but you did not make any substantive progress toward resolving the problems.

In addition, you are not communicating in a way that is desirable for editors. You are perfectly free to remove material from your talk page (although archiving is generally considered preferable). However, if you simply remove material and do not respond, it is difficult to understand your thinking. I don't know for example, whether you felt that you cured the copyright problems, or perhaps thought that the source of the text was an acceptable source. If you explain your actions it will be easier to help you.

I recently deleted the article because it had copyright problems and I saw no action by you to address them. I now see that you have restored the article in substantially the same form as the article that was deleted. Again, if you do not communicate I do not know what you are thinking. I don't know whether you thought it was deleted in error, whether you thought you cured the problem, or something else.

I notice that the version you restored is not exactly worded the same way as the source. However, we have seen editors who think that changing a word here or there cures a copyright problem. It does not. Please read the following link for more information: Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing

I also ran a duplication detector which does not pick up close paraphrasing, it only picks up exact matches. Even with this cruder measure the article is problematic. I'll provide the link below so you can see the results. However, I emphasize that changing a word or two here or there to eliminate the exact matches is not the cure.

Duplication Detector

Unfortunately, we have identified other articles with issues. I haven't had a chance to look closely but we may be following up with other articles which need addressing.

I urge you to take this quite seriously. If you are editing with a misunderstanding of policy we can help you understand the rules. If you do understand the rules and ignore them, you may be blocked. Explaining your actions will be the best way to ensure that doesn't happen.(Talk) """,0

Addendum documentation for ArbCom (reverted from AN by Future Perfect at Sunrise twice)

(Now, we can consider the matter of what happened.)
 [Aftermath note 1]: I created this topic when I was concerned there might be an serious (emergency) situation, but did not have sufficient knowledge of the editor's history (especially recent onwiki conversations) to judge how serious the matter was — but I had just observed behavior which was sufficiently out of the norm to not simply dismiss the replacement/message on their user page.

 [Aftermath note 2.a]: I  may be incorrect, but I do not believe Equazcion had sufficient knowledge of the history of the administrator to simply dismiss the matter. Unfortunately, there may be more to discuss about the interaction above, but let us first clarify if I am correct or incorrect with regard to Equazcion's knowledge of the administrator history (especially recent communications/interactions).  (interact)  

[Aftermath note 2.b]: In the interaction above Equazcion has characterized my interaction with the administrator (on User talk: Jimbo Wales) prior to the administrator's user page replacement message. Before we discuss this further, perhaps Equazcion may wish to reconsider the characterizations.  (interact)  

(I will immediately notify Equazcion of the notes 2.a and 2.b above so they may comment.  (interact)  )

===Question(s) for administrators regarding the user talk message===
The big question, of course, do we need to follow up regarding this?
 Clearly an administrator replacing their user page (and especially leaving it that way for 12 hours) with that is an inappropriate reaction to any situation. 
Note that the administrator's edits just prior to their user page replacement were:

 User talk: Jimbo Wales Revision as of 02:34, 14 February 2010 Rodhullandemu (→Bloqued WHY?: I'm gone.)
 User talk: Jimbo Wales Revision as of 02:41, 14 February 2010 Rodhullandemu (→Bloqued WHY?: goodbye)
Now, what is all that the reaction to? (Hint: A mock and a """"hear hear"""")

 The criticism section is fundamentally and appallingly flawed. 

The criticism section is fundamentally and appallingly flawed. For example, it starts off by quoting (and uses heavily throughout) the white supremacist Tomislav Sunić, who other people may think of as a reliable source, but I most certainly do not. Here are his thoughts on Jews.  I hope you have a stronger stomach for that filth than I do - I stopped reading about halfway down. More about Sunić: """"In June 2008, the group hosted Tomislav Sunic, a former Croatian diplomat and the author of the anti-Semitic book Homo Americanus: Child of the Post-Modern Age, which argues that """"Americanism,"""" heavily influenced by Judaism, undermines traditional European morality.  """"On June 24, about 40 people attended a talk by Pacifica Forum speaker Tomislav Sunic, who only three days earlier had addressed the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC) at its national """"leadership conference"""" in Sheffield, Ala. Sunic, a writer and white nationalist, had previously spoken to the Washington D.C.-area chapter of the CCC and the Institute for Historical Review (at least twice). He appeared on the """"Political Cesspool,"""" a white nationalist radio show, and was interviewed extensively for David Duke's Internet radio program. Sunic and the former Klan boss (whose latest book is entitled Jewish Supremacism: My Awakening to the Jewish Question) commiserated about Jewish domination, low birth rates among people of European ancestry and discrimination against whites. """"Especially in these multiracial cities, like L.A. or Washington D.C., I'm losing my eye contact,"""" Sunic confessed to Duke. """"I'm sort of afraid even of raising my head and looking at people right in their eyes because I know they may not be of my species."""" .

The criticism section also relies heavily on Rummel, about whom we should maintain a high degree of scepticism. To quote Tomislav Dulić, """"the estimates used by Rummel for Tito’s Yugoslavia cannot be relied upon, since they are largely based on hearsay and unscholarly claims frequently made by highly biased authors"""". .

It then goes on to say that """"The Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia, an office of the Slovenian Government whose task is to find and document mass grave sites from the Second World War and the period immediately after it, discovered at least 581 mass graves in the Slovenian territories [65] which “are believed to hold up to 100,000 bodies”[66] killed under Tito's government"""". None of this is true. The CCMGS has compiled a list of 581 sites which it believes worthy of inspection under the terms of its mandate. It has investigated just a few of these, and even where it has started to investigate, progress has been slow to say the least. For example, at Tezno, 1,179 bodies were discovered in 1999 (despite the wild speculation by the likes of Dežman and Ferenc about 15,000 bodies, so eagerly reported in the media), and at Barbara rov 300 bodies.

Yet another triumph for the forces of darkness at Wikipedia. I also note again that the erroneous claims and deceit on the part of the editor making the complaint once more go completely unaddressed.

If any editors are interested in how there is a leftist bias prevailing within politics pages at WP, and how this is upheld by Admin when a challenge is made from an editor interested in correcting this, I invite them to look at what has been going on recently at the Roger Scruton page, which now will go on reading like an article that would be written by a left-wing tabloid and not an encyclopedia entry. The pattern, for those who are interested, is as follows:

 Leftist editor posts biased and inaccurate entries on WP politics page based on prejudice and ignorance, or in pursuit of an agenda to discredit a figure on the right of the political spectrum;
 Posts challenged by another editor;
 Leftist editor cannot cope with being challenged and having his ignorance/bias/agenda exposed;
 Leftist editor creates trumped-up (and in the latest example regarding the 3RR violation, in fact completely bogus) charges against the editor that has """"wronged"""" him and brings them to admin – a tactic that the """"wronged"""" editor knows will result in the """"blocking"""" (in effect censorship) of the editor who tried to address the leftist bias.

This is a process of censorship, and the procedure that is gone through at Admin nothing more than a show trial. It is rather ironic that I should see proof positive of this leftist bias at the Scruton page – Scruton has after all himself been vilified by the left throughout his career.   """,0

"""Colonialism==
The section on Colonialism is very inadequate.  No sources are cited. I recommend that the following be added:

To speak of the """"scramble for Africa"""" is to begin a debate centuries old. In the words of Robert Collins, """"The explanations [for the colonization of Africa] are nearly as unsatisfactory as they are numerous.  The misconceptions are as enduring as they are erroneous.  To scholar and student alike, the search for understanding this dynamic period, which resulted in European colonial rule in Africa and dramatically altered the future of a vast continent, is the Problem of the Partition of Africa.""""Robert O. Collins, Historical Problems of Imperial Africa, (Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1994), 7

By 1870, many European nations were interested in the African interior, and began moving up the rivers.  Generally, except for a few cases, foreign powers could not move beyond """"small coastal enclaves."""" Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 301  But from the years of 1880-1900, the European imperial powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial nation states, and leaving only two independent nations: Liberia, an independent state partly settled by African Americans; and Orthodox Christian Ethiopia (known to Europeans as """"Abyssinia""""). Colonial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when all colonial states gradually obtained formal independence.

The scramble came from the rising of a new world from old Europe.  Until this point, Britain had been the undisputed leader in the industrial realm.  They could produce more manufactured goods than any other country, and at the lowest price.  Britain promoted the idea of """"free trade"""" in Africa, the idea that no European countries would interfere with one another while freely trading in Africa.  Britain had no worries until the 1860's when """"France, Germany, and the United States had caught up with Britain in terms of industrial technology and manufacturing."""" Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 301 

As a result of this industrialization of the world, there was a shortage of markets to sell to.  many European countries, as a result, looked to Africa as a potential client. Some believed when diamonds were discovered in 1869 they """"provided the incentive and capital for a large influx of Europeans.""""Robert O. Collins, Historical Problems of Imperial Africa, (Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1994), 7  The creation of the Suez Canal """"not only made the East African coast more accessible but also became the great pivot in British imperial strategy.""""ibid., 7 Above all else, we must look at this imperial world pragmatically and not ideologically. Until this point, """"military and political relations between Africans and Europeans concludes that Africans controlled the nature of their interactions with Europe.  Europeans did not possess the military power to force Africans in any type of trade in which their leaders did not wish to engage."""" John Thornton, Africa and Africans in the making of the Atlantic World, 1400-1800, second edition (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 7

But a new world, as noted above, had begun.  Because of new competition in the trading industries of Europe and the Americas, Britain now had rivals for trade in Africa.  Even smaller countries sometimes wanted to get involved looking for quick cash and to find ways to sustain their countries.  Within the hubris of the European nations was the ideal of """"national prestige,"""" an idea that holding African colonies would increase the power of a nation.Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 303 New technology as well in the form of the """"repeater rifle"""" and the """"maxim-gun"""" gave Europeans new advantages over Africa. There had been trade of guns with Africa before this era, but as Hilaire Belloc put it:

Got ur message/question.  I think you were encountering a situation where the NRHP name in our LA list was a red-link and was different than the name of a pre-existing article on the site, and you handled it correctly by revising our list to keep showing the NRHP name (as it is a list of NRHPs) while wikilinking to the pre-existing article.  And you added the NRHP infobox, keeping the NRHP name there (as it should be).  Further, I edited the article intro to mention the alternative name.  And further, i created a redirect at the NRHP name for the site.  I think we talked about how to do redirects a while back....

It would have been similar if the problem had been we had created a new NRHP article already, before finding the pre-existing one.  Then I would have supported merging our material into the older article, and converting our new article into a redirect to the older one.  That gets to the same result as above.  

In mergers, I do think it is courteous to merge the newer article into the older one, so that the older history of edits stays with the article.  Even if the newer article name is better, because the merged article can be moved with its entire long history to the newer name, after.

"""== Discussing recombination ==

Recently I noticed that this article uses 'genetic recombination' to refer to recombination that occurs during in meiosis and brings about genetic diversity among organisms.  This isn't necessarily correct: genetic recombination can also refer to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or V(D)J recombination, neither of which, to my knowledge, occur during meiosis or produce heritable genetic diversity among organisms.  To account for that, I think it would be helpful to replace instances of 'genetic recombination' with 'homologous recombination', the type of genetic recombination to which this article refers.  What are others' thoughts on this?  The only drawback I could see would be the slightly less reader-friendly word 'homologous'. This, however, seems clarified by the first sentence in the 'Sex and recombination' section to invoke the phrase: """"In the related process of genetic recombination, sexual organisms can also exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.""""  If the inaccessibility of the word 'homologous' were in fact a drawback, I think it would be more than compensated for by the greater accuracy of the information being presented to the reader.

Yesterday I tried introducing this change, but was reverted.  In the summary of that reversion, the editor noted: """"why be less general? homologous excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc.""""  I've offered my rationale for being specific just above, but was curious about the second sentence.  If homologous recombination excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc., then is that somehow accounted for by other types of genetic recombination, like NHEJ or V(D)J recombanation?  To my understanding, it is a failure of homologous recombination in meiosis that produces heritable chromosome translocations, fusions, and gene duplications.    

I think you are correct, being more accurate is better since the sentence does refer specifically to matching chromosomes. I've reworded this to state In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. I've added the idea of general recombination to the previous section, adding Mutations can involve large sections of DNA becoming duplicated, usually through genetic recombination.   

 Charles Darwin film 'too controversial for religious America' 

""""A British film about Charles Darwin has failed to find a US distributor because his theory of evolution is too controversial for American audiences, according to its producer.""""    

That's a laugh. Please don't try to make evolution look like it's a helpless victim being attacked by a bunch of religious nuts. The theory of evolution does have many loopholes, but America is not religious by any means; I'm shocked that an American producer turned down the film. —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 

Sorry, I just don't see how evolution can be a controversial topic - evolution is all around us, simple as that. People who tend to object to such basic fundamental facts of life tends not to understand the depth of the topic to the point of understanding it, but rather the shallow aspect to justify their lack of understanding. Not everyone is good at science so some people would tend to take the shallow route of critizing something if they don't understand. Example; I'm terrible at pre-calculus so I critize the aspect of pre-calculus to justify my understanding - see where I'm getting at?

Not relevant here. The Evolution article is not about Charles Darwin, the film is not about evolution, and there is an entirely separate page for the creation–evolution controversy.

Recently, Scott Ramsoomair, creator of the webcomic VGCats, has created a webcomic of Starfox, between Fox and Falco, consisting of a legitimate dialogue using only quotes from Starfox 64, found here: http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=223

The reason for this is that the section of the article this was in is about cultural references in the game, not about other material making refrences to this game.",0

 I was thinking about this last night, and came to two conclusions: First, focusing solely on this article is not the way to go. I need to go back to square one and add academic rigor (if possible) to global warming and denialism. [Don't tell me GW is FA and is therefore academically rigorous; the FA star does not even come within discus-throwing distance of establishing an article as """"academically rigorous.""""]. Second, your system of defending this Wikipedia page (notice I didn't say """"article"""") is completely airtight, because you hold control over all of the definitions. Join any high school debate team and they'll tell you, if you own the definitions, you own the debate. And the problem here is this: you define anyone who disagrees with AGW as a """"denialist""""; and you define everyone who agrees with you as an """"expert."""" Done! The page is impregnable. Take forex the quote by Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Using her comments as supporting evidence of the page's (not """"article's) thesis is a flagrant act of POV that proves this page (not """"article"""") is an op-ed piece from start to end. Barbara Boxer is a politician. Every bit of power, money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only: to characterize herself as a noble public servant, and stereotype her opponents as villains, buffoons or both. Even more — and this is important — Barabara Boxer is not a run-of-the-mill politician. It would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. In short, the Boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the """"so what?"""" test. I intend to delete that one sometime soon too. I also wonder whether I should give one of those damn wikicookie templates as a thank-you to the editors who revert me, every time they do so. Or maybe a barnstar? I dunno; some token of gratitude or other. •  """,0

"Nostradamus astrology real science 

 Michel Nostredame gives the formala hint in a public epistle: Que toutes ces figures ∫ont iu∫temêt adaptees par les diuines lettres aux cho∫es cele∫tes vi∫ibles, c'est à sçavoir, par Saturne , Iupiter , & Mars ,[241] & les autres conioincts [...] first published about 1558 A.D. Nostradamus tells us he uses visual astrology ('cele∫tes vi∫ibles,' lit. visible universe), not tropical astrology, for his poems.

this is a the major war codex from Nostradamus. You  or anyone in the world can now predict any large game shifting war in history forward and backward based soley upon nostradamus' own claim in his public writings. Just because one gets a masters or studies N for 30+ years does not nor will it ever imply they have intelligence. 

Nostradamus did not need to create houses and charts and stuff as this is astronomical, as he has pointed out ('cele∫tes vi∫ibles) , ref. to Aussie visable modern astrologer, Bernadette Brady for bring back this concept. 

If you have not been able to figure this out you need to get out of Nostradamus all together, otherwise you work for Satan's Army.",0
"""77 people were slaughtered in Norway this day last year ==

Of course, since it wasn't in America it is absolutely unimportant and doesn't deserve a mention whatsoever, so it seems. And you lot still protest there is no pro US bias on this joke website.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2.99.69.69   

It could be suggested as an item for In The News. But looking at the On This Day section, I tend to agree that it's probably more notable than the arrest of Jeffrey Dahmer, which although important in the US, was surely less significant in terms of a particular day.   

On what basis?

See below.  — 

Oh, I thought the accusations of """"jumping to conclusions and blaming others"""" were meant for me. It was on the basis that it's in the (real) news, that's all. So much for trying to open a dialogue with an anon ip. Gosh, I must be stupid.   

No, I indented that reply directly below the original poster's message, not yours.  I replied to you above, with a different indentation level and separate signature.

ITN focuses on major events when they occur, not on subsequent remembrances (excepting rare instances in which they're extremely noteworthy in and of themselves).  — 

The 2011 Norway attacks were added to the 22 July queue and probably will appear on the main page next year.  As noted at Wikipedia talk:Selected anniversaries/July 22, the section's primary maintainer generally avoids listing one-year-old events.
If you disagree with this practice (or wish to suggest any item), you're welcome to participate in the selection process by posting on the relevant dates' talk pages.  In fact, you could have added the item to the active list yourself before the page was automatically protected yesterday.
But I suppose it's easier to jump to conclusions and blame others than it is to collaborate.  — 

 I don't """"do"""" collaboration, even if I did, marking the anniversary of one of the worst terror attacks in European history should not be something that requires """"collaboration"""". No doubt we can expect the anniversaries of insignificant events in the US to be remembered one year on though. In fact, I'm willing to put money on a bet that the little shooting in the cinema this week gets a mention in one years time.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2.99.69.69   

In that case, Wikipedia is not the place for you.  You expect this site to collaborate to bring about what you want to see.  Goodbye.    

I'll take that bet.
Note that the 2011 Tucson shooting was added to the 8 January queue but did not appear on the main page this year.  (Conversely, the 2010 Togo national football team attack did appear.)
On what do you base the assertion that U.S. items are treated differently?  — 

On the simple fact that much of the US American population simply does not know, or chooses to disregard the fact that outside of their national borders, there are people who are not US American living in countries that are not part of US America. This is a fact known to the rest of the international community. Also, in response to Kevin. I'm sorry I failed to inform you of my intent to post here as I understand it, yo",0

"""*That was a ridiculous comment. The source is by no means """"dubious"""" or """"amateur"""" and by claiming such you obviously didn't read the article whatsoever. I find it hysterical you claim if it was of any significance, it would be mentioned in the """"news"""" or """"newspapers"""". First of all, the article itself is from National Geographic, so it obviously was in the news, secondly, newspapers are nowhere considered as a reliable source when compared to an academic journal. The study I cited does prove quite a bit and is carried out by a respected geneticist. I have provided a reliable source and links to Maltese hIstory to support what most people obviously recognize, while you only provided some garbage POV link to a newspaper article with no references and that has nothingto do with Maltese people. Also, by being related to Arabs does not mean Maltese are necessarily Arabs and there are many Lebanese who seak Arabic, but also don't even consider themselves Arabs because of their distinct non-Arab ancestry, especially amongst Lebanese christians. Tunisians and other North Africans were largely Arabized in language and culture but are of non-Arab origins, and are of predominantly Berber origins and retain Berber culture, even among Arabized Berbers. Maltese speak a Semitic language and are of very significant Phoenician descent which clearly links them to Lebanese and also to Tunisians. Considering the Maltese language is a Semitic language very similar to Tunisian Arabic, obviously there would also be Arab cultural influences as well. They are related to all Arabs in terms of language, but are specifically very closely related to Lebanese and Tunisians due to common Pheoenician ancestry and also share many cultural aspects with Tunisians.

 Confused about how members are selected 

I'm a bit confused how the members are selected. I know each has to be approved individually, but how exactly are they nominated (self nominated?)? Are only the appropriate number for each region nominated or is it possible to have more then the total allowed for a region nominated? If it's possible to have more then the total, and more then the total are approved, how exactly are the states which will actually be on the council selected (e.g. based on the votes received). Finally, whatever the case, what happens if not enough states are selected/approved from a region?  

I hink that they are self-nominated because there were more candidates then mandates to disperse.  

To address your questions in order:
They are all self-nominated. The countries have to volunteer, and they have to invite observers into their countries to check how their own human rights record actually is.
It is possible, and intended, that more than the alotted number of slots nominate themselves; else, why vote if we have exactly as many candidates as slots?
As has happened for the Western European and Others Group, the ones with the most votes in support are selected. (None of the candidates from the WEaOG got less than 50% approval, but Greece and Portugal got the smalles number of votes, I believe.)
Hope this explains it. — (?) """,0

Chile

Cielo Estrellado please please do not support Al Andalus on this. The word Mestizo is never used in the hispanic world to describe people who are predominantly European as is the case for most Chileans. 

Firstly, as you may know, in Latin America it is used for those who are predominantly amerindian in their ancestry. (It would apply in Mexico and Central America). 
Secondly, there is no defined ethnic group in Chile which can be defined as mestizo, there are just people with more or less Indian bood, Spanish origin being nearly always the larger part of the ancestry. There is no sense of common belonging shared exclusively by people with amerindian ancestry which excludes people who dont have this ancestry. This is a vital characteristic of an ethnic group.
The word mestizo is pejorative in our language and should be used as little as possible. Ill give you an example. When the movie """"Harry Potter and the half-blood prince"""" came out in the Spanish speaking world, it was translated into Harry Potter and the Prince, because of the negative connotations that the word mestizo implied.
Finally, in our cultural community, Latinness, Spanishness (or if you want to use racial terms """"whiteness"""") is an expansive concept which does not exclude people placind then in a different ethnic group on the basis of their blood being """"tainted"""" as happens in the Anglo Saxon world. Although, I agree that that in certain countries where racial divisions have been stronger due to a much larger Amerindian community, (such as Peru or Guatemala) leading to implications regarding identity and ethnicity..

Anyways I hope you understand my position and we can establish some dialogue on this issue which transcends the narrow (and in my opinion racist) perspective of Genetic studies.
I also hope you are not a sock puppet of user: al andalus! This would make things much harder:-)

Espionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands. See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the """"tradecraft"""" used to collect this information.
Hey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says """"Hey Balls get ready for a patry"""" Balls replies """"You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.  

History
Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/

The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.

Different intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU
 ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited. 

Various Forms
Unlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.

The US defines espionage towards itself as """"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web

 All positive points, no negatives mentioned AT ALL... 

This article reads more like a propaganda page than impartial information. It is probably written and maintained by a member of staff at the school, but even so it should give a neutral point of view. For example, the old fashioned grammar school attitudes that the school desperately hangs on to (these include uniforms that haven't changed at all since the 1950's, authoritarian attitudes that are concerned by uniform more than actually making sure the children get a good education, etc, etc...) cause tension between students and teachers, as these obviously dubious values do not fit well into modern society. Just to add to this, the most recent ofstead report strongly emphasises the need for student and teacher relationships to improve. however, because of the senior staff all living in the 1930's, they took this to mean they need to enforce the rules more, with stronger emphasis on uniform and weaker emphasis on educational support; this has simply degraded student's relationships with their teachers (especially the so - called """"senior staff"""" who don't even teach but instead spend their time punishing people for petty things - the school even employs a certain member of staff whose job it is to be horrible - ironically she is actually called Mrs Horride!) even further.

Anyway, I saw you add the info back, so I added a reference to it so it doesn't get reverted again.

I feel that this article is hopelessly partisan and needs to be comprehensively re-written. It actually uses """"we"""" when talking about the event, undermining any neutrality. The tone throughout the article sounds like Wikipedia is trying to sell the event. Here are a list of examples with my notes:

 """"Spring Harvest has become much more than just an annual event — albeit the largest Christian conference in Europe."""" This is not factual and is gloating - """"much more"""".

""""2,700 Christians attended the first event - a number that grew to 38,000 in only seven years."""" """"Only"""" seven years - again, partisan opinion. 

Since its inception, Spring Harvest has had a profound impact on the life of the Church in the UK, and further afield.

It has encouraged new styles of worship. It has exposed Christians to a vast range of speakers and Church leaders from all over the world. It has helped evangelicals to recapture their commitment to social compassion, giving them a wider vision of what God is doing in the world."""" This is incredibly subjective and implies belief in God on the part of an encyclopedia.

""""This has significantly contributed to the success of Spring Harvest as it can entertain all members of the average family."""" What is the """"average"""" family and where is the factual evidence that Spring Harvest  can entertain them? Again, this sounds like a sales pitch.

The history and media coverage sections are also vague with the same unsuitable tone of laudation. To quote just one instance: """"1999: Spring Harvest raises thousands of pounds to help the victims of brutality in Kosovo."""" This is not factual enough on the charity, sum etc to be included and so is merely a sales pitch. These dates seem to be chosen to present a positive image of the event.  """,0

"Another common theme of the financial 'media' is to claim that Japan is a source of liquidity to the world.  Low interest rates actually reduce liquidity as interest payments are not being made on loans, and thus, money isn't available for financial intermediaries to recycle back into making new loans.  The money supply in Japan has been steadily declining for at least the past few years, yet world stock markets have been reaching new highs, and assets of all kinds have been bid to sky-high valuations.  Thus, it can be argued that the asset bubble is being driven by money supply expansion in Europe and the United States, and not by the shrinking money supply in Japan.

The bottom line is that I don't feel this will have a happy ending for the United States.  The dollar has dropped 5.5% in the past week, which, for the world's largest economy, is pretty much on the threshold of a currency crisis.",0

""""Since the late twentieth century, the researchers Paul Heinegg and Dr. Virginia DeMarce have conducted additional historic research in censuses, land deeds, court records, etc. to document that many multi-racial groups, later sometimes called tri-racial isolates, who during the nineteenth and early twentieth century were found in frontier areas, were descendants of families of free people of color formed in colonial Virginia. [9] At the time, most colonists were indentured servants from the British Isles. Beginning in the early 17th century, colonists imported African indentured servants and slaves. In the early period, the working classes of indentured servants, slaves and free workers lived and worked closely together, leading to marriages and unions.[4] The historian Ira Berlin has described the first generation of African-descended people in Virginia as the """"charter generation."""" He has noted that some were the multiracial descendants (usually men), who were the children of Portuguese and Spanish men active in the slave trade, and African women in the slave ports. Some of the men arrived as free laborers, having accompanied Europeans. Others were imported as slaves.[10]""""

This should be removed as well, as Melungeons have never been found in slave or servant records.  This is in  a section for the Origins of """"Melungeons""""  yet this section is not discussing """"Melungeons"""".  Since Melungeons have never been found in slave records, it makes no sense why this is even in a article on Melungeons.  Unless someone can find a slave record for Melungeons then it should be removed and anything pertaining to slaves.  This mentions slaves and indentured servant and leads towards African americans, however the original slaves in Virginia was Native Americans, Irish, Portuguesse, people from India, etc etc. Either way it does not pertain to Melungeons as Melungeons was never slaves. 

I looked at he Virginia DeMarce source used, only thing is says about Melungeons is they was mixed race, then it discusses indians, then it mentions the Melungeons being Saponi indians.  http://www.genpage.com/DeMarce.pdf

So not really sure why the actual Melungeon section of that source was not used and instead something was used in replace of what the source says on the Melungeons.  What that sources says is  """"Saponi, who appeared in Orange county, Virginia, on the lands of Governor Spotswood as late as 1742-43- including the Bowling and Collins names later found among Tennessee Melungeons.""""  This is speaking about the Saponi indians.  Then it mentions tri-rcial groups in reference to white, black, and indian mixture in equal portions.  

I looked at the Paul Heinegg source, could not find the word Melungeon used at all,  so clearly that can't be used as a source to this article. http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/

So clearly this stuff needs to be removed and the Demarce reference needs to be re worded to the """"exact"""" way the source states in relation to Melungeons.""",0

This is actually a quite controversial case, though I admit that the label Belgian is a little misleading, """"Trappist Quadrupel"""" is not so bad. Stan Heironymous, in his very well researched book on Belgian Brewing """"Brew Like A Monk"""", writes about La Trappe, which was briefly a trappist brewery in the Netherlands and had the appellation revoked when it sold to a Dutch Brewing company. According to those that sold, the problem was simply maintaining an order of monks. They did produce a beer which they called a Quadrupel. Moreover, Quadrupel has become a label on some american beers obviously of Belgian inspiration (and using derivatives of trappist yeast.) While this arguably makes Quadrupel not a style, Quadrupel is not listed as a style per say, but one of the myriad """"specialized"""" belgian ales.

 I really find your argument unconvincing, since the style guidelines make it clear that this category is to be used for submitting to beer competitions with a beer that is not appropriately labeled as something else, which is to say that the style category is quite upfront about what it is and not misleading at all. Yes, the BJCP styles include some catch all categories that aren't rightly considered styles, but they are clear about it when a judging category doesn't not fit some historically entrenched approach to beer. Since the guidelines are very clear about what they are but also provide a lot of accurate information to the reader, I think they're great. (Indeed, I would appriciate it if those that object would show me where the BJCP contradicts the opinions of other groups on these subjects.)""",0

 Larklight trilogy 

Hi,

Re. Larklight trilogy

I did loads of work on these articles yesterday; I fully agree that the plots are way too long and not very good; that's the main thing that needs sorting out.

I see the 'trilogy' article as having a very brief summary of each book, about 1 para.

I'm gonna put the pics back in there though - I think pics brighten up articles. Originally - before other people edited it - there was no info box, and the 3 pics were big and at the top. I'm not convinced the infobox is worthwhile for the 'trilogy' article, because it's not so appropriate to 3 books as to one - but others have added it and worked on it, so I'll go with the infobox, and the 3 pics within the 3 sections.

The user XXRonaldo007XX has tried to add an image to that infobox, which I don't think is a good idea - (s)he's a new user and struggling a bit with syntax. I'll leave him a message in a mo.

Please read and comment in Talk:Larklight where I've started a discussion on what I see as a way forward, regards structuring the articles.

Thanks for your input,

Current Squad
I propose redoing the current squad list a bit (for all South African teams). During the first half of the year, the top players will play Super Rugby for the Bulls; during the second half, some of them will play for the Springboks. I suggest we list all players in this section that are contracted to the Blue Bulls, but also indicate if they play at national team level, at Super Rugby level, at Currie Cup level or at Vodacom Cup level only.

With the current format, I think the only way possible would be to have some kind of indicator. Something like:

Props
  Dean Greyling (NT)
  Rayno Gerber (SR)
  Rossouw de Klerk (CC)
  Basil Short (VC)

Hooker
  Chiliboy Ralepelle (NT)
(NT) Represented South Africa in 2012(SR) Represented the  in Super Rugby in 2012(CC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Currie Cup rugby in 2012(VC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Vodacom Cup rugby in 2012

The indicator would show the highest level the player played at during the season and players would be sorted by position first, then this indicator, then surname.

However, an alternate representation could be:

 PropsNameNTSRCCVC  Dean Greyling                          Rayno Gerber                                      Rossouw de Klerk                                  Basil Short                                                 Hookers  Chiliboy Ralepelle                   

(NT) Represented South Africa in 2012(SR) Represented the  in Super Rugby in 2012(CC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Currie Cup rugby in 2012(VC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Vodacom Cup rugby in 2012

This could again be sorted by playing position, then level played, then surname.  Footnotes can be used if a player represented a different Super Rugby franchise than the main one affiliated with the union, etc. A template (which is a slight variation on {{rugby squad player}}) can be developed to simplify this.

My response: 

This is absolutely outrageous.  The ICC is virtually a home for torture: it is as bad as anything Mengeles thought up in the concentration camps: we're dealling with helpless children.  I have contacted the ICC in the past, and Columbia Presbyterian, and it was clear from my conversations with pediatric surgeons that staff there were ashamed of what they carried out: basically in vivo experiments which amounted to torture.

Wikipedia may have a neutral policy but the information you have inserted, and insisted on re-inserting, is wrong.  It may even lead to the death of more children by misleading people into believing the ICC is a safe home for children. It most certainly is not.  There were people such as yourself involved in the Inquisition and the SS!  You cannot defend a """"neutral"""" policy when it amounts to covering up the sadistic treatment of children.  You should be asbolutely ashamed of yourself.

Apologies for the delay in replying, I only just noticed your post. Essentially, there are a number of problems with the article besides the copyright infringement. The article had a promotional tone and feel, largely as a result of copying the material form the association's website. With WP articles we try to maintain a neutral point of view so it may be a better idea to write the content in your own words. The article alo didn't cite reliable sources for much of its content in order to help support the claim that the association is notable. What I'd encourage you to do is rewrite the article, in your own words, using the information from the various sources to guide you and having very little dependency on the association's own website. If you feel you still need the deleted material for this please let me know and I'll strip out the references and provide them to you. If there's anything else you feel you need, or if youb have any questions, please let me know. Many thanks, moff 

 Oxford Wikimania 2010 and Wikimedia UK v2.0 Notice 

Hi,

As a regularly contributing UK Wikipedian, we were wondering if you wanted to contribute to the Oxford bid to host the 2010 Wikimania conference. Please see here for details of how to get involved, we need all the help we can get if we are to put in a compelling bid.

We are also in the process of forming a new UK Wikimedia chapter to replace the soon to be folded old one. If you are interested in helping shape our plans, showing your support or becoming a future member or board member, please head over to the Wikimedia UK v2.0 page and let us know. We plan on holding an election in the next month to find the initial board, who will oversee the process of founding the company and accepting membership applications. They will then call an AGM to formally elect a new board who after obtaining charitable status will start the fund raising, promotion and active support for the UK Wikimedian community for which the chapter is being founded.

You may also wish to attend the next London meet-up at which both of these issues will be discussed. If you can't attend this meetup, you may want to watch Wikipedia:Meetup, for updates on future meets.

We look forward to hearing from you soon, and we send our apologies for this automated intrusion onto your talk page!

I'm only answering this because I'm really bored, excruciatingly so, and I also find it kind of amusing. People writing and, or, approving of psychologically harmful disinformation, that starving girls read, including the expressed desire to include a potentially triggering image of such a starving girl, illicits no response whatsoever. A collapsible box however, seems to be somehow construed as a threat to  civilization. One inane comment after another becomes somewhat irritating. 
Despite only having a ninth grade education, I actually did learn how to read. I also learned the proper use of Latin phrases, e.g.; id est (i.e) and exempli gratia (e.g.). For example, or to use an abbreviation of a Latin phrase, e.g.; ...in article text, i.e., how they were recently used here. Should have been e.g., not, i.e.. That being said, I read this:  
MOS:COLLAPSE:Scrolling lists and boxes that toggle text display between hide and show are acceptable for use, but should not be used in article prose.  This includes reference lists, image galleries, and image captions; Collapsible sections are useful in ,infoboxes, or to consolidate information already covered in prose.

This is not prose:
Candidate genes include dopamine transporter, dopamine receptors D2/D3,[46] dopamine beta-hydroxylase monoamine oxidase A, catecholamine-methyl transferase, serotonin transporter promoter (SLC6A4), 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2A), 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B receptor (5-HT1B),[47] the 10-repeat allele of the DAT1 gene,[48] the 7-repeat allele of the DRD4 gene,[48] and the dopamine beta hydroxylase gene (DBH TaqI).[49]

Your alleged concern over compliance with WP:ACCESS is unwarranted and seems to be self serving. It says nothing about """"Collapsible boxes"""".

Kwami puts it perfectly. Mr Anderson, who has been site-banned for a week (again), is making this a WP:POINTY part of his campaign to reduce the style guides to ... well ... nothing. He has, actually, done us a service in raising matters to do with the relationship between the MoS and external sources, and between the MoS and WP:TITLE. But I believe he should give his campaign a rest; it is highly disruptive and we all have better things to do.Yes, dashes vs hyphens carry important meanings for readers, and are a long-established part of the language. It is yet more important since readers see our text on electronic monitors; often, they are not of the best resolution, and no one sees it as well as on paper in good light. Hyphens can look like dots or smudges in many circumstances. This might be OK for when a hyphen is correct, but when a dash is prescribed by many of the most prestigious authorities in the US, the UK and elswhere, it is professional to use it.This debate needs to be at MoS talk, not here.

"""I've included a passage of the bible on my user page. I want it to open the page, and will keep it here, because I feel it acentuates the writing that follows.

so, without any further ado, here is some biblical goodness.

THE BEST THINGS HAVE BEEN CULMINATED 
Zeal to promote the common good, whether it be by devising anything ourselves, or revising that which hath been laboured 
by others, deserveth certainly much respect and esteem, but yet findeth but cold entertainment in the world.  It is welcomed 
with suspicion instead of love, and with emulation instead of thanks: and if there be any hole left for cavil to enter, (and 
cavil, if it do not find a hole, will make one) it is sure to be misconstrued, and in danger to be condemned.  This will easily 
be granted by as many as know story, or have any experience.  For, was there ever any-projected, that savoured any way of 
newness or renewing, but the same endured many a storm of gainsaying, or opposition?  A man would think that Civility, 
wholesome Laws, learning and eloquence, Synods, and Church-maintenance, (that we speak of no more things of this kind) 
should be as safe as a Sanctuary, and out of shot, as they say, that no man would lift up the heel, no, nor dog move his 
tongue against the motioners of them. For by the first, we are distinguished from brute beasts lead with sensuality; By the 
second, we are bridled and restrained from outrageous behaviour, and from doing of injuries, whether by fraud or by 
violence; By the third, we are enabled to inform and reform others, by the light and feeling that we have attained unto 
ourselves; Briefly, by the fourth being brought together to a parley face to face, we sooner compose our differences than by 
writings which are endless; And lastly, that the Church be sufficiently provided for, is so agreeable to good reason and 
conscience, that those mothers are holden to be less cruel, that kill their children as soon as they are born, than those nursing 
fathers and mothers (wheresoever they be) that withdraw from them who hang upon their breasts (and upon whose breasts 
again themselves do hang to receive the Spiritual and sincere milk of the word) livelihood and support fit for their estates. 
Thus it is apparent, that these things which we speak of, are of most necessary use, and therefore, that none, either without 
absurdity can speak against them, or without note of wickedness can spurn against them. 
Yet for all that, the learned know that certain worthy men [Anacharsis with others] have been brought to untimely death for 
none other fault, but for seeking to reduce their Countrymen to god order and discipline; and that in some Commonwealths 
[e.g. Locri] it was made a capital crime, once to motion the making of a new Law for the abrogating of an old, though the 
same were most pernicious; And that certain [Cato the elder], which would be counted pillars of the State, and patterns of 
Virtue and Prudence, could not be brought for a long time to give way to good Letters and refined speech, but bare 
themselves as averse from them, as from rocks or boxes of poison; And fourthly, that he was no babe, but a great clerk 
[Gregory the Divine], that gave forth (and in writing to remain to posterity) in passion peradventure, but yet he gave forth, 
that he had not seen any profit to come by any Synod, or meeting of the Clergy, but rather the contrary; And lastly, against 
Church-maintenance and allowance, in such sort, as the Ambassadors and messengers of the great King of Kings should be 
furnished, it is not unknown what a fiction or fable (so it is esteemed, and for no better by the reporter himself [Nauclerus], 
though superstitious) was devised; Namely, that at such a time as the professors and teachers of Christianity in the Church of 
Rome, then a true Church, were liberally endowed, a voice forsooth was heard from heaven, saying:  Now is poison poured 
down into the Church, etc.  Thus not only as oft as we speak, as one saith, but also as oft as we do anything of note or 
consequence, we subject ourselves to everyone’s censure, and happy is he that is least tossed upon tongues; for utterly to 
escape the snatch of them it is impossible.  If any man conceit, that this is the lot and portion of the meaner sort only, and 
that Princes are privileged by their high estate, he is deceived.  """"As the sword devoureth as well one as the other,"""" as it is in 
Samuel [2 Sam 11:25], nay as the great Commander charged his soldiers in a certain battle, to strike at no part of the enemy, 
but at the face; And as the King of Syria commanded his chief Captains to """"fight neither with small nor great, save only

I was probably in bad mode that day. Do not take it seriously. However, there is still question why most of the Wikipedia edits of one Swedish are about Kosovo. My logic tell me that something is wrong there, and I just do not like much when people lie about their identity. But if you are Swedish then you should be more cautious about edits in one such sensitive question such as Kosovo. The fact that Albanians from Kosovo want independence does not mean that you should reject some scientific principles and to post into these articles maps whose only purpose is to remind Albanians that they once lived in the countries which enslaved them. I am Serb but I fully understand Kosovar Albanian point of view regarding Serbia. As for these maps, I wrote that to you in Serbian but I will repeat that in English: if you write about one territory then you should post there only maps which show that territory with its own borders. Two maps that you posted do not comply with this principle. If any of these two actually showed Metohija with its borders within Serbia-Montenegro or Montenegro, I would not object. But to post only maps of these two countries with no borders of Metohija shown is not a science at all.  (talk) """,0

Don't be so quick, the talk update was coming:

This article is pure POV.  It assumes that oil depletion matters so much that it drives a search for alternatives to oil.  This is a nonsensical example of economism, in which supply and demand are assumed to be paramount in all decisions.  

The truth is that the dominant scientific view is that climate change requires a shift to other energy sources long before the existing oil reserves run out.  Accordingly, this depletion issue is simply irrelevant.  Before it occurs, all coastal cities will look like New Orleans, and the refugees will be so vast in number that there will be no serious concern with how to get them all gas for their SUVs.

The article now states this, but, framing a POV is not quite the same as getting rid of it entirely.  No talk about implications or alternatives should be permitted from the POV that """"supply matters"""", because, according to a consensus of scientists, it doesn't.""",0

To follow up, I am very sympathetic indeed to your project to add the names of distinguished biologists and biological educators. If you'll check what I do around here, you'll see it is mainly to improve and defend the articles of scientists and other academics and related subjects.  But there are some difficulties. I can best exemplify the difficulty by saying that the article on John Tyler Bonner was nominated about 6 months ago for speedy deletion as """"did not assert notability"""" and fortunately rescued. About one member of the US National academy of sciences gets nominated for deletion at AfD a month. They all get kept, but it takes work. 

What is needed for a successful article on a researcher is:
A short bio listing the birth, degrees, positions. 
A paragraph describing the work and how it has been recognized as important
A list of books, & a few major articles. When challenged, I add the number of citations for the most-cited. 
A list of awards and honors and editorships . 
I've been adding grants received. 
if possible a ref from a biographic noticethis gets much easier  after they have died. 
and of course none of it can be taken from a university or other web site, tho the site should be listed as supplying the details. 
Pictures, as you've discovered, add problems. I usually dont try. 
This works if: the person was a full professor at a recognized research university, and has an award or  two from outside the university. Otherwise there are problems; people at non-research places need very solid documentation. Professors of education need really solid documentation. 
 
For educators not noted as researchersawards are needed for professional recognition, and at least one more than the president of NABT will in general be necessary. We have so far not had very good success herevery few high school teachers have made it past AfD. Good luck, and call on me for any help. ''''''  """,0

   Thanks for taking the time to explain Gbawden.  I posted this response to Tokyogirl79 and have also posted here for you.  I would also like to request your assistance in gathering and presenting the materials for Wikipedia entries as outlined below.  

I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. (or really just add my voice to the growing dissent that is out there already).  Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

Stabbed Kercher getting axed
Hello, Wikid77 here. Now that User:Zlykinskyja has been hounded away from editing """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""", the wholesale axing of fully-sourced text has begun. See: removal of forensics. The apparent WP:Wikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman, with legal expertise, trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms. I warned beware of """"colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia"""". Perhaps if American student Amanda had been """"Adam Knox"""" then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20? misquoted infamous statements. (I didn't know any evidence in December 2009, now I know much, and some seems falsified in Italy). Zlykinskyja tried to add how """"Donald Trump"""" rejected the verdict (+source), but that was quickly deleted. Some US officials are conducting a mock-trial by judge to compare verdicts, but I doubt that could be explained in the article. Then some prankster this week posted at top, """"Breaking news: Knox dead in prison from suicide, details not confirmed"""" (from an IP edit in the London area), and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that. I wish we could split the article into several low-target subarticles (I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles). The talk-page has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on """"Amanda Knox"""" and naturally, a prior subarticle was AfD deleted.However, I suggest the following:
 """"Amanda Knox"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article with civil suits, appellate trial, and college coursework in prison.
 """"Raffaele Sollecito"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article, noting he completed his computer degree while in custody, and they met, at a classical music concert, because he looked like Harry Potter.
 """"Prosecution of Amanda Knox"""" (new) - would contain all the pro/anti-Knox text, moved from edit-wars in the Kercher article.
 """"Investigations of Kercher murder"""" (new) - would be a forensic article, with fingerprints, Low copy number DNA, luminol, unidentified DNA/prints, listing exact quotes+sources, etc.
 """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""" (reduced) - would be trimmed into an overview, linking sections to subarticles.
I have seen how other articles, split into subarticles, greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details, so that forensic details would likely match the sources, when viewed there.

Ah, yes, but we probably need a quotation from another view that conflicts it. Would anyone be able to find one? |heru|nar 

Some comments regarding France's utter defeat in the Napoleonic Wars should be part of the article, nonetheless. The fact that France slipped from being the top European power to a secondary level, clearly below Britain's and soon also below Germany's and even Austria's, is hardly contentious. It must be remembered that the Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars came hard on the heels of what appeared to Europe's intellectuals as Britain's final, unavoiding loss of great power status, following the independence of the U.S. (just six years before the assault on the Bastille)  
Actually France was the dominate continental power until the Franco-Prussian war and remains a great power to this day.  

 I must respectfully disagree with this latest assertion, since France was smaller in size and less influential than both Austria and Russia before the Prussian war. Even if one were to concede that it was the main """"continental"""" power, that would imply a loss of status - before the Napoleonic Wars, it was the main European power, including Britain, and had beaten combined enemy armies time and time again. As for keeping great power status to this day, I'm sure that that should come as great surprise to the French, humiliated by Nazi occupation and resolutely defeated both in Vietnam and Algeria. Now, it's true they can veto stuff in the UN - just like the (then) underdeveloped island of Taiwan did until 1973, for whatever that's worth. 
Aussiesta who cares about your stupid POV? you are telling nonsense. nazi humiliation etc, pff. weren't the US humiliated in vietnam, in cuba and now in iraq? so they aren't great anymore then right? didn't the soviet retreated from afghanistan? what about them? the german were defeated and occupied in 1918 and 1945 what about them? what about the old good british? they were wiped by the germans in the campaigns of 1939 (Norway) then 1940 (France) and Dunkirk, a defeat transformed into a great victory, what a joke! actually in indochina and algeria the french had 10 times less casualties than their opponents, is this a defeat? a defeat is supposed to happen when one is loosing a war not when he is winning it. these two decolonization wars were wasted by politics. the very same happened in the overlooked Suez Crisis of 1956. the british surrendered there. they left their french and israeli """"allies"""" without warning. ever heard about the Madagasacar war of independence? no? why? because france smashed the rebellion in a such violent way there are ashamed of. no one knows what happened in madagascar in 1946 so it is not in history books. moreover france is still a great power with remaining overseas territories and a strong nuclear force (the third one in terms of warheads after russia and usa) your beloved austrian and german doesn't have. so watch your tongue. quoting a non neutral POV is just the same as giving your own opinion. who do you think you can fool with your francophobic tricks?

There are important distinctions between branches and twigs.  Branches are heavy structural elements, representing fairly mature tissue, that support twigs.

"Agent X2: Basically thanks - with a 'little' more 

(Little has to be a bit more in this case. It just lies in the nature of the matter.)

First: English is not my native language, so I won't correct the article myself. I rely on others to do that for me, based on my suggestions. Again, I am a german dissident and as a man with a technical background, I do not only have years-long experience with most probably driving around a hidden GPS/GSM bug and the consequences of this arrangement. I also have the ability to become aware of it, although I have to rely on many 'strange observations' which after months of further observation and consideration start to make sense, if you explain them the way I have.

I had prepared a comprehensive letter yesterday summarizing the present situation of the article - i e before your recent changes. For ease of work, let me copy and paste it here, erasing only the sentences that have no more meaning at all. The rest therefore is still true, more or less:

First, I'm not quite sure what implications the 'Articles lacking sources'
classification has. There sure is a lot more to say and show about this
subject, but I think it is already now safe to say that we've got a case. So
what about removing it from this kind of probably discriminatory category? I
suspect that presently it looks like a kind of 'crackpot' article and
therefore doesn't really invite others to join. Would there be a more
suitable 'wanted' category?

Second, we do agree that these appliances exist, and that they also can be
abused. Experience tells you, if something can be abused, it also will.
Experience also tells you, that government agencies are no exception when it
comes to this kind of things. What we need are more details about their (i e
the presumed LEC = military version) size, sensitivity (with respect to the
concealed places they can be attached to) and battery life-span (assuming
they're not installed, just stuck with a magnet or some dough-type
fastener). In the discussion, I gave the URL of a leading german maker of
these objects and tried to draw your attention to the fact that their folder
directed to the LEC is password-protected *), while the material for the
general market is on open display. Would that ring a bell with you?

Third, I would like to see several changes in the article. I'll enumerate
and motivate them in a separate message - see below.

Fourth, I'd like to join everybody into the discussion who is interested in
this subject and can contribute something reasonable (or maybe knows someone
who can). My idea is, this is not just an electronic gadget issue, this is a
civil rights concern. Do you see any other faculties involved, besides
electronics and human rights? How do we spread the word among them? Again,
we need to remove all the discriminatory  classifications from the article
for others to join.

) For your convenience, let me quote that sentence: 'Have you especially
seen my remark regarding the password-protected folder at
http://www.fugon.de/ , expressively directed towards the german LEC ('BOS')?
Wouldn't you agree that this most probably is where all the REALLY
INTERESTING stuff could be found?!? Enigma...'

Third: Desired changes to the article

Foreword: ok

Types of GPS trackers:

I've been informed that they don't necessarily limit temselves to SMS, when
transmitting. Another option would probably be to use GPRS - one of the
wider used packet-switched data transmission modes in cellphone systems.

It is also here that we ought to mention that they are used for tracking
down criminals. I've sent you proof of that. See the discussion page where I
quoted the two media article discussing the german constitutional court's
verdict on GPS/GSM bugs dating back to 4/05.

It ought to be mentioned in that same chapter that there is reason to
believe that there also exist more 'professional' versions for the use
through the military, LEC etc, which are probably smaller, more sensitive
(can be placed 'anywhere' and still work, without external antennas) and
have a long battery life-span.

Potential abuse of GPS trackers:

What is said in the box is basically correct. Could it be re-formulated in a
way to provoke people's interest, rather than stir a feeling for lack of
trustworthiness? Something along the line that 'these are military-style
secrets thus hard to ascertain; anyone from inside this business having
doubts about their ultimate legitimacy should feel invited to",0

These pages contain material which is ha ha only serious. Very ha ha, but also very serious, so pay attention after you're done with the giggles!

Adminitis is a state of mind in which some Wikipedians find themselves at times. Though generally confined to administrators, the condition has been observed in some non-administrators. Although the exact causes are unknown, there is thought to be some correlation towards extensive and prolonged anti-vandalism activity.

 Symptoms 
 Strongly believes that all users are equal but admins are more equal than others
 Assumes bad faith frequently
 TLAitis (see WP:WOTTA)
 Stops editing articles, but continuously pontificates about """"writing the encyclopedia""""
 Impatience
 Exhibits immediatism
 Hangs out in project namespace
 Has no time for featured articles
 Frequently refreshes pages to catch the latest change that (of course) needs to be reverted
 Believes that he or she is always right (sorry, EVula...)
 Believes anyone who uses the word 'vote' for 'express a view in a straw poll' should be banned for life
 Originally hailed as the nicest person on the wiki, now reviled as the most hated troll
 Prevents pages from being edited in encyclopedic fashion for policy reasons
 Seems to enjoy biting new users
 General BOFHness
 Strict adherence to """"Wikipedia policy"""" while not using common sense or conversely,
 Strict adherence to ignore all rules, as a strict rule... while not using common sense
 Self-denial. """"This page cannot possibly apply to me""""
 Humor breakdown. """"This page is not funny""""
 Sudden spike in use of specific admin tools, or use of admin tools in areas where he hadn't been using them before
 Requires less and less evidence to be convinced of sock puppetry until confidently asserting that all new users are the same person
 Spends hours writing sarcastic pages about admin behavior
 Believes he is the only real claimant to the """"Defender of the Wiki"""" barnstar
 Exhibits signs of MPOV
 Thinks people are attacking them when they're only trying to be nice
 Has a habit of removing criticism while pretending it's a personal attack
 Indulges in biting delicious newcomers

 Diagnosis 
It is a near universal truth that sufferers from this illness will reject any diagnosis of the condition by an outside party. With that in mind, it's important for those who have received this diagnosis to conduct a self-test. If more than three of the following apply to you, you may be suffering from this illness: 

 You frequently feel that pages are broken and must be deleted (protection is for wusses!).
 """"Everyone is a vandal or a troll, and must be blocked"""" is a recurrent thought.
 """"Blocking people is a punishment! (not a tool to get people to cool down and edit the wiki)"""" is a mantra, not anti-wiki. 
 If you nominate this page for MfD even though it's only 2 minutes since the last revision, you may possibly be suffering from adminitis.
 Corollary: If you speedy, you are certainly suffering from adminitis.
 If you accuse the creators of this article of making a WP:POINT, especially if you forget that making a point does not imply disruption (you need to disrupt to make a point, not make a point to disrupt! -P), you are probably infected. 
 And if you buy the above line of thought, you are definitely infected.

 Pathophysiology 
The infectious nature of this illness is unknown at this time.  More study needs to be conducted in order to identify transmission mechanisms. No effective containment mechanisms have been identified. So far anti-vandal bots have proved immune to this condition, although as yet there is no convincing explanation concerning this anomaly. 

Observational studies have noted that sufferers will seek the counsel of their Wikipedia friends, but end up infecting them in the process. Other studies have noted the evolution of a Wikipedia editor as potentially having a causal role in this illness.

 Add-in of old material or add to new page 

This edit was definately a great improvement, the only thing is it stripped out some information that I think was good. How about we add some of it back in or add some of it to start a new artcile Goddard Space Flight Center Facilities or List of facilities of the Goddard Space Flight Center or something like that. Comments? Here is the material that was taken out on that edit:

West Campus
The West Campus contains buildings that support administration, research, design and construction of spacecraft, operation of spacecraft, information storage and archival, and data analysis. The buildings generally are two to three stories high, often brick, and simply detailed. Amenities include two cafeterias, a base exchange operated by the Goddard Employees Welfare Association (GEWA), a library, a health services unit, a post office, and recreation areas. West Campus facilities include:
The Diffraction Grating Evaluation Facility (DGEF) was developed at Goddard to evaluate optical components such as diffraction gratings, mirrors, and filters as well as detection systems used in space instrumentation. 
The Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) provides engineering services to missions including orbit determination, attitude determination, maneuver planning, spacecraft navigation systems, and attitude sensor performance analysis. Currently, FDF provides orbit and attitude determination for more than 15 NASA spacecraft, and also supports Space Shuttle operations and expendable launch vehicles. 
The High Capacity Centrifuge located in Building 15 is a 30 g rotary accelerator capable of rotating 5,000 pound payloads at up to 30 RPM and is housed in its own circular building. Tilt fixtures allow the orientation of test articles in a wide range of attitudes and angles. 
The NASA Communications Network (NASCOM) is a global system that provides communications support to all NASA projects. Voice, data, and teletype links are available through the network for connecting the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) with user spacecraft control centers. Land lines, submarine cables, and microwave/satellite links make up this communications system. 
The Network Control Center (NCC) manages the total Space Network. The NCC schedules and configures the TDRSS and monitors the status of ongoing scheduled services. Operators schedule emergency services, isolate any problems in the system, and restore faulty user services. The Control Center communicates with other stations through the NASCOM network.
The Building 3/13/14 Payload Operations Control Centers (POCC) are facilities that provide support to one or more spacecraft missions. Some are operated from GSFC, for example SOHO, and some are operated from offsite, for example Swift. Equipment located in control centers handles all data, generates commands, and interfaces with other stations. The control centers also process experiment commands and telemetry, and control payload and instrument operations. The Hubble Space Telescope Control Center (STOCC) in Building 3 is the facility where Hubble Space Telescope (HST) managers and engineers monitor and control the orbiting observatory. Past missions operated at GSFC include the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, COBE, and IUE.
The Space Environment Simulator is a three-story high thermal-vacuum chamber (nicknamed """"The SES"""") located in Building 10 that features an 8.2 meter diameter by 12.2 meter high vacuum chamber capable of simulating temperature and vacuum conditions for virtually any launch or orbital environment condition. Shroud temperatures within the chamber can be controlled to -180 °C to +100 °C. 
The National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) at GSFC provides online and offline access to a wide variety of astrophysics, space plasma and solar physics, lunar and planetary, and Earth science data from NASA space flight missions. NSSDC also provides access to online information for the spacecraft and experiments that have or will provide public access data. 
The Spacecraft Fabrication Facility where Goddard technicians and engineers manufacture components used for spacecraft assembly. This includes the tools which the astronauts use in space as well as the spacecraft themselves.
The Building 29 Spacecraft Systems Development and Integration Facility is a 7990 m² facility that contains one of the largest cleanrooms in the world. The High Bay Cleanroom is a , class 1,000 (M4.5), horizontal flow cleanroom measuring 30.5 x 38 x 27 meters (100'x125'x89'). Its five {{con",0

"Wikipedia is a source of information on a huge range of issues and topics, many of which do not get an airing in conventional references; it is particularly useful in providing details on obscure flags across the planet that are not often featured in standard works.  Included in Wikipedia’s annals are the flags for example, of Khuzestani Arabs, ethnic Somalis in Kenya,  the Bakonjo of Uganda, the Turks of western Thrace – some decidedly obscure banners but I am grateful to Wikipedia contributors for providing information on these myriad groups which  allows me to know exactly whom these designs represent and understand the context when I see them aloft on news reports and elsewhere. Why therefore are we to be denied similar access to information concerning the extant flag in the English county of Dorset? 
The fact is that a gold flag with a red edged white cross, designated the “Dorset Cross”, can be seen flying across the county; it is also a fact that the town council in the Dorset town of Wimborne has embraced this as their preferred county flag. The design is therefore a tangible reality, that has evident popularity and the full support of a local authority, what factor in these circumstances makes the Dorset Cross ineligible for inclusion in Wikipedia? One might argue that the Dorset Cross is not an official flag - how many of the examples cited above can claim to be official? The four snakes and cross flag depicted in the entry on Martinique in fact specifically states that this is an “unofficial region flag” however, one presumes that it actually flies in the island i.e. it exists and is possessed of a certain popularity and is therefore worthy of note. How does the circumstance in Dorset differ? As in Martinique, the Dorset Cross flag is not official; as in Martinque, the flag can be seen flying in many places, how is this flag then not worthy of mention or depiction in Wikipedia? A trawl across the internet reveals that there are two flags currently commercially available as Dorset flags – one is a banner of the arms of the County Council, which design the general public is not legally entitled to fly, the other is the Dorset Cross, which the public demonstrably are flying but this reality is not being reflected in Wikipedia, where we currently have an illustration of the banner of the arms but none of the Dorset Cross – this strikes me as imbalanced and tendentious. 
The Dorset Cross is a contender in a current competition held under the auspices of the Dorset County Council to select a flag that they will themselves endorse. The competition itself is of course worthy of mention and when all the contenders are revealed they should of course all appear in Wikipedia but the fact is that notwithstanding said competition, the Dorset Cross is already flying and predates the competition and Wikipedia, in not allowing its depiction is guilty of misinformation. One relies on Wikipedia to advise that the flag of the Dinka is a five striped horizontal design and takes such advice on good faith; how odd therefore that one should not be similarly able to consult this resource on a flag that one can see flying in the streets and all about.User:Vexilo",0

 In response to Claude's last two posts.  Backwards of course.  Regarding NRMs - if you'll check the list, you'll see that Assemblies of God, Calvary Chapel, Foursquare, and CMA are all considered both NRMs and denominations.  Just a note.  Also true of the Vineyard Movement, of which there are many comparisons to GCA.  You're right that GCC doesn't like the denominational nametag,   but just like Vineyard many outsiders consider it to be and there is little actual semantic difference.  As far as what a movement is, a couple definitions I found were """"a diffusely organized or heterogeneous group of people or organizations tending toward or favoring a generalized common goal: the antislavery movement; the realistic movement in art."""" and """"An organized effort by supporters of a common goal: a leader of the labor movement.""""
 I say all that to say this.  Movement is a very ambiguous term, more appropriate to an idea.  You're right that GC does use the term frequently.  However, I think the best factual definition, and most suitable for our purposes and for accuracy within the title and intro, is """"GCAC is an association of churches"""".  That's what the AC in GCAC stands for.  Really, that's what we actually see in existence - churches.  Somehow we need to differentiate - I think we need to start with definiing the article as about an association of churches, because we have to pick a topic - that is one thing plaguing us at present as editors.  So let's start with something real, then trace the history of that association. and the present.
 I will re-edit the Today section.  It is not NPOV at present.  What I objected to was not the quote but rather your original sentence before it.  I was confused about the date, couldn't find it in your reference (I was in a hurry).  We need to focus on what we're doing here - we're putting facts up.  We don't need to interpret or extrapolate.  That quote from Bovenmeyer seems to be about  church leadership, with one sentence relating that to autonomy.  For that reason, while I think it should stay, it would be wrong to put that forth as the best description of the GC view of autonomy and congregational polity since neither of those is the topic.      Again, your statement isn't found in the quote.  The quote itself is fine, and appropriate - i don't see any reason that it needs a qualifier - as the quote i put above from the cong. polity article says, leadership/authority is a common integral part of cong. polity, and as we all have said there is no """"typical view"""" - if we're going to have cong. polity as a term in the GCA article, people need to go there and read it (also someone needs to put some serious work in on that article).  I don't have any problem with  deferring to leaders - i just want accuracy here.  Also note that there is a difference between an article in an official publication by one man and an official stance of the org (which is listed in several places), especially given the independence and autonomy of the churches within GCA.

I agree with 100% Andrea James is a vindictive professional transsexual who will hurt any one who disagrees with her or threatens her position as the """"Dowager Empress Queen of the Transsexual Sexual Paraphernalia Society"""". Her education is a grand hoax as is her degree from the University Of Chicago. Andrea James is another transsexual who thinks because she can hide her past life she can make up any all all of her credentials with the thought or fear that no one challenge the validity of them. So you will know if I was graduate of the University of Chicago I would have my diploma displayed on my website with my transcripts if some called my education a grand hoax. Ultimately Ms. James steadfastly refuses to prove that she is a graduate from the University Of Chicago and if she makes up lies of that nature than what can be true about any thing else she claims to have achieved? Andrea James where is the proof, lets see your degree and tran Pityscripts from the University Of Chicago.

Furthermore Andrea loves to use her web-sites as a whipping post to harm professionals reputations who will not bow to her perverted view point. With out one doubt Ms. James needs help but like a pathological liars she will fix it her self and damn the people she hurts. In a way you have to feel sorry for her, however you cannot forgive her crimes against her sisters and the community she claims to represent when she thinks nothing about harming a hard working professionals reputation. In reality what that boils down to is jealousy of the worst nature and her use vile """"Yellow Journalism"""" and evil deeds would make any sociopath proud"""". Andrea James gets an A+ for being a sociopath.

The real tragedy about Andrea James is her failure to admit when she is wrong and to keep on making the same mistake in front of every one because she thinks it will go away. Your wrong Andrea if you want respect and people to like you, than you need to learn that hurting people reputation will not make you any friends.

Well thank you. I am glad that at least you can really look at existing articles, and realise a mistake has been made somewhere and apologise for it, and for that, I shall rest my case. As for the part over the assumption of good faith, perhaps I may just remind, that your introductory comment in my talk page, as well as the revert edit summary you provided are just as inflammatory and a reflection of bad faith to me in my books, and you may similarly wish to reflect a little on how you conduct your edits. To revert another purely due to the """"unnecessarily terse edit summary"""" is simply unacceptable in wikipedia. If you have an issue with my comment, talk it out in the relevant talk page (and I would prefer it to be either in the article's talk page itself or in a more centralised location. This is not some kind of a you vs I issue alone. Others should know what happens in the background too. This is a community, remember?), not revert out of emotional displeasure or just to make a point. That you are """"suspicious"""" of my edits based on past experience in other articles does not vindicate your current action. It speaks of nothing but very bad faith, so you may perhaps do good cleaning up your backyard first before telling others what to do (reminds me very much of global politics for some reason. D).

My comments are unbelievably inflammatory? Well I am sorry, but I do happen to be someone who usually speaks my mind, and I dont mince my words. You will have to get used to my bluntness, I suppose, as much as I have to get used to your behavior as well.

The last I checked, you created the three articles for alliancesm, with NA at the top for each of them. Now please explain to me in what way is NA the home continent for each airline alliance?

No one said anything about it after this change? Well I did, and almost immediately. I dont see any avidence of the continent order being switched back and forth at any time of its edit history, and I certainly do not see anyone commenting on the pre-existing alphabetical listing for a good 14 months straight even when NA is CO's home continent.

"The fact that Jenny is raped while unconscious during the course of the film shows that Jenny may not be aware of all of the sexual encounters she's had.  She may have been raped before, and so her claim that she had only ever had sex with Telly may be false (without her even being aware that it's false.)  I always thought that was the whole point of the rape scene — to show that naive beliefs held by these kids can't be trusted.  Telly's belief that he's only ever slept with virgins is probably false (unless he slept with a virgin who had contracted HIV some other way) and so is Jenny's belief that Telly was her only partner, or that in a culture of random drugged-out sex and casual rape anybody can even be sure who they've slept with.

Edits by me:
searchlight has indeed been sued successfully many times. Someone has altered this fact to suggest that this isn't the case, while providing no proof. I'm changing it back.
 As a magazine, it bases itself on the one of the prime journalistsic principles of not revealing its sources. Amongst those sources have been Ray Hill, Tim Hepple, Matthew Collins, Darren Wells and Andy Sykes.  - isn't this rather contradictory!? Its sources obviously have been revealed, although I shall leave it in. """"prime journalistsic principles"""", however, is rather too complimentary-sounding for a NPOV article.
 Hepple has been discredited somewhat, but that is in no way a reflection on Searchlight's modus operandi. - no idea what's this is supposed to mean. It makes no sense without an explanation. I have therefore removed it - if whoever added want to reinsert and explain, fine.
 few minor NPOV tweaks, along with a little reprasing for better flow, and grammatical corrections (""""MP's"""", etc.). IT is still rather slangy in places, and this ought to be rewritten.

Priority disputes on Wikipedia science pages are quite common (there's on on the Albert Einstein page as well at the moment), and what is required in all cases is to make sure that it can be demonstrated that Wikipedia is reflective of significantly notable points of view, and not fringe points of view. This is not to say that there aren't ways for non-mainstream points of view to be incorporated into articles, and is certainly not meant to imply the correctness of one view over another. So if I am suspicious, just take it into context that in most cases I am used to people trying to push little agendas when they insert priority dispute information like this into articles, and it is nothing personal against you.

 Contested deletion 

This page is not unambiguously promotional, because... (your reason here)   

FWIW I haven't worked at the company for over 8 years, I originally created the page to contribute to Wikipedia on a subject which, at the time, I knew about.  I don't know how accurate what is written is at the moment as I haven't followed it, but I know the company does still exist as I have a friend who still works there.  While I agree the wording of the opening 2 sentences at the moment do now come across a bit 'marketing-ey' (I'm guessing someone has edited since it was created), as a Wikipedia user I'd find it stranger a big company wouldn't have a page on Wikipedia than that the page had some marketing speak.  Rather than deleting the page entirely, why not just fix it by cutting down to the first two sentences to just have the facts about what it does and size?  eg:  """"Isobar is a global full service digital marketing agency with over 70 locations, across 44 markets worldwide""""?

Here's a clip from Sedlar's film which shows first issue of the magazine titled """"Ustaša"""" which Pavelić began publishing in the spring of 1930 (skip to 3:13). Although stylized, the header clearly shows an asymmetrical """"U"""" with a bomb in it (symbolizing revolutionary struggle).
At 3:37 in the same clip a magazine cut out showing the UHRO organization logo is shown as printed by them - an asymmetrical """"U"""", a flaming bomb inside it and a chequoy on the bomb. It looks just like the one Nanin7 had made and DIREKTOR removed (bar the dark-blue color which Nanin7 used to fill in the letter U). The original is black-and-white but the letter itself clearly wasn't meant to be black.
At 5:03 in the same clip the front page of the organization's statute is shown, again, with the same logo as described above, dated 1932.
At 5:22 the narrator talks about the organization logo directly and says that """"The """"Ustaša"""" was defined as a revolutionary fighter, also indicated by their logo, which first appeared in the masthead of the magazine """"Ustaša"""" in 1930. Inside a blue letter """"U"""" a silver hand grenade is depicted, with red flames coming out of it. In the centre of the bomb a small Croatian coat of arms is shown, with the top left field in silver."""" As he is saying that yet another picture of the logo is being shown (this one seems to be an enamel badge). The text btw was written by one Mario Jareb, a historian who wrote several books on the history of the Ustaše as well as one on the history of Croatian national symbols.
At 5:55 in the same clip front page of yet another party newspaper titled """"Nezavisna država Hrvatska"""" (published in New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh and San Francisco), with the same logo shown, this time in the form of an initial in the main headline, dated 1 May 1934. 
So I don't know how much more official can it get. As for the """"several variant"""" thing - I can only assume they dropped the bomb once NDH was established (since per their logic, the revolutionary struggle has achieved its goal) and replaced it with just a chequoy which was then used as a state symbol later on. I've never seen a cross in combination in contemporary use, only in modern far-right graffiti, but I may be wrong. Either way, this article is about the Ustaše party/movement and this version is the closest we will ever come to what was their official symbol. Only the shade of the color blue can be considered debatable (I tend to think it was probably lighter blue than what Nanin7 used).  (''talk) """,0

Dear Alexikoua, I am wondering whether there is any informative value in citing the so-called """"1910 census"""". This is not an official census, it belongs to a series of documents that had propaganda value, in the sense that it was createed in 1919 to help the Greek delegation persuade other participants in the peace conference to yield to its demands and maximize Greek territorial gains in Asia Minor.

I would also be thankful if you could please provide your source for the numbers you cite in the 1914 Ottoman census table. The reason I am asking is that I have Karpat's book right in front of me and some of the numbers differ somewhat. For example, Greeks of Adana vilayet amount to 8,537 in Karpat (1985), pp. 172, 188, not 12,000.

Finally, I would like to add a word of caution, if I may: as I found out reading a note in Kostopoulos, Tasos (2007) Polemos kai ethnokatharse, p. 171 [I can confirm this in a couple of days by comparing Karpat's book, pp. 170-189 and Alexandris, Alexis (1999) """"The Greek census of Anatolia and Thrace (1910-1912): a contribution to Ottoman Historical Demography"""" in D. Gondicas - Ch Issawi (eds.), Ottoman Greeks in the age of nationalism, Princeton, pp. 58-65] despite having the same name, the boundaries of vilayets vary between Ottoman censuses and that of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the 1914 census not including certain sanjaks, like Kutahya, Afion Karahisan, Canik (=Samsun), Eskisehir etc, in vilayets. For these minor, but existing nonetheless discrepancies between the two to be eradicated, it is advisable to adjust one of the two administrative divisions to the other's a model being provided by Kostopoulos, (2009), pp. 170-1.

"Combined Anatolian-Kurgan hypothesis 

I now think that the Proto-Indo-Europeans lived in present-day Turkey.  Yet the Kurgan culture does play an important role in the evolution of Indo-European languages.  I think it was founded by Indo-Europeans which immigrated to the Pontic steppe.  The ones which did not leave were cultural ancestors of the speakers of Anatolian languages.  The language of the Kurgan culture gave rise to all other Indo-European languages.  These include all the ones spoken today.

There were several early splinter groups from the Kurgan culture.  Three of these were the cultural ancestors of the Armenians, Greeks and Albanians.  There may have been more but the languages descended from theirs are so poorly documented we don’t know much of them.

A larger splinter group from Kurgan culture was the Beaker people.  This metalworking pastoral people spread over much of Europe.  The areas were they settled includes almost all of West-Central Europe, the Italian and Iberian Peninsulas, the large islands between them, the British Islands, Southern Scandinavia and probably parts of Eastern Europe north of the grasslands.  With such a widespread culture they soon developed several different languages.  These were ancestral of the Baltic, Slavic, Germanic, Celtic and Italic (including Romatic) ones.

The Kurgan people themselves developed into the Proto-Indo-Iranians, many of which returned to the Middle East.  With the Aryan migration to northern India the Indo-Aryan languages eventually splintered from the Iraniac ones.  This happened not long before these two peoples started to write as Avestan and Vedic are relatively similar.

What do you think about this hypothesis?  No “the Urheimat must be my country because we are the most superior/unique/original” argument, please!  No people in the world are intrinsically superior to any other ones.  It is questionable if any people are “uniquely unique”.  The most original of the living Indo-European languages is probably Lithuanian.  Yet no-one who is not a Lithuanian have seriously suggested the Indo-European Urheimat to be in Lithuania.

Secondly, Schindler's heroism is widely recognized all over the world, while Winton is mostly known by the British who are extremely well-known for loudly bragging about things they never accomplished. He is a purely media-made hero. And third of all, the children he saved were thrown out of their homes in Britain as soon as the war ended.

DOUBLE STANDARDS & NOT BEING NEUTRAL

Dear Wikinews, Wikipedia and """"WHOVILLE"""" since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such.

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete """"when in doubt don't delete"""" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.  If you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop telling the public to follow standards which are double standards and more..  Does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this?

In the """"Dragonlance Legends"""" series (Weis and Hickman) R goes back in time to learn the rest of F's secrets, and they have a magic battle. While the victor is considered to be R, and goes by R, he actually possesses the memories/abilities of both, and they both had the desire to become a god by destroying Takhisis,  so it is unclear which one actually survived the battle. So, with the lack of clear evidence, it is a Schrodinger's Cat situation. By which I mean that, from that point in the storyline, R can be seen as both R AND F, even though they started out as two different people.

You *ARE* indeed clueless. Yes, """"Ariana"""" is a different spelling for """"Aryana"""" which does indeed come from the Avestan's """"Aryanem Vaejo"""" (specifically, in Vandidad, Fargasht-e Yekom).  But the """"Aria"""" that you mention above is Greek for what is in Old Persian """"Haraiva"""" which is modern Herat (Hari-Rud).  Looks like you can't even read and understand a simple text in front of you.  The Greek """"Aria"""" has NOTHING TO DO with """"Arianem Vaejo"""".  Not even a single scholar has ever suggested that Arianem Vaejo is the same as """"Haraivo or the Greek """"Aria"""".  The Greek """"Aria"""" for Avestan/Old Persian """"Haraivo"""" is comparable to how in ancient greek text Hagmatana is written """"Ekbatana"""" or many other examples. The Old Persian satapry Hari-Rud (which was not called Hari-Rud in Old Persian) is clearly mentioned in both Darius I's Behistun Inscription as well as two of Xerxes' inscriptions.  """"Arianem Vaejo"""" on the other hand, is mentioned in the Avesta where I told you above, and numerous scholars have published works on the whereabouts of it (including our own late Dr. Bahram Farahvashi who has a full book by that title, called """"Iran Vij"""").  Nobody (other than our great scholar """"Zereshk"""" of course) thinks it is the same as Hari-Rud/Haraivo/greek """"Aria"""".  

As for """"aberoo"""", I honestly feel sad for you, because your beahviour and edits in Wikipedia clearly reveal that you suffer from an inferiority complex and nearly all your edits are about image and not about contents.

 Statement by {Party 1} 
Nothing being presented here is being taken seriously and all I'm receiving are responses that suggest Nightshift36 has already made up his mind that no matter what is presented, nothing will be added, no matter what the source. http://www.theblackdragonfightingsociety.com/frank_dux.html this website lists many sources that verify his claims and they are still being denied. For example, a prior discussion: The whole story of Frank Dux and the Kumite is a fraud. There is no such thing as the """"Kumite"""" tournament.

Does anyone honestly believe that such a world class underground full contact tournament could have gone on, and there would remain no evidence of it beside Dux's testimony? Anyone who could produce evidence of such a thing would have a million dollar story, but no one has. Wouldn't someone eventually come forward, or one or two fighters maybe speak out against it? What about the families of the fighters? Wouldn't they notice that their loved ones come home with broken bones and missing teeth? Dux himself claims that there were fatalities. In that case wouldn't the families of the dead fighters investigate what happened? Dux further claims that there were spectators gambling in the event (as in the movie), then how could they keep the silence of the spectators for all these years? To this day there remains no video, or pictures or anything to substantiate Dux's claims.

Dux further claims that he holds the record for the fastest """"kick with a knockout"""" at 72 mph. This makes no sense whatsoever. Is there a cop with a radar gun next to ring, measuring the speed of every strike? A 72 mph kick seems impossible, as swords don't even swing that fast. Someone wouldn't just """"jump into"""" such an event either, but they would have training partners, and a record of their fighting career. They would have won tournaments, and fought in other full-contact venues (like ones that actually exist), yet their is no footage or evidence of Dux's participation in such events. He is a martial artist, but nothing like he claims.

The only thing that's been knocked out here is Dux's credibility. Soldier of Fortune magazine exposed his lies about his military career. Using the Freedom of information act they showed that the actual years of his service in the military don't match up with his claims. He could have never served in Vietnam, and was never a special op like he claims. They exposed a picture of him in the military as a hoax, by showing that the ribbons and medals on his uniform are inconsistent with his branch of service. His own response to this is that the uniform was a costume that he was wearing on the way to a halloween party. You gotta be kidding me. Dux sued them for libel and lost.

He also sued Jean Claude Van Damme, saying that he (Dux) had come up with the story for the movie """"The Quest"""", and that Van Damme had made a contract with him for royalties that were never paid. Dux failed to produce any evidence of such a contract, and claimed that the missing evidence was destroyed in an earthquake. Van Damme's lawyer ripped Dux's credibility to shreds, showing that Dux's apartment was not damaged like he said it was,",0

Shiotani Teiko. And dozens and dozens more just like it.

Hi. You created an article saying, in full: Shiotani Teiko (塩谷定好? しおたに ていこう, 1899 - 1988) was a renowned Japanese photographer.

Actually it's Teikō, not Teiko, and according to WP's silly rules we have to ignore his real name of Shiotani Teikō and instead call him Teikō Shiotani. But that's not the main problem, which is that he's described in just about the same way as Kuribayashi Satoshi (栗林慧? くりばやし さとし, born 1939) is a renowned Japanese photographer. Or indeed Watanabe Kanendo (渡辺兼人? わたなべ かねんど, born 1947) is a renowned Japanese photographer. Or Orihara Kei (折原恵? おりはら けい, born 1948) is a renowned Japanese photographer. And so on and so on and so on. Which all means that somebody looking among Category:Japanese photographers is highly likely to land on a mere substub.

I can count on my fingers the people likely to turn a half dozen or so of these substubs into articles. No, on my thumbs: User:Pinkville and myself. But he's busy and I am too. I'd rate the probability that more than half will be converted within a year to more than stubs at well under 1%. It's an interesting """"proof of bot concept"""" exercise, but is it good for anything else? 

Tell you what: I'll match you one for one. You turn two of these into articles; I'll turn two into articles. You turn ten into articles; I'll turn ten into articles. How does that sound?   

That's a great challenge! You're on. –  (talk) (random) 

OK then. Do tell me when you've done one, as I can't keep the whole damn lot on my watchlist. Well actually I can, but I lack the time and effort to put them onto my watchlist. Also, I'll be intercoursingly busy during the next month, so in the short/medium term I may only be able to match you up to ten.

I'm sure I've got entire books by at least twenty of these substubbed people, so I ought to be able to do more.

What's odd about the list are some conspicuous absences. (Not just people I think are good, but people who, rightly or wrongly, are celebrated and successful.) Asai Shinpei is one, and there are more though I can't think of them right now. 

Not that it's any of my business, really, but did you scarf the list from User:20th Century Art (Zenhan)'s page, or do something else?   

Yeah, I scraped from Zenhan. I'll let you know here, or on your talk page, when I have one ready. I don't think I can make any of them featured, but legitimately """"non-stub"""" is the goal. All the best, –  (talk) (random) 

Okay, here's my first. Ichiki Shiro. It's not much beyond a stub, but it's something. (It took an hour of research, and I think I found all the info that's anywhere on the web regarding Mr. Ichiki.) By the way, was I right in listing him as a Hatamoto? My sources say he was a retainer of the Daimyo (in the Edo period, of course), and I know that he spoke with his Daimyo, so he couldn't have been a Gokenin. But I don't think he was a warrior, so I don't know. So far as I can tell, all Togugawa retainers were either Gokenin or Hatamoto. Am I correct in my inference? –  (talk) (random) 

Damn you're fast. 

Unfortunately I don't know squat about Tokugawa retainers and the like. On several occasions I've tried to interest myself in feudal history but have always fallen flat. I suppose I can't separate it from the hammily acted, cheesily lit TV period dramas I sometimes have to tolerate when at the in-laws'. LordAmeth might know. (And this photographer's right up Pinkville's street.)   

How's this for a progress indicator?   
Great! –  (talk) (random) 
Yup, except for a number of factors, one of which is that it's problematical copyrightwise (or so I infer from a comment elsewhere by one User:Quadell). I've already chucked in one extra list, and I'll certainly add one more, and I may add one after that; perhaps it can then be described as an original creation. All this is delaying my editing of any article. Still, I'll get around to that too in time.

Just out of interest, who do you think this nark  is and why is he so motivated to go about doing what he is doing? I put this record up in the open for you and them to see because I have no and have had no connection with you nor any of the journal pages and, frankly, I take offence at being called a meat or sockpuppet of yours when I am not. I am sure that you are just or even more upset as being accused of a connection with me when you have none.

Unfortunately though, that is the depth of 's lies and the shallowness of 's integrity. 

 Where he has no grounds he invents them and he is, oh, so clever at playing WikiTricks with all these technical terms and methods. 

I am starting to feel like a Jew in Nazi Germany being hunted down, connected to individuals which I have no connection with and their so-called crimes and accused of crimes which are not mine. 

And what of ? He just seems to get off on throwing around his weight whilst avoiding entering into the actually factual discussion.

For the record - and let them love every minute of their persecution syndrome, let them avidly copy and paste and make little weblinks to this as they are so good at Wikitricks - I am a vegan of 20 years or more standing and, arguably, MacDonald of Clanranald. I became involved in editing the vegan article before you returned to it recently. I am entirely responsible for kicking this whole thing off because I refused to let  get away with his ridiculous domination of the article and I put  in the same category for his anorexic stuff. 

From my point of view, my objections are largely literary. The article became too bloated and required editing down. It is merely meant to be a definition of what vegan is. I don't see any point in actually engaging in those that oppose veganism. I don't even support vegan's trying to counter counter-vegan propaganda on the Wiki. It is best to keep it short and simple and give a few links so that folks that are interested can go find out more.

I approached  reasonably and got the same sort of response as you did, see ; . When  started to engage in his revisions without consultation, I tried to engage him in reasonable discussion, see ; . But he just ignores it.

 List of convicts 

Not sure why, but this welcome reformatting of the List of convicts on the First Fleet removed a fair bit of detail on some of the convicts.

"This article confuses several different types of anti-personnel ammunition - originally called 'shrapnel' (after its inventor), 'grape' and 'cannister'.  Shrapnel and cannister seem to have been mainly land service ammunition while 'grape' seems to have been mainly naval.

Shrapnel was invented circa 1800, but later that century it was used with more modern shaped shells.  A shrapnel shell is like a flying shotgun, the bullets are ejected while the shell is in flight by a small charge and they fly forwards in a cone.  The charge is initiated by a time fuze (igniferious at this period)in the shell's nose, which is blown clear as the bullets leave.  Bullet sizes varied, but by WW1 they were usually lead antimony alloy with a few hundred bullets per pound weight.

Cannister, in contrast, is bullets in a can and the can bursts as it is fired.  This means cannister is short range.  While shrapnel was little used in WW2, cannister was developed for various weapons including tanks.  Australian Centurion tanks in Vietnam had 20-pdr cannister.

Cannister was always carried by British artillery in its 19th century campaigns and quite widely used. Sometimes it had to be locally assembled from old bully-beef cans. Shrapnel remained their primary anti personnel weapon into WW1, and always the ammunition of choice against 'troops in the open'. In 1945 they successfully trialled 95mm shrapnel fuzed VT.

Beehive, correctly called Splintex, was developed by the US in the Vietnam period.  It is a shrapnel type shell - it is fitted with a mechanical time fuze and the flechettes are fired forward from the shell in flight. It was available for 105mm arty, 106mm RCL, 90mm RCL, and probably others.  US policy was for splintex to be only fired at direct fire, ie for arty it was local defence only, presumably for fear of blinds being re-cycled by the enemy into IEDs.  However, the USSR appears to have subsequently developed 122mm and 152mm shells of this type and used them for indirect fire.",0

 I'm not 100% sure what the practice is on sorting subcategories within their parent category.  I just checked, and I noticed that Category:Historic districts in Massachusetts has the pipe character and then """"Districts"""" after it, so it sorts into """"Districts"""" when you're browsing by letter.  That means you have to go to the third or fourth page, or go to the """"D"""" listings, to see the historic district subcategory.

 The reason I created the subcategory for houses is because there are over 3400 entries in Category:National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts, which is absolutely huge.  I'm using Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser to recategorize the houses into their own subcategory, so that'll organize them somewhat better.

 Possible amicus appeals 

I thought this comment might be of interest. It indicates that anyone could file an appeal of the block, provided the blocked party indicates he wants to appeal it and indicates where he wants the appeal to be made. Under the circumstances, I think it might be possible that a thread could be opened, maybe at ANI, requesting the block be lifted, or, if that proves unsuccessful or doesn't appeal to you, requesting some sort of discretionary sanctions on individuals who might seek to prejudicially malign others. Under the circumstances, I think that there might be a reasonable chance of the block being lifted based on the prejudicial misrepresentation to which you were responding. Alternately, I think that there might be a very sound basis for requesting that backhanded libellous misrepresentation in the matter of the """"c""""-word might be made subject to discretionary sanctions on its own.

 INCONSISTENCIES 

On the two narratives of the Creation Story (Gen. 1:1-2:4a and 2:4b-25), please notice the following inconsistencies:
a. In the first narrative, man was created on the sixth day where man the last of God's creation. On the second narrative, notice that man was first to be created.
b. In the first narrative, all other creatures (birds, fishes, animals, plants, etc.) created before the creation of man where man created at the same time; both Adam and Eve while in the second narrative, note that Adam was first to be created then followed by the garden in Eden and then by the animal creatures. When none proved to be the suitable partner for man, it was only then that Eve was created where Eve the last to be created.
c. In the second narrative, the LORD GOD used the possessive pronoun I (""""I will make a suitable partner for man"""") while in the first narrative, when GOD created man, GOD said """"Let US create man...""""
d. Note that in the first narrative, God created all things using His word (Let there be...) while in the second narrative, Lord God created all creatures including man """"out of the (clay of the) ground"""".
e. In the first narrative, everyday of creation was always concluded with the phrase """"God saw (his creation) that it was good"""" while on the second narrative, the Lord God said """"IT IS NOT GOOD for man to be alone"""" considering it is He himself who created the man that is alone. Believe it or not, it is was a mistake. It then brings us to inquiring whether or not the creation of EVE in the original plan when the narrative suggests that had God did not mistakenly created man to be lonely, Eve could not have been created. Note further that the first choice of the Lord God to be the partner of man was animals. Upon notice of man's loneliness, God created different animals (2:19)and the purpose of their creation is to present them to Adam for man to choose which of those animals he may like be his suitable partner. Eve was actually the second choice after Adam rejected animals. Hence the question again, does God know what he was doing? It seems the creation process a matter of TRIAL AND ERROR. And true enough, EVE is a product of ERROR.
e. Bible scholars are one in the agreement that the second narrative was written way ahead of the first narrative. Gen 2 (the second story of creation) is therefore the original creation story. But why was it written A POSTERIORI the first narrative. Please consider the same parallel confusion of sequence in the first two books of the New Testament. Mark is an older Gospel than Matthew but chronology seem to follow the same confusion between the two stories of creation in the book of Genesis. 

 IRREGULARITIES 
a. On the first day of creation, God created LIGHT. On the fourth day, God separated the light that guides the day from the light that guides the night and all other stars and heavenly bodies. Question is; when did God created the SUN? Was it on the first or the fourth day. If it's the latter, what light did He create on the first day?
b. It is not correct to call the garden Eden. The correct text states (2:8) """"LORD GOD planted a garden in Eden"""". Eden is the place where the garden was planted and not the garden itself. The narrative even mentioned the location of the garden being """"East of Eden"""".
c. Note that in the 2:5, it was stated """"the Lord God had not sent RAIN upon the earth"""". Question: when was rain created?
d. Please check the absurd narrative of Chapter 6 about the Nephilim. SONS OF GOD marrying daughters of man and producing sons who were the heroes of the past and the popular men?"""" Huhhh?
e. It seems disenchanting to consider God a SUPREME ALL POWERFUL BEING but possesses the human frailty of REGRET; (6:6) And the LORD was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
f. NOTE: GEN 1, the creator was GOD. In GEN 2 and 3, it was the LORD GOD. In 4 to 50, its the LORD.

""":::::::::""""Systematically killed"""" is POV. The armies in Tunisia and Egypt weren't attacked, yet they still shot protesters, Egypt shot more within the first month than were killed in Syria the first month, only after the opposition took up arms did the body count rise dramatically. Of course the clashes weren't sectarian in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, since they're overwhelmingly Sunni. That didn't keep Christian Egyptians from being attacked by Salafists though. If the Shia of Bahrain took up arms as the Sunnis in Syria do, they'll be """"massacred"""" too, no doubt about it. And the West wouldn't do a damn thing. Libya was more of a tribe-thing, though secularism versus Islamism also played a role. Secular Liberals in all countries were just the spice that ignited the unrest, they've had zero influence since, unlike what Western media tries to portray.

Thank you  """"If a country's position on the matter receives significant coverage in high-quality secondary sourcing (mainstream media and scholarly works), it is worth inclusion"""". It's basically the standard for WP:WEIGHT I've been proposing for a while now (except that I offered to adhere to a more strict """"two reliable sources"""" rule). I note that what Langus points out is also of relevance to establish the importance of such a section being present in the article.
@Irondome: the source you presented is a good one to give an idea of the weight assigned to the international position on the issue, it doesn't mean we should base the entire section on that article or only articles from that source (in fact: we should not, the more articles from reliable sources the better). The problem with attempting to come up with a summary like you propose is that it would be very difficult to come to an agreement. In this case, short mentions of individual (or grouped, as to avoid listing) positions could prove to be less prone to attract never-ending discussions.
This is what I suggest (all in one single section with separated paragraphs):

 International position (title)
 Opening paragraph about the disparity in pro-Argentinian and pro-British positions being voiced (properly sourced and neutral)
 UN resolutions (briefly, mainly: """"The UN does not recognize the islanders as having a right to self-determination hence Britain continually rejects the repeated UN's calls for resolving the issue through dialog with Argentina"""")
 Mention of the US and EU neutral positions (the """"Monroe Doctrine"""" should be moved to another part of the article as to not extend the US position too much) as major international players. The fact that the islands are listed as a British OCT by the EU and the Commonwealth should be mentioned too.
 Mention of the majority of Latin American states backing Argentina (as per article presented by Irondome, the article presented by me and this article accessible here, section 3.1). China should be added here too being another major international player.
 Finally Spain's position should be mentioned and also its similar issue with Gibraltar (although editors have previously opposed any mention of Gibraltar here, I still think it is worth of mentioning)

That's my proposal and I am of course open to hear comments and/or corrections. It should end up being quite shorter than the current section and easier to source too. Regards.   """,0

 السلام عليكم 
I intend to clean up the Jihad article. I intend it to conform to NPOV standards. Even though there are numerous POVs about it, it is something very simple, a noun, an idea, and something there shouldn't be any argument about. I am worried about people reverting my edits which WILL BE NPOV, simply because they want to- and can. I'm not asking you to help me in potential votes, I do not approve of vote stacking and never ask people to vote for things. I intend to clean up the article in the next week or so, barring complications. All I ask is that you stop by some time in the next coupl'a weeks and provide a voice of reason at some point in the inevitable objection to my edits (which may not be that huge but everyone is edge at that page). Thank you.
P.S. Your story about Avi moved me, I happen to be one of those bourgeoisie foreign Palestinians who have never set foot there and should only open there mouths to support the Palestinians who live there.  

 Anti-Arabism article 

Salam,

Based on what I have read about you, you seem to be very well-respected among many Wikipedians and you tend to have a relatively neutral point-of-view, so I'm requesting that you review the latest additions (mainly mine) to the anti-Arabism article for any biases. Also, are you still planning to amend the article? And what do you think about adding this image found here to the anti-Arabism in Iran section?  It seems to demonstrate the views of anti-Arab Persians very well, so its inclusion is important. However, I'm not familiar with Wikipedia's rules concerning uploading images, you would probably know more about this, what do you think?
 

 A hint 

Here's a hint. If your textbooks in grade schools didn't claim Israel doesn't have a right to exist, if parents in your society weren't teaching their kids that blowing up my people is a wonderful thing that will get them 72 virgins, if your government didn't name streets after mass murderers, pay blood money to the parents of mass murderers, put them on camera hailing their kids as heroes, and if YOUR PEOPLE weren't spending their time and money on buying weapons and digging smuggling tunnels instead of fixing infrastructure, starting businesses, and building better lives, then there would be no need for checkpoints, no need for a big-ass wall, no need for anything of the sort. And you'd have your state. You'd have had it decades ago if your goal was to have a state.

You could have been living freely, if the Arab states had accepted the offer, signed a nonagression pact, and let you come home instead of stuffing your parents inside """"refugee camps"""" cynically turning you into shock troops and poster children for """"oh look what the Jews did to 'our people' when we stuffed them into refugee camps instead of taking the easy way to let them go home.""""

You could have had a Palestinian state in 1948. You could have had one at any time after that.

But it's as you say. """"On the last day, even the rocks and the trees will shout 'O Muslim, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him!""""

Your goal isn't a Palestinian state. It's the death of my people and establishing a sharia state on top of their cooling bodies.

I just cleaned up some of your ridiculous lies on one page. I'm not going to bother checking anywhere else - YET. That would be wikistalking.

DOn't put words in my mouth.  I'm not on the same premise as you here.

 A reaction to the above comment 

Some good points here, some of which are accounted for very well on the page about the SWP US. It seems better that this entry on Barnes remain focussed on Barnes himself rather than the SWP.
DICTATORSHIP OR DEMOCRACY - It's an excellent point to say that it's pointless and misleading to demonise Barnes. Clearly, there was a qualitative change in the politics of the SWP during the 1980s. Barnes clearly played a leading role in this process, but had the national committee majority behind him. Most would also say that the SWP organisational and democratic norms changed: those who were expelled, such as the Fourth International Tendency, argued it was done undemocratically and wrong-headedly.
BREAKING WITH TROTSKYISM - This seems a fair description of the SWP's evolution. However, if the SWP feel it unfair, it would be better to write of a """"break with Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution and the struggle to build the Fourth International."""" In so far as Trotsky agrees with the Leninism, and opposition to Stalinism and the third period, the SWP agree with him. However, Trotskyism clearly refers to the politics of the movement that Trotsky and the SWP founded: the FI. The defining aspects of that movement: permanent revolution in the developing world; anti-bureaucratic revolution in the workers' states and the notion of socialist democracy. Of course, the SWP no longer calls itself Trotskyist and the word is dropped, for example, from the title of Joseph Hansen's book on Cuba.
CASTROISM - Similary, it is mistaken to call the SWP a Castoist party. The SWP's 'New International' strategy in the 1980s and 1990s was one of convergence with the Castroist current. However, it's clear that the SWP has its own ideology.

Wikipedia is hosted in the US, so US laws on copyright, etc. are enforcable. That's just the way it is, and we need to avoid legal action being taken against the foundation. To be honest, I don't see big differences in behaviour of editors by nationality, so far as nationality is apparent - I suspect that there are just more Americans here than any other nationality, simply due to sizes of populations of English-speakers, so any group of editors is likely to have more Americans than anything else, including the helpful, constructive, thoughtful ones. I think, however, that there are a higher proportion of editors here now than ever before who have little interest in adding and improving content, preferring to delete, argue, try to raise the bar on notability and fair use guidelines to allow more to be deleted, etc., but I don't see this as a wholly US phenomenon.  08:15",0

By the way, I am not denying that 5 trains are sometimes seen on the west side, and that 2 trains are sometimes seen on the East side. I am merely suggesting the standard for when such things are sufficiently notable to belong in the articles.  

Well Marc, you're right about that. I will look around and until I find something about this matter the pages will stay the same. imdanumber1 

Marc: Although 5 trains travel via West Side Express, it doesn't show it so on the online MTA map. Same thing for the 2 operationg East Side Express. Well, for both trains, they sometimes go to New Lots or Utica Avenues, but doesn't say so. Well, the way that the trains run decides what should be put on artcles, don't you think?  

If you look carefully at the MTA map, there is small print in the lower right-hand corner. Under the , it says, """"some rush hour trips to/from New Lots Av, Brooklyn."""" Under the , it says, """"some rush hour trips to/from Utica Av or New Lots Av, Brooklyn."""" There is no such small print indicating that  trains occasionally run on the East side, or that  trains occasionally run on the West Side. The link is .

For the record, I remain opposed to listing the Eastern Parkway Line stations beyond Franklin Avenue as being served by the  and . I think it's confusing, and highly inappropriate for a general purpose encyclopedia. Everywhere else in the MTA literature and signage, those stations are not shown as served by the  or . Since the MTA saw fit to say so only in a footnote, we should do the same. However, I was outvoted, and the MTA map does provide a fig-leaf of support for the majority view.

The previous comment of the article states that MOC was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920 and a ban by the Serbian (then Yugoslav) autocratic King Aleksandar. 
The article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. 

The statement """"over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""" is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that """"most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""", but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.

You can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that """"all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918."""" This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in """"its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church"""" it is not balanced. Also, the statement """"its following is small to the point of non-existence"""" needs to be based on fact not fancy. Do you have an official census of followers or is this your speculation?

If the Manx are identified as a separate ethnic group, then why aren't the Channel Islanders?  You want so much to believe that the Normans aren't related to the English that you omit them from the related groups section, but keep the Bretons who aren't even part of the British Isles.  In fact; archaeology confirms that the Bretons left Britain as Salian Franks were among the Nordic invaders when Rome fell.  TharkunColl says that the Normans aren't related, but you say that the Channel Islanders do not constitute a separate ethnic group.  Where is the consistency of logic in those assumptions, which defies consensus outside of your joint control of this article?  Things are much different in the wide world of academia and scholasticism.  Well, Channel Islanders speak a language closer to English than any Celtic tongue.  Why is that a bad thing; why does negative POV have to be accepted?  Now, who is fantasising about the Dark Ages again?  Why would the Normans of the Channel be excluded, when they are HM the Queen's loyal subjects?  Remember what they endured for us during WWII, which the Celtic nations did not have so bad...  When has Brittany declared their loyalty these past 500 years?

At least insular Normandy is still with us and this is a fact that TharkunColl especially hates beyond all doubt, since it means that England still has a major toehold of continual ethnic relations with France (while Hanover has come and gone).  He is upset because he views the French relationship to be unfair to England, but has no qualms about that in relation to English """"oppressive influence"""" on Celtic speakers with special help by German princes.  The same POV TharkunColl uses to exclude the French is that which the Irish use to exclude the English.  The question is, why would you do something to others if you do not want it done to yourself?  (TharkunColl claims that he is not bound by the Golden Rule, since he is not Christian) The solution is for English and Irish nationalists to not act this way at the Wikipedia.  Wikipedia is not a vehicle for these types of POV; these Balkanist notions.  When discussing ethnic relatives, the Channel Islanders are a mutual bridge between the English and French.  This is confirmed by all academics and scholars; that you two fringe-theorists disagree is of no consequence to the world at large.  On this page, there are several objections to your dual consensus, but TharkunColl calls them fantasy.  Why don't we all gang up on you Francophobes together?

You keep the French out because of this Hanoverian fringe who says the English are Germans.  He supports the errant belief that Hanover is where the English come from as opposed to where Denmark's old sphere of influence was and before the Holy Roman Empire and/or Kingdom of Germany existed.  German princes have no roots in England at allthey have only been recent and foreign: Habsburg, Orange-Nassau, Oldenburg (now Mountbatten), Hanover and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (now Windsor).  When George changed to Windsor, it did not conceal the true nature of the monarchyneither did the Bombing of Dresden in Saxony have that effect of integrating these Germans.  The more they try so hard to be accepted, the further our people have rejected their status as our Sovereigns.  There have never been so culturally and socially unpopular royalty in the history of the British Isles, yet for some political reasons...others feel it is necessary to make a stalemate by using a straw man fallacy against the Anglo-French fusion which has been witnessed in posterity; by noting that the Germans are an unpopular choice for inclusionall the while saying that Hanover is where the English people are from.

Please, let historical precedent decide who is a part of the English people vs who is only in governmental or political relation/alliance as a result of religious divisions and Parliamentary dictation of Royal affairs ever since the time of colonialism and especially 1603.  Henry VIII of England neither liked Martin Luther and his Prussian/Hanseatic culture, nor was Anne of Cleves going to provide an heirby choice of a King desparate for heirs.  That was the sentiment of the people, whom if Protestant had some Calvinist/French (Huguenot, Puritan) leanings to the exclusion of others.  Wesley's Hanoverian entrance to our religious climate had as much """"imported spirituality"""", from the Moravians obviously not being part of English dispositioneven if Wyclif and Jan Hus seemed to get along for the sole purpose of dissent, they were false friends and allied by circumstance of a mutual """"enemy"""".

preventative measures:
dependant upon control and elimination of the insect vector .
There is currently no artificial means of prevention.
Methods used to prevent the spread of disease, or to protect individuals in areas where malaria is endemic, include prophylactic drugs, mosquito eradication, and the prevention of mosquito bites. There is currently no vaccine that will prevent malaria, but this is an active field of research.

Some drugs that can be used for treatment of malaria can also be used for its preventative qualities however they need to be taken daily or weekly. These are seldom used by those living in a malaria abundant enivornment and are commonyl found amongst travellers visitng regions of hight malaria activity.
Quinine was used starting in the seventeenth century as a prophylactic against malaria. The development of more effective alternatives such as quinacrine, chloroquine, and primaquine in the twentieth century reduced the reliance on quinine. Today, quinine is still used to treat chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum, as well as severe and cerebral stages of malaria, but is not generally for malaria prophylaxis.

Modern drugs used preventively include mefloquine (Lariam®), doxycycline (available generically), and atovaquone proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone®). The choice of which drug to use is usually driven by what drugs the parasites in the area are resistant to, as well as side-effects and other considerations. The prophylactic effect does not begin immediately upon starting taking the drugs, so people temporarily visiting malaria-endemic areas usually begin taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and must continue taking them for 4 weeks after leaving (atovaquone proguanil only needs be started 2 days prior and continued for 7 days afterwards).

Controlling the vector is the most useful way of preventing the spread of malaria.
Efforts to eradicate malaria by eliminating mosquitoes have been successful in some areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but the draining of wetland breeding grounds and better sanitation, in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from affluent regions. In 2002, there were 1,059 cases of malaria reported in the US, including eight deaths. In five of those cases, the disease was contracted in the United States. Malaria was eliminated from the northern parts of the USA in the early twentieth century, and the use of the pesticide DDT eliminated it from the South by 1951. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a major public health effort to eradicate malaria worldwide by selectively targeting mosquitoes in areas where malaria was rampant.[12] However, these efforts have so far failed to eradicate malaria in many parts of the developing world - the problem is most prevalent in Africa. The United States itself may face the spread of malaria in the future as climate change (warming) leads to an expansion of the areas in which mosquitoes are active..

Mosquito nets and prevention of mosquito bites

Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people, and thus greatly reduce the infection and transmission of malaria. The nets are not a perfect barrier, so they are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to search for a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets.[16] Since the Anopheles mosquitoes feed at night, the preferred method is to hang a large """"bed net"""" above the center of a bed such that it drapes down and covers the bed completely.

The distribution of mosquito nets impregnated with insecticide (often permethrin) has been shown to be an extremely effective method of malaria prevention, and it is also one of the most cost-effective methods of prevention. These nets can often be obtained for around US$2.50 - $3.50 (2-3 euros) from the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and others.

For maximum effectiveness, the nets should be re-impregnated with insecticide every six months. This process poses a significant logistical problem in rural areas. A new type of impregnated net, called Olyset, releases insecticide for approximately 5 years[17], and costs about US$5.50. ITN's have the advantage of protecting people sleeping under the net and simultaneously killing mosquitoes that contact the net. This has the effect of killing the most dangerous mosquitoes. Some protection is also provided to others, including people sleeping in the same room but not under the net.

Unfortunately, the cost of treating malaria is high relative to income, and the illness results in lost wages. C",0

Grizzlygus1 - I believe criticism sections are almost always going to be inappropriate in Wikipedia. Just about everyone has somebody who disagrees with them about something. Some, like outspoken atheists, will have more than many from conservative religious parts of society who disagree. That's a given. We cannot possibly list all the criticism, so what's the point of listing any? We should just describe what's significant about someone (i.e. why they have an article here) and let others decide on the merits of their actions and views. The same goes for people significant for their strong religious views. List those views, and let it stand. Going any further will inevitably create the debate of """"how much further?""""

The tank losses extremely biased

The Indian tank losses are exaggerated at atleast 175 tanks this means some Pakistani wants to believe that even more than 200 Indian tanks were destroyed. And the Pakistani tanks losses are put at minimal 200 tanks. The original source is US library which i dont consider as neutral at all considering the fact that US was a supporter of Pakistan. The losses dont reflect the fact that Pakistan lost almost all major battles of """"Khem Karan"""", """"Phillora"""",""""Burki"""" and even at Chawinda according to pakistan general himself pakistan lost 34 tanks(india claim 57tanks) on the other hand Pakistan exaggerate its claim to 120 tanks(India accept only 29 tanks) more importantly at Khem Karan and Phillora Indian army put on display some 100 tanks at khem karan and 58 tanks at phillora then how is it that pakistan losses are mere 200 and Indian losses """"Atleast 175"""" a complete lie. 

Spencer C Tucker one of the most renowned military historian puts pakistan losses at 300 tanks(Indian claimed 494 tanks) and Indian losses at 150 tanks(Pakistan claimed 290tanks).

http://books.google.co.in/books?id=N481TmqiSiUC&pg;=PA172&lpg;=PA172&dq;=pakistan+tank+losses+1965&source;=bl&ots;=O9UCZHbyUs&sig;=-oILZn-csKxRzDXKPkNF3-dGEPY&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=rZsOUPWhENHirAfzuIDoBg&ved;=0CFUQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q;=pakistan%20tank%20losses%201965&f;=false

All the Indian editors plz focus on this the neutral losses are represnted by US figures which i think are biased and further Spencer C Tucker is also one of the most renowned historian , even Stanley Wolpart and Jeremy Black made it clear that at the end of war Indian Army has Twice the number of tanks(Pakistan started with more tanks when war started).

All the Indian editors must raise this issue as some pakistani editors think that by peddling lies they will win the 1965 war.

The thing is that Saying that the Vedas permit beef-eating and cow-slaughter amounts to striking a lethal blow to a Hindu’s soul. Respect for bovine or livestock animals is a core tenet of Hinduism. But, Once you are able to convince a hindu of flaws in the foundation of this core tenet and make him feel stupid/guilty, '''he becomes an easy prey for the predator faiths. There are millions of ill-informed Hindus who are not empowered to counter argue and hence quietly surrender (and convert).Vegetarianism is an integral part of most schools of Hinduism. The Vedas are also accused of animal sacrifice in sacrificial ceremonies popularly known as the YAJNA. Interestingly a section of home-bred intellectuals claiming to have deep study of ancient India has also come up, who cite references from works of western indologists to vindicate such untrue accusation against the Vedas.The Vedas have not condoned the practice of killing animals anywhere,. But, due to the rise of dilettantism fused with a plethora of societal changes, influence of external cultures and severe lack of awareness about real Vedic injunctions, the role of religion has withered over the years.

But alas, thanks to all the slanderous and conjectural accusations heaped upon the Vedas that can be attributed mainly to the interpretations of commentaries written by Mahidhar, Uvat and Saayan in the medieval times; and to what Vam-margis or the Tantra cult propagated in their books in the name of the Vedas, animal Sacrifice is rashly associated with Hinduism (as if the religion itself promotes violence against animals).

In the more recent times, Swami Dayanand Saraswati – known as the grandfather of modern India – interpreted the Vedas as per the correct grammars of the language and authentic evidences. His literature, which includes commentary on the Vedas, Satyarth Prakash (loosely translated as """"Light of Truth""""), An Introduction to the Vedas and other texts led to widespread social reformation based on Vedic philosophy and dispelling of myths surrounding the Vedas.Some verses of Vedas prohibiting killing animals:Some verses from other Hindu scriptures prohibiting Killing animals:'''

Wikipedia Guidelines: The common theme in the notability guidelines is that there must be verifiable, objective evidence that the subject has received significant attention from independent sources to support a claim of notability. The absence of citations in an article (as distinct from the non-existence of sources) does not indicate that the subject is not notable.

Wikipedia Guideliens: No subject is automatically or inherently notable merely because it exists: The evidence must show the topic has gained significant independent coverage or recognition, and that this was not a mere short-term interest, nor a result of promotional activity or indiscriminate publicity, nor is the topic unsuitable for any other reason. Sources of evidence include recognized peer reviewed publications, credible and authoritative books, reputable media sources, and other reliable sources generally.

The Harbrace Guide to Writing books (both of them, published and distributed to colleges throughout the U.S. referencing the film) falls under credible and authoritative books.

Since I am a long-term donor of Wikipedia, it seems that this is a direct violation of what Wikipedia professes their site is. 'The Free Encyclopedia'. An Encyclopedia is a reference for documented, written sources. Together, all the sources add up to an article, which deems notability as referenced above.  I am not trying to be argumentative, but factual in what Wikipedia claims they are as a source, and what they have told me they are in terms of my donations as a supporter over the years.

Bill,

I don't find your un-edits a gender-based attack.  I am largely concerned with the content of the article itself, but I wonder why you put up so much opposition to my very small edit.  Surely it can't mean that much to you.

I don't want to make derogatory comments about men.  I have nothing against men, and I don't enjoy tearing people down.  You mention the term """"well-referenced"""".  I prefer for statements to be well-referenced too.  I don't think that this particular statment is well-referenced, and furthermore, I don't think that it can be well-referenced, because I don't think that it is true.

And nobody has PROVED the accuracy of the article. The part about Gwen not being able to pass was culled from many people that knew Gwen well and stated that Gwen could not pass. In the Rolling Stone article, it was mentioned that Gwen could not get a job because of her visible transgendered status, in other words, that she was clearly a biological male. Most Photos of Gwen look to be a biological male made up as a female. You can insist over and over that this is not the case, but it clearly is. Gwen was also attacked weeks before by people who clearly recognized her tyransgendered status. Yet we are supposed to believe that almost everyone Gwen came into contact with knew she was transgendered until she met up with these three men and their group of friends?? Somehow they were magically oblivious to what most others can clearly see? 

[QUOTE] That doesn't make her """"dangerous behavior"""" a way to wink and say, """"well, she got what she deserved"""".  [/QUOTE] 

I NEVER implied that Gwen deseved to be murdered, and that is a sick contention of your part! Gwen clearly engaged in behavior that put her at great risk of someone raping, killing or beating her. When the Transgendered do not have a support system in place, and by that I mean qualified professionals as well as understanding friends and family, they are at great risk. Gwen's family, as well as friends, were no doubt sympathetic and loving, but Gwen had no other support or therapy. Gwen should have been in a support group at the very least, and perhaps been transitioning after therapy before attempting to passing in public, which is very dangerous in most places no matter how passable the person is or believes themselves to be. Yes, these guys are scum, and thats even more reason to take any motivation they claim with a grain of salt. But the bottom line is: Gwen should have been more cautious. 

And lets honsetly answer the question once and for all: Was Gwen wrong in not revealing her gender status before having anal sex with some of these men (And it has been widely reported that it was anal not oral sex!). I find it impossible to believe that if it was indeed oral sex that not one of these purported hetrosexual males made a boob grab! This whole situation does not pass the smell test!

"I have to disagree that it has any place outside of a speculative mention within this article.  This is mostly because all of the science surrounding powered descents without heatshields due involve the concept of a tethered descent.  All of the science regarding this topic is contained within the topic of the space elevator.  This includes the material concerns, robotics, energy transfer to power the climbers, etc.  Even more notable is that all the talk on this topic mostly concerns ascension, ie placing satellites into orbit.  Very little is concerned about or researched on the topic of descension with a space elevator.  Mind I call it a space elevator because this is the recognized term used to describe it within technical circuits, including NASA and other research institutions.  I agree that the idea is a possibility within 200 years for a powered descent without heat shielding,  but as of now, there is simply no research, talk or even speculation on any project to even look into it.  Thus, a mention at best within the article.

 RE:RE: Blagojevich 

Copied from my talk page, no response required

Hey folks, since there's two users in this talk I'll just thread this here.  I promoted it to ITN on the reasoning that the removal of a state executive is, IMO, notable whether the subject himself is or not (though I'd figure it is inherent).  Seemed obvious to me that this was more than Wikinews, which is why I skipped the discussion phase.

As to the portal, thanks for letting me know, I was not aware of the duplication being needed in the editing, I thought it was transcluded.  Learn something new every day ;)

And lastly, I still think that it should be on the main page.  While I can understand Spencer's logic in that it needs more information to make it encyclopedic and not just news, I personally don't think that anymore should or could be added to the article on the Blagojevich scandal at the time and it is a pretty descriptive article.

What I changed on the Quadric (projective geometry) page was simply an incorrectly directed link to a disambiguation page.

"""Revisiting neutrality on the Clinton entry==
I edited some content about the Richard Mellon Scape adversarial relationship with Clinton that dogged his career for 8 years and even after he left office. Many of the controversies raised during Clinton's term were a DIRECT result of the Scape Arkansas Project and to see any reference to Richard Mellon Scape's part in Clinton's troubles just """"disappear"""" seems like a very """"right-wing-view"""" sanitization of the Wikipedia. 
As the, arguably, most important adversary of Clinton for a lengthy portion of Clinton's political career, to obliterate any mention of this relationship comes close to censorship.
R.M. Scape is one of two very large and looming forces at work in American politics in the early 21st century, the other being George Soros on the left. Their fingerprints, from behind the curtain, certainly draw analogies to the Wizard(s) of Oz.
Please note that I did not vote for Clinton either time, being somewhat more conservative, but I have noticed an apparent right shifted bias developing in areas that touch upon politically related items in the Wikipedia lately - and """"it ain't good"""" as they say. 

This slow erosion of complete disclosure concerning what is stylized as """"right wing leaning"""" viewpoints and the retention of those things which critisize """"left wing leaning"""" viewpoints is subtle but steady - not just here, but across many places on the Wikipedia. While they make me smile sometimes, my inclination toward keeping Wikipedia neutral reins in my mirth.

I would encourage the group to rethink the neutrality of Wikipedia & work very hard to balance the influences on both sides to prevent any more of this """"shading"""" of the Wikipedia.

I know it is very hard to remain absolutely objective but it is imperative that we do so in order to remain a respected source. To remain COMPLETELY factual without opinionated bias, it seems to me Wikipedia should error on the side of INclusion rather than EXclusion.

 Misrepresentation of Eugenie Grandet's character 

The intro to this article says the Eugenie inherits her father's miserliness.  The end of the article states that she continues, as an orphan and widow, to live in his miserly ways, but without his obsession with gold.  This is not correct.

The one who inherits the miserliness of Grandet is Charles, his nephew.  Balzac states this explicitly near the end of the book when he says that this trait  """"found an outlet"""" in Charles, rather than his daughter.  Charles, grows from a callow and spoiled young man into a corrupt libertine and finally into a hard-nosed skinflint.

Eugenie, whose character is one of modesty, piety, and love, continues to live in the simple and austere manner of her upbringing, but she knows nothing else, and, having been betrayed in love, wants nothing for herself.  In tremendous contrast to her father, she is extremely generous with people, giving Nanon a fine marriage portion, distributing funds far and wide for charity, and endowing public institutions like libraries and hospitals.  Her personal austerity springs from a lack of interest in material comfort, not from miserliness.

"""::Just because a man says """"I have...axe..."""" (e.g. """"I have no axe to grind"""")  does not mean that he is threatening you with personal violence then, or that later if/when he has an axe that he is threatening to take it to a grinding wheel and then attack you, or that he is threatening to use an axe or knife or hatchet or anything on you, etc. If that is what you get out of that phrase, or every time the word “axe” or “cut” or “hammer,” etc., is spoken or written, you find yourself worried or uncomfortable, I think that you should discuss these concerns with someone you trust. The person(s) you trust can discuss these concerns with you and/or direct you to others with whom you can discuss these concerns further.

People, including you, commonly use even more colorful  expressions and lingo without the slightest intent to threaten someone  at least we all hope you are not intending to be threatening when you make commentds including an axe.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Queen_(band) If people are responding to you, when you say these things, in a manner that indicates that they are taking what you say as a threat, you may wish to discontinue saying such things, and, candidly, even all the more so if you are actually intending to make a threat.
 
If you are concerned that a particular phase that you feel has been directed at you is a threat, and you believe that you are in some danger, then the only responsible advice anyone can give to you is for you to contact the appropriate police authorities and report it to them. My personal opinion that you are completely wrong does not matter. It is an issue, for you, of safety. It is better that you bother the law enforcement authorities with matters that were not a threat to you (but that you felt were a threat), than to fail to report a real threat for fear that you are over-reacting. They will either provide you the help you need or arrange for that help. It may be that you are overreacting or reading more into what someone says. It may be that the help you need is not exactly of the type you think you might need. All that can be worked out in time. What is important first is that you are actually safe. What's really going on in the messages that you are reading is something that, if you are truly concerned for your safety, can be sorted out later.

 Still concerned about balance 

I've put in a fair bit of time on the article, both in verifying/cleaning content and filling in material, enough that I think I can say I have gone over things in detail.

Look, for example, at Korea and the Caribbean/Cuba/Cuban missile crisis; those are a start on what I think is encyclopedic coverage. Just to say, with no other background, that the CIA trained police or set up an Operation Gladio network really doesn't give information; I'd recommend waiting for more background and context.

There are news reports from reputable journalists, but there are also quite a number from activists for varying positions. I'm afraid I don't give equal credit to a staff writer for the Washington Post and for the Revolutionary Worker.

The article is impossibly long, yet its covert operations section is full of fragments. It's going to have to break up so those fragmentary sections can be edited; it's taking a long time to save the file now.  Note that I was able to put estimative/analytic material in for Korea and Cuba. Much data of that sort is available, often in the form of the actual declassified documents. Not to put in relevant reports, National Intelligence Estimates, etc., gives the impression that the agency is purely covert operations, since the reports were almost never mentioned for countries I sawjust controversial """"dirty tricks"""". That's not NPOV.

Many sources are available for the report literature, including the George Washington University National Security Archives, the Avalon Project at Yale, the archives at Mount Holyoke, the military staff colleges and research institutes, the Foreign Relations of the United States series, and even the CIA FOIA Reading Room. There is, for example, a huge amount of reporting about Southeast Asia, including strong disagreements among the CIA, military, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and White House (Sam Adams' book, War of Numbers is excellent, but also see the Pentagon Papers).

I'd like to suggest that people editing this look at some of my articles on the process of intelligence, which may help understand things that aren't just covert destabilization. Start with Intelligence cycle management, which will take you through a hierarchy of articles. The HUMINT sections do deal with clandestine rather than covert activity; I'm actively working on them. The article on Clandestine HUMINT and Covert Action is particularly relevant both in history, and balance between clandestine and covert activities. Especially in WWII, there was often a conflict between operations and intelligence gathering. 

Please let me help, but understand that my reaction is that things come across as very accusatory and unbalanced. Believe me, I am very aware of both improprieties and just plain incompetence in intelligence agencies, and they need to be brought out  but in an encylopedic, not fragmentary and accusatory way.

the so called most beautiful woman on earth is brown and not white. indians do not self identify as whitea (maybe some pathetic race-traitors do). indians are indians, even if we would fall under the caucasoid category. probably we might have the same forefathers, but thats long ago.

The difference in perspective is in your saying that you are baffled by """"the link between terrorism and Iraq"""" but no in the next say there was no significant link between Iraq and Al Qaeda.

I would say that Iraq was one of the links in the chain or terrorism, which is supported not simply by Usama pulling strings in Afghanistan, but by a network of recruiters, trainers, financiers and sympathizers. For a variety of reasons Iraq was a central link in this chain. Perhaps I could put it this way. When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the U.S. went to war with Japan, but it also went to war with Germany and Italy. Hitler didn't attack the U.S.; Mussolini didn't attack the U.S. Bu that they were Japan's allies, half a world away, was enough.   | explains it all ® 7 July 2005 16:18 (UTC)""",0

 RE: Maccabiah teams 

I understand what you mean. I myself was somewhat reluctant to add them to that section at first, exactly for the reason you have stated. I think it's a shame, however, to see the Maccabiah teams entirely out of the """"national"""" section of all the templates.

Here's an idea that, I believe, addresses both your and my concerns.

 Let's Clarify Something here 

First of all, nice to meet you Stephanie Adams. I to am a very well known celebrity, I just in fact was almost a winner for a daytime Emmy award (but that's neither here nor there)

I think what the big confusion is about Wikipedia is that it is verifiable information, not what you WANT on your wikipedia article.

Meaning, awhile back your website sold tarot card readings via email, we can all see that looking at the cached version of it. Maybe you do not do that anymore but your company DID in fact do it. Therefore since Wikipedia is a historicaly piece of work, it should be listed. Maybe instead you could add in """"Used to.... but does not anymore""""

I used to dance with Hula Hoops on stage. I do not anymore. But if a person put on my Wikipedia Article, """"Julianna Mauriello used to dance with hula hoops on stage"""" then I could not mark that as non factual and write on wikipedia that it is not true. So for that reason, since I can see that your website USED to sell Tarot readings via email, I am going to revert it but also comment it to show that you no longer DO tarot card readings.

 Philosopher RFC 
philosopher (from Wiktionary): A person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy.

I am going to make the case that we must call Stefan Molyneux a """"philosopher"""" (without qualifiers) in the lead.  This is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy, only that it is his career. (Note: Not all of the sources I use below are in the article at present. The point here is to first convince RFC respondents that """"philosopher"""" is accurate and widely accepted, then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place.)

 Definitions 
Obviously, each source is going to use slightly different phrasing. Some will call him explicitly a """"philosopher"""" or has views on """"philosophy"""", but I think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent. Using one word """"philosopher"""" in the lead sentence covers all of his political, ethical, and theistic specializations in one word, which we then elaborate on later in the article.

 """"philosophical conversation"""", """"philosophy show"""" - used to describe his Freedomain Radio series
 """"libertarian"""", """"libertarian thinker"""" - """"Libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies ...""""
 """"anarcho-capitalist"""" - """"Anarcho-capitalism ... is a political philosophy...""""
 """"voluntaryist"""" - """"Voluntaryism (or sometimes voluntarism), is a libertarian philosophy...""""
 """"athiest"""" - """"Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches.""""
 """"ethics- """"Ethics, sometimes known as philosophical ethics, ethical theory, moral theory, and moral philosophy, is a branch of philosophy""""
 """"Secular ethics- """"Secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy...""""

 Primary source 
As Stefan Molyneux is a living person, we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him (obviously, we don't want to host any sort of """"fringe"""" claims). If we are to dispute what he says about himself, though, then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this, or we open Wikipedia to discredit or liability - this is why BLPs are held to strong standards in the first place. I think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct. He is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media, which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the """"old-school"""" philosophers we're used to.

 Freedomain Radio """"About"""" page - """"my Master's Thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies """", """"I have been fascinated by philosophy - particularly moral theories - since my mid-teens.

 Freedomain Radio (the show that Molyneux hosts) has the tagline """"The Largest and Most Popular Philosophical Conversation in the World""""* 
 Molyneux's books show that he is endeavoring to produce tangible written results in the field of philosophy, particularly Universally Preferable Behaviour (UPB): A Rational Proof of Secular Ethics and Against the Gods?

"I agree with Kamosuke on some points, however I still prefer Sir Edgar's version over Kamosuke's although not perfect.  I request Sir Edgar's version to be modified to mention Western influence before and under the sakoku policy.
Here are my thoughts in detail....  I agree with Kamosuke that China is similar to the Roman Empire, with respect to culture, politics, literature, arts, and religion, as well as its influence towards its surrounding nations.  More specifically, Luoyang (洛陽) and Chang'an (長安) are similar to Ancient Rome.  However, you cannot eliminate the mention of Korea.  From the dawn of historically recorded Japan, until the fall of Baekje, Korean influence was greater than Chinese influence.  Then there follows a period in Japan where Korean immigrant families remain important while Japan looks to China for influence; but eventually these families assimilate and dissolve into Japan.  A period of greater Chinese influence continues for at least 9 centuries.  However after Japan is discovered by Europe, Japan chooses a policy of sakoku for 200 years, where all foreign trade is conducted through Nagasaki.  Western influence is maintined through Rangaku studies and direct contact with Westerners at Nagasaki.  Meiji Restoration opens the door further to Western influence.
Let me stress that Sir Edgar's wording is more elegant and beautiful.  However, it needs a little more detail, particularly regarding Western influence before and under the sakoku policy.",0

If you look at template:cite book you can see the parameters for a template that defines a cited book.  I always use this template (or others like template:cite journal or template:cite web) because they automatically put the different bits of information into the right format.  template:sfn gives a way to easily make a reference and footnote that link to the cited source, thus:

Displays as:

The trick here is that the """"cite book"""" template includes """"|ref=harv"""" which tells the template to make a footnote from the author's last name and the year of the book, e.g. """"Smith 2009"""", and link it to the book definition.  That may not always be possible, because the author's name and/or publication year may be unknown, in which case you can tell the template what name to use for the footnote, as in  |ref={{harvid|Norwegian Blue}}

 Stop the partisan bickering!!!

NYT: 3/17/03  """"An Israeli Army bulldozer today crushed to death an American woman who had kneeled in the dirt to prevent the armored vehicle from destroying a Palestinian home in the southern Gaza Strip, witnesses and hospital officials said.""""

""""Other witnesses, however, reported that Corrie had scaled a pile of dirt but then lost her footing and fell backward behind it, out of sight of the bulldozer operator. The bulldozer continued moving forward, covering Corrie with dirt and then crushing her.""""

BBC: 6/27/03  """"... Rachel Corrie died in March during a protest against the demolition of a house in the southern Gaza Strip. She suffered multiple injuries when an Israeli Army bulldozer ran over her and later died in hospital.  However, the army said that military police investigating the incident found that Corrie was killed by earth and building rubble falling on her as she tried to climb on a pile of earth while the bulldozer was operating.""""

Seattle Times (AP): 3/17/03  """"The International Solidarity Movement said Rachel Corrie of Olympia, Wash., was in the line of vision of the bulldozer driver Sunday as she stood in his path to try to prevent the demolition of a Palestinian home in the Rafah refugee camp. ... The Israeli military said Sunday that Corrie's death was an accident. It said small windows in the bulldozer's cab restricted the driver's vision.""""
 
Haaretz.com:  """"A 23-year-old American woman, Rachel Corrie, a college student from Olympia, Washington who belonged to the International Solidarity Movement in the territories, was killed yesterday by an IDF bulldozer during a house demolition in Rafah.""""

Guardian (UK) - 4/14/03  """"An Israeli army investigation into the death of Rachel Corrie, an American peace activist, has concluded that its forces were not to blame for her death. ... Corrie, 23, was crushed to death by an army bulldozer in Rafah, Gaza, as she protested against house demolitions.""""

Jerusalem Post: 1/5/06  """"An IDF investigation into their daughter's death ruled that it was an accident, but members of the pro-Palestinian International Solidarity Movement for whom Rachel, 23, was volunteering at the time of her death claimed that the IDF bulldozer driver saw Corrie and drove over her as she and a small group of ISM activists tried to stop him from razing a home.""""

Observer (Guardian) (UK): 1/23/03  """"A peace activist with the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), Corrie knelt in the path of the Israeli machine to prevent it demolishing a house near the Egyptian border in the southern Gaza Strip.""""

These 8 sources are the most reliable mainstream sources current in the article.  They agree on these basic facts:

Corrie was killed by an IDF buzzdozer;
She was protesting house demolition by acting as a human shield;
The IDF investigation concluded the death was an accident;

It seems to me that various editors on one partisan side of this debate here are trying to whitewash this article by repeatedly inserting weasel words such as """"she believed was about to destroy ..."""" while editors on the other partisan side of the debate are trying to insert extra detail about (e.g.) home demolitions, that properly belongs in the article on that topic (i.e. the widespread nature of it, etc).

I do not understand all of the byzantine rules of Wikipedia yet, but I find this whole situation ridiculous  I agree that the article should limit itself to facts that directly bear on Corrie, and not the larger Israel-Palestine conflict or home demolition (or arms smuggling) issues, but also that the lead should state plainly that Corrie was killed while trying to obstruct home demolition, and that the IDF has stated that the death was an accident.  All the rest of the weaseling is just plain wrong, and borders on the pushing of subtle (and not so subtle) propaganda from both sides.

From what I read, partisans from the pro-Israeli side have been sent here to influence this article, and I have no doubt that there are partisans from the other side as well.  Can we just oust the partisans and say directly what the eight mainstream sources above say?  Tom Ketchum

"David Shankbone is traumatizing notable authors 

David Shankbone's attitude toward authors who don't like the photos he's taken of them is bossy and bullying.  He takes disastrous photos of authors.  Taking more unflattering photos could hardly be possible (See Edmund White, A.M. Homes, Francine Prose, Kathryn Harrison, Mary Gaitskill).  It's gotten to the point that authors he hasn't assaulted yet with his camera are afraid to go to readings for fear he'll be there, waiting for them.   I don't spend much time on Wikipedia, but when I come upon an author's page with a terrible photo, I now know it's been taken by David Shankbone.  I became curious about how these authors felt about the photos he'd taken of them, so I went and looked back in the history of a couple of them.  First I checked in the history of A.M. Homes, and sure enough, someone tried to take down the Shankbone photo (possibly even A.M. Homes herself or someone close to her), saying it was not a good photo, and he repeatedly put it back.  I also looked in the history of Sharyn November, and she herself had an exchange with him on one of their talk pages saying she preferred another photo of herself instead, but he would not let her have her way, and I don't remember the details, but his attitude was unpleasant and bossy.  She quickly backed down sweetly. 

A few days ago I came upon yet another disastrous author photo by David Shankbone and decided to Google his name, because I've been thinking that sooner or later an article will inevitably come out in the print media about authors' frustrations with this offensive photographer.  I wanted to see if any articles had been published yet about it.  I didn't dig very deeply but did find that on February 18th, 2008, lots of Wikipedia editors wrote about their frustrations with David Shankbone (in a section called: Does Wikipedia want David Shankbone or should we just tell him to leave?), to the point that he promised he'd leave Wikipedia (he shouldn't make promises he won't keep-he didn't even leave for one day, as far as I can see from his list of contributions).   All those posts from upset people have been deleted from Wikipedia, but I was able to find them by going into the history of the page: Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents.  

Authors are not the only celebrities Shankbone has upset.  I came upon discussions (on Wikipedia) about the actor Mike Farrell, who was upset by the photo Shankbone took of him, but Shankbone insisted his photo stay up on Farrell's page (it has now been replaced by a much better photo taken by someone else).  And I'm sure it's happened to countless other “notables”.  Many notable authors who are distressed by their photo will just remain quiet and try not to look at their Wikipedia pages, either because they don't know how to take down photos and post messages on Wikipedia, or because they fear that fighting David Shankbone will be futile and will  only increase their distress.  
Authors are often shy and insecure about their physical appearance.  Why make it worse?  And why be stubborn and nasty about it to the few authors who do muster up the courage to request that an unflattering photo be taken down? 

As with any contributor to Wikipedia, David Shankbone should have no right to assert that his photos take precedence over the photos of others, especially when more appropriate pictures are available and copyright free.  He claims that he has allowed better pictures to take the place of his, but this is clearly not true in many instances, given the way he fights to retain his pictures even in instances when any reasonable third party observer would agree that another picture is either better or more appropriate for the article.  

David Shankbone might be using Wikipedia to try and make a career for himself, and maybe that's okay, but he's hurting a lot of people along the way.  

I am an author, with a few published books, and there is a page on me on Wikipedia.  That's why I care about this issue.   I'm appalled at what David Shankbone is doing to authors.  

As I don't know the best place to post this message, I'm posting it in three places: David Shankbone's talk page, Jimbo Wales' talk page, and Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents.",0

 A quick question on Aaron López 

I'm guessing that the nationality standard being used here is the same as the one I'm using on the all-time MLS club rosters: nationality by national team (including youth national teams), and in cases where there is no national team participation, nationality by birthplace.  Aaron López was born in Mexico, raised in the US, played ODP, but never made an appearance for a US youth national team...and thus counts as Mexican, correct?

Here's the simple steps to get K delivered to your home:

1) Setup a hushmail.com email address
2) Contact globalpharmonline@hushmail.com and let him know what you want.  Here's the K they have along with prices. Make sure you tell him you want the brand Indus. The other brand they have sucks.

Ketamine500mg Inj 10ml Rotex Germany$25.00
Ketamine250mg Inj 5ml Indus $15.00
Ketamine 50mg Inj 2ml Indus $5.00

The 5000mg bottle = 10 (10ml) viles.  That breaks out to 5 grams powder. One 10ml vile breaks out into half a gram of powder.

It's real easy to get the liquid into powder if you don't know how to do it.  Just put it on a plate and boil water underneath it until it evaporates, then you'll be left with the powder.  You can also put the liquid on pyrex in the oven.  Be careful not to heat the liquid anymore than once it's gone otherwise you'll burn your shit.

"Apologies

I never got back to you properly about Wynton and Haydn and now I fear I never will: sorry. Briefly, I just felt that it was a bad example because (in my view) it both overestimated the impact of Wynton's recording, and underestimated how popular and well-known the concerto already was before Wynton was even heard of. It seems to give a status to that one recording which is not due (I speak as a trumpet player who very much admires Wynton as a player, but is very suspicious of the hype which sometimes attends him) and which seems to ignore the many fine recordings of this piece which have been made before and after that one. It's not a situation like Gorecki 3 or the loathsome The Piano. It just, from where I am sitting, entirely lacks the feeling of a crossover. It's just one good recording, among many, of a very popular piece. LOTS of non-classical-specialists could whistle the 3rd movt tune while Wynton was still at school! ) I'm sorry to do this to you as you now won't have a chance to argue with me, but it's the best I can manage right now.

Much to my chagrin and dismay, I'm only Norwegian by heritage (& half-Norwegian at that). My paternal family left Norway in 1868.

Indian martial arts
The dispute is that I've mentioned the official citations from Tsumi Hozan jujutsu, the Shaolin Temple, Gracie family and Goju Ryu Karate and what I keep getting is that Japan and China never interacted with any ancient civilization at all and the official citations don't mean anything, the facts when backed by the official citations will get an NPOV and Factual Inaccuracy tag and as if that was not enough I've been called anti- white people, pro tamil (I really have no idea when I came to be identified as a Tamil, I'm not anything even remotely close), Alex Doss (one of the guys believes that I actually am that guy) and biased, my credibilty now becoming a questionable thing, my sources are undisputed. 

I've cried myself hoarse for anyone to come dispute the official sources on the talk pages and no one comes forward to , they go mad because I mentioned a fighter from a game in the Indian martial arts in pop culture section and when they fraudeulently changed his fighting style from what CAPCOM officialy states, I objected.

I started the article, I've been sincerely working my ass off, the first few times I even edited the article so any legitimate grievances will be met.
Plus, I've constantly maintained that In addition to what I've officially cited here, I'll bring forward an assortment of websites confirming my facts and a huge list of academies and official citations from martial arts disciplines in near future but none of that stops the opposition from mindlessly putting the tags in there.

In other words, the information is undisputed, the official sources been mentioned and they confirm my stand, the opposition though, has adopted a technique of three-on-one encircling, deviation from the central topic of official citations (on which I have yet to hear why do they think that official citations are NPOV and Factually IC material) and mindless lies (like changing the fighting style of video game charecter Dhalsim) and have gone to the extent of telling me to """"be a nice chap"""" and more things to that effect. 

I've cited the official sources and that's it, if someone has a problem with the official versions they'll have to live with the fact that the problem  exists in their head and not in the article, the shaolin knows more about it's history than any of the three involved, it's a fact.

I mentioned an assortment of websites pertaining to the popular point of view and it was rejected as random, what the official citations ???

""": I would just add that unless a stub is clearly vanity or garbage, adding a VfD within minutes after the entry is posted is not a very good practice for several reasons.  While schools are inherently controversial here at Wikipedia, I would urge you to apply the same wait-and-see approach across the board. The whole purpose of a stub is to act as an invitation to create an article.  Frequently, it is difficult to tell whether the subject is encyclopedic.  I have seen many good articles start as stubs.  For example, a stub may start as """"John Q. Unknown was an American politician"""" and it may turn out that he was a Territorial governor, U.S. Senator and later president of a well known college.  Unless the subject of a stub is very well known, it is a rare stub that gives enough detail to know immediately whether the subject has the potential to become encylcopedic.
 You may have already seen these, but I would refer you to Wikipedia:Stub and Wikipedia:Deletion policy. The deletion policy states that among the problems which do not require deletion are a stub with potential (which should be expanded) or a minor branch of a subject that doesn't deserve its own article (which should be merged, with a redirect to the new location).

"Dear Readers, I have been forced to make some editorial changes due to the attack on my reputation. It is my personal opinion that the previous article is a smear job and attempts to slander my good name. A few points. Moving from Toronto to B.C was for one sole reason and that was to find work. There is no record of a criminal charge on my record of the so called soliciting a prostitute charge, thus it is not right to say so. I ask anyone to prove my criminal record includes such a charge. Furtermore while it is wholly true I have emailed the CPC and former YCl members, but not for some time and it is not a regular hobby. As a former communist I am concerned about any attempt to re-build that movement. Furthermore I am not a member of the pro-life board anymore and have not worked for Campaign Life since 2001. I still hold my persoanl views on the matter of abortion, and that is my right.
It has been stated in the press that the homosexual man beaten in that park was in fact participating in questionable behaviour in that park that media admits is frequented by gays. I in no way agree with the assualt what so ever and have never said such! Finally this question about pictures. The Manning picture was taken during a federal election and that is all. I do not force my self on political leaders and the picture was voluntary on Mannings part. Please prove otherwise.

 Islamic Terrorism / Islamic Militancy 

Since Hkelkar won't stop reverting my edits, why does this page insist on going by the loaded terms of the past and writing """"Islamic terrorism"""" and """"Islamic militancy""""? Any educated person should know that Islam is a religion, and the militants fighting in these two countries are both fighting for nationalist causes. Think of Kashmir in 1900: There were Hindus and Muslims living with one another. There were no wars being fought. Then, after the partion, which created nations, there suddenly was a militancy problem. Same exact scenario in Israel. Thus, these insurgencies or resistances or whatever you want to call them can not be claimed to be Islamic, when these two regions clearly had Islamic culture and Muslims from hundreds of years prior without terrorists.""",0

 strange situation at the Barak Obama talk page 

Recently I added a single reliably-sourced word, """"African,"""" to the list of Barak Obama's mother's ethnic origins near the beginning of the Barak Obama article.  My basic point is that if the article mentions Obama's mother's single Scottish ancestor (who was born 400 years ago), as well as Obama's Irish and Swiss ancestry, then there shouldn't be a problem with an equally-brief mention of her African ancestry. My one-word addition to the article was first modified and then deleted, so I opened a talk page here.  The discussion has taken a disturbing turn, and seems to have hit a nerve of racial discomfort among some wikipedia editors.  In particular, the suggestion to delete the entire list of ethnic origins as a way to avoid adding the word """"African"""" strikes me as a potential public relations black eye for wikipedia, which is why I am making this post here.

More interesting things.  According to pollster.com, the Senate Breakdown (remember, only about 1/3 of seats are up for election every year) should be:

Democrats: 54
Republicans: 41
Independents (both of whom sit with the Democratic caucus): 2
Undecided: 3 (but all are in traditionally strong Democratic states, so they'll probably fall into the Democratic column).

Interestingly, both Obama and Biden will need to be replaced in the Senate.  Usually, the Governor of the state in which those seats are held choose the replacement until the next election (again usually).  Obama is from Illinois, the governor is a Democrat, so will be replaced by a Democrat.  Biden is from Delaware, one of the most solidly Democratic states, and the Democratic candidate for governor is leading by a huge margin, so expect a Democratic replacement there.

According to pollster.com, the House of Representatives should fall as follows:

Democrats:  240
Republicans: 179
Undecided:  16

 Objectivity

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Hi, John
Regarding your recent message about """"Naked"""", my edit is based on the character's arguable status as an anti-hero. It becomes apparent to me that Leigh's intention was to portray someone who, while probably hailing from a higher academic milieu or background (whether conventional or self-taught) uses his eloquence and education in an deliberately overbearing manner. You cannot deny the fact that the film clearly passes judgment on the character on this and other levels. I just wanted to summarize this in a few words.

What I appreciate about this discussion, is that it is being conducted by people who demonstrate a great deal of concern for the issues involved - both the subtleties and the sweep of the issue. I believe this is appropriate (though admittedly tiring) because, in legal matters, a great deal often hinges on a comma, or the inclusion/exclusion of the word """"not,"""" or other such maddening technicalities. Ergo Shakespeare's famous dictum about lawyers.

Consejo de Salud Playa de Ponce v. Rullan does provide federal precedent, and a framework for discussion and debate. However the Rullan ruling is not ultimately dispositive of a U.S. constitutional question or territorial status issue, since the U.S. Supreme Court is the court of ultimate (and binding) jurisdiction in both of these areas.

The language of the Rullan ruling did not grant full constitutional privileges to Puerto Ricans living on the island itself (as opposed to those living on the mainland). The Rullan court stated that """"Congress today, thus, must afford Puerto Rico and the 4,000,000 United States citizens residing therein all constitutional guarantees.""""

However, as stated earlier, Puerto Rico is subject to the U.S. Congress' plenary powers under the territorial clause of Article IV, sec. 3, of the U.S. Constitution.U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2 (""""The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States ...""""). 

The Rullan ruling occurred in 2008. Three years later (in 2011), insular Puerto Ricans have neither U.S. Congresspersons nor U.S. Senators, and they cannot vote for a U.S. president. Therefore insular Puerto Ricans are not fully-enfranchised U.S. citizens, and they have not been extended """"enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U.S. Constitution.""""

It is thus clear that (in the exercise of its plenary powers) the U.S. Congress has chosen to ignore the Rullan ruling.
 
The operative word in this discussion (and I understand the frustration on both sides) is the usage of the word """"must"""" in the Rullan ruling. As forceful as that word sounds, it was mis-used by the Rullan court, because the U.S. Congress clearly ignored it.  

Again...a lower federal court is not the court of ultimate jurisdiction for the issues addressed by Rullan. The U.S. Congress ignored it. Puerto Ricans (on the island) are not fully-enfranchised, and therefore do not have """"enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U.S. Constitution.""""

As the FLDS leadership continued to prophesy that the end of the world was quickly approaching, they taught the people that wickedness needed to be purged from their society. Jeffs taught, 'One or two covenant breakers can cause the Lord to stop blessing this people. As long as we have evil doers among us, the Lord's blessings will be withheld. Zion must be pure. We can't have evil people among the priesthood for the Lord to appear and bless us like He would like to. Be this a warning.' (W.S.J. 12/26/95) Jeffs laid the doctrinal groundwork to justify a cleansing of the FLDS. Their theology teaches that an ancient city lead by a prophet named Enoch, was taken up into heaven because of their righteousness. The FLDS believe they can be taken up too as the wicked world is destroyed.""""[... ... """"Yearning for Zion,"""" a hymn by W.S.

"==Wikistalkers by erstwhile administrators deserve severe sanction.

Dear BK:

Thank you.

However, this has soured me, and I will cure myself of my wikiaholic behavior. I quit. They've achieved their victory, and Wiki will lose my modest contributions.

That being said, I think you should look close at what they edited, and come to your own conclusion. They gutted whole articles.  This was WIKISTALKING and they went FAR beyond what they complained about. This was search and destroy, pure, simple and unvarnished. It was a clear abuse of power. I will not abide an abuse of power, and will not let this rest without their being brought to justice  they are bullies, and this was wrong.

I for one would not stand silently and idly by while the Wehrmacht makes the Jews disappear into the railroad cars.

Moreover, their actions showed an intent (and attempt) to bully me into silence about their misconduct. It was a cover up.

Accountability in this system is important. Those who abuse their powers do not deserve to be trusted to hold the reins. They deserve the severest sanctions, and should be stripped of administrative privileges.

What they did here was very destructive of the goals of an organization that depends on the good will and volunteer efforts of contributors.

Speedy deletion of Feague
 A tag has been placed on Feague requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 Bot automation at Wikipedia:Today's articles for improvement 

Over the past two weeks, there has been extensive discussion on introducing bot automation to assist with maintenance of the Today's Articles for Improvement project. A  has now been approved for trial and will carry out the weekly duties. The bots first run will occur around ' (midnight on Sunday).If you have been assisting any of the weekly maintenance tasks, please refrain from doing so this week. The bot needs to be tested and proven it can do the job, and it only gets one chance per week. The tasks will include:
 Adding the new scheduled article to Wikipedia talk:Today's articles for improvement and removing the entry from Wikipedia:Articles for improvement
 Set up the schedule pages for the new TAFI, except the adding of an image and caption
 Adding  to the new article for improvement, remove  from last week's article and add  to the talk page
 Notify relevant WikiProjects that the new TAFI is within their scope
 Send a mass message to everyone on the notification list of the new TAFI selection

Updating the accomplishments and archiving selections is still done manually, along with daily' tasks such as adding approved entries to the articles for improvement page. These will become automated in the near future.

We hope the bot proves to serve well, and by carrying out the routine housekeeping tasks we can boost the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the project.  thanks you for your service in helping with the weekly tasks in the past, and for your cooperation during this trial period )

"I just mentioned the social conflict, because the contemporary crisis of Judaism was less a conflict between Orthodox and Reform movement, but a social gap between a ruling minority, consisting of families which had bound together religious authorities, academics and wealthy merchants through marriages, and a ruled majority in the Jewish communities and town ghettos whose poverty had dramatically increased. This is not only the social context of the conflicts between Maskilim and Orthodox Rabbis or Maskilim and Reform Rabbis, but also between Orthodox authorities and mystic movements like Hasidism. Hasidim in Galicia and Bukovina usually understood much better the problems of the poor population than any Maskilim among the West Yiddish Ashkenazim in Alsace or Western regions of Prussia. And Polish nationalists and among them, Polish Jews who lived in the larger Shtetl and visited the universities in Wilna, Warsaw, Cracow and Lemberg, formed a governing elite in the Sejm of Lemberg – the parlament of the crownland Galicia. The rural communities of Galicia was another “uncivilized” world for modern Jews in Vienna, Paris, Budapest, Prague and Berlin. Nachman Krochmal from Galicia as a student of Hegel must have appeared like a mooncalf. Their hopes focussed on a revolution in 1848 and it failed again.

 Moses Mendelssohn certainly belonged to the privileged minority of the Schutzjuden and his circle was the upper class of Prussia, but this does not mean that they were not disappointed about the backwards conditions in Prussia, whatever faith they had. Wealthy members like the brothers Humboldt or Polish aristocrats were very engaged to improve the social conditions. They founded universities, hospitals, they improved the working conditions of coal miners etc. If I compare them with wealthy people today in Germany, I can assure that they were much less ignorant. Otherwise they were also very intolerant people (especially around Fichte in Jena) like the demagogues who cause the hep hep progroms, so Hegel and his pupils had to go the ghetto to protect their inhabitants...

 But like David Friedländer Moses Mendelssohn’s social sphere had an impact on his concept of modern Judaism. As a pedagogue he wanted to teach Jewish children German, Hebrew and Greek, but he refused Yiddish as a corrupt dialect, which finally meant to refuse the prospering culture (literature and drama) of East Yiddish and the Ashkenazim world from Wilna to Bucarest. From the point of view of Alsatian Ashkenazim, Mendelssohn was admired as a radical philosopher of Haskalah, but the reason behind his radical attitude was the extreme pressure of assimilation, that the Jewish population had to suffer in Prussia. For this reason I was a little bit surprised about your categorization of Moses Mendelssohn as an Orthodox Jew. Conversion finally remained the main access into the ruling elite of Prussia which can be easily analyzed by the cynical statements of Heinrich Heine (especially his commentaries of the Pietist circles around the children and grandchildren: “He [Felix] is the grandson of the great philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, but he has nothing better to do than to set the lamb’s piss into music!”).

 I just collect here all these names and places, in order to demonstrate how open the category of Reform Judaism should be. And I still see no reason how to exclude Moses Mendelssohn.",0

 Your edit on National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma 

I hate to bring this up, but I don't care if the content you removed from National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma was relevant or not; the edit summary you left was, in my opinion, inaccurate, and, more importantly, was really insulting to me. You shouldn't just remove everything that makes the office unique; how's it different from every other office then? Undoubtedly, some of that information was in fact irrelevant or excessive, but instead of actually doing anything to help the article, you have done nothing more than strip it down. I know that you have made some great contributions to the wiki, but that edit summary was kind of like a slap to the face. If the content you removed was entirely non-unique and useless, then your edit summary might have been a bit more justified, but that was most certainly not the case. I'm not going to call you lazy or insult you (I don't think you're lazy, that's not what I am implying), but I am going to say that you could have done better. I've dealt with enough of this sort of gesture. Through all of this, I am trying to remain as civil as possible, but if you are going to say that you don't like the article as is, make more of it than simply stripping it down. There are other areas of the office's history which I would far rather expand upon, but I would likely be heavily restricted in terms of finding non-primary sources. I hate WP:PRIMARY enough; that's one of the reasons I been dealing with many problems from some editors. That's part of what forced me to userfy the page, which in turn is part of the reason for which next to no editors aside from myself have edited the article. No one wants to edits a user space draft apart from the relevant user. That's why I have received little input on the article. In any case, please just be kinder in the future; I intend no offense here, and I will admit that there were and are problems with the article, but please do not just go around removing cited content without also helping to build as well. Please don't take any offense or think me """"foolish"""" or something (I don't know what you will think when you read this) like some editors would.

"Irving quote 

Re: Authoritive statements of Irving in [Battle of Britain] article.

You have re-wrote the section as following:

Historian David Irving states that part of this reason was due to the totally inadequate production levels, with 250 single-engined and 64 twin-engined fighter aircraft produced on avarage per month during early 1941Irving 1974, p. 163., and that as a result, the number of German front line aircraft were declining, and this problem would not be improved until the spring of 1942, with a huge effort to expand production, reaching 1,200 by March/April 1942.Irving 1974, p. 142.

In fact, however, Irving does not make these statements. If you read the book  (which has been linked in free pdf format), here is what he writes on page 163:
On Milch’s desk there were already the most alarming reports not only of the gathering RAF bomber strength but of bomber production in America too. To him, air defence rested primarily on the fighter squadrons, but at present the Air Staff was calling for only  fighter aircraft to be produced a month. Fighter production had averaged  single- and  twin-engined aircraft a month during . Milch and his new planning chief von Gablenz wanted far greater numbers, and with more bombers as well  not only the  He s but  Ju s of the latest type as well.⁴⁰

”In the English Wikipedia there it is a group made of slav administrators and users who promote their nationalistic POVs (read: htp://brunodam.blog.kataweb.it/2008/08/13/hackers-slavi/ about slav hackers ).

One of those admins in the en.wiki is user:Joy (who has organized the disappearance of articles like Province of Zara, for example), who seems to be connected to user:Kubura of the hr.wiki and user:Vituzzu of the Italian Wikipedia.

What's with the line about the Black And White Ball of Truman Capote's?  Is it really a pertinent biographical detail to say that Ms. Lee was extended an invitation?  Not being a scholar on the subject, I may be missing something, but if it's really important, could it be fleshed out a bit to make it clear that it's more than useless trivia?
 

Why a recluse?
I came to this article to discover why exactly Harper Lee became a recluse. It does not really say for sure. I would be interested in knowing that if anyone happens to know.

She didn't exactly become a recluse. She just doesn't give interviews or write novels. She does have friends and family and she travels frequently.

Oxford

Does anyone know what college Ms. Lee went to at Oxford and what she studied while there?

I believe she was studying law when she went to Oxford for a one-year exchange program from the University of Alabama. I can't find a reference to which college she joined. If this was before the colleges became coeducational, that might narrow the candidates down to a few. I think Lady Margaret, St. Hugh's, St. Hilda's and Somerville were women's colleges.

 Wikipedia limits itself to information that is verifiable. Since there is no verifiable information about Lee's literary ambitions (and not much about her private life at all), the subject is not detailed here.

Claims of descent from Robert E. Lee

Our article claimed that Harper Lee was a descendant of the Confederate General. A reader sent an e-mail to the Robert E. Lee Memorial Association to confirm this. They advised: I regret that Harper Lee is not a descendant of General Robert E. Lee.  There is a chart of Gen. Lee's descendants on the Stratford web site www.stratfordhall.org.  Click on """"history"""" in the left navigation bar, then click on Robert E. Lee, scroll to the bottom of his page and see the link to his family tree.  General Robert E. Lee has very few descendants, considering that he had seven children.  None of his daughters married and only two of his sons had children.  I hope that this information is helpful.

The claim has been removed from our article.

"Hi,

Taekkyeon is a sensitive topic because many people want to learn it and not enough qualified teachers to disperse the knowledge. If you truly desire to learn Taekkyeon there are only two masters in the world who know the complete system. One is in S. Korea, he doesn't teach many people. The other lives in Los Angeles, CA. The truth is, you have to either move to Los Angeles or S. Korea if you want to learn the Taekkyeon as taught by GM Song and Im Ho. 
I will tell you this. GM Song was a bodyguard of the remaining Choson Dynasty family memebers. The top Taekkyeon masters always defended the king, They were in the military. Taekkyeon was a military artform first and a civil cultural game for children and adults later. By calling Taekkyeon a civil martial art game is demoting it from its real status. However, Taekkyeon is still a Holistic Martial art with many healing aspects and a civil game for children and adults. Its all three!

The island had been under Persian control until the early 20th century. After 1908, the UK controlled the island along with the other British-held islands in the Persian Gulf, including what is today the UAE. In the late 1960s, Britain transferred administration of the island to the British-appointed Sharjah, one of the seven sheikdoms that would later form the UAE.

"Johnuniq and Quietmark, 

This is my last response. I do not have a problem with how you handled the discussion page and I appreciate the polite responses. I brought up my PhD in statistics because a contributor thought it would be appropriate to just delete my discussion, so I wanted to know why they felt that was within their purview. Do they hold some higher degree or happen to be an expert in evolutionary theory to whom I should defer? I am not a creationist trying to tear apart evolution, but a scientist trying to scientifically discuss the article. As such, my comments should not be quickly dismissed, but should be answered. 

I made the suggestion that there are many verified methods of falsifiability, which have been in either peer-reviewed journal articles or stated by Darwin himself (I believe this post was deleted, but I can provide them and their references to help out this section, btw I can find at least four or five, which is more than are currently listed, but are actually correct). This article listed none of these methods of falsifiability in the section labeled falsifiability.  

I don’t want creationism taught in school. One of the methods of falsifiability this article mentions requires a deity. This opens up Pandora’s box.  How easily could a creationist say “What’s good for the goose is good for the gander?” If a deity can be used for falsifiability (the cornerstone of a scientific theory), then obviously it is allowed into science.  If it is allowed into science, then keeping creationism and ID out is not justifiable. Do not give creationists such an easy target.  

Other methods mentioned in the article, I easily disputed using only the definition of falsifiability found at wiki, among other places.  While you (in general) have dismissed my claims as being SYN, you could not break the logic used nor provide an argument as to why I might be wrong. This is like shooting fish in a barrel and you are giving creationists the ammo to do so.  How much ammo do you want to give them?  

Royboy, first the definition of chimera they are using has change from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics) so the definition has already changed, because these exist.  Beyond that, evolution does not inherently predict that there are no chimeras as long as the lineage can be traced back and it was advantageous to have say a lion’s head and a horse’s body.  And as for the genetic variation being easily verified, how would this be done?  Our knowledge of genetic coding is very limited, and is certainly not to the point of finding the small changes that would appear relatively quickly in a population as you are suggesting. The number of microarrays involved would be cost prohibitive and lead large error rates that would only find very large genetic anomalies.  Beyond that, reason would dictate that mankind as been relatively the same for a million years, thus these are very slow processes.  In fact, I think you could be the first evolutionist I have ever heard, that is suggesting that these are quick processes. 

I am playing devil’s advocate, because I have found that it is the best way to truly test the validity of what is being stated and this is the scientific way. Look again at my previous posts (at least the posts that have not been deleted), not only do I say what section needs to be changed and why, but I have “quoted reliable sources that throw doubt on some aspects of the article”.  I have no peer-reviewed journal article stating that these methods of falsifiability are wrong because nobody has a peer-reviewed journal article stating that they are correct, so why would anybody argue against a point that hasn’t been made? I may be able to find some creationist webpage, but I don’t want that in the article either.  You may be right that I am committing SYN, but these are relatively simple arguments that can easily be made by others.  I’m not trying to denigrate evolution, so there would be no point to making an article called “Are objections to evolution valid”.  I just want science to prevail.  Make arguments strong and scientifically justifiable or they will be used as weapons to attack evolution. 

I believe that the section on falsifiability needs to be overhauled and carefully reconsidered, this is the wiki wringer you are mentioning Quietmark, my posts are part of that. I’m not asking it to be overhauled right now, but I think it does need to happen. This, however, I leave to your (collective) judgment.  If you would like me to review or help out, I am willing to do so, but only by email or talk.  I will not be editing this site or discussion page again.  It is my opinion that fair scientific discussion is not prevailing here, as nearly all of my material have been deleted or archived.

 Bowie The Secret Life of Arabia 

Hello Ian,

You were quite right to correct my edit. Buckley's comment shouldn't be excised on its own; all of them should go - it doesn't matter who any of these writers are, their aesthetic judgement comments are all just POV opinions (of no greater weight than yours, mine or anyone elses, though Buckley's is particularly ridiculous, let alone in a Wikipedia context) and therefore not encyclopedic in nature and therefore not Wikipedia compliant. 

Even worse is the completely uncited statement above """"Like Bowie's 1971 song """"Life on Mars?"""", it evoked a world where film and reality become merged and confused"""". Says who?? And indeed who cares, Wikipedia is not the place for editors' subjective comments. That is potentially endless.

Wikipedia makes it abundantly clear that it is not a opinion forum, or a vehicle for people's differing aesthetic opinions; it is an encyclopedia.

The only quotes that would be acceptable (and of any interest) in this regard would be one's directly attributable to Bowie, Visconti, Eno etc i.e. the creators themselves. It would be extremely productive to seek any out. What the article needs is facts - for example, details of where recorded and on what dates, who the personel were etc etc, all properly cited.

Either way, all of these comments must go and be replaced by encylopedic content. This is simply just what Wikipedia insists on, rightly as an encyclopedia.

So I'm looking at 1) leave it where it is now, 2) split it into 2 identical articles, 3) some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily, 4) a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination. Choice 4 just doesn't look that appealing.   """,0
"Thank you.  I did not say it was a single book, but what you linked to says it is a 'corpus,' and it is often published at once, though apparently there is debate whether it was all written by Zoroaster.  At least for what Zoroaster wrote, I think philosophy does play a part, mostly involving semantics (difficult; knowing esoteric philosophy helps to interpret spiritually/divinely inspired texts) as you described, but perhaps also with gematria, or as HPB wrote, perhaps with 5 other methods than these latter 2.  Since many esoteric mystics have consensus on philosophy, not the least of which is ethics, methods of interpretation are important.  For example, such mystics would say animal sacrifice in the Avesta should not be done but is symbolic of something, as it is thought to be in the Vedas, etc..",0

 my removal of your content on DNA melting

Mutations do not have """"weird structures""""  a point mutation might start with a single nucleotide mismatch, but those are rapidly detected and repaired to form a stable bonded double-helix structure, and subsequent rounds of DNA replication match each base with its complement. Perhaps your wording was wrong, perhaps you were thinking of an obscure related technology that I have heard of, but you didn't give a reference and I'm not going to help you with this, because you're being rude.

Otherwise why would the name have any connection to him/them? Do you think that there were """"who's who"""" publications or """"VIP"""" directories, published in those days?

"Reverting other editors 

Hi there!
You appear to be engaged in an edit war with one or more editors according to your reverts at Alien (creature in Alien franchise). Although repeatedly reverting or undoing another editor's contributions may seem necessary to protect your preferred version of a page, on Wikipedia this is usually seen as obstructing the normal editing process, and often creates animosity between editors. Instead of edit warring, please discuss the situation with the editor(s) involved and try to reach a consensus on the talk page.

If editors continue to revert to their preferred version they are likely to be blocked from editing. This isn't done to punish an editor, but to prevent the disruption caused by edit warring. In particular, editors should be aware of the three-revert rule, which says that an editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page within a 24-hour period. While edit warring on Wikipedia is not acceptable in any amount, breaking the three-revert rule is very likely to lead to a block.

Please be informed that a  Dispute resolution has been filed on this page, and further edits should be kept to the talk page until it is resolved.

Thanks! And have a wonderful time on wikipedia.",0

""""Boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation, shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation.  Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. """"He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception,"""" Henry Adams wrote in a much-quoted analysis in 1870. """"He believed in common schools, and not in political science; in ledgers and cash-books, but not in Adam Smith or Mill; as one might believe in the multiplication-table, but not in Laplace or Newton. By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice, and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.""""Henry Adams, """"The Session,"""" North American Review, July, 1870, p. 36.  But in a very corrupt time, it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post, either for himself or his friends. Living within his salary, he lodged in a boarding-house throughout his tenure. His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker   though never for money. Chicago Times, March 6, 1875.

""""Boutwell's financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic.""""Liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments; but while Boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part, , he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of Washington, remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses.''""""

It does work well for insomnia, and tends to produce vivid dreams, which is interesting, but its usage should be carefully monitored.

Do homosexuals like you get turned on at the thought that these great ancient people's may have accepted homosexuality? Why do you have to distort history to fit your image?

second i'm sure there was gay shit back in the day, like in every culture...but i don't believe everyone was doing it....just because you find two pots out of a 1000 that show some gay act...doesn't mean everyone back then was gay

third...there is a difference between brotherly love and being gay or a pedophile...i say i love my friends and in greece i even kiss them on the cheek when i see them..that doesn't mean i want their ass...look at shaq and wade slapping each other's ass in basketball are you telling me they are gay?

fourth...just because some plays back in the day reffered to certain people being gay...doesn't mean they were...alot of plays (especially comedies) were made to be critical or make fun of people by dehumanizing them or making them look stupid...like calling them gay...just look at comedies now making fun of people...someone might say the president today is gay in a comedy skit, but we all know he is straight

fifth...i hate gay propaganda...i know they are people blah blah blah...but to try to impose on a great culture some of their values to justify their way of life is pathetic...just because there are no great gay people in history doesn't mean you have to ripout pieces of history to make your people look good....from alexander to hitler to lincoln...you guys try to change history or make things up to fit your own cause

i leave with quotes from two authors who wrote gay stuff on alexander

Some modern historians point out that the ancient sources cannot be considered definitive. Robin Lane Fox writes: """"Later gossip presumed that Bagoas was Alexanders lover. This is uncertain."""" [16] And, according to Mary Renault, who wrote a novel about the relationship of Alexander and Bagoas, """"No historian states plainly whether they were physical lovers."""" [17]

""". If you want to talk about linguistic issues in the Spanish State, or about terrorist bands linked to nationalism, do so at their right articles. The way you try to shove those topics in an article about """"Nationalities in Spain"""""""" looks like you´re trying to inject your personal, unfavourable to those independentist movements POV in this article. Please stop doing that.  

My dear 81.202.96.146, please stop asking me to stop from doing this or that, for it is not your duty to tell me so. Give your opinion and defend it as you may, as I am doing, and put the full stop after it. Now, it seems that we cannot insert anything here that raises the slightest doubt against the legitimacy of """"those independentist movements"""". Sorry, I won't bother creating an article entitled """"Terrorist groups linked to X nationalism""""; but I do believe that if there's an article that deals with """"X nationalism"""" or """"Nationalities in Y"""", which includes """"X nationalism"""", it is only right to talk about those terrorist groups. To your accusation:

 I already assumed above that I was biased, as anyone else (my quote: """"Of course, this I'm saying is only part of the story; but it corresponds with the same reality and nothing about it is being said in this biased article."""").
 I haven't edited the article yet, because I think the subject is worthy of a discussion, no matter how ridiculous the article itself seems to me.
 Due to 1's """" as anyone else"""", your accusation can bounce back at you with a very slight variation: you are trying to prevent obnoxious information about nationalism from entering the article, thus unveiling your point of view... So, what's wrong about it?
 The problem with your POV is that you already stated something false about the article to defend your position and I refuted it. Your only answer now is to say that my views should belong to another article.

I don't know what your reasons are for defending the accuracy of this article; clearly not the article itself. My own are simply that, if we are to talk about such a delicate subject as """"nationalities in Spain"""" we'd better document ourselves and tell everything that ought to be told.

 

 Why can´t I ask you to stop doing something I find incorrect? You are in fact, doing the same, by asking me not to do it. See the irony? I wasn´t issuing orders, just asking kindly for you to stop doing that. If you don´t want to, it´s ok.
By order:
1- Everyone is biased, that´s ok. But Wikipedia is not a soapbox. If you want to voice your personal concerns about """"spanish speakers opressed in Catalonia"""", that´s fine with me, but please don´t do it in an eclyclopedical article right? When we contribute to a wikipedia article, it´s not enough to go """"OK I´m biased because I think this and that, so let the battle begin"""". No, we try to put aside our differences and be as neutral as possible. I´m not trying to point out my ideas in an article, as if I were hoping to clash with you and eventually """"reach a middle ground"""" in the article´s content. No. I´m trying to be objective in this article, and you´re not, because you´re admiting to be biased AND allowing your bias to affect your output in this article.
2- That´s very respectful of you, and I think it´s the right thing to do.
3- No it doesn´t. I am not trying to push an agenda here. I am just pointing the OBVIOUS LOGICAL fact that articles should talk about the topic they´re about. If I, for example tried to hide the racialist doctrines Sabino Arana had, in an article about Sabino Arana, you could rightfully accuse me of """"preventing obnoxious information"""" from getting into the article. But asking for an article named Nationalities in Spain to talk about those nationalities and not about terrorist gangs that claim to defend some of the ideologies that support independentist claims based on the actual nationalities we´re talking about in this article, is just asking for something entirely reasonable. See the far away link between your proposed """"terrorist issue"""" stuff and the actual content of the article? As I said, create an article about Terrorist gangs linked to nationalist claims in Spain, and everything will be fine. By your same reasoning, anyone could end up talking about the IRA in an article about Catholicism.
4- What did I state that was false? I made only one comment before this one, just to ask you to stop trying to shove terrorist stuff in an article that is not about terrorism. Seems perfectly reasonable to me. Bye

 Shark urine? Really? 

I can buy that shark biltong is an acquired taste.

Nor is there any reason to assume that the urine flavor (presuming there is one at all) should be concentrated at the skin; given that the process of shark urination is an osmotic exchange, the urine should be evenly distributed throughout the system, and, if anything, *less* concentrated at the skin.

Requests for comment
I've echoed the suggestions of Mackensen and others that you take this to Wikipedia:Requests for comment.  Your most recent reply on Mackensen's talk page is:

 I could, but I think Arbcom should accept the case with or without an RfC. There's too much misconduct to willfully ignore. Besides, you're only asking me to do that to delay the inevitable, why would I ever take that advice?

There are several problems with this response:
 Firstly a number of other editors have asked you to go through RfC: , the  closer or the first Articles for deletion discussion, , who as far as I can tell played no part in earlier discussions,  who also seems to have been absent from earlier discussions, and , an arbitrator who in rejecting the case said """"If you can't be bothered with an RfC then we can't be bothered with an arbitration case.""""  has also remarked on your failure to follow process here.
 Again you allege misconduct, on a scale too great """"to wilfully ignore"""".  If there appears to be such a level of misconduct and yet the arbitrators can't see it, it looks like you'll have to make it more apparent to them.

But finally, despite all the others including arbitrators who have asked you to go to RfC, you say that I in particular am only asking you to go to RfC """"to delay the inevitable"""".  Well I'm not sure that you and I can agree on what """"the inevitable"""" is in this case.  To my eyes this looks a case on which you really wouldn't like to hear what the arbitrators have to say, and they've hinted on this in their comments on the case.  But since they're obviously not going to accept the case until you've at least made an honest attempt to conduct some intermediate steps in dispute resolution, I'm urging you to do so.

So what refernce and evidence did you use to block my edit access and state my comments were unwarranted harrassment?  I do not want to appear argumentative and certainly want to comply with the rules of Wiki.  You also refered to my act as vandalism which I think is harsh and unwarratnted.  If you check with Mr. Kuru I think he will tell you were were having a legitamit discussion and my edits, subsequent with his deletion were inetnded to comply with his request to remove promotional material.  I simply subsequently loaded a link to the approved patent on the USPTO patent site.  It provides substantial reference, teh approved business method patent, prior art, abstracta nd claims.  I think your actions were premature and showed you lacked informationa bout what was being discussed between Kuru and I.  I would still like to refernce the patent and since it had previously been done and sanctioned acceptable because it was on teh site undisturbed for 2 months I think this has merit.  I do see the fact that my name, as teh inventor tends to promote thepatent.  However, if you check I am not the owner.  It is owned by Ultimate Claim Solution, Inc.  My refernce also tried to explain that aspect.  Non the less this all could have been avoided.  When someones content is deleted the person making thatd elrtion should point out in there csignature they are an administrtor or moderator.  Had Kuro done that I would have talked to him first instead of trying to update the edit to what I thought ws not promotional and then trying to engage in talk with Mr. Kuru.  

Lastly, I respectfully request you release the block.  I aslo request that I be given permission to return the article to the annonomus post which refernced the patent.

"Wikipedia is, in fact, the closest thing to a people's encyclopedia that currently exists, in terms of its popularity. More people read Wikipedia than any other encyclopedia. That doesn't mean Wikipedia relies on a democratic definition of truth. If we did, we would have to state, as a fact, that God exists, because a majority of the world's English-speaking people believe that claim to be true. Fortunately for God, he's still got some gaps to hide in, so for the time being the existence of God is not a scientific question. But anthropogenic global warming certainly is, and this is probably one of the aspects of scientific consensus that stands in greatest contradiction to popular belief. The vast majority of ordinary people display no detectable concern about continuing to burn fossil fuels, and a sizable fraction either deny that burning fossil fuels can possibly influence the climate, or doubt that the influence would be harmful. Wikipedia can certainly report on who believes what. We have a List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming.",0

Advice
To save me writing too much, a lot of this is going to be links to existing policies and guidelines - there is plenty of advice available, in fact a confusing amount, so pointers may be helpful. The guide to writing Your First Article and the Business' FAQ are particularly useful.

Wikipedia frowns on writing about your own organisation because of worries that someone with a conflict of interest will not be able to write from the Neutral Point of View which is one of our three key content policies. (The others are Verifiability and No Original Research). However, the anonymity of account names means it can't be prohibited, and it may be better to have a declared interest than somone pushing a case anonymously.

It should be possible for you to write an article about your organisation that won't get deleted, if you are careful. The first essential is to avoid any hint of promotion - be drily factual, as though you were unconnected with the organisation and had no interest in it, but were documenting it for completeness. See the guideline on peacock terms.

The next point is likely to be the problem if your organisation is new - notability, which is the Wikipedia term for """"of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article"""". See the guidelines on Notability and Notability (organisations and companies). What you have to do is find references from reliable sources which are independent of you. Your own web-site etc are not considered independent. Has there been comment on your organisation, e.g. in the trade press? It may be that you will have to wait until you are more established and can cite independent references.

I wrote the above off-line: now that I come to post it, I see you have run into another problem - copyright. That's more of a problem than you might think, because everything in WP must released under the """"GFDL"""" which says that anyone may do anything with it including rework it for commercial use - so just saying """"I agree to this being put in"""" is not enough. The notice above tells you what you can do, but for the reasons in my third para above it is very likely that your mission statement will not be in suitable terms for Wikipedia, so the solution to the copyright problem may well be to rewrite it. That leads me to a last warning: an important difference between Wikipedia and a business directory is that you will not own your article - see WP:OWN - other people can and will edit it. See the warning at the bottom of the page you use to edit: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.""""

There's been an amusing tit-for-tat re-edit of the location of Whitgift School as a result of user Samtheboy mistakenly believing that the school is in the county of Surrey. Without wishing to sound like an anorak, this Greater London vs. the 'old' county boundaries around London is a bit of an old chestnut. Significant changes in local government in the 1960s and 70s (the result of the inexorable spread of suburban London) meant that towns like Croydon, Kingston and Bromley in the south were swallowed up by London, becoming the London Borough of Croydon, etc. One old county - Middlesex - disappeared altogether. Confusingly, the Post Office retained the old names, disregarding the new borough locations, and to this day people in places like Thornton Heath believe they live in Surrey - a fact which couldn't be further from the truth. The same is true of south Croydon, which is in the London Borough of Croydon and hence Greater London. The county of Surrey begins further down the road and the local council taxpayers, commercial ratepayers and other residents of south Croydon pay their taxes, have their roads repaired and their refuse collected by the local London borough. I suppose the reaction is: who cares? But if Wikipedia has pretentions to accuracy, we should get these things right.

 Where do these concepts come from? 

The article was recently revised to say that Old Town is """"in Williamson County, near Franklin"""" (no longer """"in"""" Franklin) and that the mound complex """"is alongside the Harpeth River on what later became one branch of the Natchez Trace"""" (no longer simply """"on the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""").

I'm puzzled by these changes, which aren't sourced. My investigations (call them """"original research"""") using online maps do indicate that Old Town is in northwestern Williamson County, near Franklin, but not inside the current city limits or even in the urban growth boundary. Thus, I think the geographic location is OK, even though sources have placed it """"in"""" Franklin. 

Let me get this straight.  You want to use insulting language about the edits, but then agree that they are factually correct.  Where is the OR?  I disagree that it is OR to state that the location is in Williamson County.  Whether or not it is currently in the current city limits is a factual matter that I am not actually sure about, but in the historic sweep it is correct to say that the location is near Franklin (think of Franklin having been a small town at one time).  It is """"near"""" Franklin, meaning it is not in modern downtown Franklin.  I see no OR.  

However, I can't agree with """"is alongside the Harpeth River on what later became one branch of the Natchez Trace"""". First off, what is later than """"is""""? It appears to me that the mound complex """"is"""" alongside the Harpeth River and """"is"""" on the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace. I surmise that the intent was to say that the site was not on a branch of the Natchez Trace when the mound complex was built, but I don't buy that. First off, the previous version of the article never said that the mound complex was built on the Harpeth River branch of the Trace; it merely said that it's there now. Secondly, I'm not aware of any source indicating that the mound complex was not built on the Harpeth River branch of the Trace. Notwithstanding whatever the current version of the [[Natchez Trace[[ article, it's my understanding (based on diverse sources) that the Trace (which is an interconnected collection of trails, not a single trail) existed for centuries before white people laid eyes on Tennessee, and that archaeologists who have investigated Old Town assume that it was located where it is because of the river, the Trace, and the crossing of Brown's Creek. If the intent was to say that the Trace did not exist when the mound complex was built, I see that as a piece of WP:OR that's inconsistent with many sources.   

Those amendments to the article were in 2 edits, the main one with edit summary """"revise about assertion of location, avoiding unnecessary disclosure and avoiding synthesis (e.g. about 2 creeks being the same, not in a source AFAIK). Drop dup cat."""".  Funny you should be making accusations of original research.  I think the wp:OR accusation should apply more strongly to the previous language, which included wp:OR in the form of synthesis (wp:SYNTH?) about which creek is what (and the synthesis ends up disclosing more about location than is necessary).  I think that """"the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""" refers pretty clearly to that branch of the 1800's Natchez Trace, which served as path/roadway for return upstream of persons who had brought rafts or barges down the Mississippi to New Orleans.  The other branch is known as the Ridge Route or something like that and is covered in a different NRHP listing.  These two distinct branches are known in history and described in historical documents, including being described in Williamson County MRA and other documents that Orlady has read.

I actually had some extended discussion on this topic previously, with a Muslim editor. He assured me (and provided some credible refs from the Sharia) that Islam acknowledges Jesus' status as a prophet and respects him accordingly, but it is against fundamental teachings (and even court rulings) to celebrate the birthday of a prophet. I had originally wanted to include the material on the basis of NPOV, but he convinced me that it's either a fabrication, or taken out of context and distorted. The discussion and refs are in the archives (probably late Oct. - early Nov. somewhere). Since then I've been removing the material (it pops up fairly often) because the part that is verifiable isn't relevant to the article, and the part that's relevant is not only unverified, but strongly disputed. I suggest we continue removing it until solid and very specific refs are provided to support it.  Tropics """,0

Events don't need titles?
There is a common pratice by American television to label events as if it were a television programme.  Before the video footage is broadcast, often there is theme music and an elaborate title page that might say """"Crisis in Canada"""" or """"Terror in Iraq"""".  Is it subtle POV to have to label every event with a title.

Reply Remove Incorrect Libelous Comment By Media Lawyer 

I have the information now to refute what has been commented by that commenter.

a)Incorrect. Richie Ramone did not say such he would sue them for 20 years. That did not happen Source please?

b)Incorrect. Richie Ramone did not say he would """"sue and reap millions"""" There are no interviews with Richie Ramone about his lawsuit. Only statements from his lawyers.Sources please?

c)Incorrect. Most do not say Richie Ramone sued because he was """"embittered"""" that he left. No one has alleged that. Tommy left, CJ left, Dee Dee left. End Of The Century actually advances the case that it was an impossible situation to be in the Ramones. That is public record. They were, in the main, miserable to be in the Ramones. Public record. So, Source please?

d) The band did not continue to be successful. Source please? The band was NEVER financially successful in Joey Ramone's lifetime, as far as album sales, and it got worse after Richie left. Richie Ramone left because he was tired of the grind, playing only the 4-4, their lack of mainstream success, and that was reported in Rolling Stone in August 2007. They were dropped by Sire Records that year. The band deteriorated, due to Dee Dee Ramone's quitting in 1989. Most sourced information is that they were on a downhill slide from then. According to USA today, they sold most of their albums after Joey's death in 2001. To date, Ramones CDs with Somebody Put Something In My Drink have sold more than 1.3 million copies. Smash You was released as the title track to Loud Fast Ramones. It was called """"Loud Fast Ramones Smash You"""" and has sold more than 350,000 units, according to Soundscan. 

e)Richie Ramone did not sue his """"dead band mates"""". He sued the Estate of Johnny Ramone as well as Ramones Productions. He did not sue the Estate of Joey Ramone, nor the Estate of Dee Dee Ramone, nor has he sued the wives and relatives of Joey Ramone and Dee Dee Ramone. Source is the lawsuit. He did not sue Joey's brother Mickey Leigh, Dee Dee's wife Barbara, nor Joey's truly exceptional and lovely mother Charlotte Lesher, who passed away a year ago. 

First Media Lawyer says the band continued to be successful, and then it's that they have no money. Fact is, Ramones productions is a very lucrative business. Again, USA Today reported in 2002 that the band sold millions of units since Joey Ramone's death. That is according to Soundscan. Paper Magazine and others have reported on the big business of marketing Ramones since the sad passing of Joey Ramone. Media Lawyer's statement that the Ramones are in """"hardship"""" is not sourced. 

Request: Please remove what we believe is libelous incorrect TALK comment by Media Lawyer, unless Media Lawyer can produce reliable sources. At the very least, none of it is sourced.

WP:SYNTH
An RfC was just closed at Talk:Climate change denial#RfC: Must the word 'denial; occur in every citation for climate change denial?, and it is interesting to read the closing statement there, in that it reflects community consensus about some aspects of when to use or not use sources about a topic without violating WP:SYNTH.   
The concluding statement says the term """"climate change denial"""" may be used if the source """"implicitly states they fall into the general group.""""  It has no relevance to anything discussed here.  It certainly is not a loophole for """"synthesis"""".    
I don't think anyone is looking for """"loopholes"""". I'm not arguing for any kind of slavish devotion to that discussion here, just for editors to take a look, and to think about it with an open mind. I think that the closing statement makes some good points about common sense.   
There is nothing """"slavish"""" about the devotion.  If most sources say the motivation of the terrorism is secular, then we cannot say it is religious and call it Christian terrorism.    
 I was saying that we don't have to follow that other page slavishly. And that other page isn't talking about situations where most sources say something is unrelated. If you are interested in what it does say, then you can read it. If you don't want to read it, then don't. Everything here does not have to be a WP:Battleground.   
As I have noted before, unless reliable sources attribute some religious motivation or aim,  I would not say Wikipedia should attribute such a motivation or aim.  If the sources ascribe motivation to irredentism, economic or other attribute and do not ascribe a religious aim, then it does not belong here.  Note the discussion just closed at Climate*.*  where the result was basically """"no consensus at all"""".  Cheers.   
Not sure what you mean, but I linked to a discussion where the closer said there was a consensus. I'm not going beyond what the closing statement said there.   
The issue has come up in articles about terrorism and about ideology.  Different writers may use different terms to mean the same thing or the same terms to mean different things.  Generally, in peer-reviewed literature, the terms used are defined and we can say that one author who defines """"Christian terrorism"""" as terrorism motivated by Christian belief and another who uses the term """"Christian religious terrorism"""" with the same definition are referring to the same thing.  However, another author who uses the expression """"Christian terrorism"""" and defines it as ethnic terrorism where religion is part of ethnic identity means the same thing as authors writing about """"religious communal terrorism"""" carried out by Christians, or """"nationalist terrorism"""" between different religious groups.
Can you provide a single source that should be included based on the opinion expresses in the climate change denial RfC?
  
I'm so tempted to just reply """"yes"""". And I really would rather not get into a wall-of-text over things that we will soon be discussing at the mediation. But let me try to clarify why I linked to that discussion. This isn't about definitions of """"Christian terrorism"""" in my view. It's about what the closing statement there said, that just because a particular word is not used explicitly in a source, does not mean that the source does not apply to a page – editors can use common sense to examine the context within the source. Thinking back to the discussions about the Lebanon section (now made somewhat moot by the Schbley source, that examines in detail the Maronite Monks), there was discussion of whether it was SYNTH to consider a United Nations source, because it used the word """"genocide"""" instead of the word """"terrorism"""". I'm pointing out that there is now some precedent for using common sense in evaluating the language of such sources, in context. If you or another editor sees common sense in that instance as indicating that genocide is not terrorism, that's still a discussion we can have. So that's why I provided that link. I'm not about to rewrite the Lebanon section on t",0

 MY STATEMENT 

AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED?
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN?
You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.
I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.
But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.
An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.
Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.
It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.
Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.
i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.
You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.
She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.
She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.
She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.
She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.
The arbitration should have been about this too.
They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.
And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.
He even insulted Nicholas turnbull.
Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves.
Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.

This has to stop.
I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.
He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.
This don't go and has to be aborted.
I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.

None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.
It is a close debate and not an arena game.
THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.
He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.
He must be removed as well.
i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.
If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.
This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.

 deletion of redirects per Wikipedia:Naming conventions (schools) 

The issue has gotten contentious for one redirect in particular for Uni High.  There's been an Rfd for days nowand I've said that I'd be fine with keeping it, but only if there was a particular reason to.  We are forming guideslines etc, and while a look at the ones in place helped form them, I'll definitely admit that I could have overlooked stuff.  But the current discussion has been going round and round and the person who wants the redirect kept is arguing two things (it seems).  One is that keeping the redirect will prevent article duplication.  And the other is that it will help people find the article.

In my point of view, both of these arguments make no sense, as the article in question was moved from name of school plus paramater to name of school plus different parameter.  There are half a dozen different paramaters that could be used easily, so the idea that people are going to naturally gravitate towards the one that did happen to exist and want to create an article there, or search that way doesn't make sense.  If the person really thinks that that's a problem, then they should have created other redirects from the other possible namespaces for the article.  If you could take a look at the discussionI'd appreciate it.  I may be missing something, we may want to change the guidelines per different things that have been raised (notability of the city was raised, which we don't outright address because I didn't think we would need to but we probably should).

"Descriptive theory, then normative. Correct? 

The article claims that
“Savage proved that, if you adhere to axioms of rationality,  if you believe an uncertain event has possible outcomes  each with a utility to you of  then your choices can be explained as arising from a function in which you believe that there is a subjective probability of each outcome is , and your subjective expected utility is the expected value of the utility…”

First of all, how can something like this be “proved”? It seems to be an empirical matter. But more importantly, the article later says, with regards to the failure of the theory to predict actual choices, that
“Savage's response was not that this showed a flaw in his method, rather that applying his method allowed individuals to improve their decision making.”

The first paragraph claims a descriptive role for the theory, but according to the second quote it is a normative theory about how people should reason. This problem is so flagrant that I have to question whether Savage ever actually made the first claim, since this one also contains the problematic claim of a proof. Could we either get a description more in line with Savage's own claim, or either a reference for this flaw?",0

"""Hello, I wrote Jack Lynch, Professor at Rutledge Univ. of 18th Century Literature. His talks includes works involving dictionaries. He responded (concerning definition of dictionary) with """"dictionary"""" has had a wide range of applications over the centuries.  Since 1631, the word """"dictionary"""" has been used with this meaning:

    By extension: A book of information or reference on any
    subject or branch of knowledge, the items of which are
    arranged in alphabetical order; an alphabetical encyclopædia as a Dictionary of Architecture, Biography, Geography, of the Bible, of Christian Antiquities, of Dates, etc.

There are all sorts of reference works we'd be likely to call
other things  encyclopedias, gazetteers, and so on  that have been called dictionaries by their makers.  In these cases,

    the essential sense ‘word-book’ is supplanted by the
    accidental one of ‘reference book in alphabetical order’
    arising out of the alphabetical arrangement used in modern
    word-books.. My reason for contacting Professor Lynch was the result of a curriculum director denying my published phonetic dictionary to her school relating that the reference book was not a 'real' dictionary. Now the dictionary is in public library collections in Canada, Mexico, The Netherlands and, of course, since it's an American English Phonetic Dictionary, is in over 400 U.S. public libraries. I am the lexicographer and would like to include """"Gabby's Wordspeller & Phonetic Dictionary"""" into the dictionary collection. And, since it's the only known phonetic dictionary currently in existence in either book or digital form, it has no category to list itself. Does it belong in a sub-category or does it require it's own category? There may be others come along now that this one has made the light of day.

"Jesse Ragan deletion nomination
Hi, I have received notice that the page I began about Jesse Ragan has been nominated for deletion based upon suspicion it is a vanity article. First, I am not the man (assuming Jesse ragan is male), nor have I met him/her. I began the article because as a professor of typography I felt Ragan's work significant, and that s/he had achieved work of lasting merit fairly early in life. S/he has been several time recognized by the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) (the national professional organization for graphic designers), Ragan's work has appeared in respected design periodicals, and has lectured on typography at several Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD) institutions. 

Several days ago I noticed removal of Ragan's name from credits for typefaces on the Tobias Frere-Jones article. My first thought was that some disagrement might have occured between Ragan and his former employers Hoefler & Frere-Jones, perhaps leading to a nomination for deletion. Mr. Hoefler wrote to me publicly on my talk page that Jesse Ragan was only one of many who worked on the project. That may be the case, but that would not discredit typefaces Ragan has produced entirely on his own, or the two mentions of his contributions to the Archer typeface on the AIGA web site. Clearly, at some point someone at Hoefler & Frere-Jones thought Ragan's contributions significant enough to provide his/her name (and not the rest of that team) to our national professional organization. The fact that Mr./Ms. Ragan is now independent and a competitor to other type foundries might be a part of this. But I have no knowledge of this. I know none of these people personally, and I respect the work of all of them as a review of my edit history will suggest. My primary reason for beginning the article was to increase the number of articles on typeface designers, and a secondary desire to increase the number of typography related articles in general. Jesse Ragan's work is very solid, even his/her own direct client list is impressive. In the world of typography, apprentices are historically given credit, witness Francesco Griffo who apprenticed to Aldus Manutius. It is my hope that Wikipedia will continue to make some room for subjects that though not block buster in scale are significant.",0

Also please read this excerpt of what I wrote:

You can thank me later for it but I'll tell you Parseval's identity. It's more conceptual to think of L^2 the space of measurable square-integrable functions on [-pi,pi] as a complex inner product space (Hilbert space). The idea is that the space has an orthonormal basis (general orthornormal basis can be found by wavelets) such as {e^{-in}} for n an integer. And if f is a function in L^2 you can take its inner product against each of these functions and get """"components"""" of f. The point is, as you'd expect in any Hilbert space, the components are the only relevant data when it comes to taking inner products. So you can find the inner product (an integral) of two functions just by knowing their Fourier coefficients. Pretty cool math dude? So basically I advise you to find the Fourier coefficients of the function """"x"""" on [-pi,pi] and take the inner product of this function with itself and apply Parseval. The PROOF of Parseval is probably well beyond the scope of your education; you'll see it when you get to university. It involves proving the completeness of the trigonometric system (in the L^2 case) which can be done nicely with convolution but I'll save the details to your lecturers at first year undergrad. uni.

I have read that particular book, and I'm confused by what you say. Of course the film jumps from person to person; the progression is of ideas, not poeple to be interviewed, which allows for a cohesive meaning to the film. In fact, the film presents information very similar to that of the book in question, except it is not essentially a propaganda piece aimed at one particular medium, but an exposé of an industry, targeted at the practices of several media.
I'm also a writer, and a prodigous reader. I had read most of Seuss' children's work by the time I was three, most of Dahl's children's stories by the time I was six, and read The Lord of the Rings when I was twelve.

"""I think that, at the level of basic fundamental principles, we may actually be in agreement. I would agree that it's inappropriate for Editor """"A"""" to insert a format that Editor """"A""""  ‘’knows’’ is non-standard,  and then request a consensus before it's overturned by Editor """"B"""" as soon after the posting as is reasonably practicable,” or at least provide some explanation for using this non-standard format. 

We presumably disagree as to whether, in the subject instance, Editor """"A"""" knew, or even suspected, the information (the year of death for the author who had just died that week) which Editor """"A"""" added to the article, was in a non-standard format. So then, if that were the case as to Editor """"A"""", I think then that Editor """"B"""" should obtain a consensus before changing (or deleting in its entirety) the information added by Editor """"A"""" in a format that Editor """"B,"""" acting alone without a consensus, believes in good faith to be a non-standard format. I think that except in the very rare case where there can be no reasonable belief that Editor """"A"""" was acting with a good faith belief that he was adding to the article, but rather, he was vandalizing it, should Editor “B” proceed to delete or edit the work of Editor “A” without first obtaining a consensus, or at the very least, to receive a (favorable) response to his request to Editor “A” that there be a change.

I believe that a procedure like this is in compliance with “assuming good faith”, which as you know is a fundamental principle on Wikipedia: It is this assumption that (other) editors' edits and comments are made in good faith. [Wikipedia:Assume good faith] that, I think, is what is missing in the approach taken by Editor “B.” That is, that Editor “B” should have approached the work (the newly added/inserted information) of Editor “A” with the assumption that we are all supposed to be operating under at all times, that Editor “A’s” additions/deletions/revisions/etc. were made in good faith, and that being the assumption, it cannot be appropriate for Editor “B” to single-handedly and without a consensus, delete all (or even part) of Editor’s “A” work. Does that strike you as an outrageous proposition? I mean, presumably Editor “A” and “B” share common flaws of imperfection found in so many humans, and presumably, going into the issue without any knowledge of the other editor, neither editor can presume that he is absolutely correct in every aspect and that anyone who views anything differently than he is a vandal intent on destroying Wikipedia. 

Isn’t it at the outset basically a 50/50 proposition when an editor goes, to delete the newly added information by another editor, that he may be wrong in making that deletion? And if it’s 50/50, shouldn’t he ask for a consensus before deleting the work of another editor, or at a bare minimum contact the other editor and have some reasonable assurance that Editor """"A"""" has received his note/email/posting/etc. before deleting Editor “’A’s” work?

I might comment that in our situation, it was not an instance of Editor “A” changing something that was already on the page and then Editor “B,” seeing what was obviously an act of vandalism in the changes by editor “A,” reverting those changes. Not at all. Editor “A” added new information (the year of death for an author who had just died), and Editor “B,” believing that it was presented in a non-standard format to have this information at that particular place, deleted it. Editor “B” believed that this date information belonged, if anywhere, only on a page devoted to the author himself, and nowhere on a page the subject of which was the author’s work, in this instance, a book.

I do in fact disagree with Editor “B” on that point. I find it very useful to see when, during an author’s lifetime, and also in relation to significant world events, an author or artist wrote or published or created a particular piece of work, Articles about the book, or other work, when discussing the writing and publishing, virtually always includes references to when he wrote the book or when he had it published and even references to when other drafts of the book were created (like Herman Melville losing the first finalized version of Moby Dick at sea and having to re-write the entire book years later, or other such interesting facts, like authors commenting that they would have changed many things in a book if they had written it after a particular event in their lives personal to them (e.g., the death of a beloved father, birth of their own child, marriage, good or bad fortunes, etc.) or events in their lives in which we collectively share in some part (the 9/11 attacks, sinking of the Titanic, WWII, War in Vietnam, the shooting of Ronald Regan/Kennedy/Kennedy/King/VJ day, VE day/man walking on the moon/the falling of the Berlin Wall, or the deaths of Roosevelt’s, Churchhill, Elvis, John Lenon,",0

PokemonFan was used vote in a controversial TfD after Iloveminun (who nominated the template) got told to stop voting delete. PokemonFan also vandalised the user page of the admin taking part in the vote who wouldn't delete it for him. It's more of a larger problem by Iloveminun, who is trying to replace Serebii, a valued and incredibly useful website most of the actually reference, from hundreds of Pokémon articles (first he tried to remove the template that links to it manually, then from the template that produces references in all the Pokémon articles and replace it with his own website, Pokémon Galaxy. Pokémon Galaxy is not at present even finished, but it seems to be pushing it. Which is how I got caught in everything. (Bit odd how I caught the real sockpuppet when I was originally way off) Thanks,  Rainbow Sneakers 

I will. Is Minun132 being abusive? Hmm, I had missed that. Thank you for the offer, I will wait for your return since this is a new situation for me. Thanks again,  Rainbow Sneakers 

Nah, I'm writing I'm just ill. And getting sidetracked. It's nearly done. Cheers,  Rainbow Sneakers

I do not see how it is relevant if sources use the word famous.  We are never obliged to use the same words as any source.

No, I tried that and it was rightly shot down.  You can find a source - a famous one! - which says that this opera is a shabby little shocker.  And those words aren't even listed as ones to avoid, so do we use them as if they are objectively true?  Obviously not.
I don't believe the word is forbidden on Wikipedia, I already said that.  But we have a guideline called """"words to avoid"""".

Hey there buddy, I am back:

(a quote from Kenneth Tennyson Phd.)

""""the sad thing is that our fellow here - freedom skies - appears to have been raised in america or britain and yet he seems more indian than american or british and along with that supports a radical view of the world that is peppered religious ideas... and along with that - he is educated! It is truly sad... if india industrializes and this hindutva movement holds sway, the world will see a flourishing of a very powerful and scary radicalized country.""""

Firstly, can you tell me what being American or British is? America and Britain are both made of of various immigrant and former immigrant communities from Italy, Ireland, China, Guatemala, and so forth. So, if Freedom Skies is being proud of his culture, is that evil? Secondly, you have an over negative estimation of countries outside of your clouded world. Suggestion, join the Marine Corps. That is one thing I have learned is understanding the world through travel. Thirdly, I am utterly shocked at your comment on Freedom skies being educated as being a sad thing (if not, a scary thing). Does that threaten you that Indians are educated? Please answer yes or no (no need to give a disertation or oration), thank you. Also, that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the Southern part of America during the civil war used to consider Blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle. As a matter of fact, it was illegal for an Afro-American to go to school or even learn to read, since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners. I will even go a further step to say that back then, these racists from the colonial South felt threatened that the slaves would become """"a very powerful and scary radicalized community"""".  

Regarding your previous posts, here is some food for thought. In the Marine Corps, as a Gunny Sgt. or someone in command, if you are at a bar or a party, you never show that you are drunk.

There are two FeloniousMonk's!

One must be a sockpuppet. I edited the intro to say:

The canonical definition of the Discovery Institute's Intelligent Design is that Intelligent Design (sometimes abbreviated ID) is the controversial assertion that certain features of the universe and of living things exhibit the characteristics of a product resulting from an intelligent cause or agent, as opposed to an unguided process such as natural selection. Intelligent Design is wholly a product of the Discovery Institute, a conservative Christian think tank. The idea has been around since 1990.

Just like FeloniousMonk said above:

The canonical definition of intelligent design, which is the one offered by the Discovery Institute (""""that certain features of the universe and of living things exhibit the characteristics of a product resulting from an intelligent cause or agent, as opposed to an unguided process such as natural selection"""") Since ID is wholly a product of the Discovery Institute, with every leading ID proponent is one of its Fellows and every campaign and strategy arising from its offices, defining ID as they do is necessary in the intro for any of the claims made in the article by Dembski, Behe or Johnson to make any sense.

""":::: But in what sense can that comment possibly be “correct”? """"Provided that what is sourced is already in the article""""! I can't let that pass, as it is just so damaging - so I'm going to say a few things. You cannot just ‘summarise’ any old group of citations (sometime creating a new thing altogether in doing so - which is excempt from needing proof) – you are absolutely obliged to consider WP:weight, along with other of the many guidelines like WP:red flag in Verifiability, and Notability too. Weight alone will more often than not dictate the new text, as it has done now. 

These retentive methods of ‘Style reviewing’ are a plague across the full scope of Wikipedia, and this article highlights the foolishness (too long maintained) of methodically tick-boxing inherently illogical style-correctness, whilst routinely (ie as a kind of 'policy') ignoring content( which is ironically seen as the job of the editors, who actually get sidelined in the process). In teh past I've seen so many foolish paragraphs pass though ‘style’, even in Featured Articles (another content-shy process believe it or not). There really is nothing clever about being so clinical when it leads to plain misrepresentation, especially with a subject like this. Many non-British would will be mislead by the text on a basic ‘reader’ level here anyway, which just adds more irony to the process of course . As a rule, it is good to consider what you are doing in life in anyway, regardless of your job.

What happened in Nick Griffin is that simple event-verifying  citations from within the article (the few cases of Griffin being invited to speak at mainstream establishments) were converted into a kind of super-flexible ‘source’ material’, which (in that new state) were easily moulded into the stand-alone line """"Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."""" I strongly suspect that no one got a shoe-in to actually add any weight, due to the rigid system involved - where new  content is demoted in value, and even at times discouraged. I’ve seen it happen too often, it’s just plain dumb. What’s worse, a general ethos of ‘protecting the result’ comes from the process, which ended here in me being accused of ‘vandalism’ for attempting change, which I really object to. It really is dumb.

Imagine someone collecting a handful of citations of various people expressing an opinion (shall we say of black people being inferior to whites?) and places them in a relevant section in an article (say a """"Controversy"""" section in a new and developing article called """"Racism"""") . According to Wikipedia’s Style Council, this line inserted at the end of the intro would theoretically be fine: """"Many people believe that black people are inferior to whites”. As there was nothing in the developing article about the many issues surrounding IQ test and the reading of them both past and present, no balance is made, and the Intro passes with flying colours. The new authorised version is then considered as ‘passing consensus’ – a broadly finished thing that is duly protected from change.

The Intro equation I’ve seen many times is: X (citations of comments existing somewhere i n the article) = Z (a new flexible ‘source’ material  when grouped) = Y (a new and uncited statement of fact, based on the new entity of the ‘source’). THE INNER WORKINGS OF ‘SUMMARY’ ARE SIMPLY NOT APPARENT TO THE TYPICAL WIKIPEDIA READER, who is always at the very bottom of the Wikipedia heap, just below the general editor.

Articles like Nick Griffin can be difficult and need creative work on the edit level - but that is the point. So much time on Wikipedia is wasted on stylising incomplete articles and weak unbalanced text. It is no way to bypass edit conflict - that ‘’’has’’’ to be done the hard way, such as in finding ways to express weight. Risking edit battles is far superior to squeezing down to make-shift style-approved articles that are subsequently protected from change. Here that process made the introduction bland, weak and misleading, and the added factor of the subject's inherent extremity ensured the article became seriously misleading – to the point that the article became Nick Griffin-friendly, and hence ultimate",0

 Silent Consensus About Reality 

This phrase stopped me dead in my tracks:

...silent consensus about reality.

Perhaps the phrase """"silent consensus about reality"""" has a clear meaning in the jargon of some school of thought, but I have never encountered it before and have no idea what it refers to.  I'd like to see this re-written or expanded so that it's comprehensible by the average person (or removed altogether).  Since I have no idea what it means I'm not able to re-write or expand it, and I'm loathe to just delete it since it has survived many other edits and therefore presumably means something to others.  

The phrase was added by Special:Contributions/85.127.205.253 85.127.205.253 at 2009-01-31T03:27:25.  Can that person clarify what they intended to say?  Can anyone else offer an explanation?

"This plot description is much superiorcomments? 

“Joliet” Jake Blues is released from the Joliet Correctional Center after serving three years of a prison sentence after being convicted of armed robbery. Jake is irritated at being picked up by his brother Elwood in a battered former Mt. Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own. 

The Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment). At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Band.
  
As The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall. 

After parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher). The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room, the mystery woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves The Blue Brothers from another attempted arrest.

Elwood proceeds to his “straight job”, on the assembly line at an aerosol-can manufacturer, takes several cans from the line and places them in his briefcase, and visits the plant manager, quitting his job, citing a decision to become a priest (curiously, Elwood’s supervisor’s office is adorned with a U.S. flag and an Illinois state flag, suggesting that the aerosol-can manufacturer in an enterprise owned by the government of the State of Illinois—or else simply that Elwood’s supervisor thought it would be cool to adorn his office with a U.S. flag and an Illinois flag).

Jake and Elwood begin tracking down members of the band. Trombonist Tom “Bones” Malone and the rhythm section of the group (Willie “Too Big” Hall, Steve “The Colonel” Cropper, Donald “Duck” Dunn, and Murphy “Murph” Dunné) known as “Murph and the Magictones”, are playing in an empty Holiday Inn lounge, “The Armada Room”, and are readily convinced to rejoin The Blues Brothers’ Band. Trumpeter “Mister Fabulous” (Alan Rubin), now maître d' at a restaurant, is more of a challenge to persuade (“you ain′t never gonna get ’em outta those high-payin’ gigs”), but Jake and Elwood rudely convince him with some dining-room hijinks. En route to meet saxophonist Louis “Blue Lou” Marini and guitarist Matt “Guitar” Murphy, The Blues Brothers drive through a rally of neo-Nazis (upon whom Jake comments “Illinois Nazis—I hate Illinois Nazis!”) and adding another enemy to the The Blues Brothers’ growing list of pursuing parties. Marini and Murphy are working at the soul food restaurant on Maxwell Street, in Calumet City, Illinois, which Murphy owns with his wife (Aretha Franklin). Against her advice, the two musicians leave and rejoin the band. The reunited group obtain new musical instruments and associated equipment from Ray (Ray Charles) of Ray’s Music Exchange, in Calumet City, Illinois, on loan, pending payment from the proceeds of The Blues Brothers’s Band’s pending ‘triumphant return’.

Handle in text:  It is not clear exactly what the alternative  to this RFC proposal is, or what a """"no"""" or """"yes"""" might yield,  so I will spell out what I see here as the best solution. I agree with Gamaliel and Nomoskedasticity that this is a BLP issue and that using """"Filipino"""" alone is utterly unacceptable and POV.   I do think """"Filipino-American"""" correctly describes the subject of the article, and is not an indication of citizenship, but rather it is a demographic description which could accurately be used.  However,  per TheRedPenOfDoom, and MarkBernstein, I think that this may be best handled as Bbb23 and Seb suggested - and how the lead is now worded - which is to not use either identifier in the first sentence, but instead unpack it, spell out in more detail the actual facts in an NPOV manner, in the lead and in the rest of the article which the intro summarizes.  This works and does not take sides in the serious BLP issue.  We further make clear how Vargas self-identifies, which I think is important here, without having Wikipedia editors take a position. As MarkBernstein said, we are not required to indicate nationality or citizenship in the first sentence or anywhere, and TRPoD is right about disclaimers etc.  -sometimes it is best to go at it from a different angle. We also had the same kind of issue at - believe it or not - Bee Gees where there were warring factions who disagreed about whether they should be called English, Australian, or Manx; we handled it by leaving off the nationality, and the wars stopped.   So, I support this wording: Jose Antonio Vargas (born February 3, 1981) is a journalist, filmmaker, and immigration activist.

Dear Ronz,

PSB the embedded links and the areas which I am trying to update: 

1. The multi-stage fitness test, also known as the bleep test, beep test, pacer test, Leger-test or 20-m shuttle run test, is used by sports coaches and trainers to estimate an athlete's VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake). The test is especially useful for players of sports like rugby, soccer, Australian rules football, hockey, netball, handball, tennis, squash and fitness testing at schools and colleges plus many other sports; employed by many international sporting teams as an accurate test of Cardiovascular fitness, one of the all-important """"Components of Fitness"""". This test is also part of the FITNESSGRAM - Commercial Link, incorrect and unrelated to the Multi-stage Fitness Test physical fitness test to measure cardiorespiratory - Typo fitness. The test was created by Luc Leger, University of Montreal[1] published in 1983, """"A Maximal Multistage 20m Shuttle Run Test to predict VO2 Max"""", and was re-published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology (vol 49 pp 1–12) in 1988 in its present form with 1 min stages under the name """"Multistage 20-m shuttle run test for aerobic fitness"""".[2] Result equivalences between slightly modified versions are well explained by Tomkinson et al. in 2003.[3] The beep test world record is 19.2, held by Håkan Mild.[4][unreliable source?] - Embedded Commercial Link LAZYRUNNER added as Reference

2. The Multi-stage Fitness Test is know as both the beep test and bleep test, the broken links for the beep article are irrelevant to the content of the Multi-stage Fitness Test article as it discusses both.

I look forward to hearing from you via PM.

Robertissimo, I beg to differ.  The """"couple of mentions on Fox"""" were full segments on the O'Reilly Factor, a debate on Hannity and Colmes, a full segment on Fox and Friends, a segment on Neil Cavuto and another segment on ABC News, an op-ed in the New York Post and the Marine Corps Post.  I was given the Jeane Kirkpatrick Award principally because I not only defended myself in all these forums, but Iaccording to the award citationupheld a standard of academic freedom in the face of adversity.  I take great issue with your claim of my """" admission in that article that he was also an escort"""".  No such admission was made, i was trying to make a rhetorical comparison between payment for porn as a proxy to a form of prostitution.  I made this point on SEVERAL occasions on the Alan Colmes show.  I was on Alan's show four times.  I take your statement as offensive, cowardly, counter-productive and demand an apology.  I understand that wiki contributors are supposed to be much more subtle in their criticism, however Robertissimosomeone, to my knowledge, that I have never methas shown great disdain for me by publicly calling me a liar, prostitute or worsean imprecise writer.  
If you, Mr Robertissimo hold me in such low regard, why are you interested in contributing to this article?  That's a fair question.  If Mr Robertissimo refuses to apologize, I'd like some advice on how to handle this matter appropriately.  Editors as the faceless Mr Robertissimo should keep in mind that I am a real person and not some """"wiki curiosity"""". 

Robertissimo's comments on the Marine Corps status shows an entire lack of knowledge of these type of procedures, both formal and informal and his assessment is frankly simplistic.  These issues have been discussed ad nauseum, but angry activists still believe they can """"hurt me"""" through this Wikipedia article.  With all due respect to Mr Robertissimo (none of which he has shown me), where did he suddenly come from?    Are we heading back toward editing wars as the dishonest and biased attempt to further their agenda?  Given the history of this article and the number of, frankly, shady characters who have appeared and disappeared on this page, my concerns are merited.  

Out of curiosity, why hasn't any emphasis been placed on """"further investigating"""" the allegations made against me by U-Haul and the Veterans organization? The Marine Corps Times printed the """"allegations"""", but I haven't seen editors on this talk page bringing up that issue.  It is disturbing, distracting and tedious to have to """"defend"""" myself from the likes of character such as Mr. Robertissimo et al...This page was not meant for that purpose and I would like for civility to return.  I fear there has been a further infiltration by former editors who had been resoundingly banned from these pages.  Can anyone comment?
Writing vs. Edits.  I originally cited a comparison between myself and Rich Merritt (who happens to be my neighbor).  I was told the Salon reading audience would not recognize the former pornstar alias USMC Captain Merritt .  The Salon editor, Mark Schone, inserted Jeff Gannon as Mr Gannon is somewhat of a lightrod for the Salon readership's disdain.  I've made this statement before on at least three occasions (please consult the archives).  
In reality, Merritt's story is entirely dissimilar to my own as Merritt was performing in adult films while on active duty. My last film of record was in the winter of '94, nearly a decade before my enlistment in the Marine Corps.  The comparison between myself and Gannon is also passing at best, as Jeff was considered to be a type of interloper/doppleganger with insider knowledge given to him surreptitiously from some shadowy figure/network within the Bush administration or the Republican party.  In my case, there was no doubt of my identity as a Marine, my status as a student at Columbia University, the subsequent changes that were effected in the student and city policy regarding the discrimination of veterans and the specific description of those veterans were all real and documented.  I also had NO inside help or sway with any party or organization, including (unfortunately) the Columbia Milvets organization.  There was never a question that I wrote the articles I wrote, nor was there a hint of some """"higher up"""" working behind the scenes to help me.  There was also never a doubt that I had merited the CPAC Award. I was unanimously elected according to the event's organizers.  I was even congratulated for courage after standing up to the political roasting after unsourced bloggers revealed my past and attempted to link me (rather poorly) with an anti-gay rights agenda.

Took me a while to figure out what you were talking about; that edit was almost a month ago.  The explanation on the page suggested that making the edit would block the script running the bot from its source, which was the intention.  Blocking the IP it was using as a logged-out bot, which is what was originally done, was causing collateral damage.  All bots are supposed to know that they're logged out and stop themselves (or be able to log themselves back in); the absence of that section of code is a serious matter, because bot editing is restricted to named bot accounts, and is essentially a malfunction.  Just think if someone had blocked the range (which someone was considering doing!), not realizing that it was the WMF Labs - none of the Labs-based tools regularly used on this project would have functioned, and cross-wiki bot activity would also have been adversely affected.  Better than 90% of bots include code that tells the bot how to check if it is logged in, and what to do if it is not, and many that don't require hands-on control. There's no reason for these ones not to include that code. Heck, they can probably swipe it from one of the other open-source coded bots currently in operation.  
I'm also confused by your statement,  was the bot blocked or not? and was it editing logged-in or logged-out? If it was editing logged out, then there's an even more serious problem because it should always need a manual restart after a block.  If it was editing logged-in, then the """"kill switch"""" isn't working.  So, no matter how you look at it, something's not working right.   """,0

(see here for protection policy/information). In general, an admin doesn't need consensus to protect a page when a dispute is ongoing. Is there a problem with my administrative actions?

 """"fringe theory"""" 

The article currently contains the sentence:

 Richard Stallman says that proprietary software commonly contains """"malicious features, such as spying on the users, restricting the users, back doors, and imposed upgrades.""""

This is problematic on various levels:

NPOV - """"neutral point of view (NPOV) means representing [...] all significant views that have been published by reliable sources"""" - Stallman's view is hardly a """"significant view""""
undue weight - """"Generally, the views of tiny minorities should not be included at all""""
It is a Fringe theory / conspiracy theory, backed by absolutely zero evidence (from WP:FRINGE):

""""An idea that is not broadly supported by scholarship in its field must not be given undue weight in an article about a mainstream idea,[1] and reliable sources must be cited that affirm the relationship of the marginal idea to the mainstream idea in a serious and substantial manner.""""

""""We use the term fringe theory in a very broad sense to describe ideas that depart significantly from the prevailing or mainstream view in its particular field.""""

A conjecture that has not received critical review from the scientific community or that has been rejected may be included in an article about a scientific subject only if other high-quality reliable sources discuss it as an alternative position.

""""Care should be taken with journals that exist mainly to promote a particular viewpoint. Journals that are not peer reviewed by the wider academic community should not be considered reliable, except to show the views of the groups represented by those journals."""" - The FSF is clearly an organization with certain political views, clearly not a reliable source.

""""Quotes that are controversial or potentially misleading need to be properly contextualized to avoid unintentional endorsement or deprecation. What is more, just because a quote is accurate and verifiably attributed to a particular source does not mean that the quote must necessarily be included in an article""""

""""The best sources to use when describing fringe theories, and in determining their notability and prominence, are independent reliable sources.""""

 Henry Dunant 

It is well known that Henry Dunant, founder of the Red Cross, was a committed Christian.
The """"Samaritan of Europe"""" began with the aim of being """"more effective in Christian charity,"""" """"to heat up the lukewarm"""" believers, and to """"convert those who had not met God"""" (as stated in the Société; by Henry Dunant). The société quotes him as rejecting the Catholic Church and the State, but embracing the cause of the Gospel, empathethic with primitive Christianity, as well as talking about the prophecies of the Scriptures. In A memory of Solferino he calls """"gracious"""" the self-sacrificing Christian devotion. 
The two sources that claim that he became an agnostic """"in his last years"""" do not point to any original source, nor have any documented quotation of him on the subject. Neither Oscar Riddle nor the NNDB give any reference to an original source to support their claims, which make their assertion unreliable.

It was not a personal attack, but rather a racist remark about Indians in general. No, I did not accuse Anir1uph of being unfamiliar with the English language because he is Indian, his nationality was irrelevant. Anir1uph showed failure to use the English language correctly, common practice among non-native English speakers. I am fed up with uneducated third world citizens who edit Wikipedia according to their own POV. Anir1uph is a pretentious editor and forms fart of a larger Indian demographic who subtly edit Wikipedia pushing their own POV, using weasel words and do not adhere to consensus. There is a growing concern among a considerable number of White Western editors that due to the increased availability of computers and the internet around the world - the number of uneducated third world citizens with a POV agenda to their edits is rising rapidly. Nationalism is a large factor in this and it isn't healthy for the Wikipedia community.

 Is Occupy Oakland ongoing or defunct?  

I concur with 's reversions today on the Occupy movement and Occupy Oakland articles, where other users (possibly vandals) attempted to cast Occupy in the past tense. It's premature to portray the overall movement as deceased. However, solely with respect to Occupy Oakland, this is an issue worth discussing.

Note that the Infobox at Occupy Oakland differs from those on Wikipedia's pages for Occupy movement and Occupy Wall Street, respectively. Occupy Oakland is the only one where the word """"ongoing"""" appears—once on the Date line and again on a separate Status line.

I submit that Occupy Oakland's lack of activity over the past several months suggests that it may now be time to reconsider Wikipedia's use of """"ongoing"""" applied exclusively to Occupy Oakland.

There is currently a small amount of autonomous organizing around two upcoming anniversaries: the group's October 10 birthday and the October 25 riot where Scott Olsen was shot in the head. However, none of this stems from Occupy Oakland collectively or any of its designated committees. It's being conducted strictly by self-appointed individuals. Even allowing that anniversary activities are likely to take place, the question looms: do these constitute evidence of an """"ongoing"""" group or are they merely nostalgic gestures by a few diehard remnants?

 Tremble. 1. to shake involuntarily (as with fear, cold, excitement, fatigue).

 These two expressions are good idiomatic English:
 “If his wrath is aroused, the skies will tremble [in fear].”
 “If his wrath is aroused, the heavens will tremble [in fear].”
 Here the singular “sky” and “heaven” would not be used in good spoken English, only in mediocre written English.

 So we have a choice of eight ‘very good’ literal translations:
 “YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] skies tremble.”
 “YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] heavens tremble.”

 If you try speaking them aloud, you may find that this one sounds best:
 A. “YPG goes walking, and the earth and heavens tremble.” Something about the meter (the cadence) just makes it sound liks a military motto.

 The present-progressive clause “YPG is walking” would naturally correlate with the present-progressive clause “the earth and skies are trembling.” But we want to use simple present tense in the second clause.  (See above.)

 To do so, a native English speaker would begin with “YPG goes walking …”, because it combines both tenses: simple present and present progressive.

 But see whether you can come up with a better-sounding combination!",0

However, vast differences in the relative sizes of pedestrian populations necessitate the existence of several variations to the popular design. 
In the most well-known type, pressing the button when there is no nearby traffic will immediately trigger the walk signal. If there is traffic, it will either allow one to cross at the soonest opportunity or, if sooner, its regular time interval. 
The second type, which is often hard to distinguish from the first, only allows crossings at its fixed time interval. Pressing the button only causes the green person to appear after traffic stops.
The third, and most deceptive type, does absolutely nothing. It is known as a placebo button.",0
"ACT OF VANDALISM BY KRAKATOA KATIE

This person has completely obliterated all of my contributions to the Billy the Kid article. KrakatoaKatie has replaced what had been the most detailed, and accurate, account of Billy the Kid's life that has appeared on Wikipedia so far and reverted to an account that contains absolute garbage. This was done as an act of PURE VANDALISM by a person that has an agenda that has nothing to do with improving the content of this article. Quite the contrary - the clear intent hear was to destroy that article - WITH MALICIOUS INTENT - and replace it with something inferior that takes the treatment back to a comic book level. I ask any board members, editors, and Wild West History buffs associated with

Wait.  You're not going to block me for posting an RFC?

Or did you block me just so that I couldn't go advertising the RFC on other pages where it might be relevant?

See.  There's the problem. As a non-admin, I am liable to be blackballed by admins, some of whom suffer from Projection (or do they merely think sophistry is administration?):

I performed no personal attacks.  I made analogies between admin behavior and classical abuse of power.
I was personally attacked. No admins have been blocked.

I was not trolling.  Calling me a troll is nothing but a lie designed to anger me and cause me to overreact.  It's an attempt to fabricate """"evidence"""" for a block.
At least one admin thinks my being called a troll is enough evidence, because now I am blocked. (And I seriously doubt any admin is reading this page).

I was not disrupting anything and I am not posting in any inappropriate manner.  I was discussing the problem in the forum provided.  Blocking people to stop them from winning an argument is the disruption.

There are 1,7000 admins on this thing.  I have no illusion that all 1,700 of them will be right all the time.  The first 20 who saw Chooserr's postings may have said """"okay by me"""".  It's the first one who comes along who misreads the situation who causes the problem.  One mistaken admin invalidates the opinions of 20 rational ones.  Meanwhile, a well-meaning user is punished for doing nothing wrong, demonized in the community, and the community is thrown into dysfunction.  To the point that anyone coming to their defense is treated with an egregious level of imperiousness, intimidation, sophistry, and dismissive attitude, followed by an abuse of power.

Do not block me.  Block Curps for failing to perform due diligence before injuring a user.  Block Zoe and Mysekurity for validating and amplifying Curps' error rather than taking a skeptical attitude.  Block Nandesuka for repeating the error and then attacking me for defending the oppressed individual.  And block Sean Black for either deliberately or gormlessly falling for their false accusations against me.

The behavior of the admins in this event is a classic abuse of power: a clique of bullies hiding their damage by increasing it.  """,1

Evidence
Admin  was admonished in the  WebEx and Min_Zhu arbcom case """"not to use his administrative tools or give warnings in content disputes in which he is involved.""""   This is evidence of recent involvement in a content dispute, where FM reinserted a WP:BLP—WP:OR—WP:ATT violation (edit summary rv guettarda was correct) without participation in talk. (Furthermore, he  continued this behaviour against another editor in an unrelated issue, which Wales said was not warranted and worthy of a bigger discussion).  He is also  blocking outside the scope of the arbcom decision, even if one incorrectly asserts that I am party to it, including blocking (17 February 2007)  for contributing to (not voting!) a  deletion discussion; this was not an article, and participation is not disallowed.  FM then removed evidence that showed he was acting inappropriately.  He also made a previous block on 20 July 2006, incorrectly citing the arbcom decision of 'associated articles', while first providing no evidence, then false evidence (diff he provided was not to Ken Ham), to justify his accusation and inappropriate block.  (Note that KillerChihuahua removed evidence from that page, claiming that it was posted by a banned user, while no one in that decision was banned from Wikipedia; therefore, the removal was inappropriate.)  

 The reason and contest of the block is obviously that the blocking admin acted inappropriately by placing a block against someone on the 'other side' of a content dispute (and removing evidence by deleting a post that was not his own) in the first place.

 'Assessment' vs. 'diagnosis' 

This section was moved here from /Comments subpage by TalkCs  

I am new to this, and finding my way, so sorry if I get things wrong. I am a British Art Therapist(and a Council Member, British Association of Art Therapists). The art therapy article as it stands is very US based, and there are significant differences. I propose to start contributing to the page with this in mind. My first proposed addition is this, in the section on assessment tools:

'It is important to note however that attitudes to assessment differ internationally. 'Assessment' is easily confused with 'diagnosis'. Because diagnosis is a medical function rather than a therapeutic one, British art therapists tend to resist the implied medicalisation of what is essentially a non medical approach, which concentrates on 'seeing the person, not the label'. The British Association of Art Therapists statement on diagnosis simply states that ‘Art Therapists do not diagnose…' (http://www.baat.org.uk)'

Each of these dynasties (especially the Samanids), and those that followed (notably the Ghaznavids and the Buyids), tended to set up courts adorned with Persian bureaucrats, scholars, astrologers and poets in imitation of the great caliphal court of Baghdad, as enhancements of their prestige, and as a disguise for their tenure of power, which otherwise might have appeared as more nakedly dependent on brute military force.""""

There are further transformations you can do that would reveal the moments, but that would define a different integral transform that is different from the Laplace transform (in fact, for any integral transform we can apply its inverse and then the Mellin transform and get the moments, so this isn't unique to the Laplace transform).

 IQ (girl group) 

 No. You're right. IQ aren't actually signed to Universal Music. I checked UM's website and IQ aren't on the roster. They're signed to WPE Music, LLC,  but their music was still distributed through Universal Music. Does this still make them notable if they are being distributed through a major label, even if they aren't signed to it? Their MySpace states they are on a major label. And by thw way, the reason I didn't to sign my username was because I forgot. Sorry.  4:10 (UTC)

I just wanted to let you know that I've being doing some sluthing on IQ. Here's what I found out: 
1. I e-mailed Public Relations of IQ. I was told that they are signed to Bungalo/Universal, but are having a hard time with the labels.  is their record label, but they are mysteriously not on the roster.  The artists on Bungalo are Carl Thomas, LaToya Jackson, Suga Free, Patti LaBelle, Rodney Jerkins among others. Universal is linked with Bungalo. Bungalo released the girls' debut album, Roll Call.
2. IQ are on Radio Disney's Incubator roster (http://radio.disney.go.com/music/incubator/IQ_bio.html), which would mean that the girls are currently playing on a national radio station.
3. The girls did (and are) on a tour. The tour has mainly been around Massachusetts, but they did tour Los Angeles and New York City. 

I'm not sure if this fits for notability, but if doesn't, then that's okay. If they do, then give me the okay for the article. Take care!  3:41 (UTC)

 East Keswick 

Just a friendly reminder to use an edit summary when proposing deletion for an article.  Edit summary usage is always good, but it is especially important that edit summaries are used when proposing deletion.  The reason for this is that articles proposed for deletion that later have the  tag removed should not be proposed for deletion again, but rather sent to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion.  The only easy way to check if an article was previously proposed for deletion is to look at the edit history and the edit summaries people have left before.  Thanks!  juicetalk

"Another theory of mine owner of this site, the reason why Doug has now appeared out of nowhere, is due to the fact that the other 2 people couldn't revert after a certain point or else they would break this 3 edit rule. Notice how now this fellow Doug has appeared, blocked, then reverted the last edit I made. This I believe is an error of the system. It allows people to collaborate. 

The reality is Roux I suspect has some agenda. Wikipedia must understand that the Trance scene is currently being sidestepped by the House scene in a major way. Mainland Europe as of 2011 has practically lost it's Trance festivals. The rosters on the mainstages are almost exclusively House now. Trance generally has contained since the year 2000 some of the most loyal 'drones' in the dance market. The type of people who dislike anything outside of Trance music. Almost obsessive compulsive types. I suspected this behavior in Pengowl originally also. Then Roux appeared. Both of them would monitor anytime I appeared on the page. Trance followers often dislike much attachment to House, because the House scene has practically overshadowed the whole Trance scene currently, and due to the fact that House came first. This may give a certain editor (Roux) certain agenda's to have cited information silenced or to disqualify a citation. I suspected Roux was a Trance follower from his comments on Paul Oakenfold and also the clues telling me what year he entered the scene. I am guessing 1992 or even later - (Trance scene actually started 1987-1988). There also are other possible motives for deleting my important entry. So once again Wikipedia owner, this is likely the reason why Roux is trying to find some rule or anything he can to prevent that one sentence and those two citations from being included. Why? Because they demonstrate that the earliest published Trance works are actually from the UK Acid House movement - thus one can conclude that Trance had origins from the English House scene - which Trance people would HATE WITH A PASSION ) (Right now the world is to believe that it comes from mainland Europe only - there is zero reference to England, which in fact had one of if not the largest Trance scenes in the early years).

Information is just information. I personally don't have any pure attachment to House or Trance. I enjoy both, but one must speak about the origins. To silence the past is in a way misinforming an entire generation of newcomers to the scene. Few people can speak about the past because those early critical warehouse years were the beginnings of the scene. What may sound like a few years to you, in reality there is a big difference to someone who appeared in the scene in 1987 as opposed to someone who appeared in 1992. It is also difficult for anyone to speak of the origins of Trance without living through classic Chicago House in the 1980's. There is little to no documentation on the early years of Trance. The documentation that does exist is often written from the perspective of DJs or writers who did not live through classic Chicago House therefore it is difficult for them to piece together the past. To speak of the actual catalog releases of the creators of the music is extremely important in my opinion. In fact, the records themselves (the only medium that the art was released through in the early years) are the actual only true un-biased reference to the genre, wouldn't you agree? At the end of the day, Trance doesn't exist in space, it exists in published form contained on a vinyl record. I am not sure why the site would want me to avoid speaking about the creators of that art.",0

 Removal of poorly sourced claims about vegetarianism 

The article currently says, 
The Economist in an article writes that some Uruguayans see him as """"a roly-poly former guerrilla who grows flowers on a small farm and swears by vegetarianism"""", but he is not vegetarian.

The source that claims Mujica is not a vegetarian is dubious; it appears to be an opinion piece by someone who opposes the president's lifestyle.

Alternative Judaism
Zain, I think that Alternative Judaism is a good place to put the disclaimer about other religious groups that claim they are Jews, but I do think it is worth looking at the links a bit further, since I think you might have misread some of them. Also, remember that there is a difference between claiming descent from the """"Israelites"""" and actually claiming to be practicing Judaism.  Here are the links you keep using to illustrate your points, and that you added to the article:

 Anglo-Israelism  Never claimed to be Jews, they claim that the English are the descendents of the lost tribes of Israelites.  Nowhere on their site do they claim to be Jewish or practicing Judaism. I do not think there is a good argument that these people are Jews in any way.  They can and are identified in the Ten Lost Tribes article.
 Christian Identity  Weird choice.  They hate Jews, look at the text of the article, where they explicitly condemn Judaism as evil. Certainly not an alternative form of Judaism, nor are they Jews.
 Talmidaism  A subset of Christianity, or possibly Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article.
 Nazarene A subset of Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article
 Messianic Judaism  Already in the article that you edited
 Judaizing teachers  Refers to a movement of early Christians, not a current group.  This is like including Jews Harp in the list - it is a reference to a historical label, not a religion.
 Jews for Jesus  Already in the article that you edited
 Messianic Renewed Judaism  A minor subset of Messianic Judaism
 Lost Ten Tribes  Not a religion, but another good place to put these sort of links

"""Read this Article

It all started about 3 months ago. An innocent girl was diagnosed of (curable) kidney cancer at Eko Hospital. All was well from the beginning, she was admitted and went through the operation of removing one kidney (primary source of the cancer). After all the fear for the worse, prayers and the pains she went through, the operations was successful and all was well again. She started gaining back her weight, cracking jokes and doing every continued living normally.

She was discharged from the hospital, and was told to come back in the next couple of weeks to start (radiotherapy treatment) (Doomed)
We all know what radiotherapy involves and there is nothing wrong in the treatment, but the manner the patient was been treated using the new radiotherapy device, with little or know knowledge of how it operates.

She has to go through a one month of the radiotherapy treatment, 6 mins per day. Monday to Friday every week. Now she's lost plenty of weight, loss of appetite, always in pain, vomiting and diarrhea and every radiotherapy symptoms you can think of. By now, the fear in the family is intensely growing.

I believe a patient in that kind of situation should be in an intensive care of the hospital in question, but eko hospital sent her home with some paracetamol. They said, in the next couple of weeks she would be fully okay and they insisted in her continuation of the treatment.

By now, everything you can think of is happening to this little girl, she's as skinny as you can describe it. From time to time she asks if she's going to survive this, and everyone around her said yes based on what they were told at Eko Hospital, one person accidentally said, """"madam I'll tell you the truth, your day is doomed and she will not make it, just take her home and pray for the rest of her life."""" patient mother confronted the doctors with this matter and they said that """"the head nurse that shared that information does not work in their department and knows nothing about what she's talking about"""".

To cut the very long story short, on the 2nd of October, yesterday, she has to be rushed into the hospital, she said """" I don't want to stay at home, I want to be in the hospital, I believe I will be okay when we get to the hospital"""" When they got to the nearest hospital to their home, they refused her why, because they do not have loads of cash at hand at that moment in time, they progressed further to the next hospital where they required instant deposit as well. Then finally progressed to a further hospital where instant cash is also required.

She herself begged the last doctor, because she doesn't want to go home. Now the time is 1.am all at home trying to make this poor girl comfortable as she was in pain all over, this is a very bright 19 year old girl for God's Sake. 2 am, now she's now twitching all over, and mumbling some word we do not understand. the last sensible sentence she made was """"you, you, you have new clothes, I'm happy for you o, I will tell my daddy and my mummy they will buy clothe for me too""""

They had to rush her to EKO Hospital, at the early hours of the morning, like about 4.30 am, right outside the hospital she was confirmed dead!

She'll be buried today Wednesday, October 2007. Another potential Nigerian youth gone.

Although, she's gone, I want you guys to know that this is something that can happen to anybody. Though cancer is not actually the course of her death, but the treatment given to her and the manner the treatment was used.

Key Points
Misleading Information by eko hospital to patient family
throughout this ordeal, only 1 blood transfusion was done.
On her death certificate primary course of death """"Malabsorbtion"""" secondary course of death """"renal failure"""" Note not cancer.
This is poor negligence, this girl would have been alive if not for the negligence.

I want the medical lawyers in this forum to shed some light, at the moment, take me as a very angry man, because the 19 year old angel is my baby sister.

Update1
At the burial ground a doctor had to be called out on emergency, because when her friends asked to open the casket to see her face for the last time, she was sweating. All hope high again, like there's going to be another miracle of the century, we were all confused and wondering why someone confirmed dead will be sweating.

Though we'd thought that it's possible because' she'd just been brought out of ice,  But when a doctor arrived he reconfirmed her dead, and he said that the sweating is possible due to some reasons he mentioned, 

Anyway we've buried her now, but another question arises, was she actually dead or unconcious when they confirmed she was dead?, Cos the staff that",0
"Enough, these bands need to go Vol. 1 

Since someone can't just listen and understand the music, I guess it has to be done the hard way. There are plenty more that can go, but I'll start with one set.

Funeral For a Friend - the band themselves even know they aren't emo (says so in the reference), and anyone that listens to them knows they don't play emo. They don't have emo influences (Deftones, Iron Maiden, Get Up Kids) and they never played/toured with bands in the emo scene. They're nothing more than one of those melodic/post hardcore bands with the 00's decade sound.

Hawthorne Heights - see above. Same thing, no matter if it's as HH or when they were called A Day In the Life.

Ida - first of all, that reference does not even mention Ida as being an emo band. It says folk. And if you actually listen to Ida, it is nothing more than indie/folk music. Just because the guy was in The Hated doesn't mean it's emo. They never belonged here, and nowhere on their wiki page does it mention emo.

Joan of Arc - similar thing to Ida. Yes they had members of Cap'n Jazz, but they took a different direction from their old band and were playing indie rock.

The Juliana Theory - stunned that they would even be mentioned (or maybe not, given some others). Not only could you not find an influence of emo in their sound, but they're really a lot closer to the alternative scene you'd hear on any radio station than even being mentioned in the indie or pop-punk groups. Solid band, but nothing to do with emo.

Lostprophets - already mentioned somewhere around here. One little blurb by some guy that doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't count. This band never had anything to do with emo. Not saying they're a horrible band (because that's not the point). They just don't belong on a list of emo bands.

I'm obviously going to stay out of the content arguments so as to remain neutral.  However I did want to say that it is pleasing to see the different sides here working collaboratively towards a compromise.  It seems there has already been agreement from the main parties that a section is justified even if significantly shorter than before which seems to be a huge improvement from the time of the RfC.  This back and forth with concrete proposals and commenting only on the issue at hand rather than the editors themselves is the way forward and probably has the best chance of reaching a compromise.  If a compromise can't be reached then at least there should be better defined questions for an RfC.  If it is felt necessary to start another RfC to break a deadlock can I suggest that interested parties try to reach agreement on the RfC statement before posting it as this will be more likely to lead to a solution that everyone accepts even if it's not the one they desire.  I'd like to suggest that editors refrain from commenting on other editors and accept that they have different views.  If a compromise can't be reached on an issue I would suggest that the way forward may best be for the sides to admit this before temperatures get too hot and to leave that question for a later RfC once a full list of disagreements had been reached.  I'm in no way dictating this way forward and if the parties agree to a different way forward that will likely be better still.  I'm just trying to suggest ways to avoid what happened before.,0

Different set of rules for different users

Hi, Romaioi. I have read your talkpage and I see that you have suffered a very sad experience, similar to the one that has banned me and others. I am user:Marygiove and I totally agree with you about what you write in your """"special archive"""". At least you can console yourself thinking that you now are not banned, while others like me have no such a """"luck"""". My only crime? To live in the metropolitan area of Miami (nearly 3 million people!) and so my IP is similar to the one of other italian users banned from wikipedia and who live here, like user:Brunodam and user:Cherso.  Anyway, as you wrote in your """"MFD Link"""", it is clear that Jimbo's rules are not followed and that there are """"different set of rules for different users"""", specially if there are nationalistic groups (like some  Croats who hate Italians) that pressure some admins to accept ONLY their POV on issues about the croatian Dalmatia.  I don't know if you are able to read italian, but may be you would be interested in accessing this website ( brunodam.blog.kataweb.it/2008/10/18/altri-commenti-sul-diniego-dellasilo-di-zara/), where some italians name you as an example of what is """"rotten"""" in the english wikipedia about impartiality of some admins dealing with italians and croats.

BTW, do you know that all the mess you have gone trough was started by one of the group of the nationalistic yugoslavians, named user:AlasdairGreen27?  He promoted the ban (with another of the group named Direktor) of an article about the """"Italian mare nostrum"""" written by Brunodam, and when you copied some sections of it in another article he believed you were Brunodam (or GiovanniGiove or Pio). In the section """"It is Bruno """" you can easily read that Noclador is convinced by this Alasdair that Brunodam is Romiaoi and/or  others (http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AlasdairGreen27&diff;=prev&oldid;=230773625#It.27s_Bruno_:-.29).  In other words, the astute Alasdair throwed the stone and then waited for Noclador to do all the fighting for him! This trick has been done by the croat group even other times with other persons: it is a trick used many times by the Tito propaganda agents and modelled from the Stalin KGB. And it seems to work well, seeing the fight that has happened between you and Noclador. Sincerely. Marygiove.""",0

Hi,

I think that you should reformat User:Shanes/Why tags are evil#The vandalism protection tags (or at least the idea) into some sort of proposal to reformat multiple distracting protection tags to less distracting corner icons; for example, redirecting  to  (well, probably move the later to the former, for this case). The corner icons work beautifully, are much less distracting, and clicking them will follow you to a page explaining what the lock is for.

I fully agree that the large box with text is very distracting and unnecessary. This is especially true when non-user Wikipedia users read the articles, which probably constitutes the majority of Wikipedia readers. They probably don't care that they can't edit the article, nor would they, and of most concern—they may confuse the tag with the article content.

"Restoration of John Sarkisian 

Hi,

I'm writing in the hopes that you will restore the Wikipedia page for John Sarkisian. Here's the red link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sarkisian

Sarkisian is Cher's father (her given name was Cheryln Sarkisian), and he's noteworthy to anyone who wants to link Cher to her Armenian heritage. He was, by most accounts, not the best father figure, but that doesn't diminish the effect he had on Cher's childhood, and more importantly his role as her connection to Armenia. To this day, Cher speaks Armenian because of him, and her philanthropy to Armenia wouldn't exist if he was not her father. Information on Sarkisian is hard to come by on the web, and the Wikipedia page in question was one of the few resources available. If you could restore the page, I'd really appreciate it.

 Effective Steps of Pearls 

I laugh in the face of danger..

Pearls are the only life embodiment gemstones. How to Beat It? GHD White can Help You Make It! Even though peals live longer than people, after the oxidation over years, they will grow yellow from white and slowly lose their luster. This is why there is an idiom of “one getting old like the pearl becoming yellow"""".What is the Future of Excitingly Attractive GHD uk ? God Knows!

In daily life, pearl cannot contact with perfume, oil, salt, alcohol, hair cream, vinegar, and dirt, much less contact with bananas, water and other organic solvents. Furthermore, it is unsuitable to wear the pearl necklace in the most sweating season – summer.

If you don't use them, you can clean them lightly by high level neuter soap or cleanser essence, and leave them to dry completely.It shouldn't be exposed to the sun.

The hardness of pearl is lower, if when the pearl turns to yellow and loses its luster, you can use available from 1% to 1.5% of hydrogen peroxide to bleach, be careful not to bleach too far, otherwise it will lose its luster.

You'd better clean it by sheepskin or delicate flannelette and then you can put it away after wear pearl each time. Do not use the surface paper, because the friction of some paper will wear the pearl.

Don’t use water for cleaning either, because water can enter the holes and will be hard to dry, also, it might make the pearls ferment inside and turn the line into green.

When you wear out a lot of sweat, wet towels can be used carefully and put it back to jewelry box back after natural drying. Occasionally, clean it by fresh-saline water, and keep the moist of pearl.

 Also concerning TheCommish21 

First of all, your statement about the Underground Football League was incorrect.  It is not a fantasy football league.  The UFL is a full-contact, tackle football league based in Macungie, PA, that attracts teenagers (ranging from 9th to 12th graders) from all over the Lehigh Valley.  There are referees, statisticians, an official rulebook, and permenant teams.  It is not just a hobby that was created without any sort of solid foundation.  It's website is growing rapidly, with nearly 6000 hits since the beginning of October.  Merely because it is local and young, does not mean that it doesn't hold a solid enough position in the world to have a Wikipedia page.  Your response to the Perl citation was a weak showing of how the UFL did not deserve a page.  Perhaps there are people who are very interested in football.  They might be interested in seeing how leagues in other areas.  If someone has a vested interest in something, they should be allowed to access information about it.  Isn't that what Wikipedia is all about?

Second, merely because you have a personal vendetta against TheCommish21 does not mean that you have the right to block him and deny his appeal to be unblocked.  And you and WarthogDemon both know that he never referred to you as """"cyberidiots.""""  The term was """"cyber police.""""  I don't understand how you can hold yourself in such high esteem if you are lowering yourself to mocking those whom you have problems with.

Would it be a good idea to break all the material about the impact of the """"Lilith legend ... as source material in modern Western culture, literature, occultism, fantasy, and horror"""" into a new article (that is, break out sections 8, 9,10)? Then this article could focus on the ancient Talmudic and Assyrian components. .ink """,0
""" For example, a prior discussion: The whole story of Frank Dux and the Kumite is a fraud. There is no such thing as the """"Kumite"""" tournament.

Does anyone honestly believe that such a world class underground full contact tournament could have gone on, and there would remain no evidence of it beside Dux's testimony? Anyone who could produce evidence of such a thing would have a million dollar story, but no one has. Wouldn't someone eventually come forward, or one or two fighters maybe speak out against it? What about the families of the fighters? Wouldn't they notice that their loved ones come home with broken bones and missing teeth? Dux himself claims that there were fatalities. In that case wouldn't the families of the dead fighters investigate what happened? Dux further claims that there were spectators gambling in the event (as in the movie), then how could they keep the silence of the spectators for all these years? To this day there remains no video, or pictures or anything to substantiate Dux's claims.

Dux further claims that he holds the record for the fastest """"kick with a knockout"""" at 72 mph. This makes no sense whatsoever. Is there a cop with a radar gun next to ring, measuring the speed of every strike? A 72 mph kick seems impossible, as swords don't even swing that fast. Someone wouldn't just """"jump into"""" such an event either, but they would have training partners, and a record of their fighting career. They would have won tournaments, and fought in other full-contact venues (like ones that actually exist), yet their is no footage or evidence of Dux's participation in such events. He is a martial artist, but nothing like he claims.

The only thing that's been knocked out here is Dux's credibility. Soldier of Fortune magazine exposed his lies about his military career. Using the Freedom of information act they showed that the actual years of his service in the military don't match up with his claims. He could have never served in Vietnam, and was never a special op like he claims. They exposed a picture of him in the military as a hoax, by showing that the ribbons and medals on his uniform are inconsistent with his branch of service. His own response to this is that the uniform was a costume that he was wearing on the way to a halloween party. You gotta be kidding me. Dux sued them for libel and lost.

He also sued Jean Claude Van Damme, saying that he (Dux) had come up with the story for the movie """"The Quest"""", and that Van Damme had made a contract with him for royalties that were never paid. Dux failed to produce any evidence of such a contract, and claimed that the missing evidence was destroyed in an earthquake. Van Damme's lawyer ripped Dux's credibility to shreds, showing that Dux's apartment was not damaged like he said it was, and produced a cast of witnesses to support that Dux is a story teller and pathological liar.

In his book, Dux goes on to make other astounding claims about being a real life James Bond character working for the CIA during the 80's, and many more fantastic tales. The publisher (Harper Collins) pulled the book, and not due to poor sales either. Maybe because they realized they had been duped by this guy, just like the producers of the movie Bloodsport. Just goes to show how little credibility Hollywood has, even when they make the claim that something is based on a true story. 71.233.140.67 (talk) 

    * First, let me say I agree with you. I want to make that clear, because you're not going to like the answer I have to give you. Read WP:TRUTH and one of the first things you will see is: """"Truth is not the criteria for inclusion of any idea or statement in a Wikipedia article, even if it is on a scientific topic. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—that is, whether readers are able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether we think it is true."""" I don't like that. You probably won't either, but that is the state of affairs. Those excellent questions you asked? Those are considered original research WP:OR. If someone else asks them in a reliable source, then we can add that to this article. But until they do, we can't. Although we can all edit here, we don't own Wikipedia. So when Dux disagrees with something and decides to sue, he doesn't come after Niteshift36 (although he might try), he comes after Wikipedia. The standard for biographies of living people WP:BLP is even higher than for articles about the deceased or other topics. I can't, for example say that Mr. John Doe is a lying a-hole on Wikipedia if he is still alive. I can't even say it on a talk page or my own user page. But if a writer in Time magazine does an interview where his former boss calls Doe a lying a-hole, we can possibly include that. There are a lot of people who have asked the questions you did. I",0

Which part did you find to be false? I am thoroughly disgusted with the behaviour here. I am ashamed to say I have had part in any of this project. I never admit it to other people in private life. Methods have to change or WP will die and become known as more of a failure than it currently is known as. Thanks for your soothing words, though. You are off-the-wall and slightly out-of-control but had a big input, I think, and I took it as your sick sense of humour and liked most of it. I wasn't here that long (gab, the stalking harassment suckybaby is screaming now) but I have seen enough to confirm what is being shouted around the Internet about the wiki garbage spewed here.

On a lighter note There are many blogs and websites describing how to remove Wikipedia from your search engine so the garbage doesn't keep appearing mixed in with the real information.

"I had created the sock to (1) upload rare Selena pictures that are not on the Internet, with this advantage no one would suspect it to be non-free (2) I had believed that since I live in Hartford, Connecticut and at the time I was vacationing in Orlando, Florida, I thought that I wouldn't get caught (3) When I was waiting for a review, I believed that my sock would help speed up the process and promote the articles. I really didn't believe I could get caught, however, I did. I am deeply sorry to have the community distrust me again. I have taken a month to think about what I have done and I am sorry to have done this. The first time I did a sock was to promote the Selena Project, however, I was also told about Jonaboy1992 (an old name I had used before I wanted to change it). I didn't know of the rule then, however, I agree that I should have been blocked for the other user I used to help promote the project. Now looking forward, I want to come back and continue to expand numerous articles as I was doing. I had expanded two articles in one day, I also had another Selena fan helping me with the Amor Prohibido page. I was teaching him the ropes of Wikipedia. I don't mind being mentored, however, Robert is the only person who stood by me. The last two came and go. I will admit, that I have some maturing to do if not a lot... however, Wikipedia is a community of people coming together to create a comprehensive site for information. Even though I was working by myself, I did worked well with others such as the GA reviews and translating articles from Arabic Wikipedians. I hope I can come back, I know that my English isn't the best even though I am a native speaker. Not everyone is perfect, and everyone has a strength... my strength is expanding Selena articles. While growing up with a family who had loved her before she was murdered and growing up with my mother who continued to play her songs, I grew to become very intelligent in Selena information. So its very easy to me to expand articles based on her. While away, I was working on several articles on the Simple Wikipedia.

"Pronunciation & Music Definition
electro, e·lec·tro [ i léktro ], electro-funk, e·lec·tro-funk [ i léktro-fungk ]

noun

1. music, Same as electronic music.

2. ELECTRO (music), Electro (also known as Electro-Funk) is an electronic style of hip hop directly influenced by Kraftwerk, Jazz-Funk and Funk records (unlike earlier rap records that were closer to disco). Records in the genre are unabashed about their use of electronic and artificial sounds, taking this technological fetish almost into science fiction with many records about space travel and futuristic dystopias. Timing range is 118 to 135 beats per minute(BPM). Electro is a derivitive of the '[Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, Roland SVC-350 Vocoder, Roland VP-330 Vocoder Plus, Roland VP-330 Vocoder]' Drum machines & Vocoder's Speech Synthesizer. Electro's sound is distinctively synthetic, instrumental, electronic and experimental. Additionally, the 808 drum machines pounding beats and pure sounds were heavily used in Hip Hop, Disco and Funk music. It was very popular in New York City during the early 1980s and late 1970s.",0
"Personally I think many of the disputes could be resolved if we had some consistency in what is and what isn't to be said about politicians, and that is, more than anything, a structural issue with Wikipedia that probably has also been dealt with extensively in other wikis, concerning, perhaps, George Bush.  Perhaps we can should be looking there for guidance as to how the community has dealt with the issue.

Basically what we have is one camp who wants to tar Grant Devine/Brad Wall with (sourced and referenced) bad stuff, but goes and eliminates the (sourced and referenced) bad stuff written about Lorne Calvert and other figures in NDP administrations.  And we have another camp that does the opposite, and an edit war is the ultimate result.",0

It would interfere with DNS, Proxies and anything, including openDNS. It would gain powers from late DNSChanger.

"Epalela fish pond 
 Epalela fish pond

A fish pond, or fishpond, is a controlled pond, artificial lake, or reservoir that is stocked with fish and is used in aquaculture for fish farming, or is used for recreational fishing or for ornamental purposes. In the medieval European era it was typical for monasteries and castles (small, partly self-sufficient communities) to have a fish pond.

History

During the winter, supplying fresh food for a castle garrison was a constant struggle. Although meat would be available from deer parks, this couldn't supply the needs of the whole household. A fish pond provided an elegant solution. As long as there was a natural flow of water into the pond, fish required no feeding and were available all year round. There would usually be a series of ponds, with fish being moved between them as they grew.

By your last sentence, (20:59 30 April) it would seem that we are, perhaps, getting a little closer to nub of our discussion. The article is about his work. The fact that a very large amount of his original work, some 4000 negetives, has survived and been kept together in just two large collections for approximately 100 years is one of the main planks of his notability. The other plank is when and where he practiced. The subjects of his photographs, the people, their clothes, their floating and their static palaces etc. etc. is what is notable.  This collection is a unique, historical, visual record of a long dead era. It is not just a collection of photos of old boats. Kirk was uniquely positioned to photograph a distillation of an aspect of society. That aspect of society existed here and there, now and then, throughout this and other countries. But it came together for a short period each year at Cowes in what I have called a distillation. He did photograph it and his work has remained together, its existence, until recently, known only to a small group.

The trustees of the two collections feel, I am sure, that the photographs are too valuable to be published willy nilly on the internet.  In any event that would be impractical and was not my intention. My plan had been to try to make the collection's scope known. Not as an advertisment but as a dissemination of information.

As an analogy consider the article about a national collection described in page 10 of today's Guardian. The article describes the collection and claims or advocates its importance.  The Collection was started as the Fawcett Library.  Biographical details of Millicent Fawcett are not central to the theme of the article, an account and illustration of the contents of the collection is.   15:00, 1 May",0

 No it WOULD NOT. Some of these programs can be cracked without breaking AES. As Schneier repetitively stated, it is NOT the encryption they're trying to break, it's the implementation of it.

 Your edits to Robert Byrd 

I had to revert your edits to the above article for a number of reasons. First of all, articles must conform to WP:NPOV and be writted from a neutral point of view. This applies to critics of his record and supporters that seek to apologize for his past actions. As per Wikipedia policy, the burdern of proof would be on Byrd's critics, and not the senator, regarding whether or not he is still involved in the Klan. Any such implication without a source that he is still a member would, therefore, violate WP:V. Also, the placing of the comment in the first paragraph would violate WP:LEAD. 

Furthermore, the part about Marshall and Thomas is in fact in the article, as (regardless of what his backers may feel) pertinent to his record and is written according to WP policy. While the comments about the other nominees are arguable, you could, if well-sourced (which wouldn't be hard to do), find a quote from respected conservative civil rights activist Niger Innis that called his opposition to Rice and others """"racist"""". You could say something like """"His opposition to (whoever) was Labled as racist by Niger Innis, a spokeperson for CORE.""""

 UPDATE 

I don't have time for another long post, but I would like to share a site that you can use.  http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/shilohshepherd.htm

This site also includes 

ARBA = American Rare Breed Association
APRI = American Pet Registry Inc.
NKC = National Kennel Club

However, my research has proven that many other """"registries"""" are also selling papers for Shiloh Shepherds!!  These include, but are not limited to .....

Other All-Breed Registries: 

The following is a list of some of the other all-breed registries in existence in North America — Caution should be exercised when dealing with a breeder who registers with any of these registries, especially when the breed is recognized by any of the major all-breed registries listed above. Many breeders use these registries because they are not able to meet the more demanding requirements of the CKC, AKC, or UKC. 

The information shown in quotations was taken directly from the registry's web site and speaks for itself as to the goals of some of these registries. 

American Canine Association (ACA) — """"America's largest veterinary health tracking purebred canine registry."""" — Note: In the """"Find A Puppy"""" section of their website, dog/puppy seekers are referred to pet/retail stores. Very little information is available on the website regarding their goals or mission as a registry. 

American Purebred Registry (APR) — The APR issues registration certificates for dogs and cats. They start a pedigree file with the information the owner sends them. Once APR accepts an application, a registration certificate is issued and the animal is considered registered. APR is a record keeping agency only and does not sponsor dog shows, field trials or competitions of any kind. On the application, the owner certifies that the dog or cat is a purebred representative of the breed. They take the owner's word for it and no proof is required. 

America's Pet Registry Inc. (APRI) — """"An internationally recognized association of responsible pet owners, breeders, distributors, veterinarians, retailers, pet product manufacturers, and other concerned parties dedicated to the humane care of animals, the preservation of quality bloodlines, and the individual's right of pet ownership."""" APRI recently re-incorporated as a for-profit corporation. — The APRI promotes and encourages the sale of dogs and cats through distributors and retailers. """"America's Pet Registry, Inc. was begun as insurance for the pet industry..."""" """"APRI offers free dual registrations on dogs from reputable registration services to professional breeders. We classify a professional breeder as one who has three or more breeding females and who regularly sells puppies in the pet market."""" 

Animal Registry Unlimited (ARU) — Some statements found on the opening page of their website: """"We register all pets and animals."""" """"We guarantee that your pet or animal can be registered with us."""" """"Providing a registry for the development of new breeds of useful pets and animals. Unlike many organizations we encourage the development of new breeds."""" 

Continental Kennel Club (CKC) — Note: This registry is also known as the CKC and should not be confused with the Canadian Kennel Club — These are two completely separate registries.) — The Continental Kennel Club recognizes 450 breeds as purebred. The Continental Kennel Club has a section known as """"Miscellaneous Breed Registration"""" which allows for the crossing of two purebred parents of different breed types to produce hybrid puppies. Registered as MISC/BREED1-BREED2 and isolated from purebred registrations, they are distinguished from other breeds on registration certificates by having """"non-purebred"""" printed on their registration certificates. In addition, the Continental Kennel Club has a section within their club for developing new breeds. Stock used for these breeding programs is listed in the """"Development Class"""". The Continental Kennel Club has implemented a classified section on their site where club members can advertise their breeds. If you have a look at some of the more popular breeds such as the Cocker Spaniel, some of the kennels advertising there include breeders of cock-a-poos and other crosses. The Continental Kennel Club's website provides very little information regarding their goals or mission as a registry. For more information, however, there is a very thorough web page at: Continental Kennel Club FAQ.

 Breton and Picasso 

Your clarification was in order and I thank for that; Breton was, indeed, a Trotskyist and a bitter enemy of Stalin. As you said, this helps to explain his remark to Picasso.

I would make one correction: Breton was a """"Trotskyist"""". From the Wikipedia website http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskyism,  """"In France, 10% of the electorate voted in 2002 for parties calling themselves Trotskyist"""" (my emphasis). I don't think the """"Trotskyite"""" spelling occurs anywhere this Wikipedia page: """"Trotskyist"""" is used throughout, and establishes it as the accepted spelling.

I thought that bit was the most agreeable part.

1. Moved the Hariakhan Baba paragraph above Post-Yogananda Claims. According to that entry Hariakhan Baba taught from 1860 (before Paramahansa Yogananda was born) to 1924 (before the publication of the Autobiography of a Yogi in 1946). People accepted and revered Hariakhan Baba as the Babaji since pre-Yogananda times. The timing of his appearance also coincides with Lahiri Mahasaya's Kriya Yoga initiation from Babaji (1861).

2. Corrected a minor spelling error from Hari Dasa to Hari Dass.

3. Added Roy Eugene Davis' name and book as support for the Mahavatar Babaji/Hariakhan Baba theory. Basically,  to show that there is someone from the lineage of the author of Autobiography of a Yogi who agrees with Dass and (Mahendra) Baba's conclusion. Roy Eugene Davis was ordained by Paramahansa Yogananda himself in 1951. So, for someone like him to agree that this Hariakhan Baba is the same as the Mahavatar Babaji mentioned by his Master and venerated by all legitimate kriyabans from the Lahiri Lineage is not a light matter.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that the 1988 Mercure decision held that Article 110 of the  North West Territories Act determined that Saskatchewan was bilingual.

From the CanLII website:  """"Article 110 embodies procedural rules that give rights to individuals and, in fact, those rules are to some extent framed in terms of rights.  They are language rights or language guarantees as all the cases in this Court from Jones to Société des Acadiens make clear.  Section 110 was not entrenched after the Saskatchewan Act was passed.  This, like the continuation of s. 110, is entirely in accord with the legislative history of these provisions.  Many of the questions raised about the reach of the protections like those accorded under s. 110 have already been determined in recent cases before this Court either under s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867, s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, or ss. 16-18 of the Charter.  All of these provisions are differently drafted but they use similar expressions and there has been a marked tendency to give them a similar interpretation.  Section 110 was obviously modelled on s. 133.  The language rights accorded by s. 110 are substantially the same as those accorded under these other provisions: R. v. Mercure, 1988 IIJCan 107 (C.S.C.), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 234; Paquette v. A.G. Canada and A.G. Alberta, 1990 CanLII 37 (S.C.C.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1103.""""

Counter-Arguments to Criticism

It is important to note, most of these arguments employ one or more logical fallacies. They are often made implying certain claims such as some mystical and unchanging human nature. Other times they are so conservative that they threaten denying what is already possible today, such as organ replacement and robots performing many tasks in an adaptive manner. Some of these arguments use appeals to emotion, not limited to the claim that since there is an inequality between the rich and poor that we should slow down progress. Appeals to emotion such as this deny the fact that transhumanism will alleviate such problems instead of exacerbating them such as making the acquisition of food and knowledge more accessible.

"""
Actually, I don't think it's particularly 'enlightening' at all!  First, the essay implies that a person may be inclined to view a number of edits as coming from 'the same person'.  I view that implication as an example of a 'straw-man argument':  A person builds up an (intentionally weak or flawed) argument, solely for the purposes of knocking it down.  That's not particularly enlightening, except that it reveals that people generally have more luck knocking down a position if they've built it up, specially, just for that purpose.
I view the matter more as an example of a commonality of self-selection:  Consider that if you're at the top of El Capitan (natural rock pillar), you will find (generally) two types of people:   1.  Very rich people who can (and do) hire a helicopter to fly there.
2.  Very capable, enthusiastic, and competent rock climbers.
In other words, you don't find there many people who are both poor and handicapped, merely because of where you happen to be.  (and, if you're actually there, chances are that you, too, are either rich or a very good rock climber.  Wikipedia is, quite likely, a 'magnet' for 'control freaks'.  (and others, obviously.)  I've read comments that some editors make tens of thousands of edits.  While I could say, """"Get a life!"""", I don't view such enthusiasm as INHERENTLY bad, wrong, or a problem.  But, I think there may very well be an ASSOCIATION between OCD-type (Obsessive-compulsive disorder) editing, and 'control-freak' behavior.
There are other clues that must be considered.  A person who is acting out a 'control-freak' fantasy, wants to control as much as possible.  Apparently, WP has made it quite easy to 'revert'  to a previous edit.  That ability is not NECESSARILY bad (against vandals), but it implicitly encourages a kind of 'all or nothing' reaction:  If a 'control-freak' wishes to manipulate, as much (and as many) as possible, it's far easier to simply 'revert' ALL of an edit, rather than (carefully and selectively) remove ONLY as much of a 'problem' as actually exists.  Ever heard an old saying, """"When the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to treat all problems as if they were nails.""""  One of the most 'inefficient' routes, from the standpoint of a 'control-freak', is to actually stick around and dispute the propriety of the original edit, and the characteristics of the 'control-freak's actions. 
A 'control-freak' gets his jollies, most readily, by UNdoing what others have done.  (The 'control-freak' feels, explicitly or implicitly, that he doesn't have to 'justify' the status of the article BEFORE his victim's edit!).  If the 'control freak' must actually distinguish between 'proper' posting and 'improper' posting sections, he becomes far less 'efficient' at manipulating others.  (He must spend far more 'valuable' (in his not-so-humble opinion) time READING, and distinguishing, rather than merely reverting!   Consider a hypothetical 'war' between a person who is making a 'house of cards', and another person who views it as his task to impede the first:  The latter person needs merely show up for a second or two, every few minutes, and knock down the 'house of cards'.  Minutes or hours of work is gone, in a moment!  VERY 'efficient', from the standpoint of the 'control freak', but not for his victim.
 Worse, if the 'control freak' must first obtain a CONSENSUS (something which WP ostensibly requires) he is powerfully impeded from excercising his 'control-freak' tendencies.  (I am not considering, here, raw 'vandalism', of course:  Very arguably, it SHOULD be easy to completely revert actual, genuine 'vandalism'.)  It is not surprising, therefore, that 'control-freaks' are far more likely to simply revert ALL of an edit, QUICKLY, preventing consensus, and refusing to justify it in any actual discussion.
Thus, I notice that (in, so far, every case), every 'drive-by deletion' to which I have been a victim involves a person who REVERTS ALL of my edits (Check!), and not merely a portion of them (Check!) and who does so VERY quickly (Check!), who prevents any sort of consensus from forming (Check!), and who doesn't bother to stick around to debate the propriety of the original posting, or the 'freak's' abrupt erasures (Check!).
  Aha!  Things are getting quite clear, at least from the standpoint of the 'control-freak' in question.  But why should a flock of others try criticize the victim, and NOT the 'control freak'?  Is it because I think 'they're the same person'?  ('Straw-man argument')   Noooo!  Consider another saying, """"Birds of a feather flock together"""".   If there were only a single 'control-freak' in the world, nobody else would have any motivation to assist him, or to help victimize his victims.  But there are many 'control-freaks', and each understands that if ONE 'control freak' gets impeded, prohibited, or criticized, or exposed, the next one COULD BE THEM!  After all, I",0

 Hi Edward. You have a few options. First is to start on the article talk page, which I see you've already done. I know a few days has already gone by, but maybe ping your posting again and see what happens.

"OVERVIEW:

Crunch (AGT Crunch Acquisition, LLC) is a fitness-based enterprise that is focused on making entertainment an integral part of the exercise experience. Established in New York in 1989, today the Crunch brand has 27 locations in 7 major urban centers in the United States: New York City, Brooklyn, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles. As a strategy, Crunch has concentrated on expanding inside of these urban centers: its penchant for innovation resonating especially well with the various demographics therein.  Because of these factors the brand is often associated with descriptors such as “hip”, “edgy”, “urban” etc. and has an air of inherent coolness that the majority of its competitors cannot claim to.

FEATURES:

1)TABGROUP FITNESS CLASSES
Since its inception Crunch has maintained a focus on its group fitness program as the brand’s cornerstone. As such, it has built an extensive catalogue of classes that are characterized by their broad appeal and inventiveness. Numbering in the hundreds, these classes are organized into three different categories: Action Sports, Chill Outs and Dance Rhythms. Examples (taken from the official Crunch website) include:
Urbanathlete (Action Sports)
This circuit-style class is based on Men’s Health Magazine’s Fitness Challenge.  In it you’ll work through obstacles and exercises that were inspired by various cityscapes and come to see just about any sprawling metropolis as a big, concrete playground. 

Antigravity Yoga ‘Wings’ (Chill Outs)
Wings’ will have you stretching further and holding challenging poses longer, using only a fabric trapeze to do so.  And, by employing simple suspension techniques you’ll move into poses that are seemingly impossible.  However, the goal isn’t just to turn you into a human pretzel: those poses will help to relieve compressed joints and align your body from head to toe.

Cardio Dance Blast (Dance Rhythms)
Get your groove on in this sixty-minute class that’s been cleverly disguised as a dance party – one with a soundtrack comprised of the best in hip-hop, reggae and top-forty music.  You’ll melt away fat while bringing your dance skills to the next level and beyond.
In addition, Crunch offers private versions of their classes for small groups.

2)TABPERSONAL TRAINING
Each Crunch location has a staff of personal trainers available to its members for individual or semi-private sessions. Crunch divides these personal trainers into four different categories based on experience and certifications earned. (All of Crunch’s personal trainers are required to have a minimum of professional experience and certifications earned prior to being hired.) Collectively, these trainers have expertise in a broad range of areas. Quoting from the company’s press kit, “All Crunch clubs are staffed with first-rate fitness professionals – personal trainers with certifications in a wide variety of specialties: strength training, yoga, boxing, kickboxing, pre/post natal, kettle bells, physical rehabilitation and much more.”

3) EQUIPMENT
All Crunch locations feature a wide array of fitness equipment produced by the industry’s leading manufacturers: Precor, Life Fitness, Netpulse, Expresso, Icarian, Hammer Strength etc. This equipment is updated with an eye toward keeping current with emerging technologies and trends. For example Crunch is phasing in Life Fitness’ treadmills with built-in iPod functionality. Select Crunch locations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles feature Pilates studios equipped with both Reformers and Wunda Chair Systems and locations in all markets feature Yoga studios. Additionally, certain facilities have more elaborate features: full-sized boxing rings, swimming pools, indoor tracks, basketball courts, saunas, hot tubs and sundecks.  

4) SPECIAL EVENTS AND UNIQUE OFFERINGS
The following is taken from Crunch’s current press kit regarding special events and unique offerings: 


Crunch health clubs are home to a unique fusion of entertainment and fitness, one that we have pioneered from our inception and continue to explore through a number of different channels. In-gym parties and performances (by students of Scratch DJ Academy), an outdoor summer concert series, partnerships with cutting-edge theatrical productions like Spiegelworld and Fuerzabruta and our Broadway Dance Series are all hallmarks of this exploration. Additionally, we’ve developed a number of events that take place outside of our gyms, like field trips (which are held year-round in all of our markets and vary greatly in destination) a",0

In fact it is just the same false accusation he came up with out of nowhere last fall as part of Elonka's failed attempt to become an admin and which directly lead to his sockpuppets being outed. When he made the charges at that time they were found by multiple admins to be completely groundless. He's trying to deceive people by presenting the same, tired old harassment as something new and to failing to mention that he was the one actually using those tactics.  06:12",0

"""

Fine, gentlemen, but as it appears it's only ourselves having this """"discussion"""", allow me to submit this for your inspection, as sent by Turner May 19 to all media, the TPS and its Board (blocked by the latter two) and yes,  Fantino himself, in response to the latest headlines. If you ever change your minds...

Original to Leo Kinahan, counsel for Sgt. Jim Cassells

Mr. Kinahan:

Having discovered how sensitive you are about your e-mail address, note that I have included you as a BCC to protect your privacy. As I have been battling with the media ever since my saga began, I am only including them, at this time, in the hope that - considering the recent brave actions of your client and the resultant headlines which have followed - they may, finally, be forced to recognize my plight and resultant complaint since it all began.

As briefly as I can describe it, I was set up by 55 Division in November of ' 98 with a manufactured charge of Criminal Harassment as a favour to their local coffee hangout in my then-neighbourhood, to obviate potential civil litigation I had against it and the parent chain, Second Cup Ltd..Come trial the following year and representing myself, I went to court with 39 witnesses, several exculpatory documents and more. 

As a result of my actions and an airtight defence, the """"complainant"""" - who had been sexually servicing at least one 55 cop (John Maciek) - and two of my defence witnesses associated with the coffee franchise were paid to, respectively, take and avoid the stand.

When this was articulated by myself, the original two arresting officers, Paul Scudds (immediately afterwards appointed by Fantino to Internal Affairs, itself) and Sheila Richardson, attempted to smash through my door without cause or warrant, causing me to secure counsel, ostensibly for my own protection, in the person of Lorne Honickman.

Where I lose all of the media, in their zeal to protect one of their peers, is the fact that Honickman took a bribe from Second Cup CEO  Michael  Bregman to throw the trial and protect their """"good name"""", which resulted in his: excluding every one of my witnesses; ordering transcripts to be altered by a Ministry of the A.G. court reporter - who then bailed on both her employer and her apartment and went into hiding, along with her sister/fellow A.G. employee, who resided elsewhere; refusing to admit documents and evidence to prove my innocence and more.

After dismissing Honickman - but still having to return to court to continue the trial - I received a phone call, at home, on Friday, January 7, 2000, from 55's John Graham, informing me that I would not make it to College Park alive with the evidence of all that I put before you now.

Thirty-six hours later, just after 10:00 a.m. on January 9, the threat was made good when a dozen cops from the division assembled themselves outside my door - armed with billy clubs, black leather """"beater"""" gloves and cell phones - with the stated intention (taped phone messages retrieved after my too-narrow escape) of killing me.

Since then, I have run the entire gamut of the complaint system, including three cops I was publicly handed to by Fantino at his precious """"Town Hall"""" meetings: Stu Eley, Wayne Cotgreave and Mike Trimble ( stu.eley@torontopolice.on.ca, wayne.cotgreave@torontopolice.on.ca,  mike.trimble@torontopolice.on.ca).

Prior to - and after - this, upon my own initiative, were Bryce Evans (bryce.evans@torontopolice.on.ca), Dave Mcleod (dave.mcleod@torontopolice.on.ca) and Steven Pipe (steven.pipe@torontopolice.on.ca); all of whom have had the displeasure - or more, the sadistic pleasure - of dealing with/blowing me off - and who disappeared behind voice mail forever after, as did the others, plus every one of the usual suspects in Pro Standards ( jane.wilcox@torontopolice.on.ca, john.knaap@torontopolice.on.ca,  rick.gauthier@torontopolice.on.ca)  that I was referred to and others, including Scott Gilbert of 55 Division     (scott.gilbert@torontopolice.on.ca), whom I was forced to cooperate with by the OCCOPS and provided a gruelling, eight hour video taped statement, only to have same outright ignored - and my complaint dismissed - by the latter.

During your client's original investigation, I actually contacted  RCMP Supt. John Neily and asked him to include my situation in the mix, as Fantino was bleating about rooting out """"perjury and corruption"""" (I was subject to both during my trial) and we cooperatively communicated for eighteen months, only to have - come the moment of truth -  Neily regretfully inform me that he'd been ordered to drop my case.

Now, if you'll allow me to quote from the most recent media reports...

"Au contraire, this is absolutely a question of opinion; namely, yours and mine.  It's interesting that, as a highly experienced Wikipedia user, who seems to relish his ability to quickly attack a newbie whose edites he does not agree with, through the use of the various nuances in Wikipedia (including your accusing me of 'vandalizing', being a 'sock puppet', and whatever ever else you could use to demean and harm my editing efforts from the very first edits I tried to make  including continuously deleting my edits, and then when I innocently put them back in each time you deleted them, labeling me as violating some rule about not replenishing a page more than 3 times in 24 hours, or something like that.)  that after all this, you still aren't satisfied.  You falsely accuse me of some nevarious connection to a website I linked out to, which is clearly not a commercial site.  Just because you tell a big lie, even over and over, does not make it true.  (That trick only works for Republicans =) ) As I said, we'll have to agree to disagree, and let others come to their own conclusions.  I don't want to argue with you about your behavior anymore. It's not what Wikipedia is for.

Let's discuss the merits of the information contained on the page we're here to talk about.  Or, if you aren't an expert on this subject, and cannot make a meaningful contribution in that regard, then maybe you can move on to another subject, where you have some expertise, and let those of us who are more familiar with the subject, discuss it unhindered with your technical maneuverings.

What say you?  Can we lay down the hatchet and move past this?",0
"""

Let's put it this way Flo, everyone has talked past me here for months. It is absolutely frustrating to have everything I contribute get labeled as """"disruptive."""" Disruptive, how? Tedentious, how? I sure as heck don't feel that I have done so because as far as I'm concerned I've acted in good faith trying to make Wikipedia the best it can be.

If you want to explain the rules to me and how I can be who I am on Wikipedia and stay within the rules, I'm all ears. I just want FM to leave me alone. How would you feel if you were new on a site and everything you did was declared illegal by people who disagree with you when there is a pretence to neutrality without any explanation?

If you have done such a good job explaining everything to me, then why do I feel that I've been ganged up on without just cause? I know a lot of people who feel that Wikipedia has a definite bias when it comes to politics and religion that's not very positive.

Why not listen to me? What do you all have to lose? My faith is the core of my being, and it's who I am. Do you expect me to junk my worldview to contribute to Wikipedia? Have any of you stopped to consider how your own worldviews contributes to how you interpret the rules?

Do you care how ordinary readers view Wikipedia? You probably do, or else you wouldn't be here. The fact is traditionally minded Christians number over 1 billion people on this planet, and close to 100 million in the United States alone. That's not some tiny crackpot minority out there. If I feel attacked by Wikipedia, or feel that my POV is misrepresented, how do you think they feel reading Wikipedia?

Let's face it here, factually, the perspective represented in the articles in the Dominionism series, from my perspective, seem to overemphasize the views of a small minority in the United States regarding the Christian Right. 

Why should my work be reversed when I elaborate on the Dominionist's POV, which BTW, I don't agree with, for the sake of ensuring fairness. Or when FM, removes something I wrote from a reputable Evangelical ministry critical of Christian Reconstructionist theology? He tells me it's false or that I'm POV pushing. HOW? I cited the sources, which are widely respected in Evangelical circles.

What am I supposed to think when 2/3s of the article is devoted to the opponents of the Christian Right, who by the way are a minority of the total American population. Bush won twice because of their support and elected the GOP to Congress and a majority of the statehouses. 

Katherine Yurica's and TheocracyWatch's POV represents a MINORITY of the population. I have no idea where you live. Perhaps their perspectives are popular among your friends, but they don't represent the larger picture. How is writing from the majority perspective POV pushing or giving undue weight to my perspective, considering it's the perspective of just a little over 50 percent of the American population.

I suggested banning partisanship as part of the NPOV rule and Consensus rule, but FeloniousMonk reverted my changes that had been made by a previous editor. When he does that, what am I supposed to think about his motives? I don't know him, and he hasn't exactly been the most friendly person to me since day one. 

Have you ever stopped to think, it's not what you say, but how you say it? The tone from yourself and the other admins has kept me on the defensive, and what am I supposed to think, other than what I've said ad nauseam? I feel attacked, not consulted with.

So far, I feel that no one has explained anything about their perspectives to me except for what comes across on my screen in my mind as person attack. Things like WP:POV, WP:POINT etc., that get put up when I feel that I have done nothing wrong comes across as a personal attack instead of.

Could you consider rephrasing it this way, or this is how you should be doing this. That's constructive in my view. 

Instead of hurling rules at me, the interpretations of which I disagree with, tell me why you think I stepped over the line and your rationale. I react positively to reasoned explanations, not summary reversals of my work, accusations of POV pushing, etc., without explanation.

Maybe you've been at this for awhile, so you take things for granted. I simply go to the rulebook and fail to see where all of you are getting your opinions from. Interpretation my friend. I want to understand your interpretation, and why you interpret the rules the way you do.

Every time I do anything, from asking people what they think about the rules, or my ideas for improving Wikipedia, I get written up on this RfC. Flo, please don't take this personally,  
90 percent of the time, I simply forget to login, not thinking there is any problem with my editing without logging",0

 Article 

Hi Craddock1. Please chill out and take a step back for a moment. I have considered blocking you for a bit to stop the disruption you are causing, but I feel a final plea is a better bet for now. On Wikipedia we have an important guideline of """"Comment on the content, not the editor"""". Your very first contribution to that AFD is to attack the nominator, and it has gone downhill from there. All you are really doing is undermining the AFD in a way which will not benefit you. Take a moment to step back, consider how you could marshal an argument to explain how the article meets Wikipedia's notability criteria, and continue with a reasoned explanation in the deletion discussion. Continuing with your current behaviour will end up with you being blocked. Errant (chat!) 

Hi Errant,

Thanks for your message and sorry if I seemed a bit frustrated,

It seems as if the nominator has tried to sabotage many articles on wikipedia talking to other admins and editors. The whole point is that the ADF should not even be there and yet it remains because the nominator has a 'higher standard within wikipedia' than me - which I find unfair.

If you read the comments in the AFD you will see they are mainly to keep or strong keep the article.

Nevertheless the nominator has tried to make things difficult by issuing a sockpuppet investigation despite me admitting my fault and promising not to do it again.

I hope you can close the AFD so we can move on.

Once again since i'm new to Wikipedia I hope you will not block me but please also see things from my point of view

Best,

Philip, London, UK""",0

Since then similar efforts have been organized for other 2008 presidential candidates.[citation needed]
Sample comment: This seems to be a fine summary statement, reliably sourced in the article such as by UPI. We can just copy the footnote refs to it.   
The popular usage of """"moneybomb"""" to describe a coordinated mass donation drive for a political candidate can be traced to a weekly donation drive, the Ron Paul Money Bomb, which aimed to raise $1 million each week for Ron Paul's presidential campaign.[2][citation needed] (Daily Paul)
Jesse Elder, a New York City jazz pianist,[3][4] registered the new identity """"RonPaulMoneyBomb"""" at YouTube;[5][citation needed] (New York Times, All About Jazz, YouTube)
Eric Nordstrom then registered the identical .com domain.[6][citation needed] (Network Solutions)
Supporters of Mike Huckabee organized a moneybomb on November 20 to commemorate International Children's Day, which raised nearly $225,000, well over the pledged amount, bringing Huckabee's monthly total to $1 million as of November 20th.[11][citation needed] (Nov20ForTheChildren)
Supporters of Dennis Kucinich's presidential campaign are also using the term """"moneybomb"""" to describe their own major fundraising drive aimed for December 15, 2007, the anniversary of the Bill of Rights coming into effect.[12][citation needed] (News and Policy)
Proposed on November 6 on Daily Kos, the drive has an ultimate goal for 100,000 pledges of $100.[13][citation needed] (December152007)
Kucinich supporters are using viral advertising techniques to promote the drive by putting up YouTube videos and circulating them throughout the web.[citation needed]
Along with generating a significant amount of donations for a political candidate, a moneybomb can also generate significant media interest in a largely unknown candidate.[citation needed]
In addition to the media coverage, the November 5 drive was able to get 21,000 new donors to the campaign, over half of the donors on that day.[18][citation needed] (AP)
While there is no definitive link, after November 5, Ron Paul saw a measurable rise in the polls, showing the potential ability for a moneybomb to improve a candidate's place in a political campaign.[20][21][citation needed] (TransWorldNews, NBC4)""",0

About the catholicism in Somalia, here it is the exact words in the Tripodi book:""""Il vescovo di Mogadiscio, don Franco Filippini, dichiarava nel 1940 che vi erano circa 40.000 Somali cattolici, frutto del lavoro missionario specialmente nelle aree agricole del Giuba e dell'Uebi Scebeli"""" (my translation: the Bishop of Mogadischu, Franco Filippini, stated in 1940 that there were nearly 40,000 native Somalians of catholic faith, consequence of the missions mainly in the agricultural areas of the rivers Juba and Schebelle). If we add that there were 22,000 Italians in Somalia in that year and the aproximate population of Italian Somalia was calculated in 750,000 (there were no exact census), we have to agree to what writes Tripodi: 62,000 catholics in Italian Somalia (to whom we have to add the temporary Italian troops stationed in forts), or nearly 10% of the total population of 750,000. Of course there are other calculations of the 1940 population of Italian Somalia without the Ogaden, but most scholars agree in the 750,000 - 800,000 range.

I have written that 'The Italian Embassy calculated in 1993 that most Italian colonists used to have illegitimate children with Somali women and this fact has created a group of Italian Somalians with Italian roots, that now amount to nearly 50,000 descendants in all Somalia', because in page 38 Paolo Tripodi wrote the following:L'ambasciatore italiano considerava l'uso del concubinato un serio problema durante gli anni della colonia. Un problema che aveva generato -secondo lui- quasi 50.000 Somali con almeno un nonno o bisnonno italiano negli anni novanta. (my translation: the italian ambassador believed that the wide practice of concubinage during the colonial years had created the problem that nearly 50,000 Somalians had at least one grandfather or a greatgrandfather Italian during the nineties).

 WikiProject Ireland 

  Participants are requested to VOTE each month for their choice of Showcase Article and Showcase Picture.It only takes a minute - please participate!  

 Scope and Motivation 
Some Wikipedians have formed a project to better organize information in articles related to Ireland.  This page and its subpages contain their ideas; it is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of other Wikipedians.  If you would like to help, please inquire on the talk page and see the to-do list there.

The vast majority of this project was unashamedly ripped from another project: Wikipedia:WikiProject The Beatles, and the  of this project extends recognition for the tireless work involved in formatting, text, policy and many other aspects by ,  and himself.

For more information on WikiProjects, please see Wikipedia:WikiProjects and Wikipedia:WikiProject best practices.

This project has been created in an attempt to improve existing articles relating to Ireland, and to help with the creation of needed articles. It aims primarily to provide information in consistent format for articles on places in, or related to Ireland.  On top of this, it aims to get the main Ireland article to featured status, whilst aiding the maintenance and improvement of the Ireland Portal.

 Northern Ieland has a population of approximately 1.7 million.

 One of the greatest aids in this project for assessment and improving of articles, are the  logs found here Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Ireland articles by quality/1 and here Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Ireland articles by quality/2. Please take a look at the entries there as it will guide you on which articles need assessed, and will also guide you as to what might be necessary to improve individual articles.

Articles and categories relating to Ireland are extensive and work needs to be/is being done across a multitude of areas.  In order to gain the benefits of collaboration, please update this page with any relevant """"to do""""s.

Recent developments

 Belfast has been successful as the Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography's collaboration of the month. For anyone who's interested in helping to get the article up to FAC standard, there are many resources and a guide available on the UK Geography Project page.

 This Ireland Project is currently being re-vamped in line with the Belfast one.

 Belfast has been nominated as the UK geography project's collaboration of the month. Please feel free to comment and add your vote of support.

The version that you keep reverting to is at least as anti-contra as the other version is """"pro-contra."""" The irony is that while the Sandinistas themselves have been willing to admit their errors and have reached out to win the votes of former rebels and their sympathizers, some of their foreign supporters seem to be stuck in their circa 1986 vision of Nicaragua. Some Wikipedia editors are holding to views about the contras that even the Sandinistas don't believe anymore.

For instance, while pro-contra editors like to emphasize the role of the MILPAS, anti-contra editors prefer to emphasize the role of former Guardsmen. Yet even Envio, in its February 1987 review of the contra war, noted that Dimas' MILPAS rebellion was """"the most serious episode"""" of the early part of the war.

On the other hand, your favored version reads that """"many members"""" of the old Guard were involved in forming early groups like the 15th of September Legion. But even writers who were hardly pro-contra, like Christopher Dickey and Roy Gutman, have noted how tiny these groups were.

I've been reluctant to touch this article, fearing that I would just be getting involved in a quagmire. However, I don't think I can remain on the sidelines anymore.  T | C """,0

As was predicted by the users who brought me into the discussion,  has employed his moderator lackeys to ban anyone who is critical of his vandalism.  is not above the rules of Wikipedia. It makes one wonder why he is such a proponent of not allowing anonymous users to post at Wikipedia. It's probably one's only recourse after being unjustly banned by his moderators. .   

Another moderator has abused his or her powers to ban a user who is simply inquiring about why  continually harasses users who do not share his point of view. Removing this inquiry is in itself a violation of WP:VAND. Please do not continue to remove this legitimate question.   

  

Please Stop Removing Warnings.  

Why do you continue to vandalise your own user page? Please leave user comments on this page. How can you rationalize that this inquiry is a """"personal attack""""?   

 I think it is a personal attack, because you have singled out Nescio out of at least four editors who disagree with you emphatically. Nescio has shown good faith here, and your efforts to get him banned because he disagrees with you do not reflect well on your own good faith.  

In reality, quite the opposite is occuring. My efforts are focused on the goal of exposing  abuse of moderators good intentions in order to get others banned who do not share his point of view.  

Oh, and, just out of curiousity, WHY IS THIS NOT ON NESCIO'S USERPAGE?! Can someone reasonable please get it OFF the police state discussion?  

The reason why this is not on nescio's user page is because he keeps deleting it in violation of WP:VAND policy. This issue also pertains directly to this article since at least four users have been harassed and banned by Nescio's false accusations concerning this article. Ask him why he continues to delete this question about his """"edits"""".   

 Actually, I'd like to ask you why you (a) persist in disruption of this page and (b) won't sign in and insist on using so many open proxy IP addresses?  

(a) This is not a """"disruption"""" of this page. This discussion pertains deirectly to anyone who wishes to edit this article because if they edit in a manner that  does not agree with, they will likely be harassed and banned by Nescio and his false accusations. People should be outraged that users and/or moderators are abusing thier powers. (b) If I were to sign on under my username, it would most certainly be banned in short order. I wish to see this issue resolved for all parties involved, but I am not willing to risk my status as an editor because of Nescio's frivilous accusations.  """,0

 A Floppy Version? 

I deleted the lines in the article which referred to The Dig being released on floppy.  While my recollections of 12+ year old games may be slightly rusty, I am virtually certain that The Dig was only released on CD-ROM.  Given the amount of work (and money) put into the voice acting and pre-rendered cinemas, it would have been insanity to try to make a floppy version. (which would have required even MORE work coming up with static screens to cover the missing movies)

There was a 30-meg or so demo released around 1994 which could have, with compression, probably fit on 12 floppies.  That's likely what the editor was thinking of.  If someone can come up with concrete information on the demo's release, it would be a good addition into the """"release"""" section.

Rather than keep the poor structure, and use that poor structure as justification for excluding the pronunciation, I favor correcting the the lede.

For this article the title and opening bold text do not match, which is unusual, and as a result other aspects of the opening paragraph will necessarily be affected.",0

It certainly seems to be trending towards Begley's view that it's a manufactured controversy with no substance to it. I suggest taking Begley out of the lead, and out of the article altogether for now, and then re-adding her view as part of a summary of post-Muir Russell opinion.",0

I understand what you mean, but there has been a misunderstanding (my fault for sure). I didn't call """"ignorant"""" in the same meaning of """"moron"""".

 I've done a mild copyedit.
 Where does the term 'Canoe River' come from?
 I would have liked to know more technical details about the accident; for instance, what type of rolling stock was being used? Of course, if no such information is available...
 The quote regarding the bar examination, is that just an example, or is that the whole examination?
 To me, the whole trial section is POV; I get the impression that the article has taken side with the defense in the case. In part this is because the article goes quite in detail with the defense' arguments, but lacks a similar listing of the crowns'. It does not help the matter that two of the main sources can be said to be quite pro-Diefenbacker.

 Waiting period for autoconfirm is too short 
This doesn't directly deal with the pages the info is on, but rather with those who are editing the pages, and looking at the behaviour of the editor.

One of the things that keeps coming up is the sense of how overly easy it is to get autoconfirmed.

I think (and partly based upon an rfc concerning this) that we should change the 4 days/10 edits to 7 days/20 edits.

The """"urge"""" to edit in a way that may be deemed inappropriate (vandalism, etc.) can be cooled at least some.

I've found in dealing with such people, that once a person has to wait past their weekend (whatever days that might be), the urge is often gone and forgotten - typically replaced with other impulsive urges. And many editors have a 5 day school week or work week.

So simply increasing the number of days requirement from 4 to 7 might do wonders, and wouldn't affect those positive editors overly much (especially since admins can now give """"autoconfimed"""" out ahead of time at their discretion.

And this would help directly deal with the question about the usefulness/effectiveness of semi-protection might be on low traffic/watched pages. -  
I think it should be an AND requirement, not an OR.  Make them wait AND contribute in the meantime by editing first.  And ensure the 20 edits (count in mainspace only) aren't reverted or deleted.  Yes it may slow down the new page creation... but is that a problem?  
I agree with the idea of raising the threshold for autoconfirmation. Wikipedia talk:User access levels/RFC on autoconfirmed status required to create an article closed in January this year so you could reraise it, but I think I know what the result would be. Increasing the threshold or making it and not or or only measuring mainspace edits would in my view have a better chance of success. ''SpielChequers'' """,0
"Twisted Facts

1. Wal-Mart does not spend as much on insurance as other companies.

The fact. Yes Wal-Mart spends less per work for health.

The Twist. What they forget to say is that Wal-Mart does not buy insurance at 
all, it puts that money into a bank account, where it collects interest, it then contracts Blue Cross to admin the fund. 

The reality. Wal-Mart gives better insurance than most other retailers. 
Want to see for yourself go to your local walmart and get an assocate guide.

2. Wal-Mart does not supply as many with healthcare.

The fact. Yes on a percentage base Wal-Mart only 47% are covered.

The Twist. What critics don't tell you is that Wal-Mart offers Star Bridge health from day one, and that wal-mart has 1.6 million Workers with a larger turn over rate, so this leads to a lower percentage of works covered.

3. Wal-Mart has a high turn over rate.

The Fact. Wal-Mart does have a high turn over rate.

The Twist. Critics Site Wal-Mart as the reason, however most of people that leave walmart site customer related stress. And the area of walmart that has the highest turn over is also the largest pool of workers, cashiers. Plain and simple the customers run the cashiers out. And who can blame them think of all the people in the world you could not stand, and they deal with them all everyday.

4. Wal-Mart has more workers on state healthcare than any other company.

The Fact. Yes wal-mart does have more works on state healthcare.

The Twist. Critics argue that due to the number of workers on state healthcare is single handedly causing problems for many state healthcare,however what they forget to say is that Walmart pays 70 Billion dollars in federal taxes and nearly that again in state taxes and also generate billions of dollars in sales tax for each state with sales tax,which far out does the money spend buy the state on healthcare for wal-mart assocates. And many of the assocates that quilify for state aided healthcare also would quailify for welfare if they did not work for walmart. And would most likely be on both if they worked for a smaller ma and pa shop, that could not afford to supply any benefits. 

5. Wal-mart buys large quantities from china

The Fact Yes walmart buys a lot from china.

The Twist Critics argue that Walmart alone is the primary reason for US jobs being exported, however what they fail to say is that walmart is only 8% of the use Retail market, and 70% of walmarts income if from food sales and 90% of walmarts food supply comes from local and national suppliers, like con-agra. When broken down walmart sends a mear penny to china out of ever transaction. something much larger than walmart is helping china out. 

Now these are just 5 of the biggest twisted facts, there are many more out there, both good and bad for walmart, walmart does its share of fact twisting too. However I have seen almost no hard research here on any of the facts being relied on. I have alot of hard proof of lots of these twisted facts but I can not be the only one out looking for the twistes in the facts. And I also am not going to post any of the proofs until others start, because I want everyone here to start doing some research and finding some real reliable facts that we can bring this entry back to a good standing. But we must work together to do that, not against eachother. The Ace!",0

Bias
I was about to remove the last 5 paragraphs of the section """"2005"""" and replace it with the paragraph by Mark83 in his last edit. Those paragraphs look more than a little biased, and what's more, some facts are inaccurate, as well. But then, looking at other parts of the article, I find that it has been modified in other places too, recently, and the writing style makes it look like something written by a fan. So I haven't deleted the last paragraphs as I was about to, and am instead awaiting a discussion on the whole article.

Below are factual inaccuracies (apart from the general bias) I've noticed in the last 5 paragraphs of the section """"2005.""""

""""In comparison to Räikkönen, Alonso had made significantly fewer driving errors than his rival (just one in Canada) and has been a model of consistency finishing in the top three more times than Räikkönen.""""

My memory isn't the best, but of the races in just the latter half, I distinctly remember Alonso making mistakes in qualifying in Hungary and Hockenheim. Raikkonen wasn't prone to many mistakes, either.

""""Alonso was not only the fastest driver in qualifying but also matched the McLaren MP4-20’s speed, running with relatively the same amounts of fuel on board.""""

This is just speculation, isn't it? Since the Safety Car came on before the frontrunners had made their pitstops (not to forget Montoya retiring due to the drain cover incident), there is no way of verifying such a claim, other than believing press releases by the teams concerned, which are not exactly models of unbiased reporting - especially given that throughout most of the season, McLaren were shown to be qualifying with much more fuel on board than Renault.

 Some more detail about Mormonism and constructions fundaments 

Regarding polygamism with early mormons, Joseph Smith and his first group of 12 mens were using it all the time but hidding it from their wifes... Joseph Smith was married to more than 20 womens, without the knowledge of his wife, and problems occured when this first group around him wished to make this polygamism as an official rule of their sect.

As the first wife of J. Smith was to know about her husbands several wifes, and made a scandal against it and asked for divorce, so angry she was against him, Joseph Smith changed his mind. It made J. Smith to think a little more about the problem and to make it a non legal part of their rules, which made the other male members angry at him. It end up as a polygamism rule, but first fully applied to all after Joseph Smith death. As many things in mormonism they first appeared after the foundators death, and are mostly made by its closest coworkers to assist them in gaining more power. 
It is also very well known that previously to Smiths writings about the supposed contain of its golden books, he was contacted by various members of masonics loges, and many of this church rituals, both sacred and profane, are directly taken from classical freemasonry and masonic orders'rituals. Many of the believes enumerated in the mormons books are also directly taken from those traditions, therefor the mormons books looks more, for a religions and myhtologies and esoterisms specialist point of view, like an amalguame or milk shake of several religious and sectars theories, well known within other religious groups, than a religion in itself. Nothing in the mormon books is original, all is taken from somewhere else, often with quiet a unimaginativ mind.

The mormons researchs in latin america have given zero zero zero as prooves who could elaborate anything stated in the book of mormon as a source, or even ressembling source, for all the tribes described there. 
Another correction to what some have earlier stated here: there is a hell in mormons theory. 
Only true mormon, true knights of the later days saints, and else being it since as most generations as possible, have access to heaven,(the upper part, nearest to God). The downs part being reserved to just coming in members and half fallen members. And out of it is hell, for non mormon, who cannot access the other levels, and will never been able to be in the upper levels. It is clearly stated in the mormons teaching, and I heard it several times, by mormons priests, that there is no salvation for non mormon. Christian go to hell too, and none of the christian priests are recognized as such, nor are they aknowledge the power to baptise anyone, and they teach that even the first apostles, those walking around Jesus Christ, were not able to baptise others and that it is therefor their power was stopped there, until Jesus christ himself took to latin america, and baptised a bunch of by mistake-landed-there-hebrews, and later on this power was given by Christ and Moises itself to Joseph Smith. 
And thats the way the story goes.

The foundator of the christian church is by definition unable to baptise others. Peter was spiritually impotent if we are to believe the mormonic song. 
A way one can undoubtly see the influence of freemasonry in the mormon church is their attribution of 1st and second degree of priesthood, like a copy-paste of hebraic traditions, with some dubious change into it. 
You are missing here also, the place of womens in the mormon church where political reasons, clearly prevail: It is for exemple today teached, that the upper god, is a goddess, the wife of God, and higher than him, and that she cant be named, and very little is known about her because she is OH! so high and special. It is also teached that the reason why women cannot be priest nor teach like priest, nor baptised, is that women are per birth closer to god than men, and that is therefor men only must try to come closer to god by manifesting their spirituality from an early age, all things a woman do not need to do as she has it all to begin with... It is also teach that men must fight harder to attain the same spiritual level as women have, and thats why women must do other things in the mean time: like give birth to more mormons members, do the cleaning and make food, and play missionary 1½ year of their life just before getting married, as soon as they return from mission time. All that good propaganda methods to secure the upcoming of new female members in that order, as well as keeping the youngsters in the old sheme of things, without risking having them asking certain questions, very up to date, very warms, and never answered by this church. 
There is of course nowhere in the mormon books where anyone could actually read exactly the thing stated above, but the",0

Not sure where to put this; the talk page seems to have fragmented, and nothing is in chronological order anymore.  This section looks like as good a place as any.

Just in case you're looking for an outside opinion, analogous to an admin closing an AFD: For reasons unrelated to this content decision, I spent last night looking at this entire talk page (not the archives, thank God).  After reading it all, I figured I might as well put that to some use.  It is my opinion that there is no consensus to add the war crimes information to the article in any form, and that achieving such a consensus is not going to happen at this time, and further discussion is going to amount to going around and around in circles, with no benefit.  Since no consensus for controversial information defaults to """"don't include"""", I think it should not be included, and you should all move on.

I note that """"consensus"""" does not mean unanimity; there is no obligation to discuss this until everyone agrees.  Otherwise, AFD's would last several years.  I cannot imagine any possible compromise wording that would gain a consensus for inclusion.  I actually have no strong opinion on the inclusion itself; just an outside take on how your consensus building is going.

Non-binding, of course, but to be honest, there's a 95% chance that that's what formal mediation would end up telling you anyway.  Accept this, or ignore it, I don't care; just thought you'd like a completely uninvolved opinion.   """,0

"Dimitri & Nina 

Well, thank you so much for your reply. I hoped you would! About six months ago I noticed how badly ballroom dancing in general was being treated on WP, and decided to do something about it. I had been taught dancing by someone who had taken tuition in the latin dances from Pierre & Lavelle, so I knew their names from being a teenager in the 1950s. I wish now I had taken the trouble to meet them, but I didn't. Since I'm something of an expert on Cuban music I decided to start with the group of dancers who started LA dancing in England, from where it has spread all over the world. 

I soon discovered the lack of reliable reference sources was the main problem. I kept seeing references to Pierre, but it was ages before I had enough to put up the page on WP. I still don't have enough for Lavelle. With difficult cases I start a Word file offline. Anything on WP gets copied by bots and plagiarised widely. Even these personal pages.

I've got copies of all the books written about LA dances at that time, including both Dimitri's books and Pierre's book. I don't know where you are, of course, but if you are somewhere in England, we might arrange to meet, and you could have a look at the books. It sounds as though you don't have a copy of his first book.

I've tried to interview all the survivors from that time. So far, I've only found two. I'd certainly like to meet your father if he was willing. He's bound to have lots of things tucked away at the back of his mind which might help us. And I'll answer more fully about myself, but not on WP (for reason given above)

Now I'm going to let you have my e-mail address. If you wish, you could send me an e-mail, which would automatically give me yours. Then, once you know your e-mail has worked, please wipe off my e-address from this page after you've stored it, preferably on a private machine rather than one available for general use (open machines without good security get scanned regularly).

 It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to

 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to

in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public

That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

""""Although Pussyfoot Johnson's political operations failed by a large margin to conform strictly to the Christian principles upon which the league had been founded, neither he nor others who employed similar 'variations' were ever punished or even reprimanded. It was generally felt by prohibition leaders that since the league acted as the agent of the churches and was therefore engaged upon the Lord's business, anything was justified which might help gain the ends desired by the Almighty.""""

 Page content for footprints poem 

Why do you keep removing this text? These are important facts
about this poem and about the authorship. There has been so much public deceit and this is nothing but pure sabotage when you cannot even give me credit for my own work. 

Footprints, also known as Footprints in the Sand, is a popular allegorical text written in prose. Although released as an """"anonymous contribution"""", it is often mistakenly attributed to Mary Stevenson or Margaret Fishback Powers. Carolyn Joyce Carty is the only author of the most popular version known as Footprints poem; One night a man had a dream whose copyright actually reflects it's anonymous contribution of authorship. See U.S. Copyright Record. 

There also seems to be a critical error when stating that neithr Ella Scharring Hausen or Mary Stevenson never claimed their own copyright that it was only claimed for them by others. What kind of nonsense is that? Mary Stevenson vicariously tried to claim authorship of Hausens public domain version.

"""Hi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o)

First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, starting with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to be written.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.

Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: user:/Sandbox, that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.

For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along; I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of our best teachers ().

Here's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted inline citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work.

Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.

One last thing to keep as a motto: """"It's better to write one good, well-referenced, nicely-presented article than it is to create fifty unreferenced one-line stubs!""""  (talk …stalk!) 
How references work

 Simple references 

These require two parts;

a)
Chzz is 98 years old. """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 

He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website] 

b) A section called """"References"""" with the special code """"{{reflist}}"""";
== References ==
{{reflist}}

(an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections)

To see the result of that, please look at user:chzz/demo/simpleref. Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as user:/reftest and try it out.

 Named references 

Chzz was born in 1837. 
""""The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 
 

Chzz lives in Footown.

Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see user:chzz/demo/namedref to see the result.

 Citation templates 

You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look;

Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation
 | last = Smith
 | first = John
 | title = Olympic medal winners of the 20th century
 | publication-date = 2001
 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]
 | page = 125
 | isbn = 0-521-37169-4
}}


Please see user:chzz/demo/citeref to see the result.

For more help and tips on that subject, see user:chzz/help/refs.

"Due to continual nibbling away of information by some very uninformed editors the section on current legal battle makes absolutely no sense. It appears to be remnants of longer pieces of information standing in isolation. If anyone can work out there are two trials now in progress one which started in September 2012 at the Delhi Patiala Court heard by Mr Justice Akash Jain based on a FIR filed by the Delhi Police due to her fasting at the Delhi Jantar Mantar 6 October 2006. That trial has now completed two full days of hearings the next production warrant the 14th is set for October 30-31 2014 2 days of prosecution witnesses.
The second trial is in Imphal. So after her arrest on fresh charges March 2014 the Imphal Police pressed charges at that point a local corrupt lawyer turned up and decided that the best thing was for all charges to be dropped and Sharmila to be placed in a death tent where he desire to starve herself to death over a few weeks could be respected. The Chief Judicial Magistrate rejected his plea to dismiss all charges after 13 years of imprisonment because someone might ask why did you imprison her then and keep her in solitary if there was no case to answer. The lawyer then appealed to higher Court the District & Sessions Judge. When this Judge looked at the case he pointed out the prosecution hadn't actually submitted any evidence of any wrong doing other than suggesting that everybody knew she was on a fast to death. Given that following procedural rules of evidence in court no evidence was actually being presented just references to hearsay the Judge ruled that in the absence of positive evidence to suggest mens rea he didn't need to look into the validity of the actus reus of whether hunger striking was grounds for arrest under the attempted suicide legislation so he dismissed the charges adding that he felt the Government should take measures to preserve Sharmila's health because even if hte Prosecution hadn't bothered to present any evidence he knew she was on a hunger strike and would die without farther intervention. Subsequently the Government re-arrested Sharmila on a fresh charge of attempted suicide and appealed to the Manipur High Court to have the District & Sessions Judge's judgement overturned and for a trial to proceed. Meanwhile Sharmila is held at the JNIMS security ward (not house arrest because then she would be in her own home) on 15 day judicial remand. The last judicial remand renewal was 5th September (the next one is due on 19th September) the last hearing of the Manipur High Court regarding the judicial review of the previous case dismissal was 3 September when they sought more papers but it appears this is all to complicated for wiki editors so they have gone with what appear to be verifiable facts in no particular order which when read do not make any sense at all. In this they are true to the actual Indian court proceedings. Desmond Coutinho again look I have just signed my name.",0

Questions and comments

Ms. Barber wrote: """"In a united effort, the ISSR Licensed Breeders only produce approximately 200 pups per year""""  '''''

Ms. Barber-How many of those puppies were """"produced"""" by your kennel?  What specific health testing do you conduct on your dogs?

You, and those supporting your club/registry, have been respectfully asked for this information numerous times during this discussion yet you continue to ignore these legitimate requests, while appearing rude, insulting, superior-minded, and frankly an entirely offensive and inarticulate representative of this breed you """"founded"""" and the other breeders affiliated with your registry.  I certainly hope other breeders affiliated with your organization do not present themselves to the public in the same way you do, as I can't imagine anyone with any intelligence and self-esteem would be willing to tolerate such unprofessional behavior, much less purchase any puppies/dogs from people who conduct themselves the way you have in this discussion.

You claim a lot, but you provide no independent support for your claims, only your own writings on your own website.  You claim anyone """"producing"""" dogs other than you or your registry are frauds, yet you are unwilling to prove how this is true other than offering some photos YOU have taken of these dogs and your own rantings, as evidence. You claim breeders unaffiliated with you are """"in it for the money"""", yet:

You produce more of these dogs than almost all other breeders combined, through your wholly and co-owned breeding dogs.  Your website (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/upcoming_litters.htm) for this Winter alone, shows you are """"producing"""" ELEVEN litters at New Zion and through co-ownership breedings.  Eleven litters, even conservatively speaking, could easily produce over 100 PUPPIES!  And, you are planning for 20 more litters next Spring and Summer!  You also currently list over 25 stud dogs and over 25 females you are considering for breeding!

You charge a lot of money for each puppy you produce ($900-$2500+).  After the puppy-buyer has paid you for a puppy from a certain litter, you also contractually reserve the right, at your own discretion, to substitute a puppy from another """"compatible"""" (again, based on your own determination) litter and you will not provide a refund if they are do not agree with the """"substitute"""" puppy you decide to offer them.
(see: http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm.....""""New Zion reserves the right to substitute any litter of equal/higher value that is compatible with your exact requirements"""").

It appears that, once monies are given are given to you, your contract does not allow for any refund under any circumstances, nor could I find any instances where you contractually assume any financial responsibility whatsoever for any puppies you """"produce"""" who display congenital/hereditary problems requiring resulting astronomical/extensive veterinary fees.
  
You require your puppy-buyers to not only pay you for puppies at the time you """"produce"""" them, but you also require puppy-buyers to sign contracts promising future puppy and breeding rights (for breedable dogs, you require the dog's new owners to either give you some of the puppies that dog produces in the future and/or you require they allow you to use that dog in the future to sire new litters of your own), in order to profit from the dog not only now but also throughout his/her life. 

You have no stated policy on your website page (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm) re: your own personal policy/commitment to rescue and make/find a home for for any of the puppies/dogs you """"produce"""", should they become unwanted, homeless and/or end up in shelters or in abusive situations.

Your """"Policies and Prices"""" make no mention of a contractual requirement by you (with the signed contractual commitment of your puppy-buyers) to spay/neuter their new """"pets"""", in order to reduce overpopulation of this breed and dogs, in general.  I could find nowhere on your website where the horrifying statistics of unwanted/euthanzied dogs in the U.S. (2 million +, including 25% of which are purebred dogs) is responsibly addressed by someone actively promoting and engaged in the proliferation of this explosion.
 
Your website does not list any independent references, such as recommending/governing affiliations (i.e. Better Business Bureau), approval ratings (i.e. OFA, Penn-Hip, CERF), or other professional organizations to which you belong (ie. American Dog Owner's Association, the the Delta Society [therapy], dog training or agility organizations, etc.), only your own dog club(SSDCA), you own dog registry (ISSR), and your own literature (except some very limited information by Dr. Padgett and numerous and ri",0

"I did try to assume good faith to begin with here, but the users history of wikilawyering (as listed above), culminating with the proof - in the creation of M I A - that their desperation to delete/rename this album is purely rooted in the fact that the article could possibly be confused with an article they have an interest in, caused me to lose it.  

Ironically, changing the title of this article to MIA will immediately cause separate confusion - with another band, called MIA..",0
"'s vandalism/lies/distortion of facts/mis-use of lack of communication between wiki administrators/WP:POV pushing 

I am putting it here, kindly read the whole story alongwith the proofs.

It appears that Admin User:Abecedare has ended up doing some big injustice without checking the facts. Per he has blocked anon User: 32.177.111.155 simply because he was trying to protect Wikipedia. Please correct this error otherwise this injustice and blocking comments are going to harm both innocent editors ( User: 32.177.111.155 and User: 209.183.55.115  ) and their zeal to work on wikipedia and their future contributions/history as well.

Why User Talk: 32.177.111.155's Block was unjustified

User Talk: 32.177.111.155’s edits do not constitute vandalism

He simply restored duly referenced text. 
 Proof 1
 Proof 2
 Proof 3

 User Talk: 32.177.111.155 did not violate WP:3rr 

He did not violate WP:3RR and he simply quit editing.

 User Talk: 32.177.111.155 can not be a called a sockpuppet

 It was mentioned that User: 209.183.55.115 is licensed to Concord, CA and User: 32.177.111.155 is licensed to Los Angeles. Both of these cities are 6-7 hours of drive from each other? And it usually takes 1.5 hours of flight time if you want to fly from one city to another. 
  against violation of Wikipedia policies. Is simple warning constitute sockpuppetry?
If  had owned 2nd IP 209.183.55.115 as well, then he could have participated in the edit war through 2nd IP while staying within WP:3RR. It means he was not related to the 2nd IP at all.

Why ’s edits constitute violation of Wikipedia policies

Editor  repeatedly deleted duly referenced tex

Edit 1 
edit 2 
Edit 3 

Editor  repeatedly lied

 lied/mislead Wikipedia community through his edit summaries and statements.
Edit 1 – edit summary “Google Books isn't a very reliable source. Find a better source than that..”
edit 2 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer”
Edit 3 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer”
again lied that city of Concord and city of Los Angeles are next to each other to get the opposing editors blocked under sock category.

Editor  repeatedly violated WP:POV 

User:Neutralhomer ruthlessly suppressed others voice and kept on removing the referenced text by blatantly refusing to accept the wp:rs reliability of various internationally known newspapers and a very notable google book which is already part of wikipedia, i.e. Reduced to Ashes (book). User:Neutralhomer refused to accept following references only because he could not like them:

"Hi again, below is the edit I would like to make to the wiki page about me.  Pretty much all of the information is a matter of public record and pretty easily verifiable.  This is the same bio that is used by the university at which I am a professor.  In fact, I think thats how the edit may have gotten tagged as a copyright violation.  Nevertheless, this bio, which I wrote, does appear in various public forums so I hope that it doesnt present any problems.  Here is what I would like to say:

Andy Brick is a prolific composer, conductor and symphonist.  In 2003 Brick set a historic milestone conducting the Czech National Symphony Orchestra in the world’s first symphonic game music concert at the Gewandaus, Leipzig Germany to a sold out audience of 2200.  Andy wrote the fanfare to this historic concert event which featured his music for Merregnon II. He has served as the exclusive principle conductor and music director of the concert series leading repeatedly sold out performances from 2003-2008. In 2005 Andy was appointed music director of  the European concert series, “Heros of Imagination”.  This concert series featured new symphonic music written by Andy and performed by the Neue Elbland Philharmonie.  Brick also served as music director for the first Chamber Music Concert of the Kammerphilharmonie.  Brick has conducted over 70 game titles including Final Fantasy, Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, Halo, and World of Warcraft with orchestras throughout the world including The Prague Symphony, The Czech National Symphony, The North Carolina Symphony, The Bratislava Symphony, The Moravian Philharmonic, The Filmharmonic of Prague and members of the New York Philharmonic and Detroit Symphony. In 2007 Andy Brick was appointed associate conductor of “Play! A Video Game Symphony” and made his most recent appearance conducting the North Carolina Symphony in July 2009.   

Andy has composed and/or orchestrated music for such blockbuster Game titles as Maxis’ Sim City: Rush Hour, Midway Entertainments’ Stranglehold, Electronic Arts’ Sims 2 and Warhammer: Day of Reckoning as well as Nintendos Super Mario Bros., Bungie’s Halo 3, and  Square Enix Final Fantasy series.   His music has also been featured in such game titles as Arc The Lad by Working Designs, Shadoan by Interplay, The Far Reaches by 3DO, Tesselmania by  MECC and others. 

As a protégé of Walt Disney Pictures’ Andy wrote scores for animated feature films such as Little Mermaid II and The Lady and The Tramp II. In 2007 Andy was commissioned by Walt Disney to compose and conduct music for Sinbad’s Storybook Adventure.  In 2008 Disney/ABC Television again commissioned Andy to write new music for ABC’s Schoolhouse Rock. Andy re-orchestrated the classic film Mutiny On the Bounty for Warner Bros. Pictures.  Andy’s Tone Poem The Story of The Red Rose was used in its entirety on the film of the same name and earned him best original score for the film which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival.  He has also scored various independent films including Uphill All The Way with Susan Sarandon and The Cine Golden Eagle award winning Chatham County.   In 2009 Andy was retained as senior orchestrator for the upcoming Broadway musical Verse of Fortune. 

Andy has been featured by the American Music Center’s “The New Music Box”, PRI’s “Studio 360” the National broadcast of the CBS Evening News and various local and national media outlets.    In Print, Andy has been the featured composer in the New York Times article “A Composer Gives Video Games a Musical Life” and was the featured “Songwriter” in Billboard Magazine’s. article “Brick Brings Videogame Scores to Life with Orchestra”  Recently, Andy was selected as the featured conductor in the “Young, Gifted, and Engaged” issue of SYMPHONY Magazine. In October 2004 Andy received his first orchestral concert commission.  The resulting work entitled “Gygrans Song” was performed live by the Moravian Philharmonic.  In June 2005 Andy won the prestigious “Masterworks of the New Era” award for his concert composition “Hungarian Overture”.  The work was recorded by the Kiev Philharmonic and released on the ERM label and distributed in all major retail outlets throughout the US and Europe.

Andy Brick is a graduate of the University of Michigan where he studied Composition with Pulitzer Prize winning composer Leslie Basset.  Brick continued his studies in composition and theory at Mannes College of Music, New York.  He currently serves as Associate Professor and Director of the Music program at Stevens Institute of Technology.

"An editor should be careful and specific about which edits are thought to be not NPOV before reverting another editor's hard work wholesale.  For example, what is not NPOV about stating that Candace was killed at a home in Evergreen and not in Golden?  Because it happens to be the geographical location of a lot of leading attachment therapists?

The therapists (plural) were not clearly unlicensed, as a reliable source has stated otherwise.  It is POV to insist upon mistaken and misleading information be included, especially when the inclusion serves no good purpose.

It is a settled question that a reliable source about a topic can be listed in a reading section.  Besides, I didn't list it in the first place.

I hope and I pray and I act in good faith that Mr Paul does not let his Roman Catholic religion bias him. I have every right and need to make that statement after this editor posted that appears to question the sanity of some of the sources. Please pretty please clarify that. As for example Saint Sophrony was a man very much for this modern era and has only recently passed away. As he is quite famous for speaking of the uncreated light or the Taborian Light. As I have already pointed out in m posting is this the person you are saying we need to confirm if they are sane? What about say Professor George Metallinos from the University of Athens? How is it that we might go about confirming their sanity. What is the criteria that we should use for that? In specific? Since it appears you are saying people whom religious experiences are now to have their sanity questioned. This is starting to sound like Piteşti prison all over again.,0

 Letter to the Governing Body on controversial points 

I thought you might like to see this. It's a letter the Governing Body received in 1980 from the Watch Tower's chairman's committee, before the Governing Body disfellowshipped many senior Witnesses for """"apostasy"""", and the reason was they were discussing these teachings below. I happen to agree with the points that disagree with traditional Watch Tower doctrine. You would also find it interesting reading Raymond Franz's discussion of each of these points in his two books, Crisis of Conscience and In search of Christian Freedom, and after see if you can still refute them using the Bible as your guide. The letter is below:

Following are some of the wrong teachings being spread as emanating from Bethel. These have been brought to the attention of the Governing Body from the field from April 14 onward.

1. That Jehovah does not have an organization on earth today and its Governing Body is not being directed by Jehovah.

2. Everyone baptized from Christ's time (C.E. 33) forward to the end should have the heavenly hope. All these should be partaking of the emblems at Memorial time and not just those who claim to be of the anointed remnant.

3. There is no proper arrangement as a """"faithful and discreet slave"""" class made up of the anointed ones and their Governing Body to direct affairs of Jehovah's people. At Matthew 24:45 Jesus used this expression only as an illustration of faithfulness of individuals. Rules are not needed only follow the Bible.

4. There are not two classes today, the heavenly class and those of the earthly class also called """"other sheep"""" at John 10:16

5. That the number 144,000 mentioned in Revelation 7:4 and 14:1 is symbolic and not to be taken as literal. Those of the """"great crowd"""" mentioned at Revelation 7:9 also serve in heaven as indicated in vs. 15 where it is claimed that such crowd serves """"day and night"""" in his temple (naos) or K. int says: """"in the divine habitation of him.""""

6. That we are now living in a special period of """"last days"""" but that the """"last days"""" started 1900 years ago C.E. 33 as indicated by Peter at Acts 2:17 when he quoted from the prophet Joel.

7. That 1914 is not an established date. Christ Jesus was not enthroned then but has been ruling in his kingdom since C.E.33. That Christ's presence (parousia) is not yet but when the """"sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven"""" (Matthew 24:30) in the future.

8. That Abraham, David, and other faithful men of old will also have the heavenly life basing such view on Hebrews 11:16.

 Warning 

I am just here to say that bias you have against me is plainly obvious, and I am asking you kindly to back off, as I am starting to get annoyed. I am starting to think that you see my username and instinctively hit revert. You pretty much admitted this in your reversion of the 1965 Palm Sunday article. If you would simply do some basic fact checking, this could all be avoided

My change to """"Lacon, IL"""" was sourced via Grazulis, and you obviously reverted because you saw my username, and didn't even check or research the validity of my edit. I would bet money that if any other user made that edit, you wouldn't have reverted it. If you have this idea that I make willy-nilly edits with no basis, then you are mistaken. I dig through hours online resources, old newspaper archives, books, and pdf documents to find my information. I take pride in providing valuable, detailed, and verifiable info on historical tornadic events. Seeing the reversion of all this work is frustrating to say the least. All I ask is for you to trust me a little more, and actually READ the sources and information provided.
  Sharkguy05""",0
"""::::Sorry for the confusion. I am saying that it is not neutral the way it is now. You are suppressing the POV that is stated in the SF Chronicle “that no one was forced and that no laws were broken” which seems highly relevant given the allegations. So I am saying that the phrasing you are selecting suffer from undue weight, non-neutral fact selection and wording. Also from WP:NPOV “Verifiability lives alongside neutrality, it does not override it. A matter that is both verifiable and supported by reliable sources might nonetheless be proposed to make a point or cited selectively; painted by words more favorably or negatively than is appropriate; made to look more important or more dubious than a neutral view would present; marginalized or given undue standing; described in slanted terms which favor or weaken it; or subject to other factors suggestive of bias.
Verifiability is only one content criterion. Neutral point of view is a core policy of Wikipedia, mandatory, non-negotiable, and to be followed in all articles. Concerns related to undue weight, non-neutral fact selection and wording, and advancing a personal view, are not addressed even slightly by asserting that the matter is verifiable and cited. The two are different questions, and both must be considered in full, in deciding how the matter should be presented in an article."""" So based on this I am also reverting. I really am only trying to make the article better by trying to find neutrality and getting away from bias.66.82.9.58

 Laughable Errors""""The Qur'an also places a dress code upon its followers. For women, it emphasizes modesty. Allah says in the Qur'an, """"And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their private parts and not to display their adornment (interpreted as the hair and body-shape) except that which ordinarily appears thereof (interpreted as the face and hands) and to draw their headcovers over their chests and not to display their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands fathers, their sons, . . . ."""" (surat an-Nur verse 31). All those in whose presence a woman is not obliged to practice the dress code are known to be her mahrams. Men have a dress code which is more relaxed: the loins must be covered from knee to waist. The rationale given for these rules is that men and women are not to be viewed as sexual objects.

Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country, has laws against these dress codes in schools and work places. After the declaration of the Republic in 1923, as part of revolutions brought by Ataturk, a modern dress code was encouraged. It is against the law to wear a head scarf while attending public school in Turkey, as well as France, where the recently enacted rule caused huge public controversy.""""

Is anyone implying that Turkey obliges women to show their naked chests and display their 'adornments'? Turkey only banned the BURQA, and it can be argued that the Quran never specifically perscribed that particular dress anyway.  """,0

 Dear Mr. Jim Handerson, please read the 09:58 16 July 2012 fightingagainstlies edition of the article. You will understand that what I am mentioned. 

Oktay Sinanoğlu (born on August 2, 1934 in Bari, Italy) is a Turkish scientist specializing in theoretical chemistry and molecular biology. In his autobiographical book which titled """"The Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book""""[1] he describes himself as: """"A person who was the world's youngest professor in the last 300 years,""""[2] """"at the peak of the science in the U.S.A.,""""[3] """"a man who reached the level to say, """"I'm God"""" in science,""""[4] """"the Lord of the U.S.A.,""""[5] and """"The Turkish Einstein.""""[6]

Childhood and High School Years (1934-1953)

Sinanoğlu was born on August 2, 1934 in Bari, Italy, where his father (Nüzhet Haşim Sinanoğlu) served as a consul general. In 1939 - at the beginning of World War II - the family returned to Turkey. He graduated high school in Turkey in the year 1953. This high school's name was """"Ankara Maarif College"""" since 1951.[7] The courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology in this school had been given by English teachers in the English language since 1949.[8][9] Sinanoglu learned the English language very well in this high school.

Serving American Military Intelligence at the age of 18

In his autobiographical book entitled """"Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book,"""" which was published in Turkey in the Turkish language (first printing in October 2001 and 70. printing in April 2011, a bestseller: 150,000 copies), he stated that, in the summer holiday 1952-1953, he applied to the JAMMAT """"Joint American Military Mission for Aid to Turkey"""" (renamed JUSMMAT in 1958)[10][11][12] to get a job as a translator. His application was accepted by the U.S. Army Staff in Ankara, and he was sent on duty to Erzurum as translator for Secret G2 Military Intelligence Agents Sergeant Kowalski and Sergeant Peterson.[13] After graduating high school in 1953, a scholarship was given to him by the Fulbright Program to study chemistry in the United States.[14] According to the agreement, students were elected by the U.S. Education Commission in Turkey, but funding of the scholarship was provided by the government of Turkey, because Turkish students will return after graduation in the U.S.A to become teachers in Turkey. Sinanoglu was sent with this expectation to the U.S.A.

A University Student in the U.S.A. (1953-1960)

He arrived in New York on September 25, 1953.[15] According to his autobiographical book mentioned above, he stayed one year in Missouri [clarification needed], after which he went to California and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956, with highest honors in chemical engineering. Afterwards, in eight months, he earned a Master's degree with highest honors from MIT (1957); and after this, in two years, he finished his doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley (1959).[16] Subsequently, he finished a one-year postdoctoral research appointment at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California Berkeley (1959-1960).[17] So, his pupilage ended in 1960.

Violating Scholarship Agreement and Military Service Obligation to Live in the U.S.A.

According to the 1953 scholarship agreement, after graduation, Sinanoglu was obligated to return to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students.[18] Sinanoglu stated in his autobiographical book that: """"Returning to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students in the English language was worse than death, a horrible and dishonorable thing. İnstead of this, to stay in the U.S.A. and to teach chemistry to American students in the English language was a more honorable thing. I swore that: I will not return to Turkey; I will stay in the U.S.A and I will be a chemistry teacher in American universities.”[19] So Sinanoglu violated the 1953 scholarship agreement and did not return to Turkey. But there was a second problem: According to the military service obligation laws of his country, after finishing his studies in 1960, Sinanoglu was to return to Turkey to fulfill an 18-month military service obligation. The penalty for violating the scholarship agreement was a fine: the payment of a sum of money. But the penalty for violating one's military service obligation was the cancellation of one's passport and visa; this penalty could not be paid by money in those years (1960s). He stated in his autobiographical book: """"Theoretical Physicist Feza Gursey wrote a letter to me inviting me to the Middle East Technical University which was being established in Ankara, Turkey. But I couldn't return to Turkey because of the military service obligation. If I went to Turkey, I would be a soldier for 2-2,5 years.""""[20] An easy way to stay in the U.S.A. was to marry and father a child in that country.

I bet others would have suggestions/requests, too, if you let others know you might do some updating.  Your tools have been tremendously useful to me and to others.

About previous stuff, what I understand mostly is that you have not liked me or others generating minimal stub articles, unless a certain threshold of development or need is met, a threshold that you set differently than i have.  I don't want to re-open anything like an argument, but I wonder if you think list-articles i've been working on recently are good or bad.  These are about fraternal organization buildings (List of Odd Fellows buildings and others linked in its See also section), and also List of YMCA buildings and List of YWCA buildings.  I think they serve a good purpose, broadly, like the NRHP-listed bridge lists do, and I have chosen to develop them and to open stub articles for all their entries up front.  I think this rapid development approach has headed off a lot of misunderstandings that woulda been generated if they were shorter lists or had many redlinks.  I think i've had a lot more cumulative experience now, good and bad, with dealing with disambiguation- or Masonic- or Connecticut- or other-focused editor groups, and I think that rapidly generating the articles works a lot better, often, than leaving open red-links.  It certainly helps in establishing good categories right away, and also I've seen/learned the need for the architectural categories that correspond to these kinds of buildings.  Doing all of a certain type, at once, seems beneficial.  You can comment or not, but I just thought you might be less miffed about my going ahead with a lot of article generation, if you considered the pretty-good, immediately stable list-articles of these sort that I've been making.

Cool Hand Luke added criticism of Press TV from this article.  That's fine. As we agreed earlier all TV station articles have a criticism section.

However, this particular article goes on to say """"Only five days after launching, Press TV invited me to take part in a televised panel discussion about journalism in the Middle East. I argued that the biggest challenge facing journalists in the region is a lack of freedom and cited, among other examples, the case of Zahra Kazemi, the Canadian photojournalist who was raped, tortured and murdered by Iranian officials after she was arrested for taking photographs outside the Evin prison in Tehran. To his credit, the host and chief press officer, Shahab Mossavat, did not interrupt or silence me. He called my comments """"offensive"""" to Iran but pointed out that I was given free rein to say what I wished by Press TV. He then steered the conversation toward obstacles confronted by journalists in Israel.""""

A number of conquest attempts were launched against Prussia by Poland, (ref External link William Pierson book), also

Marija Gimbutas in her book: The Balts - describes the Prussian and Baltic territory reaching much further west, south, south-west, south-east than the later Prussia, when Poland came into existense and conquered much additional territory (claimed by Polish to have been a """"uniting of Polish tribes""""), however for centuries rejected and fought against by the ones involved.

Prussians are also recorded as Ulmerugi, Holmrugi (Island Rugians in the Vistula river area. That name still showed up on maps of area around Culm, Culmerland, Kulmerland territory which was surrounded by the Vistula river.  

Boleslaw I claimed to have conquered (part of) the Prussians and even his headstone is supposed to have shown something like this. He also claimed to have put 'columns' (pillars) up in the newly conquered Prussian territory, to mark the new border of territory, which he now claimed as his, which was not his.

So ,Szopen, Culmerland was not Polish land- it was Prussian land, partially conquered temporarily by Poland. 

Gethen, Getae is yet another name for the Prussians, that name was still known to Polish historians as well.

Szopen's mentioning of Bruno of Querfurt as having taken part in Boleslaw I battles against Prussians 1015 also makes no sense, because Bruno was dead since 1009.""",0

 Wikipedia is not a dictionary.

Could you please explain why you deleted a sentence with two references without even giving a reason? 

""""In December 2013, Waters was again accused of antisemitism after an online interview in which he compared the treatment of Palestinians by Israelis to the treatment of Jews by Nazi Germany.[123][124]""""

  

 FWIW, I believe this to be WP:NOTNEWS and WP:COATRACK type stuff that really does not belong in a bio on Waters at this point, but lest someone accuse me of ownership I'll step back and let others decide.  (talk|contribs)  
I dont object to adding about the latest anti semite allegations but only when our way of doing this fits WP:NPOV which the current insertion absolutely FAILS to do, we must be balanced and not take one side or another (in this case the side of those attacking Waters was taken as the only side of the controversy we reported)♫  talk contribs 

In the process you deleted 2 references/citations one of them was his interview. What kind of """"balance"""" are you looking for when people are not able to read Waters? Could you please bring back the references? Personally i just added the link to his interview. Beside that everything in the sentence was true. You could easily re-write the sentence and leave the citations there. No. You just deleted everything. AND the citations. Unacceptable.   
This is a BLP bio and so what I did was in no way unacceptable but if you want to re-frame what you wrote in an NPOV way why not do so here on this page first, you need to write in a balanced way as an editor and not rail against others cos you didnt do so♫  talk contribs

Wikipedia Regrets The Errors

From June to September of 2007, several false and misleading critical statements appeared at the National Civilian Community Corps (also known as AmeriCorps NCCC) page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Civilian_Community_Corps), in violation of Wikipedia standards.  This is the false text as it appeared:

National Civilian Community Corps

""""...Criticisms
The NCCC program has met with sharp criticisms from some fiscal conservatives who accused it of being a """"boondoggle"""".[4] Most notably, Libertarian pundit and commentator James Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud""""[5], in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book """"Feeling Your Pain: The Explosion and Abuse of Government Power in the Clinton-Gore Years."""" Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it """"a fraud"""".
^ http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188385,00.html ^ http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm""""

Wikipedia relies on its readers and volunteer contributors to avoid or challenge and correct misleading or false information.

The following has been called to our attention:

1.  The statement that read """"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud,"""" cited as its source an article at this address by Bovard: http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm  Nowhere in that article does Bovard make that statement.  No mention of """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" nor of the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""" appears in that article, nor is AmeriCorps NCCC called a 'waste and fraud.""""  We regret the error.

2. The same sentence went on to state the following:  """"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud"""", in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book """"Feeling Your Pain ...""""

Upon investigation, this statement turns out to be untrue.  Bovard's book (published in hardcover by St. Martin's press) does not contain a chapter of criticisms of AmeriCorps NCCC in the book """"Feeling Your Pain.  In fact, neither """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" nor the """"National Civilian Community Corps are mentioned at all in the text of that book nor in the book index.  (The chapter in question concerns the umbrella program, AmeriCorps, but does not mention the program known as """"AmeriCorps NCCC'"""" or the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""".

(The only mention to NCCC is in the footnotes, referring to a speech by then-president Clinton, praising, not criticizing, the NCCC.)

In sum, the book """"Feeling Your Pain"""" does not dedicate """"an entire chapter of criticisms"""" of AmeriCorps NCCC, contrary to the information posted at the Wikipedia website.  We regret the error.

3.  Also untrue was the sentence """"Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it [i.e., AmeriCorps NCCC] """"a fraud"""".  This sentence was misleading and false.  It was placed at the National Civilian Community Corps page and referred to the antecedent in the previous sentence, the AmeriCorps NCCC.

The claim relied on the article by Bovard at http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm.  No mention of either the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""" nor of """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" appears in that article.  No evidence has been put forward to support the statement that Mr. Sweet ever labeled AmeriCorps NCCC a """"fraud.""""  We regret the error.

Wikipedia deeply regrets that this misleading text appeared at our National Civilian Community Corps website and that it persisted for as long as it did.

The editor responsible for its appearance and continued re-emergence will no longer have access to the National Civilian Community Corps Wikipedia entry.

Signed: _____

[Philippe - Calls to move forward on the National Civilian Community Corps page, to be a team player, etc., would be better received if Wikipedia posted a note something like the above at the NCCC site  - not to mention, it might restore Wikipedia's credibility on the subject.  I don't know if there is a snowball's chance of that happening, but at least this gives you some information to process so you can evaluate the current situation.  Given the nature of the NCCC - a substantial and serious component of U.S. disaster relief and mitigation capacity - and its recent near-demise following misleading claims like those posted at Wikipedia, the statement above is not written as amusement.] """,0

"""Kenneth Tennyson's reckless behavior in other forums==

As far as Kenneth Tennyson bashing other authors, here is an exerpt from a book review on Amazon.com:

Founder of the homemade Mushindo Karate movement, never studied under a legitimate teacher, or any martial art teacher, never set foot in Asia, completely disproven, shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. Of course he claims to have studied under masters in Tibet, and been a disciple of Okinawan Karate teachers - since disproven by such worthy sources as Gorge Mattson, et al. Was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back (""""Sleep with me and I'll enlighten you"""" kinda thing), uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what ex-students say at him, a propaganda liemaster. 

The person he is bashing is none other than Terrence Dukes (or the real Frank Dukes from the movie Bloodsport)

While putting others down, Kenny brags, or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people:

Hmmm... well, kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera, alot of jumping and posturing, and a lot of religious themes to it. I guess it depends on what martial arts you've trained in to determine whether I can kick A$$ or not. let's see... I'm a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. I've got to start learning about grappling though. 

Freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that Kenny is a racist. Here are some excerpts from users from other forums:

(The Armchair Analyst - Asia Times Forum)
I see. However, you sounded like a racist.
No, I have no """"South Asian sensitivities"""". I am no nationalist/jingoist. I consider myself above it all. 

ALL your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of """"greatness"""". It may be in a narrow Anglo-saxon way, but not in a Gandhi-Buddha sort of a way. Get it?

Civilizations such as India (actually even China until today) have NEVER had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.

You have generalized Indians to be bigots etc., I agree that SOME not all are. But the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as """"obnoxious"""", by definition makes you a racist. YES IT DOES! 

(rocky - Asia Times Forum)
What inaccuracy are you referring to? If Brits came to India and got rich, was the wealth Indian or British? Besides looting, what exactly did British accomplish? While your bias is clearly visible with this statement, what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?

Isnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005, it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass, why on earth would anything written by Anglo-Saxon when Europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? Isnt there a vested interest on part of the European to disparage Native Cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? 

That's just a couple of the many others. However, I do not want to clog up this page.

I have also noticed that Kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles, and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  I know that I am not the only one who knows this:'(Brahman - Martial Arts Planet Forum)i really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine, which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion, were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning.

"Vegan rebuttal 

Hello,

I have been following this vegan debate and I have to point out a failure in your revision.

You seem to be writing from a mainstream American or Western point.

Most of the world does not shop at supermarkets - they shop in open markets - and specifically, the majority of vegan would go out of their way to support small independent grocery stores not chains.

With regards to All cuisines, again, this is an important issue.

You get your point for knowing Asian food but it is important from a vegan point of view to show that vegan diet is not something alien from another planet as one contributor wanted to add but something local and traditional to all nations and races.

One does not need to list all nations ; Asian, Mediterranean, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Scottish, Italian, African, South American etc but yet they all have specific vegan dishes and ingredients which most metropolitan vegan sample.

A modern vegan will tend to eat a far wider range of foods than a regular omnivore and the topic out reflect it.

What is the specific benefit to writing supermarket or excluding all of the above apart to your ego?

Likewise there are many other sources to buy such products - such as the internet - so it is utterly unnecessary.

Let it be.

 Ownership of this article 

My apologies for trying to edit your article, HelenOnline.  I didn't realise that this was your article.  I will not edit it again.  

I saw that the article had not been updated with the important closing arguments so I thought to update it.  I guess I should have realised that you owned it, by the way that you reverted everything, with a nasty message to my talk page on top of the reversion, sure signs of ownership.  I took it on face value that really all you wanted were references, as you complained so bitterly about my daring to add in things that you claimed were false.  I mean, you couldn't possibly be trying to damage my reputation just so that you could continue to own the page, could you?

I have no problem with a page being owned, HelenOnline, but I really think that at the top of the page it should say """"This article written by ....."""" and then it should say your real name.  Then people reading this can account for your biases.  And then, if, let's say, Oscar Pistorius, or Barry Roux, or Gerrie Nel, or someone else, think that what you have added is false, and want to sue you for publishing inaccurate information, then they will know to sue you, HelenOnline, rather than poor old Wikipedia.

I saw that you added a lot of false information to this article, HelenOnline.  Furthermore, I see that you deleted a lot of accurate information, while pretending that it was false.  Most dangerously, you used citations then misquoted what they said.  Very dangerous, that.

As I had said above, I really think that it is safer for you, HelenOnline, to recuse yourself from this article.  You have had major fights with several editors here, which has resulted, in your words, with you """"scaring them off"""", as you put it.  

I don't know precisely what happened with them, as all I can see are their comments in the talk page above, and looking through the history, but if it anything similar to the abuse I was subjected to, both from you, and by people who blindly support you without bothering to check facts, then I am sure that it was serious.  I got banned for 3 whole days for personal attacks, for asking you to recuse yourself!  Wow!  Just wow!  And as a result, you get to revert my edits unopposed, you get to abuse me all over Wikipedia, I get banned and on top of that the article gets locked in a false state, so that the truth will never be told.

It's on your head, HelenOnline, and everyone who supports you.  This article belongs to you, and if someone decides to sue you, on the completion of the trial on 11 September, I for one won't be held responsible for your false edits.

Read very closely .
Per WP:VERIFY and WP:BURDEN, the burden of proof that the image shows Godane has already been proven through the many, upon many reliable and reputable sources. You seem to have an issue with this, therefore the onus has now been transferred to you in order to prove to the contrary, something which you have so far failed to do. 
None of the sources you have cited have explicitly denied the authenticity of the image. They have merely used a different image of Godane. This does not support your contention that the image which is being discussed here, which is used by sources more reliable and reputable (e.g United States State Department , BBC and Reuters, among others) against the sources which you have cited, of which I have not heard of any one of them ( 'Suna times' and 'Waamo news'). 
No, there are not """"multiple images on Godane"""", there are only two: The one being discussed here, and the one you consistently regurgitate. Yes, it won't make the other various portraits vanish. This still dose't help you, becuase through the above sources, it is seen which image is clearly favored by the more reliable sources. This source here,  is the only thing that you have showed me which highlights that the image may not be Godane. I bet you're smiling and clapping your hands right now that through this magical source you have proven the image is not Godane, right? WRONG. This source is meager. It is unreliable as it is questionable. The article is a blog, unworthy of proper accreditation, and it's riddled with spelling errors and grammatical errors, e.g (""""Hammami is still advocating for Robow’s troopss."""") Are you kidding me? The author can't even spell, and you're taking this blog over acclaimed sources such as Reuters or the U.S State Department. Wow is all I can say. Furthermore, the blog doesn't identity which picture is incorrect (If indeed any image is incorrect, the author never cites his source), and the article was published over a year before those media sources cited above circulated the image being discussed here. Moreover, even if the images were used prior, it still doesn't help, as the author hasn't established where he got his information from concerning this supposed 'incorrect' image of Godane. Again, you're going to have to do more digging than that in order to prove your point.
The basis that 'foreign media agencies' have no credibility on reporting in areas where local media is present is just well, stupid. By that logic, any material/information coming from any part of the world which is not from the United States, the United Kingdom or Europe already excludes many of those sources. This geographical argument is meaningless. Ok then, how about I remove all references to BBC,Reuters, Council on Foreign Relations, Brookings Institution, Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, the National Counterterrorism Center (Oh look, they use the image as well! ) and many, many more sources just becuase they are reporting from places where they are not 'based'? Hmm? Seems reasonable logical to me, if we were to follow your logic. What you are forgetting is that each news agency, no matter if its western gets its information from local sources from the places where they are covering a story or reporting from, whether that's Somalia or Timbuktu. This source for example from BBC  is from the BBC African branch, BBC Africa. They will have reporters, correspondents, sources, all across Africa. And this is only one media source. The Somalian media are going to be no more accurate than BBC Africa , as they will not have the extensive resources that the BBC have, even in Somalia but also elsewhere.
And finally, this. """"the various portraits can perhaps go in the body as StantheMan87 suggested """" -. So now you're willing to compromise? Ahh, I see! So when you find yourself in between an undeniable rock and a hard place when it comes to your POV, you finally are willing to take a compromise that was offered to you by , which you rejected?

If you wish to have my help on Commons, please leave me a note there.
7 - I briefly looked at 's contributions to assess if he was active as an OTRS volunteer on Commons. The copyright violations seemed blatant to my eyes, shocking for an OTRS volunteer granting verification tickets to images. This was self-evident even looking at the first 20 thumbnails, some of which had been marked as copyright problems previously. Commons is short of experienced copyright reviewers, when we spot problems we ought to mark it for review, it is not like I was deleting them on sight, I am leaving the review to others. If you wish to discuss Ktr101's uploads to Commons, I suggest that happens on Commons.

You appear to be making statements based on a time when you had privileged trusted rights and using this history to paint the worst picture of me possible.

My very best wishes, I fail to see in what you posted above any logic,let alone valid reasons for including the statement. The current situation is hot now in a much more direct and immediate way than ever during the original Cold war: we have regular russian troops fighting right across Russia′s border, under an exceedingly thin cover of deniability, in Ukraine, part of whose territory has been formally annexed, which in turn is hosting the US intelligence and military advisors and personnel. But that is extraneous to the subject of discussion here. As i said above, I am not claiming that Putin′s words on 40 missiles are not """"important"""". I say that the exact meaning of those words, without a broader context and expertise info on the subject, is not clear (See my post above), and consequently the quote alone would stick out as a meaningless (or puzzling) throw-in. Then, you said above """"Russian nuclear weapons are actually in a workable state"""". May I ask you: Whose opinion is that? And what does it matter? The RF nuclear arsenal has NEVER been used in actual battle and thus its actual battleworthiness (which includes a wide gamut of capabilities, apart from just having warheads and delivery systems that can deliver unhindered in a situation where no one actually hinders) is a matter of assessment and supposition. That said, there is an overwhelming body of experts′ opinion that this arsenal IS formidable and capable of destroying the US both in a putative first strike and in a retaliatory strike, in a guaranteed way, even in a situation where the entire political and military leadership of Russia is destroyed (See Dead Hand (nuclear war)). I hear your point about """"this is all not about real capabilities, but about intentions and decisions that can be completely illogical"""". But where do you see any intentions, or illogical decisions in those words by Putin? He does appear to be boasting (by quite possibly lying as is common in such matters), but what is his intent? The most likely intent to be deduced from his words: he is trying to pull the wool over the eyes, and hide the rapid rate of the shrinking of the RF arsenal. But that is a speculation. If you can find an expert′s analysis of these words, then it may well be interesting and notable.  """,0

I know very well the ex-premie sites are antagonistic towards Mr Ji and that nothing must ever be published that calls into question his good name and the multiple money-collecting organisations run in his name. This is an important piece of international law, with which every article in wikipedia must comply with as at present, under pain of persecution from the latter-day Praetorian Guard. Your contributions will be mercilessly deleted by a handful of premies whose spiritual path has led them to be the guardians of the premie-controlled pages in wikipedia.

I see that you've changed Acosta back to de Acosta, which is fine since that's how she's identified in the Wikipedia entry. Vieira refers to her as Acosta. Other biographers refer only to Mercedes. Anyway, many surnames in the romance languages derived from placeslocations, like towns or territories. So it's like referring to her as """"of the seashore"""" instead of just """"Seashore."""" Anyway, I suppose both will do so I'm untroubled by your reversion. Don't really care.

The Acosta page needs to be updated based on a new biography of her by Bob Shanke, interestingly, a theatre historian. There there is also at least one major error in Wikipedia. The author says, """"The two [Garbo and de Acosta] were introduced to one another by de Acosta's lover at the time, author Salka Viertel."""" This assertion is simply false. Accd to the authors of the 3 biographies I read of G, Acosta didn't even know Viertel before she met G. G asked Viertel to introduce them and Viertel called Acosta up out of the blue. Oh well, at this point it's someone else's problem to correct. Well, maybe I'll correct this one thing since I'm at it here. I'm not interested in reading a bio of Acostaat least for the time being. I learned enough about her from the G bios. I'm trying to find time to rewrite the section agbout G's affairs but I have to read about them all over again for accuracy. Happy to see your anal self back at work! I know you're always there to review my revisions!  

Just made some changes and corrections to the Acosta page but it was stupid since the page is absolutely terrible. Hopeless. No citations, terribly written, completely untrustworthy.

Yeah, I knew the de Acosta thing was questionable, which is why the unusually detailed (for me) edit summary. I first checked her article here, but didn't rely on it too much (probably would have stopped there for consistency if it had used just the """"Acosta"""" form though). Then various discussions on the MoS pages about da, de, di, Mc, Mac, van, and von ... the substance of which was """"it varies"""", so that's when I hit the NYT. Mostly the issue got fudged by referring to her throughout articles as """"Mercedse de Acosta"""", but two articles about her and one about a daughter (niece?) getting married used """"de Acosta"""" alone.

"Removed this paragraph from the lead. It is unsourced and reads like opinion.

The translation is still widely read today, and highly regarded among many Christian groups. Some groups (known collectively as the King-James-Only Movement) even go as far as to reject all modern translations, believing the KJV to be the only reliable English Bible translation. This is despite the translation being almost 400 years old, criticisms of its accuracy, and the fact that it is written in Early Modern English (making it difficult for many modern English speakers to read, or even understand).

 Misleading reference to study? 

In the section on lead paint in art (which I largely wrote), someone added the following:

""""Lead paint will often become discolored over long periods of time. This is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids, often from fingerprints. [2] As a result, many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration.""""

As I found this surprising, I went and carefully read the study being cited. Their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper, although that wasn't absolutely clear. But lead paint is almost never used that way! Artists working in transparent watercolor (aquarelle) don't usually use white paint, or just occasionally a bit of """"Chinese White"""" (not lead) to make corrections. And opaque watercolors (gouache) and acrylic (polymer) artist's paints typically use titanium dioxide or (rarely) zinc white, but never lead. Normally """"flake white"""" is used only by oil painters, and there's no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints. Cooperstown is a well-respected institution, but as of now I'm sticking with the classic (Ralph Mayer). Flake white may get *slightly* yellowish after centuries, but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above. If someone has more information on this, please mention it here; otherwise when I come back I'm going to delete that paragraph or water it down (no pun intended).""",0
"==Please read unblock request carefully

This why I ask whoever read my request to read it carefully , I will address your points in order of when your address them.

First, your said that you will work with the editor to help make the page notable, yet that is what I was asking for throughout the entire debate before I was blocked, for someone to help me make the page notable. I cannot help showing I was annoyed when everyone who posted on that debate was making negative comments and continued to push for it to be deleted. Seen as I was the person making ALL the editing, it is the responsibility for administrators to assist me making all pages in question notable. I had already said sorry for the choice of words I've made throughout the debate but again it is as if no-one has the desire to care whether a user is remorseful of his action so long as the debate can continue, with or without them. 

Second, if the only party that was trying to defend the case was blocked and prevent not only from actively defending the pages in question, but stopped from actually adding the references and making the page more notable, well I'm sorry but I was doing my best all things considering. Even before I was blocked from Wikipedia, I did add in more reference, I read some of the notability guild lines and did make some changes, however I am only one person and there is so much I could do before I can say, 'I done my fair share, can someone help me finish this?'. But clearly not. I really don't know Wikipedia as well as you and other administrators do, but considering I have made many pages and edited many more in the short time I have started using Wikipedia properly, I can say that I have made useful information for people to read about and get accurate accounts of this. My point with this is that even though I have made massive contributions on here, there are things I do not know, and how to get pages back on Wikipedia after they are deleted is one of them. So if you kindly give me details and links on how to do this would be most appreciated.

I still fail to see why it is disrupted behaviour to return pages back on Wikipedia the way I have, a page before on Ryan Shamrock (fighter) was speedily deleted and then returned back on here, but not by me, and up until just today, no-one has affected that. The user who is suggesting it has also recommended 10 other pages for deletion, however, the user clearly doesn't know the fighters he wants deleted, as 7 of them are/have competed in either a major MMA promotion or a second tier promotion. As he is doing such pointless acts, I still wonder why he's able to do this knowing he will get into trouble with other admins for the similar things I've done? Here is the link for this debate - Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ryan Shamrock (fighter).

I get what you do mean when you say that it isn't about Shark Fights or Ring of Combat when it comes to this debate now, but none the less it is still an issue not to be ignored. UCMMA/Cage Rage UK was deleted for the same reasons that those two promotions, as well as a few other promotions on WP:MMANOT, should be. I find it amazing how these promotions are actually accepted by certain admins and are allowed to remain on there whilst a promotion I've been helping with, that has a better laid out page than the others and was making the improvements the other users were screaming on about doing for it, yet it got deleted, whilst those others ones get treated like they are highly ranked promotions. UCMMA/Cage Rage UK has a weekly chat show on Sky Sports 4, whilst showing their delayed timed events on Sky Sports 3, I bet those other promotions don't even get TV time.

The head of Cage Rage UK never asked me to post those articles. I have always worked by myself to help them with their Wikipedia page, never even expecting a thank you because I like their product and want to help other find reliable sources on them, which as many knows, Wikipedia is the place for that. If you type in UCMMA in the Facebook search bar, find the one with a picture of the words 'Cage' on the top, 'Rage' in the middle, and 'UK.com' at the bottom, then like their page, then keep looking for any posts from Carl Gale, as I keep mentioning to look on Wikipedia for UCMMA/Cage Rage UK information, fights at certain events etc. Look as far back as the 1st September 2011, you will clearly see that not only was UCMMA not part of it, they were pretty much telling me that all their information can be found on their website and their Facebook account so there was no need to continue doing it. However, I kept working on the Wikipedia pages, making contributions whenever possible leading up until their UCMMA 24 - Hands of War event. Once a few days went by after the event, the Head of Media for Cage Rage UK started to post Wall messa",0

You quoted above an expression for acceleration. That expression is correct. I am not disagreeing with it. But it tells us absolutely nothing that would enable us to solve a motion problem.

To solve a problem in motion, we need an input force. If it only kinematics, we still need an input acceleration.

We always need some kinds of contraints or known accelerations before we can determine a trajectory.

Halstead et al. reported that some Iranian villagers with very little animal product intake (dairy once a week, meat once a month) had normal B12 levels. None had megaloblastic anemia. Their average B12 level was 411 pg/ml which was quite high considering their diet.

They also speculated that because they lived among their farm animals and their living areas were littered with feces, they picked up enough B12 through contamination.

Halstead et al.'s 1960 report was in contrast to Wokes et al.'s 1955 report  in which numerous British vegans were found to have neurological symptoms of B12 deficiency.

Conclusion
B12 production by bacteria in the small intestine is possible. Some vegans can ward of overt vitamin B12 deficiency, and even mild B12 deficiency by remaining cautious. Now people like mihaiam may choose to doubt all these scientific findings hinging on their favourite anti-vegan blogs.

No, the planning took place in response to the Winter War. The British government may have been half hearted as Nick-D says, but certainly not the French nor the British public and press. From the Doerr paper Paul cites:
""""The reaction of the British public and press to the Soviet invasion of Finland was overwhelmingly hostile. Sympathy for Finland was strong. The Finns were seen as a small, embattled liberal state defying a totalitarian power. As the Finns battled against increasingly long odds, pressure grew on the British government to do something. Military supplies were sent to Finland along with some British volunteers. By March 1940 public pressure and pressure from the French forced the British government to agree to a wild plan to send British troops to Finland.""""

"I'm not clear whether a picture of a child's genitalia is legitimate or not - you appear to be more familiar with the way it works than me; perhaps you should ask whether images of children's genitalia are acceptable on Wikipedia.

I object to it for several reasons.  The is first that it is an image of a child's genitalia (albeit deceased), which is not usually accepted online for non-intersex children, and I am not sure why intersex childrens' genitals should be an exception to this.  Second, the example in question is quite an extreme case, where the child had a number of complications which meant it did not survive, and the genital ambiguity was one aspect of those complications.  I would worry that people seeking information and support would find this paper quite shocking, and as you are no doubt aware, it is an extremely rare case which has limited bearing on the experiences of the majority of intersex people.  So, is it a representative image (and link) on intersex?  No, it is not.  So, why is it there?  Finally, I resist the reduction of intersex issues to simply being about genital ambiguity - just as I resist the reduction to XY/XX chromosomes and all that entails.  I am sure that there would be better, fully consensual, images available if required - although I am not sure why they are necessary.  People who are involved with intersex in some way will not find it informative or helpful, so the only purpose appears to be either for 'shock' value or voyeurism, neither of which seem valid reasons for having the picture on Wikipedia.",0

"""I believe a number of statements from this supplement to WP:OR are relevant to this discussion:
Obvious deductions are not original research.  This includes simple logical deductions. For example, if A is in district B, and district B is in province C, then A is in province C. This is a simple syllogism. Included are all of the other simple deductions. It is an obvious deduction that Lea's Shield is the same class of device as the FemCap.
Identifying synonymous terms, and collecting related information under a common heading is also part of writing an encyclopedia. Reliable sources do not always use consistent terminology, and it is sometimes necessary to determine when two sources are calling the same thing by different names. This does not require a third source to state this explicitly, as long as the conclusion is obvious from the context of the sources. U.K. sources use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer to multiple devices available in that country .  Many older U.S. sources use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer exclusively to the Prentif device (here effectiveness results for Prentif are labeled only """"cervical cap"""").  A few current U.S. sources (such as those cited by David) use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer exclusively to the FemCap device.  Some U.S. sources include the Lea's Shield under the cervical cap umbrella.  These are obviously inconsistencies in terminology, and they can be resolved by the judgment and consensus of editors on Wikipedia.
Although the English language version of a source should be used when it is published in multiple languages, foreign language sources are also welcome, and even encouraged to reduce systemic bias. Non-English sources identify the Lea's Shield as a cervical cap.
Sources may be written in a fictional, nationalistic, religious or other narrow context. Material from these sources incorporated in Wikipedia must be placed in a broader, more encyclopedic context. Placing material in an encyclopedic context is different from taking things out of context. For example... material written from a localized or nationalistic perspective must be presented in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint... This is not original research when good editorial judgment is used. Taking material from the U.S. - where only one cervical cap (first Prentif, then later FemCap) was available for many decades, and so """"cervical cap"""" is synonymous with a single device - and presenting it in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint where multiple cervical caps are available at the same time, and so the definition of cervical cap is broader and includes Lea's Shield, is allowed and even encouraged on Wikipedia.

I am not attached to the title of """"cervical cap"""" for this article.  I believe the best editorial decision would be to merge Lea's Shield into this article, but, like David and Una, I am open to looking for a new name.  Anon, are you willing to consider a merge with a name change?  If so, we can discuss alternatives to """"cervical barrier"""", which you have objected to. Talk     C

If you are insist on including a picture that you think is of real importance to the article, I will also insist on adding the above two pictures which I believe are of great importance as well. The point I am trying to make is that the article Secunderabad discusses several aspects of Secunderabad and not just architecture. The number of pictures in each section should be proportionate to the length of that section. We have enough pictures for the section on architecture. A mention and description of important structures should suffice.
As for the other pictures you have pointed out. I beleive the picture of Garden restaurant has nothing to do with advertisement. The restaurant is a local landmark and is therefore of significance. Pictures of locally famous restaurants are often featured in wikipedia articles about cities. Refer Cafe du Monde picture in New Orleans. The Tankbund road picture is also significant. It is an important thoroughfare in the city which acts as the main arterial road that connects the cities of Hyderabad and Secunderaabd.

http://rajbhasha.nic.in/UI/pagecontent.aspx?pc=MzU=

Hindi emerged as Apabhramsha, a degenerated form, in the 7th century A.D. By the 10th century A.D., it became stable. 'Braj, Awadhi, Khari Boli etc are the dialects of Hindi'. The present literary standard of Hindi is based on 'Khari Boli'. Hindi became the official language of India after 1947

Where are other languages of India ? What about Braj bhasha, Khadi Boli, Awadhi, Chattisgariya  ? They can call Hindi as much as Urdu speaking people are calling Hindi as Hindustani. The Hindi I speak has more Punjabi & English words than Urdu. The list goes on.

(It took me some time to write this as you may have already added stuff, or there could be stuff already there I missed in the first place)

May I.....  Nathaniel, I think you have pointed out one of the most fascinating double edges of the internet, and certainly this frustrating Wikipedia. (please forgive me taking this time here, but for the sake of your welding article case, might I be so bold to attempt advancing a much, much larger cause as well) 

You have said yourself, that you are not a highly experienced """"welder"""", save for I'm sure at least some time spent laying down a few good beads, yet you haven't been known to build large constructions where lives might have depended?  I have that right about you, yes?  

HOWEVER, what you have done through this string of welding articles, I find simply fantastic.  It is concise and worded at a level properly aimed at most anyone already competent enough to begin welding, yet simply needs to get the overview.  It is as authoritative as any single, or group of books and articles I've read on welding as a hole. (That should encourage, and scare you at the same time). Now we just need to add a bit more about the Art.  Yes, that ethereal bane stalking wikipedia bureaucrats who can't stand things which don't come up in google counts.

The list of unsourced statements you have offered, may exist in no small part, to the very lack of """"authoritative"""" sources available for such things.  I have never, NEVER come across two welding books which are consistent through a """"school of thought"""" on such a list of interdependent items.  It is precisely the effect of deep interrelation, that no two instructors will ever approach welding exactly the same, yet 'miraculously' so many welds hold together and perform their needed functions in our lives.  After the instructor has pointed out the canvas, paints and brushes, than he must leave the student to his own devices.  To hone a skill set, to practice an art.  Practice.  For ultimately, the welders experience becomes the most reliable gauge to deciding the finished quality of a weld.  So practice and time under the hood is everything """"so they say"""".  

X-Ray is really quite impractical for all but the most over-funded projects.  Destruction, by cross-cutting open the weld or simply trying to break it, is what the most honest instructor will tell a student he must do if he wants to know (learn) what it takes to make a good weld.  Breaking things, is the engineeres absolute best instruction manual, and he/she must hold in great regard and memory, those times where they witnessed failure, so better to prevent it.  That is what truly builds experience, and it is only the experienced person who has any hope of mastering any art.

A highly technical, well sourced, and cited article such as this, MUST in some way acknowledge that the details will only go so far before it must address that which I have seen turn the stomach of so many a geekzoid wikipedian.....   those chanting the endless mantra of NPOV and that shit-source of false surety, google counts; That there are people out there who know more than google.  And there always will be.  That these articles, if wikipedia wishes to survive, if wikipedia ever wishes to be more than an ARTIFICIAL intelligence, it must learn to allow by tolerance alone of need be, or better yet, to encourage those who have deep knowledge into feeling more comfortable here.  To collaborate, to offer their thoughts and experience here, to celebrate the diversity of opinion, and even the how-tos and what-fors wherein work can be done with great satisfaction and supreme result, for all.

This largely tedious, wasteful, foolhardy, and pointless absolute fixation around which too many wikipedians have styled themselves as NPOV warriors, by demanding citation on every minute single detail, will be this wiki's undoing.   

From my experience, the arc is held simply as short as possible so as to concentrate heat in the shortest possible time, yet long enough to avoid dipping the tip while the hand naturally shakes minutely.  The amount of heat, the amount of heat the power-supply can deliver (over time, and becomes and very important factor in calculating """"duty-cycle"""") to the weld pool, and thus how convex or concave the pool is laid with filler, defines (for me) how close I can get to the work.  Duty Cycle, is a calculation of the machines ability to deliver a given heat, for a given time, vs. the time it must literally rest idle before it has radiated or cooled the internal workings of the machine, completely irrespective of the work piece. Yet this largely defines the maximum amount of heat, to a given thickness, in a 'shortness' of time that a welder can put into the work piece.  Aluminum for example is notorious for its ability to """"wick"""" (conduct) heat away from the p",0

Taxonomic table

Setting up the table has already caused one fair comment to be raised about what happens to the taxon Uniramia.  My visits to various sites on the Net has taught me that the situation about the higher classification of the arthropods is chaotic.  Valid arguments could be made for any of many of these schemes.  The disturbing thing is that many of these different schemes appear on """"dot edu"""" where they are presented as a professor's gospel to his class.

I've probably already left the impression that, right or wrong, I have a preference to the ITIS scheme, and by extension (since ITIS is focused on North America) looking at the """"Species 2000"""" where applicable.  I tend to use these on a """"without prejudice"""" basis that recognizes the difficulties inherent in having bureaucrats control the science.  This view treats ITIS as a reference point, and nothing more.  If a person B's particular scheme differs from ITIS in a defined way it is 1 generation removed from ITIS.  A similar situation applies if C's scheme differs in defined way from ITIS.  However, if C defines his scheme with reference to B's then he is 2 generations removed from the reference point.  String a few schemes in a row, and you begin to lose perspective on the subject.

Cladists have a stated vision of some day being rid of Linnean ranks altogether.  Given the uncertainty that often arises from guessing whether a particular taxon is a class or an order, I can sympathize with that view.  But without ranks the cladist's tree sometimes lacks good climbing branches where you can place your feet as you go up.  

I think that if we can maintain some consistency in using the primary KPCOFGS rankings, we can have more flexibility with the secondary rankings.  There is already some degree of acceptance that in most cases only primary ranks will appear in what was the """"Placement"""" list, and what is now the top part of the tables.  That doesn't mean that there can be no exceptions to this rule.  (Cf. Wikipedia:Ignore all rules)

So, to get back on topic, higher arthropod classification is confused!  But there remains that if we want anything about the subject on Wikipedia, we absolutely need to deal with the confusion.  Here then is where I see things as standing between phylum and class in the Arthropoda:  
The trilobites (not listed in ITIS) are a phylum with a single class, and that fact appears generally accepted - no problem.  

""""Generally accepted""""? Granted, I'm no expert (I've read a book about trilobytes, is all), but a quick google on """"trilobite phylum"""" got me lots of assertions that trilobites are part of arthropoda.

"""

As a Wikipedia, I am aware of the three main guidelines for editing articles about living people and feel I have not strayed from them in my editing of the article about Paul Offit. 

On Neutral Point of View:

 I was merely stating the conflict of interest of the """"studies"""" done by the committee affiliated with the AAP claiming that the Rotateq vaccine was safe when the very academy this committee is a part of takes bribes from the very corporation that manufactures the vaccine, Merck. Clearly, these people who receive hundred-thousand dollar contributions from vaccine makers are completely unreliable on topics such as vaccine safety. Studies allegedly confirming the safety of a product should never be considered reliant if done by those who would profit off them.Besides, 89 patients have been given the vaccine and died. This along with the conflict of interest done by those who claimed the vaccine was """"safe"""" shows that there is no reliable evidence that rotateq is safe. 

Verifiability: 

I provided valid links, 1 to Medalerts describing the adverse effects where Rotateq was administered and the patient died. 88 of such cases can be found on the website. The second to CBS news in which Sharyl Atkisson reveals hundred thousand-dollar contributions taken by the AAP from pharmaceutical corporations such as Merck and Wyeth.For deaths associated with Rotateq: 

http://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?LOWAGE=&HIGHAGE;=&VAX;=ROTHB5&SEX;=&VAXCNT;=&STATE;=&VAXMAN;=&VAX;_DATE_LOW=&VAX;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXLOT;=&ONSET;_DATE_LOW=&ONSET;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXDOSE;=&SUB;_DATE_LOW=&SUB;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXROUTE;=&REPORT;_DATE_LOW=&REPORT;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXSITE;=&L;_THREAT=&PRIOR;_VAX=&ER;_VISIT=&CUR;_ILL=&HOSPITAL;=&HISTORY;=&X;_STAY=&SYMPTOMS;=&RECOVD;=&LAB;_DATA=&DISABLE;=&OTHER;_MEDS=&DIED;=Yes&V;_ADMINBY=&DEATH;_DATE_LOW=&DEATH;_DATE_HIGH=&V;_FUNDBY=&PAGENO;=1&action;=Find&PERPAGE;=10&SORTING;=NONE For conflict of interest within AAP: 

http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/25/cbsnews_investigates/main4296175.shtml 

Original Research:

 This is not original research as nothing added made any definitive claims beyond what was stated in the sources. The fact that infant patients who were administered the vaccine, including a set of twins died after receiving it and that the evidence provided attempting to show the vaccine is safe was essentially done by an organization tied in with the vaccine manufacturer shows that there is no reliable proof that the vaccine is safe. 

Despite my keeping within the Wikipedia guidelines, I was repeatedly blocked by User:MastCell, my citations deleted. Some were on the excuse of """"libelous,"""" but they were all factually verifiable, and had cited sources. So then I wrote in these same facts again and along with how User:MastCell is acting as a minion of Paul Offit by censoring all negative information about him however true and violating Wikipedia's guidelines as a responsible administrator. Angered, he has blocked me indefinitely for """"personal attacks,"""" when I merely wrote them in response to his own abuse of power by censoring anything negative albeit factual about Paul Offit as """"libelous."""" Ironically, MastCell violates all of the above. His verifiability for stating Rotateq is safe comes from a Merck-funded Association, his neutrality is limited to the point of censoring any negative information about Paul Offit that is verifiable, correct and unobjective, his original research comes from drawing the erroneous conclusion that Rotateq is safe on the basis of """"studies"""" essentially funded and determined by the drug's own manufacturers. Therefore, I appeal to nullify my week-long blocking. I would also suggest blocking User:MastCell as he has actually violated Wikipedia Terms of Use himself, especially since he holds the responsibility as an administrator, the basis on which he has used to block me.""",0

Yes, the presentation of God and cosmology in TUB is exactly that and so is just a fact of the book. If one was to summarize it in one single sentence that would be the only way I can think of to describe it NPOV. NPOV though is somewhat nebulous with this book as we all have discovered because of the authorship, origin and unusual, unique presentation that has caused various types of POV to surface in debate - true, not true, religion, philosophy, etc. I searched in some online libraries, at the Library of Congress and even wrote to the Urantia Foundation to inquire about the history of its official categorization in hopes this would help. So far, I found it listed under scientific religion, religion, non-fiction, cults, and got lost with all the changes due to copyright issues and various changes in status at the LoC. The book itself says it is an epochal revelation, which is the fifth to the planet. It describes itself as clearing up misconceptions regarding God, deity, and divinity. Religious science, scientific religion, esoteric cosmology, religious cosmology, what? Perhaps just writing this in a paragraph would be useful. Answering this would help to streamline the rest of the article, while increasing it at the same time, I think. What are your thoughts?

"""I think the following better captures the nature of the Investigations. The first two pargarphs have not been changed but the final three are completely different. Comments please.

Although the Tractatus is a major work, Wittgenstein is mostly studied today for the Philosophical Investigations (Philosophische Untersuchungen). In 1953, two years after Wittgenstein's death, the long-awaited book was published in two parts. Most of the 693 numbered paragraphs in Part I were ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from the publisher. The shorter Part II was added by the editors, G.E.M. Anscombe and Rush Rhees. (Had Wittgenstein lived to complete the book himself, some of the remarks in Part II would likely have been incorporated into Part I, and the book would no longer have this bifurcated structure.)
It is notoriously difficult to find consensus among interpreters of Wittgenstein's work, and this is particularly true of the Investigations. Very briefly, Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language and its uses as sets of language-games within which the parts of language function and have meaning in order to resolve the problems of philosophy. This view of language represents what many consider a break from the Wittgenstein in the Tractatus and, hence, meaning as representation. In the carrying out of such an investigation, one of the most radical characteristics of the """"later"""" Wittgenstein comes to light. The """"conventional"""" view of philosophy's """"task"""", perhaps coming to a head in Bertrand Russell, is that the philosopher's task is to solve the seemingly intractable problems of philosophy using logical analysis (for example, the problem of """"free will"""", the relationship between """"mind"""" and """"matter"""", what is """"the good"""" or """"the beautiful"""" and so on). However, Wittgenstein argues that these """"problems"""" are, in fact, """"bewitchments"""" that arise from the philosophers' misuse of language.
On Wittgenstein's account, language is woven into the fabric of life, and it is within this ordinary everyday context that language actually operates. Philosophical problems arise, on this account, when language is forced out of the everyday context that is its proper home, and is forced into a new, metaphysical, environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks have been deliberately removed. Removed for what appear to be sound philosophical reasons, but which are, for Wittgenstein, the very source of the problem. Wittgenstein describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice; where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language (the language of the Tractatus), and where all philosophical problems can be solved without the confusing and muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, just because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no actual work at all. There is much talk in the Investigations, then, of “idle wheels,” and language being “on holiday”, all of which are used to express this same idea of what is lacking in philosophical contexts. To resolve the problems encountered there, Wittgenstein argues, philosophers must “bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use.” That is, philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the “rough ground” of ordinary language in use. 
Returning to the rough ground is, however, easier said than done. Philosophical problems having the character of depth, and running as deep as the forms of language and thought that have become habitual for the philosopher. Wittgenstein therefore speaks of “illusions” and “conjuring tricks” performed on our thinking by our forms of language and tries to break their spell by attending to differences between the superficially similar forms of expression that can lead to this type of confusion. For much of the Investigations, then, Wittgenstein tries to show how philosophers are led away from the ordinary world of language in use by misleading aspects of language itself. He does this by looking in turn at the development of various philosophical problems, from the general problem of language itself, through the notions of rules and rule following, and then on to some more specific problems in epistemology and philosophy of mind. Throughout these investigations, the style of writing is conversational with Wittgenstein in turn taking the role of the puzzled philosopher (on either or both sides of traditional philosophical debates), and that of the guide attempting to show the puzzled philosopher the way back: the “way out of the fly bottle.”  
Much of the Investigations, then, consists of examples of how philosophical confusion is generated and how, by a close examination of the actual workings of everyday language, the first false steps towards philosophical puzzlement can be avoided. By avoiding these first false steps, philosophical problems themselves simp",0

(1) Fringe paper. The paper is by Dr Barrie G. Colvin. This is what Bloomberg Business says about him:

Dr. Barrie G. Colvin is the founder and Managing Director of IFS Chemicals Ltd. Dr. Barrie Colvin is a polyurethane technologist with significant experience in the formulated systems market in Europe. He attended the University of Manchester Institute of Science & Technology and obtained a B.Sc. (Honours) degree in Polymer Technology (Chemistry). Following three years of research in the area of X-ray crystallography of polymers, he was awarded a Ph.D. from the same University. In 1973, Barrie Colvin joined Shell Research Ltd. as a polyurethane technologist, specialising in fire-retardant foams and new generation appliance insulation. In 1975, he worked on the development of base polyols for rigid foam applications followed by several years as Technical Manager for a polyurethane systems house in the UK. In 1982, Barrie Colvin founded IFS, a polyurethane formulating company, specialising in rigid and semi-rigid foams as well as speciality elastomers. The IFS Group is committed to the development of more environmentally acceptable polyurethane chemicals, having introduced a zero ODP insulation foam to the commercial refrigeration market in 1988. More recently, the company has successfully implemented the use of polyols based upon natural oils.

And this is his profile on LinkedIn:

My principal expertise is in the formulation of polyurethanes for industrial applications, ranging from insulation products, automotive mouldings, sub-sea pipeline protection systems, various marine applications etc. I have done this type of work all my working life (40 years) and continue to remain very hands-on in the laboratory development of newer, improved systems. The success of these companies can be attributed to the dedication of the staff at our factory in Roydon, Norfolk. Our aim to to [sic] provide customers with the very best, bespoke product for their intended application, backed up by the very best, most experienced field engineers who help to turn chemicals into products.

An equally important part of my time involves my participation within the Society for Psychical Research. This organization gets involved with the scientific study of claims of paranormal activity and over the years has included many eminent scientists, including a number of Nobel prizewinners. Many members of the Society have come to recognize that the known laws of physics cannot explain some of the more unusual phenomena that have been shown to exist in the world around us. As an example, there is a wealth of evidence supporting the objective nature of psychokinesis but, as yet, there is no generally accepted theory of how """"mind-over-matter"""" might work. I am a member of the Council of the Society for Psychical Research and have been very actively involved with the Spontaneous Cases Committee for some years. Whilst I have been involved with many aspects of the paranormal, my main interest is in the area of poltergeist activity (also known as RSPK—Recurrent Spontaneous PsychoKinesis).

(2) Psychic journal. I think I detect a note of disdain. The paper appeared in the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research. As indicated by Dr Colvin in his LinkedIn profile, the Society for Psychical Research is dedicated to the scientific study of allegedly paranormal phenomena and its membership has over the years included many eminent scientists, among them a number of Nobel laureates.

(3) Strange sounds. Did you read the paper? The strange sounds in question are poltergeist rappings.

I am going to restore the link and would be grateful if you would let it stand.

This source seems to present at least marginal support for your contention. I see two substantial issues with it. First is that the material is provided in """"boxed content"""" with the heading """"Concepts, Challenges and Controversies"""" and the title """"Acupuncture: Is It For Real?"""" it is not presented as mainstream consensus or accepted biomedical information included in the text. Second it also states, """"In the United States, AA [Acupuncture Analgesia] has not been used in mainstream medicine [...]"""". That seems to contradict your assertion. Also the support it cites is for the """"acupuncture endorphin hypothesis"""" not for qi, meridians or much of what acupuncture is purported to do.
@A1candidate: Thank you for presenting this information and I look forward seeing what other sources you (or others can provide). As for your quandary regarding what information to provide I suggest you start with the strongest, particularly those which explicitly state there is a consensus in the scientific community. You addressed your comment to myself and another editor and you stated your experience with """"many of the same editors"""". Two specific/many of the same?

"No sense in removing mention of eugenics 

Here is a typical quote randomly selected from Ross' work:

To the practised eye, the physiognomy of certain groups unmistakably proclaims inferiority of type.  I have seen gatherings of the foreign-born in which narrow and sloping foreheads were the rule.  The shortness and smallness of the crania were very noticeable.  There was much facial asymmetry.  Among the women, beauty, aside from the fleeting, epidermal bloom of girlhood, was quite lacking.  In every face, there was something wrong  lips thick, mouth coarse, upper lip too long, cheek-bones too high, chin poorly formed, the bridge of the nose hollowed, the base of the nose tilted, or else the whole face prognathous.  There were so many sugar-loaf heads, moon-faces, slit mouths, lantern-jaws, and goose-bill noses that one might imagine a malicious jinn had amused himself by casting human beings in a set of skew-molds discarded by the Creator.",0

The BBC includes Iran with China and Azerbaijan as related protests. 
The AFP (Whatever that is) says that Iran is different from the Arab countries, but also uses Arab spring to refer to the protesters there.  At four days old, it's the second oldest source on the front page. 
The oldest article, coming from The Telegraph, doesn't provide any indications either way.

Political comments on ancient times articles
While it's good that you want to prevent disruption to articles, I would thank you to please not use the talk pages of ancient times stuff to discuss contemporany political stuff as you did on Talk:Alexander the Great. See the WP:TALK wikipedia style guideline on commenting on talk pages   

The point was to address the recurring references that suggest """"Macedonia wasn't Greek"""" in the Alexander Talk pages. Clearly their intent is political in nature and some sort of disclaimer seemed in order to prevent unauthentic contributions. 

Although I disagree with your choice to completely remove a disclaimer in the Alexander talk page (not the main article) as I mentioned in your own talk page I will accept the removal( since I'm new here and bow to your wisdom). I only ask that you please consider my concerns that the talk page is heavily politicized already.

  

You are right that the talk page can get very politized (it changes with time as old discussions get archived, and new discussions get opened). A warning (not a disclaimer) could be good, but it ought to be at the top of the page (with the other boxes at the top of the talk page) and be very short and neutral, and its rationale should rely on historical sources for ancient times, and not on the current political situation. Sorry for taking so long, but I had stuff to do outside of wikipedia.   

Would it be possible for you to add the warning Enric? This way if could be done to your own satisfaction?  

I made a short warning. It's all I could think of. I copied the code from Talk:Homeopathy.

Hey, how's it goin' Ginkgo100? I had a couple ideas I wanted to bounce off another editor to see what they thought: you’re the editor. Here's what’s going on in my head:

First; I was looking at the Bill Ritter (politician) article a little while ago and thinking it was a little dull. You scored that good shot of Ritter at the CDC, and that's about all the color we've got. So, I stopped by Ritter's campaign site (http://www.ritterforgovernor.com) and found a great screenshot off KUSA of the latest poll numbers (drop by and take a look if you can). I thought maybe this might be worth uploading (if applicable; didn't check yet) and using in the Ritter article and Colorado gubernatorial election, 2006. What do you think?

In a related thought, I stumbled upon the video of the Ritter/Beauprez debates from Aug. 11 (Here's a link ). Other articles I've read have contained video, but this one might be a little to long (any thoughts?) and may not be material appropriate or applicable to upload onto Wikipedia.

Second, I'm going to plunge into a clean-up effort that looks a little challenging over at National Western Stock Show (take a look and you'll see what I mean). If you can, and you like what's one of my favorite events in Denver, drop by the article and help me out a little.

FROM THE TIMES

""""The sudden loss of pressure in an airliner cabin, as occurred on the Ryanair flight, is a frightening and potentially painful experience for passengers but it is does not usually endanger the aircraft. Half a dozen episodes of rapid pressure loss have been suffered by airliners over the past year.

Pilots follow a standard procedure if the cabin pressure suddenly drops while at cruising altitude. They don the oxygen masks which are constantly at their shoulder and put the aircraft into an emergency descent to about 8,000ft above sea-level, the altitude at which the air becomes comfortably breathable.

At the same time the crew would have declared an emergency to the en-route air traffic control and requested immediate clearance to the lower altitude and landing at a nearby airport. In the meantime the oxygen masks will have deployed automatically to supply passengers and other crew during the descent.

The Ryanair Boeing 737 performed exactly this procedure after it suffered pressure loss. The pilots descended from about 35,000ft to 8,000ft in five minutes, according to the authorities at Limoges airport, where it landed. The media and passengers may call such manoeuvres a """"plunge"""" or a """"free fall"""", but the descent rate of about 5,600ft per minute is perfectly controlled and within the normal performance of the aircraft — assuming that all its flight systems are functioning.""""""",0
"""
Oxonian2006, my tone may sound a bit out of control but I'm not. Issues like this one are very important to me due to my own family history. Now, going further into your comment...unfortunately the knowledge of the occupation of Poland is not as universal as you may think. To many """"the Nazis"""" does not mean the Germans as you suggested. Poland was not occupied by the """"Nazis"""" who came from """"Greenland or Mars"""" or """"Nazi allies"""". Poland was occupied by the Nazi Germany or German Army (Wehrmacht) and at the beginning of the war also by the Soviet Union or Red Army. There were no other German allied troops occupying Poland unless you count Italian, Spanish and other Waffen SS troops marching to the Eastern Front. """"The German-led Nazi occupation"""" you suggested is also incorrect, there was no such thing. Half of Poland was incorporated into the Third Reich with their citizens either murdered or expelled into the """"General Government"""" which was created and %100 controlled by the Nazi Germany, nobody else. 
Therefore he """"Nazi"""" is NOT a perfectly good word to use in this case and never will be.
Now, about the Polanski who in your opinion is not a Holocaust survivor. Well...he escaped the Cracow Ghetto on the way to the extermination camp. He would be dead otherwise. Then he barely survived hiding at sympathetic to him farmers barn avoiding the Germans who would kill him immediately if found. Every Jew hiding outside the Ghettos was immediately shot by the Germans. His rescuers and rescuers family was also killed.  I don't dare to suggest that you did not know about that. Every Jew who survived the war in Poland is a Holocaust survivor and it does not matter if he managed to survive Auschwitz, Cracow Ghetto or by hiding in the forest. They all survived that hell, so did Polanski.  """,0

On 27 July you deleted some information from the See also section - see your diff. I have reverted your deletion for the following reason:
The Manual of Style/Layout gives relevant advice at WP:SEEALSO. It states “Editors should provide a brief annotation when a link's relevance is not immediately apparent, when the meaning of the term may not be generally known, or when the term is ambiguous. For example:

 Palair Macedonian Airlines Flight 301 

Good article, have added the photo and changed the infobox. The latest infobox can be found at [[Template:Infobox aircraft occurrence}}. When you've creates an article it is usual to open the talk page with a project banner;in this case

The B-clas checklist doesn't have to be filled out as it is frowned upon to self assess higher than start class, but it is good manners to include it so the assessor can get on with the job. Happy editting/article writing  .

 Should Joseph Baldwin Academy be nominated for AfD? 

Hi William. Can you look at Joseph Baldwin Academy and see if you think it should be nominated for AfD? I can't establish any notability at all; no qualifying coverage at all. The article is about a summer program for kids that takes place at Truman State University. The whole thing simply looks like an advertisement or brochure for the program and all the sourcing is to the program's own website pages. The article even has the program's Summer 2012 schedule. Also, if you look at the talk page, the article has been written solely by their students as a project. If you think it should be nominated, can you start the AfD? I don't know how to do it. Thanks! 76.189.114.163  
This is not the type of article I know the WP criteria for. Yes I do alot of AFDs, but most are either Aviation or Sports related. All other AFDs I've done that don't fit those two I doubt number more than 10 or 12. Sorry I can't help. 

Kudos

Kudos for withdrawing the bad nomination on the Maine politician when you realized you had made a mistake. Things would run more smoothly at WP if we all could admit our inevitable minor goofs as they happen.

Jimbo Wales...is a teenage drug lord from Malaysia.   

In case you can't see the very obvious joke or you don't live in Australia here's a brief background which I have to spoonfeed. Mr Ten Questions is a satrical persona who pretty much goes around asking Ten Questions. In fact for one of his segments, he reported that he edited Jimbo's user page (or article?) to say that he was a teenage drug lord from Malaysia.

Who said 'vandals' can't be respectable? Geez lighten up a bit, if you haven't seen the video Jimbo clearly took the idea of being a 'teenage Malaysian drug lord' quite well.

See also sections

Hi, """"see also"""" sections should not contain links to articles that are already linked to in the main body of an article (see WP:MOS). The whole section should therefore be removed from Democracy & Nature. Also, it's fine to list editorial board members, if there are independent sources that document what these people did for the journal. Most editorial board members don't ever do anything for a journal, so unless there are sources, we don't list them, no matter how notable they are. The same goes for contributors. If you want to tell readers that John Doe contributed to a journal, you will need an independent source that confirms that this was a notable contribution. It is not enough that John Doe himself is notable. Please see our journal article writing guide and WP:NOTINHERITED. In addition, WP does not allow original research and/or synthesis. So unless you have independent reliable sources, all those """"references"""" to the journal itself and claims that """"significant debates"""" were ignited will have to go. Thanks.

-Stephen went to Christ Church Grammer School until 1962 when his family moved to Melbourne. There he attended Brighton Grammer School from 1963 to 1969. In 1970 he attended Melbourne High School and received a Commonwealth Scholarship to attend Melbourne University to complete a Law Degree. Instead his father John Hastings Carew-Reid talked him into comming back to Perth WA and taking over the family stone business and completing a Bachelor of Commerce Degree during the years 1971-75. Stephen received 75% of the family company worth about $8,000 in compensation to his other two brothers and one sister receiving about $20,000 to start their adult life with. Stephen built this company up with wise real estate investments from $8,000 in value to over $500,000 by the end of the 1970's. Stephen wanted to develop these properties himself and make a further $1 million development profit by building town houses and offices on the land. During his university days he rented all the rooms out in the houses to pay for the mortgages, had two children and was one of the 8 selected out of over 2,000 entries to fly to Melbourne to be part of the Johny Young Song Festival. His father took control of the company back from Stephen by issuing an extra 5,000 shares now it was very valuable and stopped Stephen from developing the house himself and in fact sold the house to a property developer who made $1 million profit. His father died in 1986 and left the WA Public Trustee as executor of this will. Stephen ended up sueing the Public Trustee for mishandling the etate and ended up representing himself for over a decade in the WA Courts against the Public Trustee who used their power of City Hall against him. Stephen has ended up having his practical expereince in the courts before he did any formal training and has now written a series of books about the fight he has had with the WA Public Trustee and the WA Government called, The Triumph of Truth (Who S Watching the Watchers). The books have been named after his late Great Grand Father, Sir Edgar Bertram McKennal who was well known bronze sculpter in the earty 1900's in Melbourne who went on to becoming quite famous in Europe.

"WP:CITIES assessment
I've changed this article's assessment to C-class from Start-class. It's clearly no longer a start anymore, and developing some clear structure and order. Some of the language is still a little choppy in places, and could use a good copyedit by a native english speaker. The history section seems to be a little heavy on the subsections, and some of those could be combined. Some of the subsections overall could have shorter and more concise titles as well. There are a good number of photos in the article, which is good, but they seem to be cluttered over on the right side of the article, and should probably be placed a bit more evenly. Also, many of the image captions are very, and should be shortened as well. Photo captions, as a rule, shouldn't really introduce any new content to the article, and should be brief enough to simply describe the photo they're attached to. All photos should also be relevant to the article text and sections that they are placed in as well, with some sort of text in the main article discussing it.

The fact that I made my case in an edit summary is utterly irrelevant  there is no policy requiring me to start a superfluous talk page entry as opposed to making the sources known through any other venue or means of discussion on the project.    And in approaching the matter in this way, I in no way violated the principle of WP:Consesus, to which I am fully committed as an editor; had Swordfish reverted again, I would have opened a discussion on the article's talk page, but it's not your place to just assume his reaction to my new evidence and insist on a particular course of action in resolving the (non)issue between the two of us.  Your actions in this case, and especially your tone in your edit summaries, seem to suggest that you feel you are in a position to dictate the methodologies of other editors with regard to work flow and communication, but in this case you have no policy argument to support this behaviour and no special position in the community entitling you to interfere in this manner, especially when you had no reason to believe the matter was not already dealt with to the satisfaction of the original parties involved.

This was a discussion based on WP:Verifiability alone, a matter that, until someone tells me otherwise, seems to have been resolved.  If you decide that you have issue with the sources in question, how they should be referenced, or the content itself, fine I urge you to open a talk page discussion on it.

"Amandajm: Ignorant Muslim & Disgusting Anti-white Racist
Reading back on racist, Amandajm - I've come to realize that in addition to his muslim name, he veritably hates white people. He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.

To that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are. (No, I've not gone off the deep end). I received an automatic response email from the FBI stating that they will look into the matter, and will definitley be following up. Racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the US. Also, I sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans.

"Cast vs. Character Info Formatting - AiW  

Commenting here to address one thing not directly related (though somewhat applicable) to the debated article.  I disagree that adding bullets or some other form of break/delineation indicates a difficulty in reading a paragraph.  It was something I often saw used in printed encyclopedias a couple decades back, depending on the flow of information and details.   

However, to maintain the paragraph format and avoid lists, I feel the material will need to be overhauled.  As it currently reads (which may well be the problem), some delineation felt necessary.  Thus, I think the entry in question could do with a revision so that the production notes/character notes are completely separate from the actor/character list.  Just my two cents.",0

 Why do procaryotic endospores get their own entry rather than being classified as a type of spore?  What is it about the definition of """"spore"""" that the bacterial kind doesn't meet?  Their sporulation and germination processes and triggering conditions are analogous to those of diploid eukaryotes, and the asymmetric fission leading to formation of an endospore is similarly analogous to that of the asymmetric division producing eucaryotic spores.

 """"TMTCFY""""? new """"Dashes"""" section & """"memorable""""

In your reply to one of A. di M.'s posts in the subsequent discussion, you used the abbreviation """"TMTCFY"""".  A search of 4 major online dictionaries of abbreviations, plus both a WP and a Google search, yielded no explanation of it, and I couldn't figure it out from the context. Am I missing something?

MWC11 defines memorable as, """"worth remembering   NOTABLE .""""  Although these rules might be """"worth remembering"""" in one sense, I don't think they rise to the standard MWC11 intended, which IMO implies something of considerably greater significance.  E.g., the day you were born was probably a memorable day to your mother; """"To be or not to be, that is the question ..."""" is one of the most memorable lines in all of English-language literature; but 
""""an en dash is not used for a hyphenated personal name""""?  Umm, not so much.  It's simply of a different ilk altogether.  (I'm not sure principles was the right word to use, either.

Oops, I think I'm seeing the issue and it is indeed my error.  Somehow I missed that the epidemiology section had a second section regarding comorbidity in it.  I have struck my comment above, and in the future I won't mention it again unless it's relevant to acknolwedge my previous error.  My apologies.
I would argue however that """"incidence"""", which relates to new appearances of DID in the community at large, isn't a good subheading because the section includes a discussion of both incidence and prevalence.  I suggest using a subheading with both (==Incidence and prevalence==) though another option is simply leaving it as epidemiology.  The WP:MEDMOS#Diseases or disorders or syndromes doesn't give much guiance here bar noting that ==Epidemiology== should include incidence and prevalence information; no mention of subsections.  Usually you leave it as a single larger section until it gets sufficiently lengthy that it makes sense to split them out (which is itself dependent on the sources).  I've replaced the section heading (but both I and P).  The section overall needs fleshing out with more sources, which I think are unfortunately lacking.  Searching on pubmed for DID and both incidence and prevalence turns up no articles specifically focussed on either topic.   (t) (c) Wikipedia's rules:simple/complex

"The vote was division no. 74, November 2: . It was on an amendment to the Bill, not the Bill itself (the amendment would have required the prosecution to prove that a statement was intended to incite terrorism, rather than that it might have that effect, in order to secure a conviction). The original result announced was Ayes 299, Noes 300. Had Galloway attended he would have voted Aye and the result would have been declared a tie at 300, but the Speaker would have given his casting vote to the Noes in line with precedent that a tie on an amendment is broken in the direction of the Bill as originally introduced. (It subsequently turned out that the tellers had counted one extra MP as voting Aye and the result was actually 298 to 300, but that is not particularly relevant)

The point for the mention is not that Galloway's absence actually deprived the opposition of the chance to defeat the government, but that following the vote, many people said that it did. Given the high profile which Galloway gave to this aspect of politics, it was not surprising that his absence was particularly noteworthy.  | Talk",0

Dear Sir,

First, please do not email Jimmy Wales about Wikipedia issues. We have official
contact addresses for this - Jimmy just forwards misdirected emails to them and
thus contacting him simply increases delays.

We apologize for what happened.

Let me clear some misunderstanding. Wikipedia is operated by volunteers, not by
employees of Jimmy Wales or the Wikimedia Foundation. This may account for some
amount of disorganization. If you expect professional service, then, obviously,
Wikipedia cannot provide it, because it is not a professional organization.

""""Willy on Wheels"""" is/was the name of a very obnoxious user that laid waste on
Wikipedia. He kept on creating accounts with usernames based on 'willy' and 'wheels'.

Because of this, there is a de facto standing order against creating account names

The simplest solution by far is for you to take an account name that does not
include both 'willy' and 'wheels'.

Yours sincerely,
Bernard Dupre

1.  My intentions after the second ban was not to create another account using Willy and Wheels. I never told you that was what I wanted. I was confused at why I was banned from even commenting and my IP was banned.

2. I don't care what distruction this other person caused, calling someone you do not know bogus as Ohnoitsjamie did should not be tolerated. I was not and am not here to cause trouble.

3. Saying that I am here to harrass and threaten is wrong. I read your incident report. I also read the block you placed on my current IP.  I have not harrassed and I have not threatened. I simply want an apology for what I have deemed bad relations on you and Ohno's part.

4. All I want is a sincere apology for calling me bogus and accusing me of threats and harrassment and then I will go away.  If not, I will forward all messages before and from this point on to Mr. Dupre and what administrator actions need to be taken will be taken. His apology in the second line says it all.

so far...

CorpseFucking Art (C.F.A.) are an Brutal Death Metal/ deathgrind band, from  Italy formed in 1993. Their lyrics focuses mainly on gore and Humor.

Biography

The band was formed in Rome in 1993. With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitars, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first demo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation.

Cryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7"""" Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal oriented. As the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal riffing with techno and industrial parts, splatter movies - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene.

Though, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.

In 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split CD with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new artwork.

After being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi. Between the recording and the long wait to the new cd to be out, the band takes part in a lot of live performances including festival in Frankfurt with Lividity, Gorerotted, Inhumate, Pigstry, Nunwhore Commando 666, Mastic Scum, Master and Damnable and the rest of Europe in places like Sweden, France and Italy. The band is currently, in 2008, recording a new studio album and is aspected to come out early 2009.

"Director, you don't have to sound so WP:OWNY, because I agree (for once), Christ, this is a stupid fucking argument. Morbidly curious about how Balkan editing worked I decided to take a peek.

 Episcopal High School 

Sorry about my addition. I recognize that the """"drug use"""" section was unneeded, and I added that before I recieved your message. But the section 
 TAB""""Recently, the reign of Episcopal has begun a slight decline. The first sign of this was the new Episcopal code: """"Episcopal students do not lie, cheat, steal, or chew gum on campus."""" This was taken to be a joke by many students, but alas, it was not. Additionally, several excellent teachers have left, and recently one of most notable faculty, Holocaust Historian John Iorii, has been asked not to renew his contract. These changes in the EHS experience began with the choice of former headmaster Charlie Zimmer to abdicate his title to Dale Regan. When asked about Ms. Regan, one student was quoted as saying, """"She seems to me to be a Neo-Facist, and she talks entirely too slow.""""

 Name is not a pseudonym 

The man changed his name to the current name which is Mark A. Gabriel. So, Mark A. Gabriel is the new real name for this man.

This is from the introduction page of """"Islam and Terrorism"""";

The NAME YOU see on the cover of this book is not the Muslim name that was given to me by my parents in Egypt. However, I would like to say that I have no desire to deceive Muslims, Christians or anyone else about my name in order to benefit my self. Rather, I have chosen my name for the following reasons.

Reason #1
After I left Egypt, I went to South Africa and was discipled in Christ there. When I began ministering to Muslims in South Africa, I became very well known by my Muslim name. For four years radical Muslims pursued me diligently. I had to hide all the time and change my residency from one city to another almost on a monthly basis. When I wrote my first book in South Africa, my pastor and I discussed whether I should put my name on it. We decided to change my name for security reasons.

Reason #2
I was not comfortable living my Christianity by a Muslim name. I felt my Muslim name was part of my old man. When a person called me by that  name, it reminded me of my old life. I want to live by a Christian name.

Choice of name
I chose the first name of Mark because Mark was a writer of the Gospels. Mark was also the first Christian who went to Egypt with the Good News. When Jesus sent the seventy out from Jerusalem, Mark brought the gospel to the city of Alexandria in Egypt. I chose the last name of Gabriel because Gabriel was the angel who brought the good news of the coming of the Messiah to the virgin Mary. Also this was the name of the first Christian person I met in South Africa who took me into his home and invited me to his church.

This proves that this man is not a hoax, and is not more than one author.  | Talk """,0

"Fine to see things settled 

I’m relatively a new user and for that reason maybe I did some mistakes handling this dispute. In that manner, I’m sorry if I made some personal attacks on FSF or if I was to fast and responded not courteously in some cases.  However, everything I did was done in order to have more appropriate article that will thoroughly describe Kumanovo.
As I can see, the page is unprotected now and FSF returned the most of my new additions to the page (and I’m thankful for that). For now I’m not going to make any corrections on the current text and I will leave FSF to do it if he feels the necessity for that in order to finally shape the appropriate look of the article.  I would like to propose to FSF several minor changes on the current version which I think should be done in order to achieve further improvement of the article:
 1. I think the following geographical info should be moved from the Economy into the Overview section: Although Kumanovo lies 340 kilometers above the sea, it is surrounded by the Karadag part of Skopska Crna Gora mountain on its western side, Gradishtanska planina mountain on its southern side and Mangovica and German mountain on the eastern side. Kumanovo has a temperate climate.
 2. I still have doubt about the presence of private practice “Otodent” in the Culture section
 3. By my opinion, the last three sentences in the Culture section would be more appropriate in the History section.

"I will suggest you to be more careful not to be the source of a new chaos instead of defusing one....it will be most distressing to witness such one again.

You took some mesures who are unlikely to be the right ones in that case, and it will crave a certain degree of familiarity with the subject and its history to can handle the task properly.
Do not dismiss users with longer experience with the case as it was based on this experience that the talk page was brought out. For instance, I received mails from the person who wrote the biography of the affair both for the french and the english talk page, as those din't knew enough about the matter to start with.
If I were you, I will feel suspicious of receiving approuval and encouragemets about what you are doing, from a person who first heard about this affair for 3 weeks ago, second: heard about it from ybm -the drive force of this affair and person who resurected it from ashes in nov. 2003 - so not much reliable as an eye opener and arbitrary source of informations, and third: who has conducted, since then, a revert war in the best anti-3RR rules, and best ybm styles...

It isn't right for an admi to emit subjectiv and judgementals accusations toward users, as calling them socket puppet and other insulting terminology, as it is usually to be found in the mouth of the persons who in shortage of argumentation, choose to attack people personnaly in best sophistics style.
So no surprise that the person who rever you is the same one who used that language constantly against other users before you stepped in, and who was also doing the reverting job as you are doing it now.

It is abusively unclear, what you are trying to do, and I do hope that a more adequate person will take over the surveillance of this talk page. One with the right degree of integrity, the proper knowledge of the stuff, here physic, a thourough insight in the affair and its history, and a knowledge of the people involved and their characters and profile in regard to the topic.
I think here of Nicholas Turnbull, administrator, and expert in mediation.

I have, unfortunately, to aknowledge the fact that your latest actions have resulted in creating a turmoil on the site, based both on your actions and your utterings, and that you have provocated 50% of the users, who had already been harshly provocated by user r-b-j for several weeks and needed therefor the administrators help to put an end to it, not to overtake the place of the source of turmoils.

I do believe that you are acting your best with your actual knowledge of the facts, but nonetheless you should be more carefull to don't bruise som ego by commiting unfully justified and unjust actions in the process, and as a consequence endanger the quality of the talk page.

As those arguments for and against have been dancing in parallel for far too long time, without everreaching a solid ground of agreement, and as references made by anti bogdanov are always pointed at some unclear statement made by scientifics a long time ago, where most did redraw it, and as all those people of science didn't knew a thing about Theoretical Physic and/or Cosmologie, which this dispute is about, and as the positiv statements, made by specialists in the fields named above, are systematically unaccepted for tricky reasons, as are the statements made on this page by pro-bogdanovian, who are called socket puppets for a yes or for a no, I suggest this affair to be settled once and for all by truly and undiscustably specialists in that field, I named Holger Beck Nielsen professor of the Copenhague Niels Bohr Institut of Theoretical Physic, and Stephen W. Hawking, from the Chair of Mathematic of Cambridge University.

I have already made the necessary steps in order to bring professor Holger Beck Nielsen attention to that matter, and would like to know if anyone feel of doing the same in England.
I tried already to suggest this approach above, but it seems that my suggestion was drawned in the tumults of the fights and remained ignored.
I will ask you to make a join effort to gather your attention on this particular possibility and think of how each of you can take part in its fullfillment, in the best interest of all parts involved.

The restored wording seems over-simplified.  It ignores the Council's attribution to the college of the bishops of the same powers that it attributes also to the Pope alone.  The Pope has within the college or body of the bishops a position analogous to that which Peter had within the college or body of the apostles.  It was to the college or body of the apostles, with Peter as its head, that Christ gave authority over the Church.  It is the college or body of the bishops, with the Pope as its head, that has succeeded to that authority.  Schreck does not deny this.  The Pope's position needs to be mentioned, but the position of the bishops as a body must also be mentioned.    
Thank you for your comments. Do you have a reference for your position above?

That seems pretty clear to me and supports the article text in the lead describing him as the leader of the church.

 Good point, but could try to find one that is less ugly? (no offense) Also, I don't see a huge difference between the two maps. — 

 True, the basic data seems just about the same and, yes, the map uses a less appealing style. I actually think that the more to-the-point style is better at showing the Kurdish region.

After edit conflict  including with myself. (D'oh.)
The way your reply is phrased leads me to wonder...  but never mind, this could end up as an infinite regression.  Shall we just say, the inferences you draw from my statement are not the ones I recognise as my intent, or as their actual implication, so you making a corresponding complaint seems somewhat ironic.  (You also don't address my question about notification at all.)
My statement was about a) JS's actual notability being predominantly in the area of Creationism, rather than chess (and certain versions of the article veering away from this reality); and b) the motivation of that editor (indeed, every editor, at least to that point) to be writing about him at all.  That's pretty clearly related to his significance as a creationist, and not some interest in writing about about chess more generally.  An implication of a """"pretext to promote a creationist agenda"""" does not appear to correlate with what I said at all.  (What I had in mind was more, increasing similarity to dust-jacket prose, and AA being reluctsnt to acknowledge this about his relative notabilities.)
Your """"false comparison"""" is likewise, nothing like any I was making.  JS is very notable as a Creationist, being a bucketload-selling author on such topics, as well as an internet celeb, which certainly merits an article, which in turn requires some discussion of his prowess  and distinctly lesser notability  as a chess player.  He's not so notable as a chess player that he would ordinarily have an article purely on him as such, and I see no reason to include every possible fact about him as a chess player, out of proportion to actual notability.
At any rate, if your evidence on the RFAr page stands as is, I shall feel compelled to respond to dispute your assertions about my comment.  I was rather hoping to keep out of the whole mess, personally, going as it largely does to """"does privacy policy completely trump autobiography concerns"""", about which I have opinions, but little direct involvement.  I'd like to ask you to withdraw them, or at least, to rephrase.   """,0

"Selena removed - here's why 

I see that Selena was on this list as having a stamp issued in 2006. I have removed her due to the fact that there were stamps, but they weren't issued by the USPS. The Selena stamps were issued by a company called Premier Postage. Their site claims to produce stamps using themes that are licensed by various folks that can be used as postage (the site also claims the USPS has authorized this). In Selena's case it appears her estate licensed her image to this company and they produced stamps. While these stamps may be valid for US postage, I feel she doesn't qualify for this list due to the stamps being issued by a private firm and not by the USPS.

"If you want a section on the Hamas Charter, that section has to be a summary of what the Hamas Charter contains. Instead, what we have here is a selection of quotes meant to push a certain arguement, that being that Hamas does not recognize Israel. There are two options which can be taken to make this section NPOV. The article needs to be rewritten or expanded such that it accurately graps ALL of the Charter, with references not only to its policies towards Israel, but its social and economic policies and ambitions as well. Since the majority of Hamas' efforts are directed to domestic efforts and not terrorist activities, those aspects of its charter should not be shoved aside. The other option of course is to provide the link to the charter which can easily be read by anyone remotely interested in the document. I'd opt for the second, since a comprehensive and NPOV summary of the charter would consume alot of space, despite not being really necessary in an encyclopedic entry.",0

Look, I am a proud former US Marine, so I am as against """"Terrorisim"""" as anyone. I don not consider the IRA """"Terrorists"""" in the same vein as Al Qaida, HAMAS or Hezbollah, or for that matter the UVF or UDA. The reason for thuis, is that unlike all these other groups, the VAST majority of IRA victims have been Soldiers, Police or Loyalist terrorists. Having said that, I have never once put any bias into either the PIRA or INLA articles. The fact is that """"Lost Lives"""", British Rights Watch, the US State Dept. and Janes Intelligence, ALL, quote the same numbers and figures I have for both the IRA and INLA. The difference between you and I, is that I use multiple sources, where as you use 1 source. CAIN is a estimate of figures, which are disputed by all the other aforementioned sources. You can't keep reverting a page, just because you are unaware of a siurce, or because it doesen't fit in with your personal beliefs. CNN just had a whole article on how schools are not allowing students in High School and Mid School to use Wikipedia for report's, because Wikipedia has so many articles with factual errors. this isn't the fault of Wikipedia, but of people such as yourself, who are either to lazy, to biased or to arrogant to allow for facts to be presented that conflict with your own views.

For example. The Council On Foreign Relations (a highly admired US think tank), says the following under the group """"Loyalist Paramilitaries"""" FAQ.

""""Have the loyalist groups targeted civilians?

Yes—and more frequently than the IRA. Between 1968 and 1998, loyalist paramilitaries killed an estimated 864 civilians (most of them Catholic), compared with an estimated 528 civilians (most of them Protestant) killed by the IRA. Experts say loyalist groups have often acted out of religious hatred, while the IRA has more often targeted British security officers—killing more than 1,000 of them—in an effort to further its political goal of ejecting the British from Northern Ireland"""" .
(end)

That is from a highly regarded source, and also Jane's intelligence, British Rights Watch, and """"Lost Lives"""" give the exact same number of IRA innocent victims vs UDA/UVF/LVF victims. I put this in the article and properly sourced it, yet it has been continually reverted by you to claim that the IRA has killed more innocent civillians then """"any other group in Northern reland"""". That is just factually wrong. Even CAIN research shows that the Loyalist groups have killed more civillians then the IRA. The above mentioned sources also give almost identical numbers to the Number of overall IRA victims, and breaks them down into Soldier, SAS, Police, UDR, UDA/UVF/LVF and so on. The number of IRA/Sinn Fein or INLA members killed by Loyalist groups is given at 45 in total from 1969-2001. Of this number 20 were Sinn Fein, 10 were IRA and 15 were INLA. The number of UDA/UVF/LVF and other loyalist terrorists killed by the IRA and INLA is given as 110. 90 are attributed to the IRA from 1969-1998, and 20 are attributed to the INLA from 1976-2001. Those are the numbers, I didn't make them up, if you have issue with them, go complain to the above sources. For these figures to not be included in the PIRA and INLA articles is an insult to the work I did trying to find all of them, from such different sources. I have made a concerted effort to not delete any of your information, I have added to it, but not removed anyhting....all I ask is the same courtesey.""",0

"""

  kinda.  I'll partially reverse that, for three reasons.  The main one stems from the argument I'm having on Wrestlemania XXVIII vis-a-vis the Daniel Bryan cash-in and the concept that appears to be getting rammed down my throat of WP:Crystal, even though I have demonstrated that not to be the case over there.  If putting Bryan, by the nature of the program and at this point and time, on the Mania XXVIII card is WP:Crystal, then the concept of the strippage and any Raw title match in Hampton, VA tomorrow night (7/25) is also, technically, WP:Crystal as well.

This redoubles when you look at the second reason.  We now know that SOMETHING is going on between Punk and WWE, and that this grand angle is going a fairly new and viral direction.  Still, end of the day, we can't source that he's under contract, but they are keeping it well under wraps.

The third reason is a timeline continuity-break in the storyline.  The best I can say (and what I posted today) is that the current title status is unknown.  Consider the following from the storyline:  The Board meeting which ended McMahon's tenure took place several hours before McMahon announced the tournament.  So, is the tournament valid?  Is the final valid?  Now, consider the timeline of the """"questionable decisions"""" involved.  Is the lifting of the suspension valid if the """"fire Cena"""" stipulation is not?  Is Cena the champ?  Is Punk the champ?  Is Alberto del Rio also #1 Contender on top of Senor Dinero el en Banco?  Is the Rey/Miz tournament final valid?  We have a storyline continuity break which probably will be addressed on the 7/25 RAW.  But, as of the moment, the entire current status is unknown.  Punk may well be entitled to this entire week as champion, or not even be entitled to a reign at all (though we do have official sourcing, as of the moment, to clear that entitlement for the moment)!

Ah ok, I get what you mean.

Eventually they'll be no more new species being discovered and this job will be a lot easier.

Mjpresson initiated the ANI proceedings and got other editors riled up so another editor took care of the formality of proposing a ban; check it out if you want to verify that.

Congratulations to Mjpresson on not being personally a cigarette smoker; neither were Nixon and Reagan who pursued the war against cannabis alias """"drugs"""" to benefit the cigarette industry; how does Mj administer hash without a one-hitter or a vaporizer?

Time running out on the anonymous Public Liebrewery computer forced me to stop 40 minutes ago, therefore the """"unsigned"""" incomplete message; to continue:

My conjecture (which I will be so bold as to share with you here) is that Mj's agenda includes:

 Using Wikipedia to promote the interests of the cigarette industry (through his advocacy in 44 detailed articles about the chain-smoking movie-maker José Mojica Marins whose main character Ze do Caixão (in English """"Coffin Joe"""" sound like Joe Camel?) commits serial murders for sex and personal vindication).  I personally couldn't smoke enough tobacco to stay awake sitting through 88 hours of those horror flicks.  To reference another BRIC country: a 2004-05 study showed 89% of all movies made in India contained depictions of """"tobacco use"""" (almost always cigarettes).

 Trying to remove from Wikipedia cannabis-related articles any information about possible Harm Reduction alternatives to hot burning overdose """"joint"""" smoking such as one-hitters, kiseru, midwakh etc. """"joint"""" and rolling papers are a handy Industry strategy to get children oriented to cigarette smoking.

 Trying to delete information that could serve as a warning against mixing cannabis with tobacco (for example, an edit deleting a reference in the hashish article to an Australian Department of Health study indicating that that practice could lead to unintended nicotine addiction (which is of course what cigarette companies want it to do).

This may explain why, in May 2010, Mjpresson nominated the One-hitter (smoking) article for deletion (reason: """"It's just a bad article."""") (vote: 4-1 for Keep).  By October 2010, after pictures of midwakh, kiseru etc. were added, the article ranked ninth in Category:Cannabis smoking with 1191 hits a day according to a rating survey.  This week, expecting to win the vote against Tokerdesigner at ANI, Mjpresson has deleted over 50% of the One-hitter (smoking) article, including pictures (all-important!) showing what a one-hitter is.

At ANI I have referenced the May 30, 2011 World Health Organization press release claiming that """"tobacco"""" (mainly cigarette smoking of course) will kill 6 million human beings in 2011, and scheduled to rise at present rates to 8 million a year by 2030; so if Mjpresson says Tokerdesigner is a """"single-purpose editor"""" at least you'll understand why.

So again, congratulations for opposing putting a picture of a """"joint"""" atop the [[Cannabis (smoking) article (especially without any warning that there may be tobacco mixed into it), but beware, you have doubtless attracted """"their"""" attention and Big 2WackGo may be after you.

 Note: beware of 3-R's, i.e. by simply reverting mJ'S edit three times you may violate a WP rule aimed at preventing edit wars; better strategy is to change something, add something different with each edit, trying to improve things each time in the interest of a positive solution.  Mj is a stickler for following the rules and will get you for that.  Though I consider him a stooge of the world's leading genocide-for-profit conspiracy I also recognize that Mj is talented and industrious and may do much good someday (after being """"forgiven on grounds of insanity"""").

 Try to find more pictures (make a JPG file and upload to Wiki Commons, I don't have that technology yet) which show better what a one-hitter is (quarter-inch or 6-mm screened crater for 25-mg single servings, instead of 500 mg in a joint every time you want a smoke! avoiding heat shock and carbon monoxide and dopy """"stoner"""" symptoms blamed on cannabis etc.)  Mj objects to the midwakh picture because it is traditionally used for tobacco, not cannabis, but he also deleted it from the one-hitter article where it was clearly described as used for tobacco.  The kiseru picture is a bit indistinct and doesn't show how narrow the crater is.  The major fear of the tobacco industry, even more than cannabis legalization, is the de facto legalization of harm reduction utensils which eliminate the need for high-profit cigarette papers.

The spelling """"Tacarimba La Tumba Del Fuego Santa Maliga Sacategas Lo Onto Del Sol Y Cruz"""" is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of Side By Side By Sondheim (available for rental only). This version of the song, however, misspells Llanfair PG (presumably to approximate the pronunciation), and has the lyric """"...today's the last I'll be spreading"""" rather than """"spending"""". It would seem, therefore, that this source cannot be considered canonical. This rendering of the place name does accord with Millicent Martin's recording on the Side By Side By Sondheim cast album, however.

The published version of the song, as contained in The Hansen Treasury of Stephen Sondheim Songs (Charles Hansen Music & Books, 1977), has the lyric printed as """"Tacarembo la Tumbe del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz"""", and, being a printed source (as opposed to handwritten, as is the vocal score), can presumably be considered definitive. Linda Lavin's pronunciation on the original cast recording of The Mad Show (for which the song was written) follows this spelling, which would suggest that the printed version is correct.

Anyone have any thoughts on the addition of Bernard Lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians?  Since Augustine, Aquinas are listed and Lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of Catholic philosophers, I thought he would be a good addition to the list.

I didn't write the sentence about the biblical references, I merely supplied them. I don't remember who  wrote the sentence.  However, a federal circuit court, wrote, (one of my deleted references):

The following was excerpted from Iannaccone v. Law, 142 F.3d 553 (2d Cir. 1998):

The right to proceed pro se in civil actions in federal courts is guaranteed by 28 U.S.C. § 1654, which provides: """"In all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel as, by the rules of such courts, respectively, are permitted to manage and conduct causes therein."""" Section 1654's guarantee derives directly from the Judiciary Act of 1789.

First introduced in the Senate on June 12, 1789 as part of Senate Bill [S-1], the right to self-representation appeared in section 31 of the Bill. But when the Bill became law, on September 24, 1789, the right was moved to section 35, which reads as follows: """"That in all the Courts of the United States the Parties may plead and manage their own causes personally or by the assistance of such Counsel or Attornies at law as by the rules of the said Courts respectively shall be permitted to manage and conduct causes therein."""" V Documentary History of the First Federal Congress of the United States of America 1789-1791 1150, 1165, 1193 (1986). As can be seen, the right to self-representation has remained constant for over 200 years.

The framers of our Constitution thought self-representation in civil suits was a basic right that belongs to a free people. Although the Supreme Court alluded to civil pro se representation in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 812-13 (1975), the Court there focused its discussion on the right to represent oneself as a defendant in a criminal case, id. at 813 et seq., which the Constitution's Bill of Rights guarantees.

In a criminal prosecution, a pro se party of course may only appear as a defendant. In a civil case, a person may appear pro se as either a plaintiff or defendant. And, as noted, the right of self-representation in one case is protected by the Constitution, and in the other, simply by statute. Further, in contrast to criminal defendants, civil litigants unable to afford counsel cannot ordinarily obtain appointment of counsel, except in circumstances when there is a risk of loss of liberty, as in mental commitment or juvenile delinquency proceedings. See H.B. Kim,Legal Education For the Pro Se Litigant: A Step Towards a Meaningful Right to Be Heard, 96 Yale L. J. 1641, 1646-47 (1987).

Moreover, the historical origins of self-representation in civil and criminal proceedings are different. In Faretta, the Court discussed the historic requirement of having counsel, going back to the infamous English Star Chamber that forced counsel upon an unwilling defendant in a criminal proceeding, and the requirement's gradual reform. This reform was fervently embraced in colonial America for those accused of crime. See Faretta, 422 U.S. at 821-26.

Passing from the criminal to the civil context, we . . . observ[e] that a person appearing pro se in federal court can be a mixed blessing because persons appearing pro se lack legal training and may, on occasion, burden the court by filing illogical or incomprehensible pleadings, affidavits and briefs. And sometimes a pro se litigant appears simply for the purpose of using the courtroom to advance a political or social agenda, or to pursue a matter that is legally unredressable. See E.J.R. Nichols, Preserving Pro Se Representation in an Age of Rule 11 Sanctions, 67 Tex. L. Rev. 351, 351 nn.2 & 3 (1988). Yet, even given those potential burdens, there still remains a citizen's right of access to the courts, a strongly held notion stretching back to the beginnings of our Republic. The origins of the right to appear for oneself in civil proceedings derive from a number of sources, all deeply rooted in our history and culture. We undertake to discuss briefly five of those sources, though doubtless there are others:

First, history. Under the English common law with its complicated forms of action and veritable maze of writs and confusing procedures, the right to retain counsel in civil proceedings became a necessity. By the middle of the thirteenth century, lawyers so monopolized the courts in London that the King was forced to decree that, except for a few special causes, litigants were entitled to plead their own cases without lawyers. See The Right to Counsel in Civil Litigation, 66 Colum. L. Rev. 1322, 1325 (1966).

Second, mistrust of lawyers made appearance in court without benefit of counsel the preferred course. See A.L. Downey, Note, Fools and Their Ethics: The Professional Responsibility of Pro Se Attorneys, 34 B.C. L. Rev. 529, 533 (1993).

 Pornography 

I removed """"pornography"""" from examples of hyperreality.  Though I certainly understand what the author was thinking, not everything considered """"pornographic"""" by everyone's standards is necessarily """"hyperreal.""""  Without delving into the differing definitions of pornography, there's a specific example I can think of which illustrates my argument.  Let's say someone makes an amateur video of him or herself having intercourse, and let's postulate that this person decides to sell said video for whatever reason.  Since it's a depiction of a sex act and it's being distributed, this video would be considered pornographic by most definitions.  Nothing about it, however, is inherently hyperreal.  Someone might be interested in purchasing it for the purpose of sexual arousal, and I acknowledge that being aroused by a digital representation is clearly a """"hyperreal"""" act, but that doesn't make this piece of pornography hyperreal in and of itself.  This might be an odd example, but I think it serves to illustrate that """"pornography"""" is too vague and subjective a concept to consider inherently hyperreal.  But perhaps I'm totally wrong.""",0

I've added this, see Cat#Skin Think outside the box 

 Scientific classification 

It appears that the current use of F. silvestris catus as the main scientific name is the result of a somewhat misguided interpretation of developments in taxonomy. I propose it is changed back to F. catus. First, this is a continuation of a lot of past discussion; most recently:
/Archive 8#Species name, and
/Archive 8#Scientific name
This discussion seems to have petered out into inactivity. It was noted that publications had started using silvestris catus, but no such citations were given. The article in its current state (under #Scientific classification) cites ICZN opinion 2027. However, as was noted in the prior discussion, this is a misinterpretation of the ruling, which was specifically aimed at wild animals and did not affect domestic animals; see this note, specifically reading from """"This erroneous nomenclature"""" and the preceding paragraphs. ITIS was also cited in discussion. This clearly prefers catus as the conventional name, although it cites MWS in noting that silvestris is also a synonym.

It would therefore be much more NPOV to acknowledge F. catus as the usual name. If catus and silvestris are indeed the same species then this should be discussed under #Scientific classification. Currently, this section should have {{disputed-section|Scientific classification}} put on it, because its interpretation of the source is wrong. I would do this, but I'm a new user, so semi-protection is stopping me. It would be even better if somebody can provide a source explaining the equivalence; all the most cited, most reliable sources in this discussion so far have favoured F. catus.

Also, while this is still semi-protected, I'd like to point out that both inline citations of Mammal Species of the World should be removed. The first is uncalled for by WP:LEAD#Citations. The name """"cat"""" is common knowledge and is recognised by all 62 other references in the article body. The second deals with specific species names for cat breeds. MSW doesn't even mention these names, so it's unfair to synthesise from that that Wozencraft, let alone all feline biologists, does not support them. However, MSW is a useful reference, so I suggest moving the citation to external links, or a probably-needed """"Further reading"""" section.   
Works for me. My opinion last time was that we should go with whatever the reliable sources say and F. catus is now the accepted name, then so be it. ''''  {chat} 
MSW3 is the canonical listing of mammalian taxonomy. It uses Felis catus and notes there is some controversy. We should do the same. -  (talk) 
I view this with suspicion. If 's interpretation is true, then ITIS should not report the domestic dog as Canis lupus familiaris, and call Canis familiaris invalid. The ITIS webpage has no entry at all for Felis silvestris catus, not even to call it invalid. Felis silvestris catus is used more and more frequently in the scientific literature. I draw this from scholar.google.com: 
From 1982-1991, 0 uses of Felis silvestris catus, many uses of Felis silvestris f catus'' whatever that notation means.

That's a very a-historical point of view. The church was coming out with doctrinal statements about the trinity, and the Arians were twisting them and believing them. So the church went back and clarified what they meant. That's why some of the creeds are quite amazingly pedantic.

It's also a non-sensical point of view. You can't believe a bunch of words devoid of underlying meaning. You either believe them as they were meant, you mis-interpret them and thus mis-believe them, or you pretend to believe them. But there is no such thing as believing them without having a modicum of understanding. Sure you can believe some words are """"from God"""" but not know what they mean, but then you don't believe the doctrine you believe that there are some words that are true.

Apparently you didn't read what Augustine wrote. Let me refresh your memory...
""""Your today yields not with tomorrow, for neither does it follow yesterday. Your today is eternity; therefore You begat the Co-eternal, to whom You said, 'This day have I begotten Thee.' Thou hast made all time; and before all times You are, nor in any time was there not time.""""

Augustine directly links God being external to time with the begetting of the Son. Now if you have a  different point of view, prove it! Otherwise it is just hand-waving and show.

People are interested in the relationship between biblical doctrine and science. What is the problem with a ONE LINE reference?

The doctrine of the church is important, but what it means is irrelevant? Come on!! Why look up Wik if not to find out what something means? You don't need Wik to read the Athanasian creed. You need Wik to *understand* it in its historical context.

> To answer your first question, the Church defines which beliefs are dogma

Then point me to where I can buy a book or books which is the final word on Christian dogma. Then I can verify for myself what parts of this article are dogma and which are opinion. Don't say the bible because it doesn't mention eternal generation.

>For Orthodox at least, it's a """"theological opinion"""" that Mary lived a sinless 
>life

Ah huh! But for Catholics it is DOGMA. Thus what is and isn't dogma the OPINION of different churches and persons.

At the end of the day folks, I have taken a quote from a church father that directly addresses the issue of """"eternally begotten"""" to explain to the reader the meaning. To take it down you would have to show either

a) Augustine was out of step with the rest of the church at this point.
b) The church was so confused, there are too many theories to discuss.

But to just say """"let it be a mystery! Don't tell them what it means!"""", sorry that doesn't wash.

 RF, Starlight problem 

Dear Slim

I request that you mediate in an issue, Starlight problem where an editor keeps reverting despite violating the rules against providing sources.  

Two main things:

The section Distant Starlight Problem#First attempts to address the problem has no sources.  Those who insist on this section have been repeatedly asked to state which early creationists proposed such a thing, and when.  For example, the statement """"In the early part of the twentieth century most Young Earthers would assert that the stars were not in fact as far away as science suggests"""" lacks any reference to a creationist from 1900-1950.

A section Tu quoque is repeatedly deleted although it was sourced to a creationist who made this argument in one of their publications.  The question is not whether it is a good or bad argument; rather, in a page of a problem for creationists, it is proper to state creationist responses that can be sourced.  """,0

"Deletion of Malenovski and Kiev school district citations 

Given that this is a contested article, I wanted to explain my reasoning in recent changes.  Firstly,  I inserted exact statistical per centages for the # of schools teaching in Ukrainian.  I did this b/c using partly to characterize 48% and overwhelmingly to characterize 70% is really pushing it.  48% is almost 1/2 and 70 is about 3/4.  Partly sounds like 1/5-2/5 and overwhelmingly is somewhere between 85%-99% broadly understood.

Now about the Kiev's school district footnote.  In my opinion, whereas the information is true, it is too narrow for our purposes here.  Citing national or at least regional statistics seems more appropriate.  As for Malenovski's article, the issue was unverifiability of the statistics.  I read through the article and came to the section where Malenovski cites the numbers (towards the end).  They are there, but no original source is named, no link is given for verification of the numbers.  Finally, I hope that wikipedia editors contributing to Ukrainization will continue to insist on the level of scholarship expected and enforced for sources/articles dealing with the Holodomor article.  Citing Malenovski and going to the lengths of translating his pov (in this case) is rather unacceptable.

By the way, I certainly prefer Gogol in Russian than in translation to English, Polish or Ukrainian.  How can you not love?:

He won the Tour de France seven consecutive times (1999-2005) but was stripped of those titles by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and banned from cycling in 2012.

We have basically two things to consider: whether this is factually correct and whether it provides the proper emphasis. I'd say that the first clause of the second sentence is at the very least misleading since 1) there is now a consensus in the world at large that Armstrong did not properly win the Tour de France ever and since 2), as far as official racing he is concerned, he did not win the Tour de France at all. It would be far more accurate to say that Armstrong was once considered to have won the Tour de France seven times. This state of affairs is very unlikely to change. As for emphasis, at this point Armstrong is more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else. As time passes this is bound to  intensify. Since it is now obvious that Armstrong achieved his original fame by cheating and committing fraud, there is no reason he should not be more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else.",0

"""

 And just for the record, I (unsurprisingly) sincerely belief that not much new technology will come out of Newman's invention. Even leaving all the contradictions to physics aside, there is a much more pragmatic argument: Any electric motor design which """"only"""" cut backs losses by 50% (going from 90% to 95% efficency) would be of outmost commercial importance. You would be able to go (with bodyguards and lawyers if you prefer) into the development centers of Siemens, EMD, or Bombardier, demonstrate your working prototype and leave as a very rich man.
   
RI^2 = heat losses
RI*(meters/ohm) = current times distance = current momentum
Current momentum can be determined by integrating current along the length of wire (with dl as the derivative length).  It can be found in the Biot-Savart law.
To maximize current momentum / heat losses, the following should be maximized:
RI*(meters/ohm) / RI^2 = (meters/ohm)/I = cross-sectional area of wire / (resistivity * current)
But current momentum produces the magnetic field, the square of which is proportional to its energy.  So to maximize the energy of the magnetic field / heat loss.
R^2*I^2*(meters/ohm)^2 / RI^2 = R*(meters/ohm)^2 = distance^2/ohm
Just use a longer wire! I guess the mere acceleration of two opposite charges converts mass into energy, causing electromagnetic radiation. Even the simple movement of a charge can cause a magnetic field, causing acceleration, and therefore radiation! If the wire is so short, that is like shorting the battery (e.g. connecting them in series) and not using the charges to your advantage.  

OK, so I'd like to start by saying that I may more or less completely misunderstand you, but (apart from a very good remark about the mass to energy conversion), your statements look rather heterodox to me. Granted, Newman would have to have found new physics to make his machine work, but I assume we are discussing textbook physics and EE in this side note. Specifically:
 It's not the resistive (heat) losses (or other losses) which bound the electric motor's efficency to 100%. Even using a supraconducting coil and everything you wish, you won't get above 100%  the counter voltage induced by the rotation will make the input power needed to sustain rotation equal to mechanical work done.
 Equal amount of copper will give you motors of equal parameters, only with voltages and currents scaled in different, compensating directions. E.g. both thse setups will give the same magnetic field and motor operation:
 1 meter of 0,15 mm diameter copper wire (about 1 Ω) at 4 V and 4 A (stall current) and
 4 meter of 0,075mm diameter copper wire (about 16 Ω) at 16 V and 1 A (stall current)
 But I agree with your guess that the mere acceleration of two opposite charges converts mass into energy. Every time some energy is transported away from a system, the system loses mass according to E=mc²  in most cases an unmeasurable low amount. Also if you temporarily attach strings to the oppositely charged bodies, you can extract mechanical energy while reducing their distance, exactly that amount of mass will be lost (If we keep the system isolated, its total mass stays the same, e.g when letting the two bodys clonking together, the energy will first be converted to kinectic energy, then to heat, and both contribute to the mass of the system, which in effect stays constant). But in a motor the movement is periodic, so there is nothing in sight which can result in mass loss  unless some copper atoms are vanishing mysteriously or sort of transmutate into something other than normal copper.

You have made the same unfounded accusation as the other two editors.  Regardless of what you think of another editor's edits, keep that to your self!

You know what, forget it. The guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here, because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why (except of course to start SHOUTING) has reported me for not being civil. How ironic is that. Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that. I guess once you get to the end, you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal, but that's assuming you haven't fallen asleep, or shot yourself, having read the same four words - Brazil, Germany, biggest & loss (and their million variants), multiple times. Seriously, if people here think what's currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way, perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are """"unencyclopedic"""", frankly you couldn't be more wrong. There's no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation - that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match, both now and in 20 years time. If you don't want it to be in this one, please think of a better reason than """"unencyclopedic"""", if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.

That said, on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article, here's what the opening should look like, if you're trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.

Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.""",0

As for the kulaks, you're perfectly correct that they never really existed as a class, and were invented by the Communists as an attempt to encourage 'class warfare' in the countryside - yet you choose to ignore the fact that it was Lenin, not Stalin, who began the campaign against the kulaks. It was, admittedly, Stalin who was responsible for the wholesale purging of kulaks as part of his collectivisation programme. Overall, I would say Stalin took Lenin's ideology to new heights of paranoia and mass murder - but the foundations of this ideology were all in the system that Lenin established. Stalin was worse than Lenin, but there wasn't a clean historical break between the two - they were part of the same authoritarian and brutal Communist tradition.  

 What Is To be Done?-Part III 

Further remarks are obviously required.

ANTI-SEMITISM.  Could I please have a reference for Nicholas' authorisation of the Kishinev massacre?  As far as I am aware this episode was the handiwork of Vyacheslav Plehve, minister of the interior and a notorious anti-semite.  The pogrom was condemned by the governor of Bessarabia and by the central government.  Sergius Witte, by far the Tsar's best minister, made his own feelings on the matter plain.  

There were pogroms in Tsarist Russia, and anti-semitism was a long-established and poisonous tradition.  The point is that this cannot always be traced back to the Tsar: Russian state and government was far too complex for that.  Official anti-semitism was, moreover, of a confessional rather than a biological nature.  Under Alexander III the drive for assimiliation became ever greater, after the murder of his liberal-minded father, but it also affected Catholics, Lutherans and Muslims, as well as Jews.  Civil disabilities could always be lifted for converts to Orthodoxy, for those who were minded to take this path.  

Nicholas was a conventional and unimaginitive man, but even he could detect the patently false.
Although he was initially taken in by the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (as was the London Times in 1919) he soon recognised them, according to Vladimir Burtsev, no friend of the Tsar, as dangerous political nonsense.  You may care to consult Solomon Grayzel, again no admirer of Tsarist Russia, who in his A History of the Jews says """"Even the Tsar had considered the forgery utterly improbable and unworthy of consideration."""" (Philadelphia, 1968, p. 613).  

Now, this whole debate arose because I questioned Lenin's credentials as a campaigner against anti-semitism on the basis of a single speech with no examples provided.  If we look at the actual record of Soviet Russia under Lenin a quite different picture emerges.  The age-old antisemitism of the Tsars showed little sign of going away; if anything, it got worse.  Red army units were amongst those responsible for pogroms in the Ukraine, to the obvious disquiet of Trotsky.  During the 1921 campaign against religion, specifically authorised by Lenin, the Jews were singled out as a special target; even Maxim Gorky accused the government of using anti-semitism for political purposes.  There were pogroms in Smolensk and other places.  When Jewish people tried to defend their synagogues, threatened with confiscation, troops broke in, shouting 'Death to the Yids' in the process.  The campaign of 1921 peaked in the mock trial of 'Judaism', carried out, for additionl emphasis, if any such was needed, in the very same courtroom as the Beiliss trial of 1913.  What price Lenin's support for the Jews?

TERROR.  Yes, there was terror, extensive and brutal; but that of the Whites was more than matched by that of the Reds, and not just against counter-revolutionaries but peope who had been their allies and comrades in the political underground.  By 1921, well after the White threat had gone away, oppression and terror had become a fact of life in the 'worker's fatherland'.  It never went away. 

Let me make it plain that I am simpy asking that this article reflects the true facts of Lenin's career.  As it stands at present it is little more than a biased 'appreciation.'
 

 I see you've been doing your homework 'White Guard'...We are evidentally getting a more intellectual class of red-baiter these days...I therefore pledge myself - on behalf of the 'Guardians of the Lenin-Shrine', at whatever expense in time and money, - to read the chapter 'The Pogroms and White Ideology in the Russian Civil War' by P. Kenez in",0
"""Memorizing Melodic Sequences ==

Another neglected area is a method for memorizing unfamiliar sequences of notes. For example, a long guitar solo that a student is trying to transcribe. Interval training is fine but the ability to internalize and recognize a series of tones as """"music"""" is just as important. As one of the posters noted above, internalizing music through listening and ear training is neglected in most acedemic programs. What most teachers call natural talent might be easily learned if these principles where taught.

 Avoid Song Removal 

Anyone who feels the need to edit the page by removing a song from the list because it is not 'popular' enough, please consider that the value of the list is how well known it is to the student, not how popular it is overall, and what is not well known to you may be rather familiar to someone else.

If you still feel the need, please document the removal in the discussion pages.  That way, if someone legitimately disagrees with your decision, at least it's easier to find the deleted entry than in the history pages, and the reasoning behind the removal. 

  

I'd recommend, rather than feeling the need to remove a song, if there's nothing you recognize, find a song you think people would know that features the same interval. The songs you know will probably be different from those I know.

"""=Sexism in MGS5, relevant to an encyclopedic entry on the game?===
Came back to this article to see if any progress had been made on cleaning it up. Good to see some progress has been made.
I'm going to make a few points here and well.. hopefully people will be rationale and objective about it.

Misinformation. This article is rife with it. It's incredibly important for an encyclopedia to present accurate information. An encyclopedia should not be an opinion column, it should not overly represent any opinion since they are not based on fact, nor relevant to a topic. I'm going to start with the 'Sexualized Portrayal of Quiet' and sadly I'm going to have to tear it apart. Please put how you feel about it or any emotion you may have about the topic aside when you read the following points;

1 - No other character in any other Metal Gear title pages is given this amount of scrutiny. Quiet has been highlighted by the media as sexist, this is true. However this is not a reason for an encyclopedic entry to focus on a given character. The page is not a study of the media's (or anyone else's) reaction to Quiet as a character. There should be balance in the reception section, giving a whole section to Quiet versus no other characters is not balanced.

2 - Misinformation. """"Michael McWhertor criticized Quiet's portrayal, pointing out that while the game explains that her nakedness derives from a photosynthetic skin condition, several other characters with the same condition — such as Code Talker in The Phantom Pain and The End in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater — appear fully clothed.""""

Regardless of the source of information, if it is incorrect information it should not be in the entry. Quiet is naked because her lungs were burnt to a crisp, the game specifically mentions this and other fans have mentioned it on the page I believe. Code Talker and The End have the same ability correct, but they did not get set on fire and thrown out of a building. I'm really baffled this is in here because McWhertor is not an authority on this whatsoever. Kojima and the game writers are. Source it correctly or remove the information I would have said.

3 - Opinion columns. This baffles me. Why are opinion pieces been taken as reception? They are not professional video game reviewers. By the media's own admission they are just someone writing their opinion about something, it's not objective. They wouldn't even claim to be unbiased as it's an opinion. You are introducing bias here by taking an opinion and presenting it for no reason other than to say """"this person didn't like Quiet's portrayal"""". If tomorrow Donald Trump wrote an opinion piece on Quiet for a media outlet, is that relevant to an encyclopedic entry about something?

4 - Further irrelevant information. There are sources and information here that talk about the PlayArtsKai figurine of Quiet. Are you out of your mind?! What relevance does this have to the RECEPTION OF THE GAME??? The video game this entry is about. To start with PlayArtsKai is a completely separate company that we have no idea or information about how much Hideo Kojima was involved with. One would assume since they are completely different companies ENTIRELY that Konami simply licensed the intellectual property rights of Quiet to PlayArtsKai. It goes without saying but Twitter is not a valid source of information.

5 - Dates. Numerous sources are reactions to the character Quiet and precede the date of release. Thus they are not a reception of the game itself. Hence why are they in a section called """"Reception"""" to start with.

5 - Forbes contributors and Anita Sarkeesian. We seem to have established that Forbes contributors are not valid sources so I expect this will be okay to remove.

Everything else seems to be sourced from valid sources who are professional video game reviewers. Although again I'd suggest that Quiet is getting an amazing amount of spotlight in the article for no other reason than controversy 

To any senior editors, administrators, or anyone with an interest in Wikipedia standards. It should be extremely concerning that this level of bias is present in an article that is supposed to be by and large, factual. 86.40.28.221

"For Viajero 

Well, once again you are ignoring several facts about what happened in Peru during those years. Let me explined them to you in a easy way so you can understand a lot better about peruvia politics:

- Fujimori, as President of the Republic, was invited to a asiatic forum that was held in Brunei, 2001. During those days, The Opposition parties manage to impeach Dra. MArtha Hildebrant, President of the Congress and member of Peru 2000, Fujimori´s political Party. It was widely know that they would try to impeach Fujimori from Office. They did it 2 times, and in the last vote (wich was extremely controvertial) they succeded.

- 16 de septiembre: Fujimori llama a nuevas elecciones generales y dice que no participará. (Reuters y Dpa). Fujimori WAS PRESENT in Peru after the Vladi-video. 

- Peruvian Congressman Javier Diez Canseco is one of the most untrusted members of this failed parlament. If you didn't know, he was an active member of the EXTREME Left during the times of the Civil War here in Peru. He was involve in several scandals during the 80's for his open suport to Sendero Luminoso. He was in China (representing Peru in that Communist country) at the time of the self-coup, and he lost his seat in the chamber of deputies after that. It is not surpricely that he had exagerated much of the information that he use and his open hate towards the former President is widely know. Besides that, Public enterprises here in Peru where already collapsing becouse of the saturisation of APRA Party Members in those institutions.

- Peru is in resecion for other motives. Since when international financial crisis does not affect some countries? you are ignoring the fact that during 1997 there was also a mayor political crisis her due to the hostages in the Japanese emmbassy. 

- The Constitution of 1993 IS NOT retroactive. Fujimori was elected with the 1979 constitution. According to some lawyers, this make him possible to run for a 2th term under that constitution. (he was democraticaly eleccted in 1995 with the 1993 constitution.) It was controvertial, it's true. But most of the power struggle here was caused by the fact that the most important (before the 90's) political parties in Peru were already tired of being ignored by the electorated.

- If you are trying to sell me the idea that the poor terrorist were slaughter with no feeling by the Army, you are completely wrong. May I remind you that it was a war zone? that the poor terrorist where armed with ak-74 and that they have and RPG inside the embassy? Oh, of course that Aministia international will defend them to death, since is their job to do that. I agree with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe when he said that they only care about terrorist and not their victims. once again, this is a patetic effort by yours to rewrite history.

- That order was removed several days latter due to the fact that it created a political storm here, becouse Fomer President Alan Garcia is also accused with the same and is free walking around Lima. Due to political Pressure by the APRA, it was removed, and if you know, that minister was already fire from his post.

Please, read carefully and don't go around trying to rewrite history. We don't forgot ours, but it is sad to see how missinformed can be the world about what really happened here. OH, and by the way, Please, before reverting something please stated why are you reverting it.   15:19, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)",0

He is a writer on the Feathersite, a site that talks about poultry, wild ducks and gamebirds, etc.

I think this is too specific, as not all proponents argue this. Some (engineers particularly) only claim that the towers were brought down with the help of explosives without any assumptions as to who was involved. The use of explosives doesn't preclude Al-Qaeda (or anyone else) from hijacking (or otherwise) airliners (or aircraft of similar description) from intentionally crashing into the WTC.

Calling for further investigation doesn't seem unreasonable regardless of what actually happened. There seems to be a lot of people who get offended even by the mere suggestion of further investigation (which may in fact help to clear the government of any involvement).

But, to play games, to have personality conflicts as if they actually know the people they are writing to. They avoid resolving matters peacefully, but highly enjoy creating fights, building molehills into mountains, and love throwing out wild accusations. They don't ask - they assume - they immediately accuse, then complain loudly. They take everthing personally - all the while - not reading, checking sources, nor citing sources themselves on the subjects in question but adding plenty of their own POV that is not neutral, nor cited with sources. If sources run counter to their POV - then they use ruses to attempt to divert attention: and ask for RFCs on Wikipedia members who just got here, and request arbitration to resolve situations they have not even started to resolve on their own - yet claiming that they have tried. Perhaps, if some spend much more time actually checking sources, citing them, and making sure that the encylopedic materials are factual then, the """"revert wars"""" by some who want to re-write history to fit their own personal views would end, and Wikipedia could be that much more successful.

I've had enough of my comments being taken out of context, then pasted onto RFC and arbitration sections - and used as """"proof"""" of me being a bad person, and disruptive. I say different, and have the right to defend myself against what I consider to be a classic case of biting Wikipedia newcomers. I will take credit for my honest mistakes, but not for accusations that are false. My evidence are the comments, and retorts, and my edits - which, are cited, and soucred.

That does not justify, say your own comments Bunchofgrapes, and those of the other """"revert warriors"""" - who, in my opinion, are ruining Wikipedia.

In answer to these problems:

I suggest putting long boxes under each row of pony characteristics for the descriptions, sort of like a standard TV Episode list, the description box being the equivalent of a summary box. That way the description boxes don't stretch the cells downward so much.
For consistency sake, the number of colours need to be reduced. I don't see the point of picking that many. If you're intending to make the colours match the body colour of the ponies, it is not going well since half the colours don't match the respective pony. If you insist on darker colours, make the text white, so that is readable.
If Minor characters have to be shown because they had their own toy as well as animated appearance, I suggest marking the Major characters with some sort of Indication like Italics.

Ok, the argument regarding the Brandenburg class is this: What distinguishes the Dreadnought type from a pre-Dreadnought? As I understand it from the article the only requirement is the uniform main battery in bore diameter and barrel length. There is a whole list what the advantages are and the only ones the Brandenburg class did not meet due to the different barrel length is maximum range (the difference is nearly irrelevant in 1890 due to fire control abilities) muzzle velocity and thus flight time and splash distinction (irrelevant because of the low number of differing guns and the missing central fire control at this time). Dreadnought labeled ships had 6 inch guns as secondary armament while the Brandenburg had only 4 inch ones as next biggest after the main guns. The maximization of striking power on long range has to be seen in the context of the time, the long range is the maximum of guns and fire control, also the power of HE does not depend on muzzle velocity but on caliber (as used in the article, which was the same for all of the 6 guns) and even the Japanese used HE 15 years later with their big guns...
The other advantages of the armament rest on """"caliber"""" as used in the article (see """"#Main armament power and caliber""""), not on barrel length, like logistical simplicity. The fire control advantage from splashes is there for only 6 guns, and if 2 shells arrive even a bit later, it is even better for distinguishing shots with the non-central firecontrol in use at this time. The rate of fire was uniform and about 2 shells per minute as stated in the Brandenburg article, no problem there as well.
What about the rest of the design features of Dreadnought according to the article? Central fire control was not implemented in all the """"Dreadnought types"""" and if it was used, then to very different degrees. The position of the main armament on the Dreadnought itself was not optimal with the wing turrets, the Brandenburg was more advanced with only centerline turrets. That there were problems like the blast damage was not uncommen, Dreadnought ships had wet guns and so on as well. The armor was undergoing heavy changes before and after the Dreadnought, the Brandenburg class had composite armour, the all-or-nothing scheme came later than Dreadnought and the armor deck (plunging fire) was thicker on Brandenburg than on the Dreadnought 15 years later. The turbine was not used by early US Dreadnoughts and coal was used on much later British ships.
Interesting how ships not even having the same caliber (as in the article without barrel length) are mentioned as being semi-dreadnoughts and the Brandenburg class 15 years earlier only lacking the uniform barrel length but coming much closer to the """"Dreadnought description"""" in many other aspects than actual early Dreadnought is totally omitted...

Also, may I remind you that character attacks are against wikipedia policy.

I have spent some time observing your efforts to create articles which lack the barest semblance of connection to current mathematical research, and to be extremely rude to other Wikipedians when they quite reasonably ask for reliable references and sources. What I know of your work tells me that, even if there is some sense to what you posit, it lacks any context with which to connect to contemporary mathematical thought. It therefore constitutes, at best original research, which is explicitly unacceptable here, and at worst, what I will call delusional thought. It therefore has, in my opinion, no place in Wikipedia at this time, if ever. As I said earlier, call us after the Nobel is awarded.

"Meijer Gardens, American Horse, Statue copyright
Hi Asher196. I have come here to follow up with you about Image:MeijerGardensAmericanHorse.jpg‎. I used to contribute a lot of images to wikipedia, back about a year and a half ago I would make trips to specific locations to take high quality pictures for inclusion on Wikipedia. In doing so, I learned more about copyright of photography than most lawyers do (because most lawyers do not work in the copyright space). Suffice to say that your perception of image copyright is an incorrect one. A summary of image copyright has been written elsewhere far better than I can try here, but i am so out of practice on WP I cannot find it. First, please carefully read the copyright template that I have placed upon this image. The image is copyrighted because it is a 2d representation of a 3d statue. Statues, just like paintings, soda can artwork, music and movies are copyrightable. As such, one cannot make derivitives of that work that one can license (i.e. take a picture). If one takes a photograph of a statue, the original copyright holder still retains rights over that image, rights that can only be bent through the implying the fair use provisions of copyright law.

I was involved in a rather epic struggle between good (fair use) and evil (anti-copyright) people on Wikipedia, one that we sadly lost because this project is dominated by people who are so leftist and anti establishment that they desire nothing short of completely free. Sadly, this is a battle my side eventually was overcome by noise and numbers generally, but even these nazi's must admit defeat in the face of being able to include photographs of statues. There is no other option. One simply cannot create public domain or freely licensable photographs of statues. I hope this post brings to you a greater understanding of copyright of images and will serve you in your future editing.",0

"""
 Wow, I honestly don't know where to begin to respond to that ~ so lets start with your """"talking points."""" First off, I'm not trying to Americanize the article, somethings were changed (like donburi to rice bowl) but they are largely a manual of style issue than anything else. Next off, I'm not egotistical so showing off my editing skills is a non-issue, plus this is Wikipedia, someone else editing your work is a fact of life. Third, Deja Vu Artworks is based in Japan, if I worked for them that would seem that I lived in Japan as well, in which case, why would I want to Americanize the article?  Which brings us to trying to improve the article. As noted before, a good chuck of infomraiton in the original revisions was irrelevant - you do NOT need a song listing from a flash animation in an article that is a general overview of a subject. Also, the Deja Vu information was removed because it was unsourced and I can't seem to find any indication of resolution for the topic - it happened in 2004 and it is now 2007 either it was resolved or it fell by the way side, where as the Netrunner controversy is still on going and received a great deal of notice when it happened. If there is a bunch of information on Deja Vu that I am missing then by all means, point out some links and we can work it into the article. Now, in regards to most of the changes - this article toes very close to the fancruft category and as such most of the edits are there to try and pull it away from that category. In case you haven't noticed, most of the information in the List of OS-tans article is gone because that article was deleted; one of the reasons for which was fancruft. Now all that said, there is no reason why the descriptions of the top five 'tans can be expanded a bit, but you must remember that should not be a full bio of the characters, plus the fact that they can be changed at an artists whim means that you can't write in the matter of """"OSX-tan is always seen poking XP-tan"""" with a stick - that is just one thing that an artist can do.

"Foroyaa: Do you have any other involvement apart from politics and trade unionism?
Alh. Cham Joof: Yes, I was the founder and Secretary General of the First Gambian Youth Movement called the Central Council of Youth in the Gambia, in 1957 and I helped to build the Central Council headquarters at Allen Street.
We used to organise annual youth week and sporting events. All kinds of sports were staged including cycling in which Alhagie O.B Conateh (Fisco) used to participate. 
In the field of scouting also, I have been named the doyen of Scouting in the Gambia. Scouting, which is a supplementary to education, was dear in my heart and I served the movement from 1938 up to date. I was the first Gambian Scout to be awarded the coveted badge known as the Wood Badge by the Chief Scout of the World at a successful training course held at the International Training Centre at Gillwell Park in Sussex, England, in 1953. I was also appointed by the Gambia Scouts Council to represent the youths at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth in June 1953.
I also had the opportunity to be selected as the Leader of the Gambia Contingent at the World Scout Jamboree held at Sutton Cold Field in Birmingham in 1957.
As a scout I grew up from Wolf cum Scout, Scout Master, Commissioner in Charge of Training and retired as the President of the Gambia National Scout Council in 2005.
I attended the First Pan-African Youth Movement Conference in Tunisia in 1960 and the second in 1961. I was able to meet Julius Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda and I had the privilege of travelling with Kaunda in the same plane and we had fruitful discussions about politics. I also helped in the creation of a Unit called the Hansard Unit at the National Assembly in 2002 and I was appointed as a member of the International Committee of Dispute Resolution in 2002.
I was also appointed as a member of the Dispute Tribunal Unit of the Magistrates Court in Banjul in 2003 and I retired in 2007.
I am the current chairman of ECO (Education through Culture Organisation) which is an International NGO.
I do part time lecture at the University of the Gambia on History and the students do come to my house for lectures.
I also wrote books on various subjects in the Gambia.

"Hank Zipzer- Barfing in the Back Seat
Hank Zipzer is a fifth grader who consistently gets in trouble and has learning difficulties. In this book, Hank’s dad, Stanley Zipzer, raced into the room where the Zipzer family was sitting. Excited he exclaimed, “Road trip!” He was so happy that he knocked over the Raisin Bran Hank was eating. Fortunately, Cheerio, their dog, consumed the spilled cereal; the Zipzer family never needed to clean up anything since they got Cheerio. Hank asked if they had to come as well with Stan and Randi Zipzer, Hank’s parents. Emily, who always liked to answer people’s questions explained that they would never let them stay home with the TV remote and microwave dinners. The only reason dad wanted to go on a road trip was because there was a crossword puzzle tournament; Hank’s dad loved crossword puzzles and when he saw one, he never took his eyes of it. The only things Hank could say were wow, oh wow and wowee wow wow wow. Mum promises that they would go to a theme park, called Colossus Coaster Kingdom. They were also allowed to bring one special guest of their choice along with them. Emily chooses Katherine, her iguana, and Hank chooses Frankie Townsend. 
Ms Adolf gives Hank a homework packet which has nine-hundred pages and Hank cannot go on any of the rides until he finishes all of his homework. They are all allowed to choose a place to stop at. Dad picked a library. Emily and Katherine choose the science museum. Frankie Townsend picks a basketball court. Mum chooses a honey farm and Hank chooses the theme park. Dad looked at the library, Emily studied the museum, mum looked the farm and they went to a hotel where Hank loses his homework; Frankie had to give up twenty pounds and his trip to the court just to save Hank. Hank doesn’t finish his homework on time and cannot go on any of the rides; he had to watch his dad complete all his crossword puzzles. Mr Zipzer becomes one of the top five people who participated. Everyone didn’t complete the puzzle in the time that was given. First place was Martina Stone from Cheyenne, Wyoming. Second place was HANK’S DAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well, thank you for your comprehensive answer. You certainly didn't need to provide an explanation and I'm sorry if I gave you that impression, but your comments explain a lot so there is some value there.

I'm not an admin and so can't (and wouldn't) really close the AFD, though as a non-admin I can re-list it to encourage more people to look at the article and did. My impression at this stage is that most editors seem to think Mr Roberts doesn't meet our general notability guideline because he hasn't received enough coverage in reliable sources. That he has won an award for his blog wouldn't normally make him notable unless it was a very significant award. Winning a notable award doesn't necessarily make someone notable either. But it's also possible that someone who isn't notable now, might very well be notable in the future. We call that WP:TOOSOON. In cases like that, the best bet would be to ask for the article to be userfied which means it is moved to your own user space until the subject is notable enough for the article to be published in the main article space. I have a couple of articles like that sitting in my own userspace. 

At the end of the day, it's not really about """"protecting"""" an article from deletion, it's about the Wikipedia community protecting the encyclopaedia from the inclusion of everyone and everything, ever. So we set and adhere to particular standards and things that don't meet those standards (even things that might one day meet them) are deleted. My best suggestion would be that you spend some time editing the articles of some very obviously notable people before trying to create articles for people who might not be. That way, if one of your articles is taken to AFD, at least you'll have a much broader understanding of policy and deletion procedures.

"""Actually, I became interested in editing this very short article (amid Wikipedia's invitation for us to participate in the survey, ending November 3), when all newspapers were flooded with Burlesque King. Nograles was forced to run naked in the hotel. Now, I was not a Wikipedian then, but, when, the landmark acquittal suit was published, I took time to edit this tersely. Nograles placed 2nd to my 1975 counsel in civil case, Atty. Henry R. Villarica, 92.35% higher than Ferdinand Marcos' 92.35% trimmed from 99% due to Marcos blunder in political law subject, in an En Banc review of his test results, 1939. Villarica owns more than 100 pawnshops, and is a very close friend-business assoc. of my brother, in gold and (they have 41/2 ha. Sta. Maria, Bulacan) fighting cock farm. I don't know Ateneo Law School Nograles, but due to the bar rating 2nd place, he is so brilliant. Now, in my 6,500 edits, I happened to have seen and edited like this controversy in bios of USA Senators, etc. So, I just follow the Wikipedia pattern. The difference between Dante Tinga and Nograles, is that, the former was cleared by the Court, but, the Nograles issue of censoring publication by libel lawsuit vs. the naked running, was condemned after Court acquittal for lack of evidence. In Nograles, the acquittal is best Wikipedia evidence to go forth with the edit on Nograles bio-naked thing. Remember the Beatrix of the Netherlands IP address fiasco caught by Wiki scanner? On August 31, 2007, Queen Beatrix’s royal family affirmed that Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau, 38, and his wife Princess Mabel Wisse Smit edited the entry on Wikipedia which described Mabel’s relationship with slain drug baron Klaas Bruinsma (using the queen's palaces’ computer). The changes were found by Dutch media using Wiki Scanner - the entry which states Mabel provided """"incomplete and false information"""" about Bruinsma was changed to just """"incomplete information"""" in January 2006. My point is, in Tinga and Nograles, irrespective of Court acquittal or clearance, the publication of the bribe and Nog's U.P. Oblation run, respectively, with reliable sources, licenses us, editors, to add """"the thing."""" On short edits, I respect IT and other editors, since, it is a matter of style. If I were not a judge or lawyer, or if I were not an A.B. communication, editor, then, like IT and math editors, I would edit with a sentence or 2. But I keep my edits to 3 sentences for this reason: links die in time due to pay per view, and, scholars or readers of Wiki must be provided with a choice, to read more meats or essential ingredients. Also, the libel suit was filed by Nograles, et al. and the subject is the naked run. Now Nograles withdrew due to affidavit of desistance, but, the other complainant did not, and the Court decided based on trial's evidence. So, with more reasons must the edit be there and at the very least, even a sentence, but the essentials of the naked run ought to be there.
Final point. I do not personally know Tinga, but in 1978, I hired a lawyer of Santiago, Tinga, Fornier Law Office, to handle my simple Malolos case. Tinga became congressman and had been well known for this controversy, it is of judicial notice in IBP. Personally, I ignored these, until Douglas Anama, my text mate, the husband of Felipa Borlongan Anama, our Assistant Clerk of the Supreme Court (with the equivalent salary and rank of CA Justice) repeatedly approached me to consult dwarves, due to their case which Tinga decided against him, that's his family home. Tinga is not the only one who had these bribery things; Ynares-Santiago and M. Nazario (remember the Ramos notable contempt fine) shared the pie. My point is - the Court would instead put to rest the issue by fine or contempt. But for us editors, we just follow the pattern in USA bio of senators and public figures. Hence, my edit is well copy pasted from Wikipedia good articles on sub-section controversies. But of course, with all due respect to your edits. Sorry, for my TLDR, but it is so informative. Cheers.

Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos (September 11, 1917 – September 28, 1989) was 10th President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. He was a lawyer, member of the Philippine House of Representatives (1949–1959) and a member of the Philippine Senate (1959–1965). He was Senate President in 1963. He claimed to have led a guerrilla force called Ang Maharlika in northern Luzon during the Second World War, something much doubted however to be true.[1][2] As Philippine president and strongman, his greatest achievement was in the fields of infrastructure development and international diplomacy. However, his administration was marred by massive authoritarian corruption, despotism, nepotism, political repression, and human rights violations. He benefited from a large personality cult in the Philippines during his regime.[3] In 1983, his government was implicated in the assassination of his primary political opponent, Benigno Aquino, Jr.. The implication caused a chain of events, including a tainted presidential election that served as the catalyst for the People Power Revolution in February 1986 that led to his removal from power and eventual exile in Hawaii. It was later alleged that he and his wife Imelda Marcos had moved billions of dollars of embezzled public funds to the United States, Switzerland, and other countries, as well as into alleged corporations during his 20 years in power.

Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos was born September 11, 1917, in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte outside Laoag City to parents Mariano Marcos and Josefa Edralin. He was named after Ferdinand VII of Spain and baptized into the Philippine Independent Church. According to the Marcos family's oral history, the family name was originally Taguktok, and their Ilokano roots have some Japanese and Chinese ancestry. Ferdinand was a champion debater at the University of the Philippines, where he also participated in boxing, swimming and wrestling.

In December 1938, Mariano Marcos, his brother Pio, his son Ferdinand, and his brother-in-law Quirino Lizardo were prosecuted for the murder of Julio Nalundasan. On September 20, 1935, the day after Nalundasan (for the second time) defeated Mariano Marcos for the National Assembly seat for Ilocos Norte, Nalundasan was shot and killed in his house in Batac. According to two witnesses, the four had conspired to assassinate Nalundasan, with Ferdinand Marcos eventually doing the killing. In late January 1939, they were denied bail [4] and in the fall[when?] of 1939 they were convicted. Ferdinand and Lizardo received the death penalty for premeditated murder, while Mariano and Pio were found guilty only of contempt of court. The Marcos family took their appeal to the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which on October 22, 1940, overturned the lower court's decision and acquitted them of all charges but contempt.[5]

In 1939, while incarcerated, Ferdinand Marcos graduated cum laude with a law degree from the U.P. College of Law. If he had not been put in jail for twenty seven days, he would have graduated magna cum laude. He was elected to the Pi Gamma Mu international honor society. While in detention, Governor Roque B. Ablan Sr. of Ilocos Norte helped Marcos study for the bar exams by providing a desk lamp in his cell, law books and reviewers. Marcos passed the bar examination with an almost perfect score of 98.01%, while also writing an 830-page defense. Several people contested his score and a retake was taken albeit an oral bar examination witnessed by several people. His second bar examination resulted in a 100% score, the highest grade obtained in the Philippine Bar).[6]

Marcos became senator after serving as member of the House of Representatives for three terms. In the Senate he served as minority floor leader before gaining the Senate presidency. He established a record for having introduced a number of significant bills, many of which found their way into the republic's statute books.[7]
[edit] Personal life

He was married to Imelda Romualdez-Marcos, with four children: Maria Imelda """"Imee"""" Marcos, Ferdinand """"Bongbong"""" Marcos, Jr., Irene Marcos, and Aimee Marcos, who was adopted.

"removal of a repeated inserted section that lacks sources etc.
Some editors put again and again the following passage in the section on the overview of the dispute:
 The Dalai Lama has “banned” the practice of Dorje Shugden and in so doing caused a rift in the Tibetan community as it is a widespread practice.[6] Tibetan and Western practitioners are currently organizing demonstrations against the Dalai Lama's ban wherever the Dalai Lama appears, accusing him of denying them religious freedom.[7] The representative of the Dalai Lama appeared in Hamilton New York to say that from a legal standpoint there is no ban. However, he was contradicted by the practical examples and stories of Dorje Shugden practitioners which clearly indicate that while legally there may be no ban, from the point of view of discrimination there is clearly a ban in effect and it arises from the Dalai Lama’s words. The representative said that he would look into all the evidences of human rights abuse within the Tibetan community in India and agreed that they were wrong.[8]

 revived / remains 

So:
 What Toptchyan wrote is that after Malkhasyants (1940, and Sarkissian's article is from March 1940, so just before it) and untill Toumanoff (1961), thus """"second half of the 20th century"""", there has been no serious scholarship opposing the 5th c. dating. You (Grandmaster) mentioned earlier Joseph P. Smith (1952) but (i) his book has an extremely thin link with the debate on the dating, (ii) he's not specialised in this area, and most of all (iii) he didn't take side in his very few lines on Moses. Topchyan not being contradicted on this, it is clear that there's a break of 21 years between Malkhasyants' book and the next serious scholar contesting the 5th c. dating (according to Topchyan, """"la publication de son livre régla la question pour environ deux décennies"""" or in English """"the publishing of his book settled the issue for approximately two decades""""). Therefore, during these two decades, the issue didn't """"remain"""" disputed (i.e. no serious scholarship published), and Toumanoff' s publishing """"revived"""" the critical points in 1961.
 Where you perhaps have a point (with """"remains"""") is that Toumanoff's main point, the """"Bagratids argument"""", had already been raised before by Adontz and Manandian. It had been addressed by Malkhasyants though (i.e. Moses wrote that Bagratids were tagadir ev aspet, two titles from the Arsacid period which were forgotten in latter centuries).
 I think the article should represent both the historiographical break and the historiographical link, and I think the current sentence do so (""""revived... continue to maintain""""). I tried to reword it, but in fact, the more I think about the issue and the more I read the sentence, the less I see the problem with it.
  
Oh, btw, no need to attack Toptchyan: Mahé for instance gives absolutely no reference between 1940 and 1961.   

Did you actually read Sarkissian's article? He quotes authors from 1920s and 1930s, and says: 

Such was, and to a large extent still is, the traditional view about the life and the work of Moses of Khoren which was accepted by the Armenians. It is this traditional and unquestioned view that has been subjected to much severe criticism during the course of the past hundred years. The object of this paper is to summarize and evaluate such criticism.

So according to Sarkissian, during the 100 years before 1940 the 5th century dating was constantly in dispute. Thus, Topchyan contradicts other sources. Criticism was not revived, it always existed. If you insist on revived claim, it must be presented only as Topchyan's personal opinion, and not as a fact, because it is not true. master """,0

"""
I'll have to take a closer look at the current version of the article, because I have an uneasy feeling that the answer actually is found in one of the subsidiary articles, such as Lydian mode. The short answer is that the connection between the Greek harmoniai and the medieval modes is more tenuous than you appear to believe, and the connection between medieval and modern modes is fairly straightforward. The """"modern system"""" is actually that of Common Practice Tonality, and """"modal"""" usage within that context begins to establish itself as a separate idea during the 18th century. The chief difference from medieval practice is a more rigid adherence to the diatonic notes of the scale. For example, in the medieval system, there is no practical difference between the Lydian scale and what we call the major scale, or between the Dorian and what we call the minor scale. In order to differentiate """"modal flavor"""" from the chromatic flexibility of the upper half of the minor scale, for example, it became necessary to insist on always using the minor-seventh scale degree, especially in ascent to the tonic, and the sixth degree had to be always major to identify Dorian, and always minor to identify Aeolian. No such practice existed up to the 16th century, and indeed it was only with Glareanus in the mid-16th century that a theoretical difference was made between Dorian and Aeolian on the one hand, and Lydian and Ionian on the other. I shall see what I can do to clear this up (using reliable sources, of course).—  """,0

"In history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view, in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view, since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian. Historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity, while theology makes no such claims. It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell (or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means), so in principle their view is notable, but as Enns said, it is a fringe view in the academe, even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP. The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources, therefore JEDP and its 20-21st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia, while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP:UNDUE. This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong (Wikipedia has no theology of its own), but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. Of course, this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties, since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers, US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. So, in a sense, scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. Only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism. They are free to do this, but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians.",0

Here's my two cents, and probably worth every penny, well maybe half. MSF (Microsoft Flight) does in fact contain every bit of a """"real"""" flight sim (except its way more realistic, environmentally), but you don't have to. That's the whole and entire arguement. Many old time players heard that anyone could simply fly with a mouse and they lost their minds. But you can turn that all off, the automatic stuff. It will allow you the complete flight simulator experience of MSFS (Microsoft Flight Simulator and other sims), except not everyone will have to do it like that, and the weather (fog, clouds, light, shadow, etc) will be much more realistic. Take a look at that cockpit view of the Maule, all those buttons, switches, knobs, pedals can be used, all of it. The complete control is there; only some kid or grandma might be using their mouses and have all of that stuff being done for them by the computer. And they, the fanboys  errr  I mean the serious aircraft simulators, hate that so very much. Go to any flight sim forum and read all the rage, it's insane.

"Appropriate names==
  Excuse me, Logolist, but there's no purpose served by implying obliquely that the Germans of today have designs upon Wroclaw, Szczecin, Gdansk, etc., if that's what you intended above.

Beyond that, you should understand that all these points of view about ex-German places that are part of post-1945 Poland have been made, aired, discussed, contested and reiterated ad nauseum on Wiki during the past couple of years.

My own view is that these places were known to most of the world by their German names for a long time, which should be explained where RELEVANT, i.e. in any historical section. This is especially true of Danzig/Gdansk, given its unique history in the interwar period and internationally high profile politically. A secondary point is that these places where known to their INHABITANTS by their German names before 1945.

There's nothing revanchist or revisionist in naming places with the names by which they were known to the world and to themselves during the historical periods involved. Indeed, it is linguistically revisionist, in a sense, to refer to Danzig (for example) as Gdansk when writing about the six centuries in which it was inhabited mainly by Germans.

I've argued all along that the Germans today should refer to these places by their Polish names when referring to contemporary events – for the same reasons that they should be referred to by their German names when historical events are the issue.

Extracted guidlelines of note from sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2:

To be avoided
 Switching between major citation styles, e.g., switching between parenthetical and  tags or between the style preferred by one academic discipline vs. another

Generally considered helpful
 Imposing one style on an article with incompatible citation styles (e.g., some of the citations in footnotes and others as parenthetical references): an improvement because it makes the formatting consistent

By following GA-criteria I am led, with no uncertainty, to a sound conclusion and made the reasonable request that all references be made consistent. They are currently a mixed bag of s and . Per WP:CITEVAR this is avoidable and unhelpful, and therefore unacceptable, in my opinion it fails the GAN requirement to follow MOS:LAYOUT closely enough.

 Your claim of possible sockpuppetry in FPC contributions 

I justed wanted to clear something up. Yes, I know that in the Leopard Tortoise candidate voting, I said Oppose with the reasoning """"It looks like an average snapshot to me."""", and that the user Tenio also opposed with pretty much the exact same reason. I want to let you know that Tenio is not a sockpuppet of mine, and here is some information on why I said """"oppose"""". 

User:Muhammad Mahdi Karim sent me a message after seeing my vote, asking me what I meant by """"average shot"""". I wrote back with this:

""""This is what i mean by an 'average shot'. I am a photographer, and I don't really find anything in the photo that would make it anything special from many others. The use of flash rid the turtle of any contrast and washed out the colors while created dark shadows under the shell. The composition is pretty average, all I can say about it is that you centered the turtle. It looks like you just relied on the auto settings on the camera and got lucky. All in all, it's a photo anyone could have taken.""""

It's also on his talk page. I don't have any personal grudge against Muhammed Mahdi Karim and Tenino's vote and reason is only coincidence.

Also on another note, I took bit of offense at your comment in the FPC when you said """"It doesn't mean their votes don't count, just that they need to be treated with caution until they 'prove' themselves. -"""", because you are implying that my vote for some reason should carry less weight than an 'established' user's vote. I'm sorry if I haven't been editing wikipedia for too long, but I have been doing photography much longer than I have been contributing to wikipedia, and I have familiarized myself with the standards of wikipedia's Featured Pictures. I'm sure you and I can agree that is more than what can be said about some others who vote or try to contribute in the FPC.""",0
"You can't ban anyone so please avoid talking about bans, since there isn't any consensus.

It clearly shows that, for instance, in Veneto % of blond people is from three to seven times higher than in Calabria, and in Tuscany is at least three times higher than in Sardinia. This is definitely relevant. Now of course you will say this map is:

If we had an award for Facepalm of the Year, I would give it to this edit summary: , which I have reverted.

And if someone adds what the protesters have said, directly quoted and reliably sourced, some editors complain that we are trying to make the protesters look bad. I want to make something very, very clear: the reason that sentence was added to the page was to present more content about the March itself, reflecting reliably sourced material about the March itself, in order that the page not be slanted towards criticism of the marchers or of their beliefs.

Lily Mazahery

Please identify the defamatory material you accuse me of posting.  Lily Mazahery was found by a DC Court of Appeals of misrepresenting human rights victims by taking money that was donated to the victims to assist them in their living expenses for her own personal benefit.  She was also found responsible for threatening them with deportation if they failed to assist in promoting her.  She was also found responsible for failing to adequately file their asylum claims.  All of those findings are sourced and can be found here: http://www.dcbar.org/download.cfml?filename=for_lawyers/ethics/discipline/pdf/hearing_committee/HCLilyMazahery21709etal.

Of course it is significant, that is why the article covers it. But what makes her more Australian than American for instance? She lived in Australia for about seven years, and now lives in the United States where she has spent over half her life. Moreover, she didn't become notable until she relocated to the US. The article covers her time in Australia, but it's a bit of stretch to take a 47-year-old actress who was born in another country, retained her citizenship, and only lived in Australia for a few years before permanently relocating to another country and say she is Australian. This is not like Russell Crowe who also moved to Australia fairly young, resides there and has actively sought citizenship.   09:15",0

Hello,

It's good to hear from you, my tuneful friend.

I am aware of the British custom of holding a commission in a """"home unit"""" while serving with the RFC. I used the term """"transfer"""" because Ball had given up his commission in infantry and carried his commission only in the RFC. Thus he was no longer """"seconded"""". However, he transferred from unit to unit. So, you see, there can be a slight difference between """"seconding"""" and """"transfer"""".

I am trying to bring Albert Ball up to Featured Article status as part of my cleanup effort. At present, I am wrapping up all my WP projects, so that I leave no mess behind. After that I don't know...the assessment rules of the WP game make for a game I feel is not worth playing, and being only a mere writer among all the code monkeys is wearing. And I do have a final draft of a novel to work upon, and the concept of another....

But, as I said, good to hear from you.

  

My point was simply that while one source may say """"transferred"""", and another """"seconded"""" there is in practical terms no real difference between what happened in either case, and hence no need to either edit or revert an edit to switch beween the terms. """"Transfer"""" is possibly the clearest term for modern readers, although original sources generally prefer """"seconded"""" when they talk about transfering between branches of the service rather than specific units. Never heard of anyone """"giving up a commission"""" in the army to join the RFC - it wasn't a separate service until after Ball's death so this just doesn't make sense. Never mind - not as if any of this matters, it was just a thought.
Sorry to hear you are getting WP burnout - happens to us all sooner or later I fear. Good luck with the novel. Is it based on your own service years?

"""Hello, Rajan1986, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions.

I noticed that one of the first articles you edited appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been undone for this very reason.

To reduce the chances of your contributions being undone, you might like to draft your revised article before submission, and then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. See our help page on userspace drafts for more details. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.

One rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which imply that the account belongs to a company or corporation. If you have a username like this, you should request a change of username or create a new account. (A name that identifies the user as an individual within a given organization may be OK.)

Here are some pages that you might find helpful:

Wikipedia is not for writing about your company
Hi. Welcome to Wikipedia, but it is not a business directory or a place like Facebook for people to write about their company. It is a different sort of site, a project to build an encyclopedia, so it is selective about subjects for articles, and writing about subjects where you have conflict of interest is strongly discouraged. The links in the Welcome message at the top of this page will tell you more about Wikipedia.

There's a page about creating articles you may want to read called Your first article. If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the Teahouse, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type  on this page, followed by your question, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Harry Let us have speaks

"""==Notability of Juan pablo alba dennis==
A tag has been placed on Juan pablo alba dennis requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   """,0

 Your edits to The Red Badge of Courage 

Thank you for your comments at the PR.  I would appreciate it, however, if you refrained from copy-editing; perhaps you could comment instead?  There are several mistakes in this edit alone, which is somewhat unhelpful seeing as how I have to now copy-edit your copy-edits. ;)  Thanks.  (habla conmigo) 
Sure,   
Sadads, thanks for the cupcake (my second in one day).  I feel the need to point out, however, that the comment I made on Truthkeeper's talk page was in no way aimed at you, and in fact did not even mention you.  That you think that comment had anything to do with you saddens me.  No, I do not feel that your suggestions at the PR are entirely helpful as far as what I intend for the article, but my comment re: the Novels WikiProject dealt entirely with what I saw on the talk page after I had posted my request for reviews.  It's not the same project with the same focus that I remember, which is why I ended up removing my post.  Again, this had nothing to do with you or your curriculum vitae.  Since we are now discussing it, however, I'm sure you do a very good job in most of your Wiki endeavors.  Please do be careful in reviewing potential FACs, however; despite the obvious need for reviewers at GAC/PR/FAC, I know that I personally would rather have one very good, knowledgeable reviewer than several who may not be as good and/or knowledgeable.  That is where my frustration stemmed from, and now I know where yours did as well.  Thanks,  (habla conmigo) 
Sigh - my page seems to be causing too much drama these days so I'll bring this here. First, re the grammar, I'll address that on the talk page. If it would help I'm more than happy to send Sage and Awadewit  email  giving them permission to divulge to you their impression of whether I am qualified a; to make judgement regarding literature; and b; to have a sense of what or what not academics here need or want. Would that be helpful at all?  The Red Badge of Courage is of high importance in the canon of Am lit and needs to be done right. I was quite careful in the GA review before passing it. There is perhaps room for development regarding themes, but what's there is presented succinctly and is easy to read. Quite honestly I'm tempted to take the monstrosity I've created with The Sun Also Rises and simplify following the example of Red Badge. Anyway, thanks for the pie - I even have a chair on my page, so I can sit and eat pie and fight with the AN/I crowd )   

Hey, no fair!  Truthkeeper got a pie and I only got a lousy cupcake? )  Seriously, though (and this goes to both Sadads and Truthkeeper), thank you both for your input on Red Badge.  The problem with such important  and, quite frankly, brilliant  novels like Red Badge and The Sun Also Rises is trying to strike that perfect balance between readability and encyclopedic value.  It's so difficult to get just right, and as a result no two novel-related articles are ever the same.  Perhaps that's why a project like WP:NOVELS will never be sustainable in quite the same way as WikiProjects dedicated to battleships, films, or even fungi.  A few years ago when I tried to resurrect the project, it was unfortunately a waste of time for me, personally; while my interests even then were leaning toward classic literature, it seemed that many members were only occupied with popular literature.  We could never seem to organize ourselves, and it seems that continues today.  That, and I admittedly seem to work better by myself.  I apologize for my shortness with you; I know you meant well, but my high standards clouded that fact.  I'm sorry if this episode may have hastened a wiki-break on your part.  I hope it doesn't keep you away from long, since it's obvious you have your fingers in many Wiki-pies, and you obviously enjoy what you do!  Y",0

The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

"""== Turkey etc. ==

Hallo !

Turkey and the other states are not European states. Geographically Turkey, Kazakstan, Aserbeidshan, Armenia, Georgia and Cyprus are Asian nations. The frontiers of Europe are the Bosporus, the Caucasus,the Ural river and mountains. The biggest parts of Turkey and Kazakstan are in Asia. Also it is not correct to include these states. It is only correct to include the European parts of these. It seems to be propaganda. The basis is the geographical determination, not a political. Another example, the Sinai peninsula belongs to Egypt, but not to Africa. And Northern Cyprus is an illegitime state. It is the wrong list.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 194.120.84.9

 Hello there, Cpetty9979. Thank you for your kind words. I wouldn't waste my time with the likes of Alessandro57 if I were you, as you'd most likely get blocked by the admins in an unfair manner while he'd get off scot-free.

 Yemen casualties 

Your point that Saudi sources tend to undercount their casualties is well taken. However, there's not a lot we can do about that, as we need to go off of reliable sources per WP:V.  on the Talk page rather than edit-warring, which won't get you what you want. -  

Please discuss the issue on the talk page of that article. Thanks.   

I inserted some compromise wording in the infobox about attributing the figures to a specific source. However, I would again ask that you do not reinsert (as you did without an explanation) casualty incidents which have nothing to do with the Saudi-led campaign. Stick only to incidents linked to the military intervention, not to the overall war in general.

"Are you there? This needs your URGENT attention Sue Anne. Cmon, surely you should ACT atleast this time.

Hi,

Are you there Sue Anne? This needs your urgent attention.

Apropos my earlier message to you, I removed the pathetic PA from Royboycrashfan 's talk page and warned Crossmr against the PA along with a fair note. Please do read that note.

But he removed my first warning and also reverted back the pathetic PA comment on roy's user page ALONG WITH pathetic PA's AGAIN, in both edit summaries.

I gave him a final warning as he repeatedly violated NPA and would not cease and desist.

Yet he continued with his same unacceptable behaviour.

The edit histories of the talk pages of User_talk:Royboycrashfan and User_talk:Crossmr will make this very clear. He keeps deleting and reverting along with PA's in the edit summary inspite of being EXPLICITLY warned.

This is totally unacceptable. Please do take immediate action.

You know me, atleast a little. There is no way anyone can get away with calling me a vandal. You know I am not here to vandalize, but I have contributed meaningfully to a few articles whatever little time I have been on here.

Of course, there were a few misinformed civil issues along the way (which served to inform me about the policy on civility, NPA etc.), but after the block and blowing off a little steam, my behaviour has been perfectly good as can be expected of any genuine user.

even Vesther for that matter with whom I had a little argument would not call me a vandal.

Also there is another admin Nearly Headless Nick who has appreciated my edits to a certain page. 
Also have made a few edits to other articles the few times i was on.

But surely just because anyone is a very occasional user, that CANNOT be used as an excuse for letting anyone get away with PAs.

Also, NPA specifically states that earlier misinformed mistakes and behaviour CANNOT be used as an EXCUSE for a PA. 
If people kept harping on about old issues, it would become acceptable to attack anyone as everyone makes mistakes in the past.

Crossmr  just CANNOT be allowed to get away with his unacceptable MALICIOUS behaviour.

Please BLOCK him symbolically for whatever time you feel is right, to mainly PREVENT him and later forbid him from:

1. Reverting the pathetic PA on Roy's page along with the pathetic PA edit summaries.

2. Removing my very first warning message with a very civil note. I dont care about the second warning, but the first warning serves as a placeholder for record's sake.

Even after EXPLICIT and SPECIFIC warnings not to continue, he continued with his unacceptable behaviour and BLATANTLY violated NPA that too in edit summaries.
Even after being explicitly advised to assume good faith (AGF), he has failed to do so.

Cmon, for whatever you think of me (ur earlier silence), you KNOW I am not a vandal.

Please take appropriate steps as a fair and upright ADMIN.

I am logging off now, other stuff to do. Will log on tomorrow.

I do hope and expect you to symbolically block Crossmr, which will prevent him from continuing to behave unacceptably as he has blatantly violated NPA even after being repeatedly warned about it.

Thank you.

Best regards.",0

 Lets Discuss Genetics and Logic, Here 

Does the absence of EU alleles in one geographically Western, Clovis era man (Anzick-1) inherently """"disprove"""" the presence of early EU man on the continent? Of course it doesn't. Following that logic, Norse colonization of the Americas is all a big myth as there is no genealogical record of their presence among Canadian first nations people. With current (and most meaningful) archaeological discoveries on the pre-Clovis issue clustering almost entirely in the mid-Northeast of the United States and being unarguably WAY pre-Clovis per strata, the 'genetic refutations' of Solutrean have been tangential at best, agenda driven at worst. The genetic itself question is a critical one, one that deserves robust discussion and the article does, in fact, contain just such a discussion, however the statement that sequencing remains from Anzick-1 'disproves' Solutrean is not a valid statement.

"That’s not really long and irrelevant. I mean, I told you above about General McCully who was always talking about really irrelevant things. Once he told me a story about myself (I’m not sure why I’d never been told it before by my family, but there you go, that’s families for you – not that I wish to make disparaging remarks about my family, they were quite nice, only you’d think that they’d tell me important things like this thing that General McCully told me).

Anyway, this story went as follows (of course, it being a long time since I lived in Fifestead, I won’t get it absolutely 100% word perfect, but I’ll get the plot details correct, which is all that matters in the long run, and in the short run too, probably):

Once, I went to tea with a girl called Sophie (to fully appreciate this amusing, and I may add, most relevant anecdote, you must realise that there was no romantic interest between myself and Sophie: in fact, we were both only four or five at the time; these ages are, you will no doubt agree, far too young for any real romantic interest to be taking place). Anyway, for reasons General McCully couldn’t quite remember (I was at least ten at the time, and being a fairly old man, General McCully didn’t have a fantastic memory), this girl Sophie (you may remember – she was the one towards whom I had no amorous intentions) put her spoon in my hair. Now, at this point in the story, you may well be saying to yourself, “So what?” But, the problem was, the spoon had a fairly large amount of yoghurt on it.

So this was, as you’ll no doubt appreciate, quite a difficult situation, and in the confusion I couldn’t help noticing the slightly random (and, I’ll have to admit, irrelevant) fact that the screws on which Sophie’s mother’s pictures were attatched to the wall required a flathead, rather than a Phillips, screwdriver (when I say flathead, do not use this term in its most obvious, literal definition, but as the DIY term in fairly common use).

Anyway, there was me sitting with yoghurt coursing down my face, examining the screws on my hostess’ mother’s pictures, and casting dark aspersions, and eventually I just walked out and went home, all on my own.

Now, when I make all these claims about being very friendly with a General, he may not actually be a General: the British Army (the army in which he had served) had several ranks containing the slightly bizarre, random and irrelevant term “General”, including Major-General, and I don’t know if he was simply one of these, since they’re usually addressed simply as “General”, as was the citizen of Fifestead General McCully.

Come to think of it, there even used to be a Brigadier-General rank and even a weird-sounding Captain-General rank in the British army, though I believe the rank of Brigadier-General still lives on in the United States Army, existing under some obscure, weird, bizarre, random and irrelevant star rating too, such as “three-star general”, though this almost certainly (speaking with an unfirm knowledge of that field of mathematics known as probability) isn’t the right term for the rank of Brigadier-General.

Anyway, being a busy person, I can’t waste any more of my valuble time on this, unfortunately.",0

 The Dellums mayoral campaign was criticized for holding expensive fundraising dinners and because Dellums would not disclose his plans for the city, or his positions on issues.  - please provide a reference for this; surely, per WP:BLP, you would never insert something like this without a source?

 Elise Ackerman, an Oakland resident who bought the domain recallmayordellums.com sent an open letter to Dellums that was covered in the local press, saying to Dellums, """"African Americans and Latinos live in fear in Oakland because of your lies. Middle-class residents working two jobs live in fear because of your lies. Nurses, teachers and social workers live in fear because of your lies."""" Near the end of the message, she continues """"You are not effective, you are not honest, you have no integrity and you should step aside."""" - what is your source for this?

 In 1972 John Lennon wrote the song Woman is the Nigger of the World. Asked for his reaction to the use of the word """"nigger"""" by a white singer in a pop song Dellums wrote """"If you define nigger as someone whose lifestyle is defined by others, whose opportunities are defined by others, whose role in society is defined by others, then good news - you don't have to be black to be a nigger in this society, most of the people in America are niggers!"""" Lennon was delighted with his reaction and proudly read the quote on the Dick Cavett Show prior to performing the controversial song with his wife at the time, Yoko Ono. - can you explain the removal of this material?

Roddenberry's sentiments on religion

Reference is made to Roddenberry religion views in the section, """"Personal Life,"""" which is probably appropriate. However, the he said / she said statements regarding religious references in the """"Star Trek"""" universe are probably inappropriate here, in Roddenberry's biography. Is not such discussion better placed in entries regarding """"Star Trek?""""  

""""I guess from that time it was clear to me that religion was largely nonsense, was largely magical, superstitious things. In my own teen life I just couldn't see any point in adopting something based on magic, which was obviously phony and superstitious. I stopped going to church as soon as it became possible to do things on my own as a teenager. I made up my mind that church, and probably largely the Bible, was not for me. I did not go back to even thinking much about it. If people need to do that, ignore them and maybe they will ignore you and you can go on with your own life. (Alexander,  Star Trek Creator, p. 37)

""""My second wife Majel Lee (Hudec) and I were both raised Protestant but well before ever meeting had both left the Protestant Church in favor of non-sectarian beliefs which included respect for all other religions, but emphasizing the concept of God as too great and too encompassing to be explained and appreciated by any single system of belief. Some aspects of Buddhism express some of our beliefs but also do some aspects of the New and Old Testaments as well as other books and philosophies."""" (Alexander, Star Trek Creator, p. 422).

""""It seems to me more and more with each passing year and each new massacre (as many perpetrated by Christians as anyone else) that the real villain is religion - at least religion as generally practiced by people who somehow become sure that they and only they know the 'real' answer. How few humans there are that seem to realize that killing, much less hating, their fellow humans in the name of their 'god' is the ultimate kind of perversion.

At any rate, I've elected to believe in a God which is so far beyond our conception and real understanding that it would be nonsense to do anything in its name other than perhaps to revere all life as being part of that unfathomable greatness."""" (Alexander, Star Trek Creator, p. 480)

To all the vandals and so called just administrators, the air dates are minor problems, the facts and details surrounding Reeves suicided are not being written well enough, as everybody else is reporting, the fact that Reeves was to fight Moore next day, is also being reverted, this is pure vandalism. As far as spelling goes by Vesa or Projects or whoever, well, if you keep on repeating yourself and have no time, some spelling errors might occur, but it's not the spelling that counts but content which is being vandalised by so called just users and administrators of this so called just wikipedia. And it is obvious wahkeenah has some personal interest in this, proof: All over internet we have Reeves' death explained in detail and possible people involved, but over here he is taking everything down, the idiotic administratotors are reversing it, thus making themselves look stupid and ignorant by not realizing the historical facts.",0

I wonder why you say """"in good faith"""", are you implying that I'm not acting in good faith? The """"simplified one"""" is ridiculous. According to the """"simplified"""" one Spanish is only spoken near Madrid and in Andalusia, when actually it's by far the most common language throughout Spain. Obviously, regional languages exist there too, but they exist in Italy, Germany and France (actually Spain is far more homogeneous than those countries, linguistically speaking) as well, and that map simply misleads the reader. It makes you think that Spain has four equally spoken languages, whereas France, for example, only has one. That's not the case, both countries have their national language (Spanish and French, respectively) and their regional languages (Catalan, Occitan, Breton, Basque, etc.).

"the new title doesn’t convey what I wanted the section to be about, think of title that conveys the question not just the general subject matter",0
"""

Below I am pasting an email from a historian, whom I asked about the correct title.| talk  

The truth is that the English language really has no equivalent to Freiherr (the title of the ruler) or Freiherrschaft (the title of the political entity), because neither or them existed in the English-speaking world.  The loose translations sometimes given (baron, barony) are inaccurate, in that they do not convey the concept of independent jurisdiction.  Medieval English barons were juridically much more subject to the kings than these (except for the few exceptions such as the liberty of the bishops of Durham and a few other historical exotica).
The concept wasn't limited to Silesia.  It existed throughout the Holy Roman Empire and within the hereditary domains of the Habsburgs, such as Bohemia after 1621.
It is normally preferable to keep the German term, italicized, and give a sentence or so of explanation.""",0

PAUL TIBBIT IS A WEED-SMOKING BASTARD WHO COMPLETELY FUCKED UP SPONGEBOB!!!!

Now, all Nick Studios cares about is money! And i Mean ONLY MONEY!!! They can do an episode where SpongeBob fucking laughs like a fucking pedophile for 20 minutes straight and NOT CARE AT ALL!!! All these people give a tinker's damn about is money, ratings, and fucking fame and fortune. These guys are like celebrities in disgize! They try hard yet put so little effort into their shows JUST to make a quick damned buck! The new episodes drive me nuts! Like Paul Tibbit even HAS any!!!> If I ever meet Paul in real life I swear to neptune I will cut off his large, hairy ball sack tare out his skull and feast on his insides for Thanksgiving!!!!

Nick's people these days are obviously on tons of marijuana! These drunk dunces have no idea in hell what cartoon quality is ALL ABOUT! It would've been WAY better if they just slaughtered this crappy series after the movie!!!! Why watch this shit anymore when Paul Tibbit DESTROYED SPONGEBOB!!!!!! Little do I understand the appeal of the new SpongeBob. I can't believe Paul Tibbit can actually get away with screwing around with a phenominal TV show like he's on freaking cocaine or something! P. Tibbit should be on trial and should get the death penalty is he's considered guilty.

 Wikipedia lying liars & their lies...  http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America.",0

Black Keys leave Fat Possum, pay tribute to Junior Kimbrough

 The Black Keys Split With Fat Possum, Prep Releases

Kati Llewellyn and Amy Phillips report:
The Black Keys and Fat Possum Records seemed like a match made in blues-rock heaven, right? But as Jack and Meg (or Puffy and J.Lo or Britney and Justin) will tell you, sometimes couples that look like they're perfect for each other just aren't meant to be. Sigh...

Black Key Dan Auerbach told Billboard.com recently that his band and Fat Possum have parted ways, and they are currently shopping around for an American home for their forthcoming album, which they hope to
release on September 12. (V2 will put the record out in Europe, and Modular will handle it in Australia.) Although the album is untitled at the moment, songs slated to appear include """"Your Touch"""", """"The
Flame"""", and """"It's Just Got to Be"""". 

Auerbach assured Billboard.com that the Fat Possum split was """"amicable."""" Yeah, yeah, they all say that, but this time we actually believe it, for quite a few reasons. First of all, Auerbach and his
bandmate, Patrick Carney, will leave the Mississipi imprint with a parting gift in the form of the Chulahoma: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough EP. A six-song tribute to the late bluesman (with an
answering machine message from Kimbrough's wife tacked on at the end), the disc hits stores May 2. It includes """"The Black Keys - My Mind Is Ramblin'"""", which
the Keys covered on last year's Fat Possum Kimbrough tribute album, Sunday Nights.

Tracklist:

01 Keep Your Hands Off Her
02 Have Mercy on Me
03 Work Me
04 Meet Me in the City
05 Nobody But You
06 My Mind Is Ramblin'

Also, Fat Possum will continue to distribute Carney's Audio Eagle label, which has so far put out the Gil Mantera's Party Dream album
Bloodsongs. Future releases include stuff by two Carney side projects, 10% Animals and Marble Arches. The latter also features guitarist Jamie Stillman (ex-party of helicopters), who co-runs Audio Eagle.

That's kind of the rock and roll equivalent of seeing the kid every other weekend, right?

The Black Keys are currently in the midst of an Australian tour, which has them playing some weird festivals with people like Femi Kuti and
Buddy Guy. In May, they'll head to England to rock The Shins-curated date of All Tomorrow's Parties.""",0

 I DID NOT REMOVE ANY WARNINGS. YOU ARE THE ONE DOING THAT, VIOLATING WIKIPEDIA POLICY 

The following is a COMPLAINT AGAINST  for harassing user's about this page

It seems that many users have had problems with  harassment and vandalism

, why do you continually harass other users and then falsly accuse them of """"vandalism"""" or other wiki-infringements? Please, do not delete this comment, I am only here as a mediator and this is NOT a personal attack. Only a simple question as to what motivates you to defame other users.

Here are the examples that I have compiled since being introduced to this issue. We have  who complains about your harassment on this talk page above. “I have not attacked you. Actually, quite the reverse. I have not exercized censorship. Quite the reverse. What's it called when you accuse others of being something that you actually are?”

 describes your actions as “rootless accusations of """"vandalism"""" in response to my recent edit of the wikipedia article """"police state"""" don't even pass the straight face test.”

 even took the time to write a letter to the administrators about your behavior.

Dear Administrators:""""I would like to file a complaint against user """"nescio"""" for wanton vandalism of the article entitled """"Police State"""". User Nescio has been deleting sections of the article he or she personally disagrees with e.g. historical police state examples """" Chile under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet"""" and """"Argentina under the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional"""", as well as other examples . This childish and irrational behaviour has resulted in a blatant misrepresentation of the facts, which is detrimental to Wikipedia's credibility and accuracy. I have tried to reason with this user, but it is unfortunately to no avail.Regretfully , I have no choice but to request that this user be blocked from editing at this time. Sincerely yours,User Winston Smith describes you as “the worst editor I have EVER encountered on wikipedia” while encouraging you to “Please stop this childish behavior.”

 had his warnings to you about harassment deleted and reported you as a vandal * has repeatedly reverted to prior revisions of the police state article after being instructed to view the discussion page. I then placed a warning on  talk page, which he promptly removed. He continues to remove the warnings.  has requested sources for the addition, at least five have been provided, yet  refuses to acknowledge their existence and insists on trying to incite an edit war.      is continuing to remove edits and warnings of mine from his talk page  while falsely accusing me of stalking  and sock puppetry.      I have to say that Nescio and others had understandable grounds on which to suspect you of sockpuppetry. Fact is, you appeared on scene the day of/shortly after three genuine sockpuppets appeared, and you shared the same POV and short history of editing.  

Please explain what makes you think that  is a sockpuppet? Can you cite these actions of VinnyCee that are considered to be those of a sock-puppet?  

 I just did. It turns out that Vinny Cee is not a sockpuppet (at least, of anything we checked), but there was good reason to suspect she was.  

So VinnyCee is not'' a sock puppet. This means that Nescio's accusation of him being a sock puppet is false. Did you """"check"""" into whether the other accusations made by Nescio against other users are also false? I would bet that they are.  

It seems that you harass anyone who attempts to edit the Police state article without your viewpoint. This is against [[WP:NP",0
"Dear GoW, you seem to have missed something obvious in your little comment - neither time that Giano finished with an old account was he blocked. That does not inspire confidence in your detective skills. Giano has, in the past, attempted to remove himself from the project by scrambling his password; and then decided to return. For Giano, it was considered more appropriate to do it under a new username rather than request a new password (Giano is not the most computer savvy of editors - he rather concentrates on the content than the means of placing it upon the page). Furthermore, very likely the vast majority of established editors are fully aware of who Giano is - and his previous accounts.

 The name Lek

They removed the older version that was thet for over 3 years with traditional 2492 in the formation and indepedance infobox.

If you are not sure what im referring to, its here  < This is the edit by Yervantsi for that infobox. Please put the above version I provided. Thanks.

Also, this head paragraph in the Armenia page doesnt need an entire history lesson.

"Wow.

In the last month (and excepting my message this afternoon), I have on one (1) occasion interacted with Heymid. I told him that instead of just removing information that has a clear, explicit source, it would be better to explain why in the talk page for the concerned article, then wait for others so get a chance to respond.

During October, Heymid was blocked a third or fourth time for, well, doing what he always has and probably always will since he gets away with it. He appealed this block, the appeal was denied, then he appealed again, promising pretty much the same stuff he had promised when trying to have previous blocks lifted. I wrote nothing when he was blocked, nothing when he first appealed, nothing when the first appeal was denied, nothing when he appealed again and nothing when he was unblocked. Yet you feel that I'm popping up at every venue, and when I did write a single message at somebody else's talk page, you immediately blocked me, without any warning, without any message in my talk page.

I'm not sure if this is funny or sad or both. What I do know, however, is that I have absolutely no intent to appeal the block, so you might just as well remove my talk page access as well. -",0

 OP Sharecraft 2012 

Africa is undergoing the worst hunger crisis in over 40 years. Children and other residents there have been suffering for too long, and OPSharecraft looks to put a stop to it. OPSharecraft is an organization run by gaming enthusiast Boumaaza Bachir. (A.K.A Athene)He seeks to raise $1,000,000 to donate to the Save The Children foundation, by July. At a steady pace of 10,000 dollars a day, it seems that it will reach the goal. This foundation is causing an uprising to unite everyone in trying to help raise the $1,000,000. Donations are coming in rapidly, Boumaaza Bachir himself has gone on a hunger strike; which will last until he reaches his goal.

"""=Remove the Tricolour from this article===
The Tricolour is not a symbol of Northern Ireland, so why is it in this section?

Could we have instead some genuine discussion as to why the flag should be included in a section on symbols of Northern Ireland? Please could other editors take part, otherwise this article - like others - will continue to remain under the control of the Irish-nationalist editors?

 Spain/Portugal 

Hi.  Not sure if you have your centuries mixed up here: note that 1400s=15th century, 1500s=16th century, 1600s=17th century.  The Spanish conquistadors arrived in Mexico in the 1520s (16th C) and Peru in the 1530s.  By the end of the the 1400s (15th C) Portugal had not even set foot in Brazil and had only just reached India, yet to """"discover"""" SE Asia and Japan.  The Dutch did not arrive on the scene until the early 1600s (17th C).   t """,0

Criticism of Islam and Islamic extremist terrorism. On second thoughts, they don't work quite as well as I had thought, but they have a certain harmony, if criticism contains positive and negative points (because I don't think people should use the criticism section of slamming Islam. Maybe that guy linked to on Striver's page who's christian but likes islam a lot should be added?). But Islamophobia is I think a subject vague enough and thrown around so liberally it doesn't really warrant anything other than a mention in the criticism section.

 Msa Garratts 

Hi,

The idea about an article is a good one, but unfortunately you've started out with an error. That is understandable as the subject is complex. 

The WAGR first imported the M class Garratts, in 1911. These are very important locos, because they are the third class of Garratt to be built, and the first """"main line"""" Garratt, showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. They were followed up in 1912 by the Ms class, only difference being the Ms class were superheated. So they were also the first class of Garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. Both classes were built by Beyer-Peacock.

The Msa class were constructed in 1930 by the WAGR in their own workshops. Apparently a copy of the Ms class, they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.

The story does not end there, but moves to Victoria. The VR G class apparently is copied from the Ms class, the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. Outside framed Garratts are very rare, even in the smaller gauges. But wait there is more (no, not steak knives!). The design was used again, for the Australian Portland Cement's 3'6"""" line near Geelong, the first loco being supplied in 1936 and the second in 1939. The boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored G42.

So in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of 28 years, used on three railway, on two gauges and built by two manufacturers, with, if I've added it up correctly, 27 locos constructed.

Personally I think the article should cover the history of the design, and include all the varients. Some work would be required to hunt down variations, though. So yes, I think it does deserve an article.

Please feel free to use the above if you wish.

Cheers,

Michael.""",0

"I agree.  And I wasn't saying there was a rule limiting the discussion to strictly city limits.  What I was saying in this section, that was the limiting factor, for it didn't discuss non-city demographics.  If it had, I wouldn't have had an issue on it based on those grounds (the other 2 issues would still have applied).  I think to insert a regional fact among city facts can be disingenuous and confusing.",0

 Thanks for your explanation. But the section """"In literature etc..."""" is in no way intended as a list of everything which mentions Chopin  - otherwise it would be endless. It is there to give an idea of some of the most significant presentations of Chopin which shed some light on his historical life and works. The video game sheds light on neither of these - it's just (apparently) a fantasy world in which one of the characters is named Chopin and which uses some of Chopin's music, as arranged by others - unless you have a reputable source which says different.

Many of the items listed as """"conspiracy theory"""" are supported by factual data and not """"theory"""". The medical opinions I give are all supported by scientific researchers accepted scientific literature, and are referenced carefully in my articles.

 Harper's Island 

While the statement you refer to regarding J.D.'s death is indeed from Karim Zreik, Karim was not a producer for the episode in question.  The wound on JD is quite clearly visible here within the episode, and would not have resulted from a bludgeoning.

Since this site is about stating the facts you need to leave it the way it was written in the show and not put your opinionated thoughts on the matter.

Rather a comb was and is an important article of everyday use. There are no articles on horn combs which were used before plastics on Wikipedia and I was only trying to fill a gap by writing a article and improving on horn combs about what we used before plastics.

"Another Explanation of the Error

Before we open any envelopes, it doesn't seem unreasonable to assume that if the envelopes are said contain A and 2A (without distinguishing which envelope contains which amount), then all values of A are equally likely − because we have no better information. However, it does not then follow from this assumption that, given A is found in the first envelope, the other envelope is equally likely to contain (1/2)A or 2A for every conceivable value of A (which is something we have implied in the subsequent calculation of expected value). 

Why?

Because, for any specific amount of money from which to fill the envelopes, given we have found A in the first envelope, for all values of A we can always find (1/2)A in the second envelope, whereas it is only possible to find 2A in the second envelope half the time.

See it like this: If the specific amount of money is M say, then we can find A to have any value up to (2/3)M, but the second envelope can only contain 2A for values of A up to (1/3)M ie. half as often.

So, given A was found in the first envelope, the chance of finding (1/2)A in the second envelope is 2/3, and the chance of having 2A in the second envelope is 1/3 − not equal as we had assumed, even though all values of A are still being assumed to be equally likely.",0

Career:
1. Trapper (sub heading under career)
His earlier mindset surrounding trapping will be discussed in greater depth, as not much is discussed with regards to how he viewed trapping before his switch to conservationism.
His work with the Ojibwa Indians / Guppy Family will be explored as they were critical in his development as a trapper that understood the fragility of the animal ecosystem (Smith, 41)
The time of his life spent working and living at the Temagami Inn as a chore-boy will be mentioned as this was one of the events in which  Archie first became an observer of the Objibwa way of life. (Smith, 40)
His love interest, Angele will also be discussed as she also introduced Archie to influential figures within the Objibwa community, providing Archie with plenty of sketches for his infamous notebooks. (Smith, 42)

From the section on his life as a trapper, we will discuss the impact of Anahareo on his switch from trapper to Conservationist.  
The transformation of his own personal views of conservationism will be explored through his writings in Pilgrims of the wild.
His initial desires to write will also be explored, this section then ending with the completion of his first book “The Men of the Last Frontier” which can be seen as one of the starting points of his public conservation career.

His relationship with W. J. Oliver regarding his being commissioned by Parks Board Canada to make films of Grey Owl will also be explored.  
We will also delve further into his later life as a conservationist and his role in Prince Albert National park.

'West Virginia' were the counties counted loyal to the USG, from which 20,000 served for the Union and 20,000 for the Confederacy.

Notability of Brandon Barger

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia.

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

PBS - Why do you continue to insist the onus is on me to demonstrate/provide proof that the definition for the terms are different?  You are suggesting a change here.  The onus is on you to demostrate/prove the terms are the same.  
 I do understand your point.  I do accept that often times """"military occupation"""" and """"occupied territories"""" are terms that go hand-in-hand.  My contention is that the nuances surrounding how the terms are used justify seperate pages.  If you can find for me some source stating that """"all occupied territories involve military occupation"""" and """"all military occupations create occupied territories"""" I'll join your effort.  However, lacking this I think you will have to achieve consensus for your arguement that the pages ought to be merged.
  Re Article 6 of GCIV - Again, I think perhaps you are being a little to legalistic regarding your definitions.  Remember that terms like """"Murder""""/""""execution""""/""""occupied territory""""/""""crime against humanity"""" have legal definitions, and definitions in the popular psychi defined outside law.  Starting from a legalistic definition is a good idea, but we shouldn't be entirely focused on that definition.  I think a useful way to go about looking at the popular psychi is by examining news articles, and seeing how they treat the terms.
 Shuki -  Consensus on something that is not verifiable is simply the majority of 'seems to me'.  I think you realize that in discussing definitions of terminology WP:V is often difficult/impossible.  Furthermore, I'm simply stating the opinion that """"It seems to me the terms are different."""" and asking PBS to verify otherwise. I think the only option here will ultimately be to seek consensus. 
 I guess I'm interested really in the larger question, which is, when dealing with terms of this nature is there anyway of really arriving at definitions besides consensus? I think not.  I also think there a huge morass of pages & articles where we could have simliar disputes.    """,0

The article reads more like a left leaning op ed than an objective encyclopedic article. A good example is this unsourced assertion early in the article:
""""By the early 1990s, the term was adopted by US conservatives as a pejorative term for all manner of attempts to promote multiculturalism and identity politics, particularly, attempts to introduce new terms that sought to leave behind discriminatory baggage attached to older ones, and conversely, to try to make older ones taboo.""""

US conservatives didn't """"adopt"""" the term in the early 90s; it would be more accurate to say that by the early 90s the excesses of """"political correctness"""" became more widely known and many people (not just """"US conservatives"""") began to ridicule it (particularly as manifest in the implemnetation of draconian speech codes on college campuses and the aggressive promotion of increasingly dubious and absurd assertions of what might be construed as """"offensive""""). The term has come to be used in mischevous ways at times by people to ridicule positions they disagree with (an example would be creationsts categorizing the teaching of evolution as """"political correctness""""). 

The article in short seems to reflect the perspective of someone of an """"activist left"""" sensibility that is more interested in addressing popular backlash against political correctness than in objectively describing it. It's really not as complicated as the article makes it out to be. In brief, politically correctness is simply a word for efforts to alter or prohibit innocuous language or other activities that are unreasonably or implausibly asserted to be offensive. Unfortunately efforts to honestly describe it seem to be a magnet for what might be called """"political correctness denialists"""" (the idea that there is no such thing as political correctness; it's all just right wing agitprop etc.).""",0

Never mind that a nineteen year old isn't going to have a huge article, people will say it is too shorttrust me, I've heard this objection on my own articles, e.g. Julia Stiles and John Henninger Reagan.  FAC commentators will also seize upon the photographs problem, which I don't see ought to be an impediment to getting FA status, but people will object.  Now, as to the article itself . . . What happened to his father?  Divorce?  Something ought to be said because it looks odd mentioning only a mother.  Second, I wonder if you could find some print articles about him?  You might try accessing databases such as ProQuest or Ebsco through the public library.  I'm hesistant about articles where all the sources are electronic.  While I've used many links on articles such as Tom Brinkman and Paul Hackett, I also cited the print version so when the operators of those sites take down the electronic versions people will still be able to find the material.  Third, I'd eliminate some of the red-links to movies and schools.  Again, this will raise objections if you take it to FAC.  Finally, most of the article is dedicated to his roles.

Hi there Bhadani. Recently there has been an user Aftab Kiran whose contributions are limited to just 3 topics, Operation Polo, Nizam and Hyderabad State. He seems to revert to his POV version of history which isn't backed up by references and despite other editors reverting his edits, he continues to revert. I've spoken to him, but he has behaved in an uncivil manner abusing me as being one of those who destroyed the Babri Masjid! I hope you can either block him or semiprotect those pages to avoid his editing because he's consistently coming back for last 2-3 weeks to revert.

My stance of being a """"Proud Nintendo 3DS Owner"""" has absolutely nothing to do with me taking a neutral position or not in the discussed article. Or can't a video game journalist for example, not have his/her personal preferences and do unbiased journalism at the same time? As for the colour code, I advise you to read the entire conversation before going in to bold assumptions. Like I said in a previous post: """"Alright, this is getting out of control. You're getting this """"Yes/No template"""" thing all wrong, seriously. Someone at my talk page said the following: """"To use an extreme example: """"Does the console kill people?"""", the answer is """"No"""", which is a positive."""". So by your philosophy would you color it with green because it's a good thing? Wrong. No, consoles do not kill people and yes, it is POSITIVE, but this does not invalidate the fact that it still is something NEGATIVE related to the question. Even the the templates themselves have by default the green color for yes and the red color for no, and that must already  mean something by itself. The purpose of Wikipedia is objectivity, not subjectivity. But what the reader does with the information is entirely up to him. Which means that if he thinks that something positive/colored green is a negative thing for him, that's his problem. He can think whatever he wants of this information. I hope this clears things up."""". To sum it up: Yes=Affirmative=Green / No=Negative=Red, personal preferences don't come into account.

Sure. What do you mean? I am in the process of writing a little welcome and how to. John, if you recall the minor dispute about the Estonia links really caught me off guard and I was a bit thin-skinned in taking criticism for what I thought was my helpful addition of a couple of links. I learned from that and other experiences here that practically every article has two sides, and that you can't just go in and naiively think you're adding objective information, when that info most likely has already been debated. I was also caught off guard in that the other contributors to the site took me for a Neo-Nazi! (See comment from DLX to that effect.) They were quick to jump to that conclusion, I thought, based only on a few bits of info gleaned from my posts. Anyway, I'm trying to make it clear that I do not do anything on Wikipedia because of what I do for a living. And I wanted to point out, with the """"About me: Who cares"""", that I do not participate here to draw attention to myself or to please my employer.  

 BTW, John, can you take a look at the dispute (there is a BRIEF reference on my user page) involving user THF or Ted Frank. Do this only if you have time to look at all the backroundthere is a lot of it on his talk page, some on the talk page for tort reform in the united states, and some on sonic's rendezvous band's talk page and deletion discussion page. I believe this user has violated several rules and policies and, in general, the spirit and purpose of Wikipedia. I have asked Cool Hand Luke to look at this but so far he has not. He only made a comment about something I did in response to being attacked by this user. Thanks for your consideration. Perhaps DLX can look at this issue too. I hope that both of you have concluded from our earlier discussion that my approach may have been ill-considered, but my purpose and intent was to make a good-faith contribution, not to disrupt and certainly not to enforce any particular politically motivated point of view.

Thanks for the 'typo fix' suggestion.  It certainly makes things simpler for me.

This Hoary person appears get his or her orgasmic jollies making asinine slurs and commentary that does not address the subject of Ebonics nor the inconsistencies in his or her logic.  I have verbally cleaned this person Hoary’s clock and yet this person Hoary keeps coming back for more.  Clearly this person Hoary loves the sadomasochistic verbal exchanges that he or she has invited and is having with me.  You would do better to make your admonitions to this Hoary person because I will not tolerate ‘dog whistle’ insults and racial slurs from Hoary, you or anyone else.  So you just block my edits all you want. Blocking my edits won’t make the inaccuracies and outright lies that Wikipedia is disseminating on the subject of Ebonics accurate or true.   If this person Hoary wants to discuss Black English or African American Vernacular English he or she should take his or her discussion to the Wikipedia Black English or African American Vernacular English section or page.  Ebonics is not Black English, African American Vernacular English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the language of descendants of enslaved Niger-Congo Africans is a dialect of English and genetically akin to the Germanic language family to which English belongs.  If you do not understand this fact then why was the Wikipedia African Diaspora project initiated? You should have called it the Black Anglo Saxon Diaspora Project instead.  But then, there would have to be historical linguistic evidence that Black Anglo Saxons brought Early Modern Black English, African American Vernacular English dialects to colonial America from somewhere in Germanic Europe.

 If most Protestants were not 'informers' that would probably be because they had no information to pass on. However I think Sarah unwittingly and superbly illustrates the reason why using the word 'informer' in this article is utterly inappropriate and far from neutral.

Hi, Cirt - I hope you will consider stopping accusing me of bad faith editing. If you have any qualms with particular edits, I'd love to hear what is wrong with them and how my approach can be improved. 

I'd like to direct your attention to two quotes on user pages. The first is from Jimmy Wales:

== You can edit this page! ==

Really, you can! If you would like to, please feel free to do so. Make an edit – or even several! After all, that is what Wikipedia is all about.''

And the second is from Neelix's user page:

Wikipedia is thoroughly, inherently collaborative. In the humanities division of academia, we still hold to the ideal of the lone genius, expecting that each humanities scholar be the sole author of his or her journal articles. In the sciences and social sciences, we expect that there be two or three authors for each journal article. On Wikipedia, every well-developed article has many more than three authors. The result is an ever-increasingly accurate approximation of objectivity. This objectivity is not the pseudo-objectivity that results from ignoring our biases as authors, but is rather the result of diverse perspectives all being covered proportionally through discussion between people who have those diverse perspectives. We write better when we write together.

I think those principles are pretty neat. And I am certain my editing adheres to them. If you'd like to contact me off the site, let me know - I'd be happy to share ways to get in touch.",0

 De Tomaso Longchamp 
Hi Typ932. You are off to such a great start on the article De Tomaso Longchamp that it may qualify to appear on Wikipedia's Main Page under the Did you know... section. Appearing on the Main Page would help bring publicity and assistance to the article. However, there is a five day from article creation window for Did you know... nominations. Before five days pass from the date the article was created, please consider nominating the article to appear on the Main Page by posting a nomination at Did you know suggestions. Again, great job on the article.  ' (Talk) 

On July 3, 2007, Did you know? was updated with  from the article De Tomaso Longchamp, which you created or substantially expanded. If you know of another interesting fact from a recently created article, then please suggest it on the Did you know? talk page. Well done...you got the pictured slot!'  (bananabucket)

""""Alternative hip hop, like all genres of art, is a social construction and as such the definition is open to debate.""""     

If with the term """"social construction"""" in this sentance, the statement """"Alternative hip hop, like all genres of art, is a social construction"""" is meant to convey that any musical work one calls """"alternitive hip hop"""" happens to be the product of an agent operating under certain social conditions (as opposed to working in a vacuum), or if it is meant to establish that the term """"alternative hip hop"""" was created by such an agent, then the statement is quite true.  However, a """"social construction"""" typically is opposed to a """"natural kind"""" in that it is only conventional.  In this sense it is not altogether clear if in fact the statement is true:  take the art genres """"Oil Painting"""" and """"Punk Rock"""":  it is not merely as a point of convention that we say these two genres are different, there is a matter of fact about it.  However, in neither of these senses does it straightforwardly follow that """"as such the definition is open to debate.""""  I do not mean to contend that the definition isn't open to debate, but only that its openness to debate isn't tied in any direct way to whether it is a """"social contruction"""".  In the first case, consider the terms """"integer"""" and """"one"""": both terms where surely created by agents in a social setting, yet their definitions are particularly rigorous.  As for the second case, i might say that a man is jewish just in case his mother were jewish. """"Jew"""" in this sense is a social construction, it is purely social convention and not a natural kind in any ordinary way.  Nonetheless, we already stipulated a perfectly rigourous definition.            -J""",0

Things are not this simple. There is much dispute over wheather the US succesfully installed a democracy, since the new government is becoming more and more authoritarian, candidates were banned from recent elections, there have been fraud claims during all 3 elections and many human rights violations have taken place. Also Iraq's status as a US ally (leave alone major US ally) is questionable, due to the strong ties to Iran of many leading Shi'a and Kurdish figures and the growth increasing influence of Muqtada al-Sadr's political party. Also the insurgency is far from quelled, although it's not as deadly as it was around 2006-2007, with at least 4,000 civilians, 900 security forces killed this year it is still one of the most deadly insurgencies on earth.  19:26, 4 January 2011",0

Here is the content of the Monoplane article from Britannica.  It's not an initial.
Monoplane,  type of aircraft with a single pair of wings. The monoplane design has been nearly universally adopted over multiplane configurations because airflow interference between adjacent wings reduces efficiency. The first monoplane was constructed by the Romanian inventor Trajan Vuia, who made a flight of 12 m (40 feet) on March 18, 1906. Louis Blériot of France built a monoplane in 1907 and flew it across the English Channel two years later. Monoplane design proved itself conclusively during World War II, and since then the craft has completely supplanted the biplane except for special purposes. Compare biplane  Best regards.   (☎) """,0

This is called tail packing  
And block suballocation, which is a similar concept. I am unsure about file systems that keep short files with the directory or inode entry. I've heard something vague about NTFS keeping short files in the MFT; if this is true, it indeed isn't represented right now.   
This is correct. Tail packing and suballocation put multiple files into one block, but that is still discontigous from any other related information, like the inode block or directory listing. By contrast, NTFS stores data for *very* short (I don't have an exact number, but it's in the several hundred bytes region) files in the directory listing, which entirely eliminates a seek for the data. Perhaps a note of this fact in a footnote for the """"partial"""" suballocation support?

"Evolution Article

Hello Slrubinstein, I was a witness to the vast changes in the evolution article. Once it started it was like a wild fire. In fact, I saw it coming and tried (and failed-oddly phrased and hyperlinked on Dec 8)to improve the first paragraph. After Adam's changes, I realized the experts have had their say it seems appropriate to let the novices have ago. I wrote to Roland and Graft with this sentiment, but also my apprehensions-that it is too simplestic, may lead to misconceptions, not neccessarily improved where it is good, and this method of rapid and bulky changes will start a stampede (which it has). Roland is studying for exams, but dropped in enough to say he hated all the changes. I have been trying to be supportive of their effort, but hoping all the expert editors who gave me a hard time would resurface to defend the merits of the original article. I thought the first paragraph did need some attention, but I thought minor edits would ensue not vast rewrites. This could go on forever. Why can't an article be protected at certain stage so Talk could continue but changes would go before a committee to decide whether the change or addition is warranted (keep it current). I actually wrote a section for Evodev a few weeks ago, but never added it. I was concentrating on a couple of good examples, but now I realize a better way. There is some movement in embryology and developmental biology which is good. Fill does have some good editing for a Simple:evolution article. Isn't there a wikipedia for kids also? Although I wanted to change or add to the original, it was an excellent and informative article. It has been a week since the major overhaul so now maybe it is time to critique.",0

Restoring WP:NPOV to the Paris article

I invite everyone to read again the WP:NPOV policy of Wikipedia:
Editing from a neutral point of view (NPOV) means representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic. All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view. NPOV is a fundamental principle of Wikipedia and of other Wikimedia projects. This policy is nonnegotiable and all editors and articles must follow it.

Currently, the article is heavily biased towards a historical/heritage representation of Paris. The article is structured the same way as the article of Pompeii with most of its contents dedicated to describe past History, heritage sites, tourism, and past culture. The difference with Pompeii though is Paris hasn't been destroyed by a volcano 2,000 years ago, and here goes the WP:POV.

Facts about what is Paris today are marginalized in shrinked sections burried at the bottom. For the good of the debate, here are some facts about today's Paris we should all remember. Economically speaking, Paris is among the top 5 cities generating the most wealth in the world, it hosts more headquarters of Fortune Global 500 firms than London or New York. Demographically speaking, it is a megapolis of 12 million people inhabitated by large communities coming from all countries in the world. Regarding infrastructures, it is one of the most important transport node in Europe, with 4 airports, 6 major railway stations linked to 4 different high-speed rail lines, and hosts the second largest river port in Europe.

To know whether or not the economics, demographics and infrastructures aspects of Paris are represented fairly, proportionately in the current article, I invite everyone to compare the size of the said sections with the one of those dedicated to History, heritage and culture (which in the case of Paris ignores its modern aspects as everyone obviously agreed here ). I've counted words of each section (including their paragraphs in introduction), and in order to give a point of comparison, I've done the same about London, which is a similar size capital city of a similar country.
Field of interestParisLondonNumber of words% of totalNumber of words% of totalHistory3,573 words22%2,048 words17%Heritage4,277 words26%204 words2%Culture2,545 words15%1,661 words14%Subtotal10,395 words63%3,913 words32%Economy673 words4%727 words6%Demographics852 words5%1,605 words13%Transport819 words5%1,693 words14%Subtotal2,344 words13%4,025 words33%Overall total16,388 words100%12,131 words100%
It's worth being mentionned though that London's culture section is entirely dedicated to today's culture. But even putting that aspect aside, the London article, which seems well-balanced, talk about as much of History, heritage and culture than it does of economy, demographics and transports. In the case of Paris, sections about the """"past"""" aspects are 4.5 times bigger than those about today's aspect. In reading this article, we can decently believe that today's Paris is judged not relevant any",0

 Translation of the name 

Should the name really be translated into English? For example, on the Catalan wikipedia, would one talk about (for example) """"Plaid Cymru"""" or """"el Partit de Gal·les""""? Would one talk about """"l'UMP (Union pour la Majorité Presidentielle)"""" or """"l'UMP (Unió per la Majoritat Presidencial)""""? I've yet to see many articles about the """"Peoples' Party (Spain)"""", """"We Can"""" or """"Citizens"""", but yet """"United Left"""" and """"Spanish Workers' Socialist Party"""" appear to be in use...

My rationale for this is that I would always refer to """"Carrer Balmes"""" rather than """"Balmes Street"""", to """"Poblenou"""" rather than """"New Town"""" and to the """"Eixample"""" rather than the """"Expansion"""" - but then, I might be biased, so want to hear alternative points of view!

This is meant to be the start of a discussion rather than anything else... Please add to the discussion )

If the result of this is that names shouldn't be translated, I'd recommend that this page me moved to """"Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya"""", and (for example) """"Initiative for Catalonia - Greens"""" be moved to """"Iniciativa per Catalunya - Verds""""...""",0

 Dithering here... 

I'm sorry we haven't met sooner.  There is another you may wish to acquaint yourself with.  His name is User:TharkunColl, an Anglo-Saxonist.  English traditionalists (even the pro-Celtic, pro-Roman) are apparently the bane of the British Isles here at Wikipedia, but I don't know about that in real life, considering such a sentiment is supposedly more tolerant.  Yes, it's said to be more accepting than the """"proud Teutonic"""" approach to English identification, although it seems as though the Celtofascists here are trying to spin the English alone as """"foreign"""" to the Isles, even though it is easy to discover the Celtic origins in Roman Europe, especially the Brythonic kind (as much as Anglo-Saxon European ties are to the post-Classical Rome of Charlemagne and other Holy Roman """"Germanics"""").  They think that pro-Celtic, pro-Roman means hostile cultural appropriation, as they have identified you as """"the other"""", the big pink elephant in the room.  It is a sight for sore eyes to see how you manage to reconcile hostile, """"mutual-exclusionary"""" factions of Celt, Roman and German, for most """"people"""" involved in these articles have one agenda to push or another, but hardly any singular Romanists, I'm afraid.  Perhaps I should try that.  Imagine the double-whammy of negativity from the """"Celto-Germanicists"""".  Ahh...there's no way to achieve anything in any of this without some bloodshed, it seems.

Incidentally, if you'd like to get worked up elsewhere, go check out the archives of that talk page...here, for instance.  In that article, it is apparently considered nonsense by  that the Greeks bestowed the name """"British Isles"""" upon that set of islands off of Gaul and that is the ultimate origin, as they instead focus exclusively upon the Tudor-Stuart settlement (extreme violation of WP:WEIGHT and barely even narrowly WP:SYNTH, so wrapped up in violations of WP:NOR!) which modernised the term and put ancient ethnic vagueness into political effect (nor do they care to see that Roman Britain was only that part of Albion, that part of the BI in total which had been conquered or annexed through treaty by Rome, even as Erin would go free...not contradicting the fact that they are both """"British"""", whatever that originally meant aside from the Trojan story).  Just about any and all BI related pages are vicious black holes and often, the only way to go about it, is by using extreme caution and wisdom.  You will find that whilst your attackers see fit to add and add as they wish, their abuse of you is based upon their own convictions of what they would like to edit one way or the other and if you don't fit their profile, then """"you are wrong"""", not just what you happen to do or write, it is a personal vendetta to expunge all of your works.  Many times, after selecting a target, they are simply being difficult and if they are lucky enough, they will have provoked thee into becoming banned, just to see you squirm, as they do whatever it is they wish, to put the spin on this or that subject, according to their absolutist truisms.  Of course, you are unable to do anything about it when your editing privileges are revoked and the admins won't even bother to level the playing field for you, only acquiesce to their demands based in vilification and lynchmobbery.  They will, most likely, base their complaints upon """"improper procedures"""", which is Orwellian codespeak for """"we don't like what he stands for, let's overwhelm him in numbers"""".

All said, it is very nice to meet you...you, like me, with a youthful tenure here being quite deceiving, would probably enjoy this a lot.  I've been a fan for the longest time, of you, TharkunColl,   """,0

Also, some articles have charted like Double Rainbow (song) and Choose Your Battles by Perry or Carmen (Lana Del Rey song) and Money Power Glory by American singer Lana Del Rey are only provided by some of the albums information, reviews and sources rather than independent sources about the song itself, etc. Some of the articles I made, like """"Too Far"""" and """"I Don't Need Anyone"""" feature info about being released promotionally through radio airplay and proposals of being an official single.

"What a hypocrite this creep Chavez is!

From the main article about Hugo Chavez:

Chávez was raised a Roman Catholic, although he has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic hierarchy and Protestant groups like the New Tribes Mission. He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Chávez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.

I find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health! This just shows what a hypocrite and liar Chavez is!",1

"""==Author's comments==

I posted the following comments on the userpage, but moved them now to this talk page with minor edits:

The following changes are suggested:

 Mark """"Requests for Adminship"""" as historical, and open the new process, """"Sysop Applications.""""
 Replace the standard three RFA questions with the six questions shown below.  
 Question 3 - how the applicant intends to use the sysop tools - is similar to old question 1. 
 Question 4, asking for the applicant's article writing experience, is based on old Question 2. 
 I have removed old question 3 about conflicts with other users.
 Questions 1 and 2 are added to establish minimum criteria.  Only one user (Lustiger.seth) who failed these criteria has become a sysop in the last several years.  Having these criteria on the application should eliminate the need for WP:NOTNOW closes to premature RFAs.
 Questions 5 and 6 are added to establish the candidate's character for honesty.  Why this wasn't done years ago after the Archtransit scandal is hard for me to understand.  Disclosure of material negative information should be expected of all applicants.
 Remove the old system of voting """"support"""", """"oppose"""", or """"neutral"""" with a reason in your vote.  Instead, vote """"support"""" or """"oppose"""" without giving a reason.  Then, if you choose to give a reason, you may comment in the """"Concerns"""" section or on the talk page of the Application.
 This change will reduce the """"pile-on"""" effect of oppose voting.  Normally, in old RFAs, support voters vote without saying much, whereas oppose voters write long comments.  The oppose votes are disorganized insofar as oppose vote number 13 may refer back to oppose votes number 2 and 6.  The cumulative effect of oppose votes with long reasons is to say """"we hate you.""""  
 The new model removes this asymmetry.  You can still oppose, but you can't say more in your oppose vote than a supporter would say in her support vote.  The cumulative effect of bare support and oppose votes is """"some of us like you, and some don't.""""  To the extent that reasons for opposing the candidate need to be explained, the voter can explain in the """"Concerns"""" section.
 No """"neutral"""" votes.  If you don't want to vote, nobody is forcing you.  Neutral votes are pointless.
 We can decide later what a passing score should be.  For now we can allow bureaucrats to use their discretion as they currently do.

The following features will be maintained from the old RFA process:
 Bureaucrats decide the outcome after a 7-day discussion.
 A nominator may praise the candidate.  That is probably the one positive aspect of old RFA that is worth preserving.

 External forcing 

This refers.  It would be useful to explain this term better (I have a comment further up the talk page).  Does it refer to any process external to the climate?  Including thought processes?  Or to processes that have some effect on the climate.  Also it is highly confusing to have a section titled 'radiative forcing' when it begins with a (bad) definition of external forcing.  My point is a logical one only.  Also, do you agree with my comments on the GW talk page where I argue for more explanation of the reasons scientists believe in GW.  Also a better definition of GW. Is it (a) the fact that instrument temperatures are on average higher than a century ago (b) a process that underlies that fact (c) the hypothesis that the process has an anthropogenic cause?  These are all different things. (a) could be true because of random fluctuations (b) could be true if the process were a natural one.

As for the use of the term """"fled"""" - it's a good middlepoint between """"emmigrated"""" end """"expelled"""" that shows the element of fear was an important factor in the decision to leave, which is true and can't be ignored. The term is used twice: once for the 30,000 Jews who fled Llibya in the years 1949-1951 and second for Jews fleeing Egypt post-1948. In both cases I think the use of the term is appropriate.   """,0

Hi John.  In answer to your question about why the UPenn study is inappropriate for the article, I'm reposting a quote from WP:MEDRS: """"any given primary source [such as this study] may be contradicted by another, and the Wikipedia community relies on the guidance of expert reviews, and statements of major medical and scientific bodies, to provide guidance on any given issue."""" 
When I first read  statement, """"We do not use primary sources to refute secondary ones,"""" I was pretty confused.  I mean, primary sources are more fundamental, right?  Well, the idea is just that when the """"secondary source"""" is a systematic review or the like, what that means is that the secondary source has looked at the all primary sources and evaluated their significance and rendered a scientific judgment.  The authors of the secondary source are better able to interpret the primary sources, not only because they are collecting those sources and considering them in the context of all the available evidence, but because those authors are experts in their fields.  We should expect that they understand the data better than we do, or, at the very least, better than the average reader.  Interpreting primary sources is challenging, and when the experts have already done it for us, there is no reason to foist that responsibility on the average reader. 
From my perpsective, the issue of whether it's a press release or a peer reviewed article quoted to describe the UPenn/Philadelphia study is more or less a red herring.  That study is just a single study, and we should trust the public health experts to render judgment rather than ourselves or the readership. I hope this helps answer your question.   """,0

Philosophy of education
I was surprised that you did not propose to move Constructivism (philosophy of education) to Constructivist epistemology. Why discriminate against Constructivism when you feel so strongly about Behaviorism, Cognitivism, and Humanism?  

Constructivism seems to be more consciously employed within the philosophy of education. I prefer to err on the side of leaving material if there might be a basis for doing so. (In addition, there is an extant article on this with considerable substance.)
There are many schools which strive to provide a humanistic education, and an article could be written about this if there are sufficient sources. This would probably be a little different than an article on humanism as a philosophy of education. Why (I ask rhetorically)? Isn't it less a coherent philosophy of education, than a coherent philosophy, which some have tried to apply in an educational context?
Behaviorism in the philosophy of education, could perhaps be a helpful section of the behaviorism article, but it doesn't seem to justify an article in its own right.   

I write in historical context about what has already happened in education not about what might be or could be, which leads me to suggest that your viewpoint is not one of an educator. As an educator, philosophies of learning and philosophies of instruction are distinct and that distinction is very important. The descriptive and the perscriptive are frequently confused in Wikipedia articles. Unraveling that confusion is a monumental task. the vocabulary used by Philosophy majors and Psychology majors overlaps with the work of Education majors but one does not exempt the other . . . and where there are differences, the differences are significant. Please exercise care in exempting the work of other disciplines . . . it does not lead to cooperation.

I think you need to review the ArbCom findings once again. It doesn't seem you've learned from all that's been discussed on the matters in general, or the specific concerns pertaining to you.   

There were specific concerns raised in that ArbCom about skeptics pushing their viewpoint. Placing an NPOV template on an article that uses exclusively mainstream sources because """"the topic is by definition pseudoscientific"""" is a classic example of the latter.

 Bot is deleting wikiproject banners 

see  where the bot deleted a wikiproject banner with the summary """"Notifying of move discussion""""  65.92.180.137  
This is interesting. The bot did just fine when it first posted the notice at 03:00, 6 March 2013.
Seven days later, after leaving the notice undisturbed for a week, at 00:14, 13 March 2013 it removed the project template and updated its timestamp.
That's not the only talk page banner it disturbed with that update. Also:
Talk:Malling, Moselle – at 00:15, 13 March 2013
Talk:Monastyrysche Raion – at 00:16, 13 March 2013
This seems to be some one-off glitch—I've not seen this bug before. It may be a side-effect of some other issue, and could be hard to track down.   
Whatever the bug is, it is causing a wholesale overwrite of the entire talk page, from what I can see, it deletes the entire talk page, and replaces it with the new notice.  65.92.180.137

 Recent revert 

I think some of this article is too """"flowery"""" and should just stick to the facts.  I have an issue with the following 

""""Should her appeal fail, her remaining hopes lie only with the British people and government, a nation in which many people oppose capital punishment.  If she is unsuccessful in canvassing support and overturning her conviction or being granted clemency, she faces execution by lethal injection.""""

I feel this should be simplified to:

""""If her appeal fails or if she is not granted clemency, she faces execution by lethal injection.""""

The details are as follows:

1. """"...her remaining hopes lie only with the British people and government..."""" - this overemphasizes the importance of Britich public opinion of the US judicial system.  It would be more appropriate to say here hopes rest on the Govenor of Texas or whoever it is who has the authority to grant clemancy as they are the people with the autority to free her

2. """"...a nation in which many people oppose capital punishment..."""" - POV and should be removed.  The statement could just as easily state that many people in the UK support capital punishment.  Here is a mori poll that claims that 70% support capital punishment http://www.beecareful.info/news/general/74447-channe-4-poll-reveals-70-per-cent-support-for-the-death-penalty.html.

3. """"...If she is unsuccessful in canvassing support and overturning her conviction or being granted clemency, she faces execution by lethal injection..."""" - stating the obvious - i.e. she is on death row so obviously if nothing changes, she will be executed.

"Still, it's clear that Wulfila chose a lot of his spelling conventions based on those of Greek.

So what sound was αι in the Greek of the time? Was it higher than ε or lower? The page Koine Greek phonology shows that both were in fact homophones and had been already for hundreds of years before. So if he took those two writing conventions from Greek, he did not take their pronunciations as they are different in Gothic.

Lazy editing is removing factual information which you could have sourced in 3 seconds work. I'd say content is considerably more important than formatting a citation prettily. Derex 
 Excuse me, but I spent five minutes formatting that source, including verifying what was in the article. My edit was proper. It brought the claim in line with the source provided. Your edit removed a valid citation, and replaced it with a simple inline link, which works against the interest of the project. A cite is still valid with a dead link, if the publishing info is there. But when an inline link goes dead without that information, it is much more difficult to find again. I know, because I had to chase down about a third of the citations in that article over the past couple of weeks. So don't get snarky with me.

Please don't remove trivially sourced content from Wikipedia, which works against the interest of the project. My edit removed neither facts nor citations. Pretty formatting is all very nice, but this is an encylopedia. There is nothing at all wrong with adding inline links, as I did, particularly when they support the facts in an article. My edit was proper. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the factual content added by others, and be a little more careful next time. - Derex 
 Not one of my edits removed the source that the anon editor provided. WP:ATT requires that the editor inserting the claim source it properly. The claim did not match the source, so I simply adjusted it during the primary act of adding actual citation information to to URL. According to WP:ATT, it is not my responsibility to further source every claim that an anon adds to an article. It is my responsibility, according to an agreement made on the talk page, to properly cite all the sources that were in the article, so that they may be further verified. A proper citation, with author, title, publisher, and date, is always preferable (even with NO url) to a simple URL. If some high school kid is researching at the library, and he finds a good citation, he can look that article up on microfiche, but if all that is there is a dead link, he's screwed.

 Palestinian Christians 

Hi - you have made dozens of edits and reverts to the Palestinian Christians page. Your latest one is regarding Elinor Joseph. Your comment was """"she is not a Palestinian, and non of her parents is of palestinian decen either! she does not belong to this page"""". I have looked high and low throughout Google and elsewhere, and the ONLY thing I turn up is that she is indeed a Palestinian Arab Christian, her parents are Palestinian Arab Christians.

First off, you should not edit the list templates directly, as the bot will ignore any changes. Also, you cannot use vertical pipes anywhere in the syntax other than in separating the template name, the section name, and the reason, otherwise everything messes up. In place, use .

My two main suggestions are to make smaller improvements to the article and to use more than one source. Unless you are very skilled at proper paraphrasing, using a single source greatly increases the risk of close paraphrasing, i.e. improper paraphrasing, and also leads to a very one-sided view of the subject. I've added two reference to the article with links to their pages on Google books (most of which are visible, at least in the UK). The print copies may also be in the Longy library:
Marco, Tomás (1993). Spanish Music in the Twentieth Century. 
Draayer, Suzanne Rhodes (2009). Art Song Composers of Spain: An Encyclopedia
The previous reference I had added—Romero, Justo (2004). Liner Notes: Joaquín Turina (1882–1949): Piano Music, Vol. 1—is also very useful, especially for discussing his musical style and works chronology. I suggest you use these as your sources for further expansion with the biography on joaquinturina.com] as a back-up only.
 
One thing you could do is separate out the last paragraph (beginning with """"His works include..."""") with its own heading Music and expand the commentary there. For example, he was a very noted composer of art song, which is given short shrift in the article. Much has been written about his approach to incorporating Spanish musical idiom in his work and on his style in general, including its strengths and weaknesses. This is also lacking in the article.
 
Another possibility, is to separate out a section at the beginning of biography to Early years where you discuss his family background and his musical education prior to Paris. The material between that section and Music could be entitled Paris and Madrid and can always be expanded in the future.
 
A third possibility is to expand and rationalize the list of works in the article. The current one has three major problems. First, it excludes many of his important works because it relies solely on those scores available at IMSLP. Secondly, it gives no indication of each work's type. Thirdly, it gives no indication of the date of their composition. Listing them alphabetically, is not a good way to go. If you do decide to concentrate on improving the works list, I suggest using List of compositions by Claude Debussy by genre as a model, although in this case, the list would not be a separate article, but rather continue to appear in the Selected works section of Joaquín Turina.
 
Hope that helps. Best,   """,0

If you look at my changes today, I included only the birth dates of the two children who are now adults (one of whom has a Wikipedia article already) with three independent sources for Track’s birth date of 20 April 1989, and I included the birth date for baby Trig, since he was SO MUCH in the news last year. I was trying to find a compromise position. There is no consensus here for including or for excluding, and, if you read previous talk pages, you will see no consensus there either.

In the spirit of erring on the side of more information (Wikipedia’s mission is to inform, after all), I made today’s revision. The immediate reversion, wiping out all birth dates, except that of little Tripp Johnston (certainly the most irrelevant birth date of all), is a bit risible and does not demonstrate any consensus either. As for the sources, I shall find better ones, but that argument is a red herring. No one has found any other birth date for Track other than 20 April 1989. All the sources (weaker or stronger) agree on the birth date.

I have read WP:UNDUE. It supports including neutral factual information. Birth dates fall into that category. I really don’t see where the problem is here.

On Makemi’s previous comment
Makemi said """"I'm not clear on how this is revolutionary, it seems like a bigger/faster/louder computer piano.""""

I deleted the remark on the CEUS being a milestone. I even deleted anything that could be judged as being a praise. Despite the fact that even the praises I made were based on facts, on the quest that has been going on for more than two decades by makers of reproducing pianos to try to produce a reproducing piano that would truly record and playback the full gamut of expressiveness of the best performers at the piano.

So here is the current article that I have, incorporating the recent change I made, following Makemi’s feedback. Any praise of any kind has been deleted by me (even though my praises were based on facts, on knowledge).

The New (2006) Bösendorfer Reproducing Grand Piano: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano
Pianos That Has For goal of Accomplishing Full Expressiveness at the Keyboard==
During the past recent decades, a reproducing piano (also sometimes called a computer piano or a player piano) has been defined as being first an acoustic piano that is not diminished in any way in its ability to play piano pieces. The touch at the keyboard and the sound produced by a reproducing piano is not changed in any way compared to a normal acoustic piano. However, a reproducing piano has an unobtrusive computer interface that allows the pianist to record and playback the piano pieces that are performed on it. Usually, it also has a silent mechanism that stops the hammers from striking the strings and that allows the pianist to play silently at the keyboard, at any time during the day or the night without disturbing others, and with the option of using headphones to hear digital sounds while playing silently at the keyboard (many digital sounds are available: piano, harpsichord, organ, strings, etc.). It also has a MIDI interface that allows the pianist to play back many pieces that are available on this particular MIDI format. However, the MIDI format allows the recording and playback of the velocity of the hammers of the piano only at a level of accuracy of 127 scales (or 127 steps if you prefer). The problem is that several pianistic techniques move the hammers at an incredibly high speed, making these 127 scales highly insufficient to be able to record and playback accurately the very high velocity of the hammers. The capability of a reproducing piano to convey the full expressiveness of the pianist at the keyboard is directly related to its ability to record and playback accurately the velocity of the hammers that are moved when the pianist presses the keys at the keyboard. Consequently, a reproducing piano usually also has a more accurate proprietary format to record and playback piano pieces at a much higher level of accuracy than the MIDI format. In summary, a reproducing piano is a very flexible musical instrument that combines the old (an acoustic piano) with the new (a MIDI format but especially the recording and playing back of the piano) at the same time. It allows the pianist to play the numerous MIDI piano pieces available but, more importantly, to record and playback piano pieces at a higher level of accuracy than it is possible to do with the MIDI format.

The quality of the Bösendorfer pianos and especially the sound that they produce are the result of a long and old tradition of piano making.

Bösendorfer also kept in touch with modernity. They took an active participation at making reproducing pianos first with their SE 290 computer piano that was made in collaboration with Wayne Stahnke. It was considered by the entire community of piano makers to be the most accurate reproducing piano of its time.
At the beginning of 2006, Bösendorfer introduced its next generation of reproducing pianos: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano.

Previously to the Bösendorfer CEUS Computer Grand Piano, several scientific studies were made that had for main goal to assess if the reproducing pianos that were available were as faithful to the expressiveness of the best performers at the piano as they should be. These studies concluded that the best reproducing pianos (including the SE 290 computer piano) were not as faithful at recording and playing back the performance of the best pianists as they should have been (see in particular """"Measurement and reproduction accuracy of computer-controlled grand pianos"""" by Werner Goebl, et al., August 6-9, 2003).

Taking this conclusion as an incentive to raise the accuracy of its reproducing piano (the SE 290 computer piano), Bösendorfer set themselves to create an even more accurate reproducing piano that would accomplish THE VERY CHALLENGING GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO RECORD AND PLAYBACK THE FULL GAMUT OF EXPRESSIVENE",0

 What incident? 

The article says:
As a result of an incident during Richard's coronation celebrations, great persecution of the Jews took place throughout the county.
Presumably this should say country, but what incident is this? Details! Don't leave us in suspense!

 Homosexuality 

Sorry to overrule a point, but there is no creditable way to suggest that Richard was not homosexual, despite the fact that  the category 'homosexual' did not exist in the middle ages.  He had sex with men, many times, and showed almost no interest in women.  Any respectable biography will say the same.  I felt it was important to make this point, and have changed a sentence or two to reflect this, but not made a large deal out of it  (for instance, not created a separate section). -Ft Louie

This is, IMO, a good point. There were a couple of lines devoted to this, as well as King Rick's inclusion in the GLBTQ article category, which were reverted by an anon as 'anon vandalism' (bizarre, no?). This should be restored, as there is at least excellent anecdotal evidence that Richard did indeed have a predominating interest in men.  16:39, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Again, Richard being a bisexual or gay, met a person in denial (or person in some other way disturbed by the fact that there have been non-heterosexuals also in history as well as there are today), who on 29.5.2005 vandalized this article by removals. This time, the vandal used the username Alphax. As above indicated, previous similar vandal attempts occurred in March 2005 and December 2004. Hopefully the vandal or vandals are enjoined from such future activity.  

Alphax wasn't vandalizing, don't be ridiculous. He was removing what appears to be extreme speculation, written in poor English. You make a number of claims that would benefit from a source - where does Richard confess to being homosexual? Note also that the IP you were using to add the material the first time also added similar nonsense to Humphrey and Isabella's articles, including """"Category:Faghags"""" to Isabella.  

I think you Adam should not be ridiculous. If you look carefully at the edit history of this article, you see that most of those texts were added by other editors months ago. And you have the basic reference: the biographer mentioned by that editor and listed in the references, obviously has answered your question. Please read it (I haven't - I trust on the previous editor - and I have not time to seek all books). 

As to Alphax, since that person clearly did not read this talk page, nor offered here the reasons for removal, before removals, it is regarded as act of vandalism.  

I removed the stuff because it was badly written, lacked references,, and was there was a link to a website that attempted to """"prove"""" the claims, also without references.  τεχ 08:10, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The problem with Richard's alleged homosexuality is that no one, not a single primary or secondary source, from Richard's time unti WWII, ever mentioned that Richard liked men; in fact, he was often cited for his abnormal lust for women.    The contrary view first appeared in """"The Plantagenets"""" by J.H. Harvey in 1949.  The theory remains highly controversial and, to be honest, viewed with some skepticism by the mainstream academic world.  It is a theory worth stating in the article, but it should be noted that there remains serious discussion on whether or not it's true.   

Well to be honest, you can simply remove that part entirely if you want. 62.78 seems to have moved on to other articles, and I know I've removed his nonsense from a number of other articles with no further reaction from him.  

I think one of the arguments for it is his lack of offspring, legitimate or otherwise: one illegitimate child, if I recall correctly. But a bout of mumps or other infection could have curtailed his fertility. Or perhaps he was the ungenerous sort who didn't acknowledge his illegitimate kids.  

The book Warriors of God is an excellent portrayal of King Richard's life, including his homosexual relationship with the King of France.

Here is the original section I've pulled from-
Personally, I prefer this info to be integrated into the article more seamlessly, but I have accepted """"comments/criticism"""" sections as a necessary part of these types of articles as there tends to be no other way to share this information without damaging the integrity of the article.

So this done, let's all take it easy. Those who think it is a poor section please leave it and place in your cite requests. Those who think it deserves to stay can work to find those cites and clean it up. This can and will become a good section if we let it be and allow for the open source machine to work it's magic.

So, the British sided with the Americans, and the current border reflects the American claim?
What were the differences between this and the Canadian claim? - Unsigned User:Geo Swan

Actually, the current boundary does not reflect the maximal U.S. claim.  I'll try to trype in some more info.   

The British didn't exactly side with the Americans; the border settlement was an arbitration (the Kaiser again, IIRC, as it had been with his father at the end of the San Juans Dispute).  The British backed down because of threats by T.E. Roosevelt that he would invade and annex British Columbia if he didn't get his way.  The main difference between the British hard position and the way things are now is that under the British terms, thet """"Yukon Ports"""" - Skagway and Haines and Dyea etc would have been """"British"""", i.e. part of British Columbia.

Canada didn't have a say in it, other than consulting London; British North American (Canadian) foreign affairs were still in London's bailiwick at that time (until 1931 or 1927 or something).

As it is under the treaty, the site of Forts Stikine and Taku should be within British Columbia; and in fact the mouths of the Stikine and Taku should be, but they've silted in a few miles downstream since the treaty was signed; the border hasn't been revised to reflect that (obviously not, even though it's in the language; same thing with the mis-survey of the 49th Parallel that's not going to get corrected, either).

There are two sticking points remaining in the Alaska Boundary Settlement.  One is that the treaty stipulates that the western shoreline of the Portland Canal is the boundary; US maps continue to show mid-channel.  Similarly with the A-B Line, which is between Point A and Point B on the north side of the Dixon Entrance; US maps show the boundary as being mid-Dixon Entrance, and the US/Alaska have even issued oil/drilling-exploration permits on """"their"""" side of that line.

Same kind of fudge-up with the Oregon Treaty; during the Salmon War of the mid-1990s Canadian commercial vessels (whale watching boats) were busted by US Coast Guard in the area of the San Juans; but the treaty is very clear that ALL commercial vessels south of the 49th Parallel are to be unhindered; that would even include in Rosario Strait, far from the current border in the Haro Strait; during the same kafuffle Sen. Slade Gorton (State-Sen) in Washington invoked the treaty to demand free passage through the Johnstone Strait for American fishing vessels (nothing of the kind is guaranteed in the Oregon Treaty, or for that matter in the Alaska treaty either) and called on the US Navy to enforce the """"international waterway"""" (which is all of a mile wide in spots).  Thing is it was the US who passed legislation that attacked non-American ships using this route, i.e. the act that makes it so that preference is given to vessels sailing from American port to American port over those from a """"foreign port"""" to an American port; this act was passed specifically to route the Yukon shipping trade through Seattle over Vancouver, even though it was Canadian/British waters that the route traversed. 

Further Thoughts

Just considering the opening statements; the treaty was actually between the British Empire, with the Dominion of Canada as a signatory party, IIRC; BC was not involved in the actual signing.

And just as aside the phrasing of the second condition of the treaty cited:

Whenever the summit of the mountains shall be at a distance of more than ten marine leagues from the ocean, the limit shall be formed by a line parallel to the winding of the coast, and which shall never exceed the distance of ten marine leagues therefrom.

...is completely bizarre for anybody who's ever actually looked at a map of the coastline.  The negotiators were in London and Washington and Ottawa, far away with only the dimmest idea of where they were talking about.  Much the same as the Oregon Treaty, only worse; there """"the deepest channel"""" seemed at least a bit logical, even though they didn't note the issues on the map with Point Roberts and the Gulf Islands/San Juans which make that border a bit of an absurdity; which so is the 49th Parallel from the Rockies west....that aside, the Alaska treaty issue cited is utterly bizarre; the Alaskan coast is a ragged array of inlets and bays, pierced by several large rivers.  There is no """"crest of the mountains"""", for one thing - other than crowsflight-drawn lines from high peak to high peak, which i",0

 Figures in the infobox... once again 

I found this:

The Russian defeat of Berlin was inevitable for they outnumbered the Germans in men 5:1, guns 15:1, tanks 5:1 and planes 3:1. < that's a lot more (2x more men, and no German artillery in infobox at all).

Until recently the Russians had claimed that they lost 10,000 men during the battle for the Seelow Heights and 100,000 in Berlin. The actual figures are unknown. Yet no less than 30,000 Red Army soldiers were killed at Seelow, and the staggering figure of 600,000 killed in Berlin seems more plausible. Konev complained at one point that he was losing 1,000 men a day because Zhukov's artillery failed to shift fire when asked. Zhukov denied that allegation, stating that Konev was not using his troops intelligently. < now a HOLE DAMN LOT more (Wikipedia now claims only 81,000 Communist soldiers were killed in the whole operation, while even the OLD Soviet figures were appearently more 100,000 in the city alone). 

I'd like to note Battle of the Seelow Heights says 35,000 Communist soldiers were killed in this battle, which is even more than claimed by these sources.

Other source (modern Russian): The Battle of Berlin was a costly and bloody one with over 300,000 Soviet casualties. The number of German losses is unknown but roughly 480,000 were taken prisoner. (infobox says """"134,000 captured"""")

Still another: However, it should be noted that the Soviet Union placed their own casualties as over 300,000 in the two weeks of fighting from the Oder to the collapse of Berlin.8This number included killed, wounded and missing. Interestingly, recent western sources place the total casualties suffered by the Soviets as even higher. (...) Although the exact estimate of Russian casualties during the battle for Berlin is unclear (infobox says """"81,000 killed"""", etc - while everyone knows the Soviet numbers were completely unreliable.)

How about just not putting any figures, as are really just unknown? 

Also, Britannica about overall Soviet (unknown!) losses:

Available estimates of Soviet casualties vary widely. A Soviet officer  who served with the high command in Berlin and left the Soviet service in 1949 placed total military losses at 13,600,000 8,500,000 dead or missing in battle; 2,600,000 dead in prison camps; 2,500,000 died of woundsand estimated civilian casualties at 7,000,000. These figures have been widely accepted in Germany, but most U.S. compilations, based on Soviet  announcements, list 6,000,000 to 7,500,000 battle deaths. Calculations made on the basis of population distribution by age and sex in the 1959 U.S.S.R. census give some credence to the higher figures, for they seem to indicate losses of from 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 males of military age in World War II. The figures used here are a compromise estimate, not intended to obscure the fact that Soviet casualties are, in reality, unknown in the West.   """,0

With all due respect, the criticism section as it stands is a total mess. Setting aside the fact that it reads as if the year is 2001, an inordinate amount of text is devoted to a recitation of the Bovard article, which is A) a clear partisan attack piece (it begins with a snide and largely irrelevant attack on then-president Clinton's character), B) a shoddy piece of opinion journalism overwrought with loaded assumptions (witness the dismissive tone about """"politically correct noncompetitive recreation""""), and C) dated. Did nobody else notice this thing is almost a decade old? Yet it is being used as the backbone for the longest subsection on an organization that is evolving, growing, and changing to this very day. Bovard *does* bring facts to the table but as it stands now they are sitting in a void of time and space. His article does not make it clear how statistically representative the examples of """"corruption"""" were to Americorps as it functioned circa 1993-1999, let alone Americorps as it functions today.

I am not an expert by any means on Wikipedia's guidelines, I have never added or edited an article and it would not be appropriate for me to start here. But given this article's immediate onslaught of criticism, I would have expected an ongoing narrative about whether any stuck (especially with the imminent arrival of a conservative presidency) and how (and why) Americorps changed throughout the Bush years, leading into its present growth. Instead what we are left with is the cluttered product of a single user's anti-government tirade. I am not against noting that libertarians have a death wish for Americorps, but take, for instance, the section about Bovard's """"unofficial source,"""" who dismisses the reading program. From the beginning it was a rather questionable inclusion, but it is flatly contradicted by the study cited thereafter. Again, I'm no Wikipedia expert, but it seems to me an empirical measurement of reality should trump the anonymously-sourced attack from a pundit with a clear agenda. Why, then, is this whole exchange even necessary?

Equally embarrassing is the sentence about GED students, who now apparently need to be stigmatized for no reason. The short """"Articles suggest..."""" paragraph is only a little less disastrous; it presupposes that helping people get welfare is a bad thing, a judgment call which I think ought to be left to the reader. And even setting all that aside, why, from a journalistic point of view, does the above paragraph re-introduce the Bovard article? It disrupts the readability of this page, making it all the clearer that the criticism section comes from someone who is more concerned with piling one slanted attack after another than with writing an informative, cogent article. Narrative context is jettisoned in yet another paragraph (""""There have been a number of criticisms..."""") which goes on to raise vague, weaselly arguments sourced by an article that returns a 404. The user above me has a raised a critique that I think is also fair about the last paragraph's apparent opposition to the concept of self-esteem.

If I could make a suggestion (and given my lack of Wiki experience I freely welcome its rejection) this whole section, as well as the one above it, needs to be wiped clean. There is nothing wrong with noting that Americorps had some issues in the '90s, so long as this article leaves one able to discern that we are no longer living in the '90s. As it stands, the specific citations strike me as largely irrelevant cases of excess scrutinizing. The $20k+ cost to the taxpayer per volunteer is a valuable piece of information and should not be omitted from this article. It should also not be mentioned without reference to the benefits that Americorps volunteers provide. Contrary to the what the criticism section implies, it does not seem likely that tens of thousands of volunteers per year are being paid only to paint murals and put on puppet shows. If this means that Wiki editors have to conduct more contemporary research (the last 3-4 years seeming most appropriate) in order to determine just what services Americorps volunteers provide and who they affect, so be it. No doubt it would be even more difficult to assess how Americorps changes the lives and attitudes of its volunteers (and perhaps I am biased supposing from the onset that it creates more generous public services) but this, too, would be a benefit. Cite the cost, describe the benefits as neutrally as possible, and let the reader determine for himself whether the end result is """"efficient."""" And move on. 173.52.83.2  M32""",0

Then someone else can smooth it along, or i may do so myself when I have more time, or after leaving the piece and re-reading it. It can be quite difficult to write good prose in one go, because you do not spot your mistakes.

 Fantastic! Thanks! –  (talk | contrib) 

 What are you doing? 
You created a huge mess in the CFR article by deleting the paragraph that leads into the cite of the Kelleher case, which results in a horribly confusing non sequitur. (That's what was being discussed on the talk page.) Plus it sounds like you are unfamiliar with federal administrative law, in which the plain English manuals are often more important for day-to-day contact with federal agencies than the regulations or statutes (unless one is dealing directly with agency lawyers). Famous examples are the USPTO's MPEP, IRS's IRM, SSA's POMS, and the CMS Online Manual System.   

 Well then I suppose you can cite it, right? No? Can't find a reliable source for your opinions and weasel words:
 """"...must be carefully drafted in highly technical language...""""
 """"Unfortunately, the vast majority of employees of the federal government are not lawyers...""""
 """"...it would ask too much to force them to directly read, interpret, and apply the convoluted content of the CFR...""""
 """"...very simple language that any layperson can follow...""""

Guys a Arvanite that says I'am Greek its not a Arvanit but a Greek!The ancestors of the arvanites where Albanian farmers and highlanders from Toskëria and Epirus!My great-grandfather was Arvanit..Arbanitika belongs to the linguistic family of Albanian.The first Christian Albanian migrations to central and southern(note: Albanian of north-western Greece are on Albanian native lands) of what is today Greek territory took place as early as the XI-XII centuries (Trudgill, 1975:5; Banfi, 1994:19), although the main ones most often mentioned in the bibliography happened in the XIV-XV centuries, when Albanians were invited to settle in depopulated areas by their Byzantine, Catalan or Florentine rulers (Tsitsipis, 1994:1; Trudgill, 1975:5; Nakratzas, 1992:20-24 & 78-90; Banfi, 1994:19). According to some authors, they were also fleeing forced Islamization by the Turks in what is today Albania (Katsanis, 1994:1). So, some have estimated that, when the Ottomans conquered the whole Greek territory in the XV century, some 45% of it was populated by Albanians (Trudgill, 1975:6). Another wave of Albanian migrations took place during the Ottoman period, mainly in the XVIII century (Trudgill, 1975:6; Banfi, 1994:19). All these Albanians are the ancestors of modern-day Arbanites in Central and Southern Greece.

When the modern Greek state was formed, the Albanian-speaking population and its language were called Albanian .Bickford-Smith, 1993: 47; Embeirikos, 1994; Vakalopoulos, 1994:243-249). However, the policy of the new Greek state was to Hellenize all the non-Greek speaking Orthodox populations within its, then limited, territory as well as in the territories of Epirr, Macedonia, Thrace and Asia Minor still under Ottoman rule). As elsewhere in Europe, army and education were the most effective mechanisms of Hellenization, assisted by the judiciary system ready to denounce and punish all forms of behavior inconsistent with the state’s nationalist culture (Kitromilidis, 1990:38; Kollias, 1994).

"I notice that you everything you work on is related to Persians and other groups problems with those issues

May I ask you how you are an expert on such topics as scholars from the Middle East and their biographies or the Persian Gulf, and Kurds?  

 Oh, ya I also cited your statments about the fact that you wanted to cite that certain Muslim clerics have okayed sex with animals and children. How do you justify this statement and thought and even treat it like it could be true? 

IN reply to you this is what I observe, alongside others....
These are your direct quotes on the Khoemini discussion page ;

I had seen some literature out there suggesting that Khomenini approved of sex with children and animals. Now someone has added some of these claims into this article. I'm not going to take them out, but the article is going to receive a dispute tag until these information are verified. AucamanTalk 

Here is a direct quote from you to user:Pecher;
I've added some stuff about Khomeini's views on non-Muslims, but people might try to take them out. Could you keep an eye on that article as well? AucamanTalk 
This is verified on user:Pecher's talk page.

What is all the interest you and Pecher have on Khoeimini and other Iranian clerics. Also your articles on Ahmadenajid all show a disturbing trend that you are trying to paint some sort of picture. It is like connect the dots. 

Here are a list of articles you have worked on;

 Human rights abuses by the Iraqi insurgency
 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel
 Controversies surrounding Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
 International reactions to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy
 Opinions on the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy

All your edits really benefit in making Israel look good compared to the rest of the Middle East. Answer me this are you an Israeli citizen too? I think you are on an agenda.

"""As a result of the massacre in Boston, Parliament began to consider a motion to partially repeal the Townshend duties.[3] Most of the new taxes were repealed, but the tax on tea was retained. The British government continued in its attempt to tax the colonists without their consent and the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution followed.

Following the Seven Years War 1756–1763, the British Empire was deep in debt. To help pay some of the costs of the newly expanded empire, the Parliament of Great Britain/British Parliament decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of British America. Previously, through the Trade and Navigation Acts, Parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire. However, with the Sugar Act of 1764, Parliament sought for the first time to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue. American colonists initially objected to the Sugar Act for economic reasons, but before long they recognized that there were constitutional issues involved.

It was argued that the Bill of Rights 1688 protected British subjects from being taxed without the consent of a truly representative Parliament. Because the colonies elected no members of the British Parliament, many colonists viewed Parliament's attempt to tax them as a violation of the constitutional doctrine of taxation only by consent. Some British politicians countered this argument with the theory of """"virtual representation"""", which maintained that the colonists were in fact represented in Parliament even though they elected no members. This issue, only briefly debated following the Sugar Act, became a major point of contention following Parliament's passage of the 1765 Stamp Act. The Stamp Act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies, contributing to its repeal the following year, along with the lack of substantial revenue being raised.

Implicit in the Stamp Act dispute was an issue more fundamental than taxation and representation: the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.[4] Parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 by simultaneously passing the Declaratory Act, which proclaimed that Parliament could legislate for the colonies """"in all cases whatsoever"""".[5]

Townshend's program
Raising revenue

The first of the Townshend Acts, sometimes simply known as the Townshend Act, was the Revenue Act of 1767.[6] This act represented the Chatham ministry's new approach for generating tax revenue in the American colonies after the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766.[7] The British government had gotten the impression that because the colonists had objected to the Stamp Act on the grounds that it was a direct (or """"internal"""") tax, colonists would therefore accept indirect (or """"external"""") taxes, such as taxes on imports.[8] With this in mind, Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, devised a plan that placed new duties on paper, paint, lead, glass, and tea that were imported into the colonies.[9] These were items that were not produced in North America and that the colonists were only allowed to buy from Great Britain.[10]

The British government's belief that the colonists would accept """"external"""" taxes resulted from a misunderstanding of the colonial objection to the Stamp Act. The colonists' objection to """"internal"""" taxes did not mean that they would accept """"external"""" taxes; the colonial position was that any tax laid by Parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional.[8] """"Townshend's mistaken belief that Americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional"""", wrote historian John Phillip Reid, """"was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the Revolution.""""[11] The Townshend Revenue Act received the royal assent on 29 June 1767.[12] There was little opposition expressed in Parliament at the time. """"Never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet passage"""", wrote historian Peter Thomas.[12]

The Revenue Act was passed in conjunction with the Indemnity Act of 1767,[13] which was intended to make the tea of the British East India Company more competitive with smuggled Dutch tea.[14] The Indemnity Act repealed taxes on tea imported to England, allowing it to be re-exported more cheaply to the colonies. This tax cut in England would be partially offset by the new Revenue Act taxes on tea in the colonies.[15] The Revenue Act also reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance, or general search warrants, which gave customs officials broad",0

Male graduates before 1969 
I've added mention to the 'trivia' section regarding men who matriculated at vassar immediately after world war II on the GI bill. I suppose this could be classified as 'original research', not sure. My father was in that first graduating class that included men (eleven of them). A scan of the relevant portion of the program from the graduation ceremonies can be found here . again, if this constitutes original research, i guess it can be pulled, though it is a rather fascinating bit of history.  

 Bias 

There are many abundantly clear examples of bias in this article: “Vassar is often praised for its beautiful campus, a 1000 acre (4 km?) lot of land marked by period and modern buildings that is also an arboretum; since that time, it has maintained its reputation as one of America's outstanding liberal arts colleges, and is especially noted for its tolerant social atmosphere; the college is a member of the """"Little Ivies,"""" an unaffiliated group of elite northeastern liberal arts colleges; Vassar is a leader in producing doctoral candidates; Vassar students are well known for their individuality, creativity, and open-mindedness; many beautiful old brick buildings are scattered throughout the bucolic campus, but there are also several modern and contemporary structures worth noting.""""  Did this come straight from the College’s website?   

 Bias ? 

I disagree with the above allegation of bias in the article.  I found no similarity between the Vassar Web site and the article.  The information in question - the attractiveness of the campus - seems fairly innocuous and is fairly similar to the type of information in Wikipedia articles about other liberal arts colleges and several universities.  The article reads like synopsis of commercially available background information in colleges guide books.  While I would have written the main paragraph differently, I hardly think this qualifies as biased, and without some criteria to differentiate this page from other pages on other schools, I believe the objection should be removed from this page.

The article violates Wikipedia's NPOV policy, clearly.  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, a place to find innformation, not a forum for opinions.  If you are unwilling to make changes, then I will go ahead and make them myself.  Also, you should leave you name when commenting.   

Also, I realize that the article is not up to date and violates Wikipedia's policy against personal research (ie, students spend time doing ceratin activities on a certain lawn).   

I do agree that much of the information on this page is somewhat biased. And the architectural info came from me, not the college's website - so, my apologies for lack of """"neutrality"""" there. However, if you edit the page to remove said """"bias"""", please re-read your edits before saving the page. Simply removing phrases and not doing a little copyedit makes the page read poorly. I have made some minor edits just so that it reads a little cleaner, hopefully not restoring anything that you feel is biased. I think the bigger issue is that this page has become a series of lists (academic majors, famous alums, residence halls) with little encyclopedic content and is an embarrasment compared to other articles about comparable schools. Someone please help to fix this article!  """,0

I don't want to go about beating around a dead Bantha, but after reviewing the sequence of the transformation on DVD I discovered something interesting when viewing the scene in slow motion within chronological order. In one shot, we see Palpatine's face becoming the Sidious of the OT, followed by more lightning to the face. After a few close-ups on a conflicted Anakin, the camera focuses back on Palpatine, who is still in a transitional state but is lacking the details present in the previous shot. It is as if the Sidious face is showing through once as the lightning is interacting with the skin, and then fading away, and then finally breaking through again as the Palpatine face melts away and Sidious says he's too weak to continue. If Palpatine was indeed literally deformed by the lighting, why did his face go from normal, to Sidious, to semi-normal, and back to Sidious again. If the lightning wounded him, wouldn't the wounds stay instead of suddenly disappearing and re-appearing? Watch your DVDs, you'll see it. I have a few screen shots that I can provide to show you what I am referring to. By the way, both this and the regular Wikipedia article fail to make any mention of Sidious' strange voice after he rises from the window sill and before he puts on his hood. In the commentary, Lucas said he added synthesized effects to the voice to make the """"true Sidious"""" drip a bit more menace.

A possible derivation of Samba is Zambo (Southern/Central Africa), which also means to give comfort. Other derivatives are Sambu in Mandinka and Sambo in Hausa. The fact that the name was at one time fairly common and no longer used may have relationship to a song popularized by white Americans during the war from 1861-1865, """"Sambo's Right To Be Kilt,"""" and especially the derogatory usage of the name enshrined in the book Little Black Sambo.""""

That was a real  academic consensus,Paul!Much better than any evidence of a consensus about Pericles!It included(still does) Huston Baker former president of PMLA,and Karla Holloway,who was rewarded for her behavior by a temporary lectureship at Harvard.

But it, admirably, goes on to list some twenty reasons(with footnotes)demostrating why there are the most serious reasons(some of them physical as in the Duke case) for disbelieving that """"consensus"""".This constitutes a minimum of what both the young aand the old have a right to expect of the Shakespeare discussions.

"Socking and edit warring is not the answer==
I just wanted to put a note here, for folks who are apparently so angry that Wikipedia says there are <9000 jews in Iran that they are opening    (all blocked) in order to make it not say that, and folks curious about it.   I suggest the socking user find more constructive ways of contributing - there are many.  I think the consensus view is that we're not being arbitrary and we're not censoring; we have articles that say it had more Jews and are open to having articles report that Iran has far more Jews than the articles now say it has, provided it is verifiable to a source that trumps the actual, official, recent government census.  This has been discussed here and elsewhere, including talk pages linked to from this section (that is, #Iran).  The claims of a larger presence could be noted if, for example, there are verifiable sources that say that the numbers do not include significant numbers of Crypto-Jews living in Iran. (t•c)

No... we only categorize """"standard biographical information"""" (year of birth/death, religious affiliation, national identity, etc.) and those things that are related to what """"makes the subject notable"""".  In Graham's case his masonic credentials are not what """"make him notable"""". It does not really matter what Graham may have valued or what he was proud of... What matters is what sources (such as historians) think is of value.  If there are sources that discuss his Masonic credentials, and talk about how they affected Graham's life and his achievements, then he would be Categorized. 
The truth is, being a 32nd degree Mason is not that noteworthy... any 3rd degree Mason can become one... all it takes is paying an initiation fee, and spending one afternoon watching the degree ceremony being performed as a play.  In fact, you don't even have to take the 4th - 31st degrees as a prerequisite (you can jump right from being a 3rd degree to being 32nd).  Now, if Graham had been a 33rd degree things would be a bit different... that degree is somewhat rare and is a special award given for service.  
As for being elected Master of a lodge, even that is not that notable... most lodges elect a new Master every year, and since there are tens of thousands of lodges in the US alone, this means that there are literally hundreds of thousands of Past Masters in the US.  In smaller lodges, it is not uncommon for every member of the lodge to have a turn as Master.  Now... if Graham had been elected Grand Master of an entire Masonic jurisdiction things would be different... state or national level Masonic office is somewhat notable (there are only hundreds and not thousands each year), and that is the level of notability that deserves categorization.
All that said, both facts are interesting bits of biographical trivia, and probably should be """"mentioned in passing"""".  The place to do so is in the main body of the text.   """,0

Yes Mr., this number add up to more than 100%. This is because most of the Ahmadis does not show up there identity as Ahmadis in Pakistan. Secondly I agree with Mr.. -Definition of Muslim upon which all Muslim scholars agree is """"Muslim"""" means a person who believes in the unity and oneness of Almighty Allah, in the absolute and unqualified finality of the Prophet hood of Muhammad, the last of the prophets, and does not believe in, or recognize as a prophet or religious reformer, any person who claimed to be a prophet in any sense of the word or of any description, whatsoever, after Muhammad. All suni/shia scholars agree on this definition. For more detail you can see the authenticated books of both sunni's and shia's, you will find same words. But Ahmadis call Mr.Ghulam Ahmad there Prophet as stated here: Prophethood (Ahmadiyya). Thats the reason they are not allowed to call themselves as Muslim. Other Muslim countries do not declared them non-Muslims but Pakistan because this movement was started in India/Pakistan. India do not declared them non-Muslim officially because India is not an Islamic country, but all Muslim scholars of India consider them as non-Muslims. Hope so it clarifies. Discuss © """,0

""""While waves of laughter echoed through the theater, James Ferguson kept his eyes focused on Abraham Lincoln...the president joined the crowd with a 'hearty laugh...""""- The Darkest Dawn: Lincoln, Booth, and the Great American Tragedy by Thomas Goodrich

"I agree, and here arises the forlorn expectation: we cannot display anything except displayable colors so let's not expect that. CMY (witholding K for the moment) is factually a 3-dimensional model. Increasing the quantity of a single ink subtracts more light of the wavelengths that it absorbs, and that variation is orthogonal to (independent of) the densities of the other two inks. This is the mathematical view and is not misleading. It does not include the non-linearity of ink combination, which of course should also be treated in the article.
 For visualizing a space-filling entity a picture is worth a thousand words, not least for the inexperienced reader. Flat drawings of 3-D objects in perspective are not universally recognizable and here we have the additional challenge of seeing through a filled volume. Please propose any better way. The article on Volume rendering will help.

You give reasons 1 to 4 for adding black ink all of which I agree should be in the article. The animation could omit black and I did look at that. However it makes a convenient arbitrary rotation axis which in my view stabilises the perception of the animation. It would also be misleading to show the colour space filled right to the black vertex without the help of black ink.

Not all Assyrians lived in today's Iraq, they were spread all around the middle east after the fall of their empire.

Babylon had its province under the Persian empire, Ssanien empire and the Seleucid empire, these were the only empires that took control over the land of the Babylonians until the Muslim invasion, which then the Nestorian Church was established and the Chaldeans were a part of it.

 RFC 

I didn't say the sockpuppet issue wasn't relevant, I said it couldn't be proven and if he insists he's not JB it should be dropped.  The stuff with JB happened around the time I started on Wikipedia and I saw a little bit of it and have to agree that they have similar editing styles.  However, if we can't prove that Booyaka is JB, then we have to judge Booyaka's behavior on its own merits.  If, on the other hand, we can prove that Booyaka is JB, then Booyaka can be blocked.  

As for """"However when Booyaka replaced the tags and ignored the notes on the edit summary - that's when it became vandalism.""""  No, it's still a content dispute.  It's an inappropriate action, but not vandalism.  Read WP:Vandalism, especially the part about what vandalism is not.  I would call replacing the tags """"Bullying or Stubbornness"""".  Not right, not good, but not vandalism either.  Accusing someone of vandalism when they aren't vandalising takes a bad situation and makes it worse.  

You said, """"There are limited editors in Australia and New Zealand, so the obtaining of third party sources is hindered severely in the time sense.""""  I see that, hence my advice to him to go easy on the AFDs and just use {{unreferenced}}.  Not that I think he'll take my advice.

If true, that lets somebody know exactly what a Coxeter group is without knowing what the word """"presentation"""" means, or (worse) having to know or accept on faith any theorems about presentations.

Then the stuff about m_ij and so on could be presented as consequences of the definition.  And those who know about presentations could then say """"Ah, yes, and in fact the class of Coxeter groups can be defined via presentations"""".

I think in general definitions should involve just as little apparatus as possible, and only involve extra machinery when that significantly shortens and simplifies what is being defined.

Well, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:

In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. 

[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, """"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."""" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” 

Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. 

In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  

Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. 

If you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? 

I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? 

Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2",0

I finally got to this today, and I didn't see any tremendous conflict between what was previously in the article and what was in this reference; rather, it seemed to me that this reference simply offered more details than what the other website had.  The only real difference was that the above reference spoke of one Metropolitan robing the Tsar (without naming which one it was; there was more than one at the service), whereas the website account speaks of two, and names them as those of St. Petersburg and Kiev.  I chose to keep that reference, as it was more detailed than simply the vague """"metropolitan"""" spoken of here.  Indeed, there may not even be a conflict between the two references at all, if read in a certain way.  Other than that, I couldn't find any great discrepencies between this reference above and the one I used earlier; rather, this one has simply a few additional details that I incorporated into the text on the receipt of the sceptre and orb, and the invocation of the Trinity during that and the receipt of the crown.  Otherwise, this reference above seemed to confirm the other reference I used, at least as far as I could tell. -   """,0

I'll not go into further conclusions, the review says it all: sometimes the book does seem, as if  AK did not fight against Germans, but more against minorities in borders of Second Polish Republic.",0

 No, I didn't liken you to a dog. That's just an expression that means things are going downhill, IOW civil fringe POV pushers are being handed concessions and being allowed to do things their own way more and more, in spite of recent improvements in the way we're supposed to handle fringe beliefs. In this case allowing a one-sided POV driven and dubious interpretation of a guideline to be used to violate my userspace. That was indeed uncivil and very impolite. Bang! Done! No discussion or request. I am shocked and disheartened by these actions by someone I respected. That's all. Was what I said uncomfortable for you? Sure, but not incivil. You have chosen your agenda and it is not incivil to point out what it is. You do it to me all the time without me running to mommy and complaining about incivility. When you're getting your way, you are very tough and civil. Somehow you expect that you can tread on people and just get away with it by calling their comments """"incivil"""". You really do misuse that card by playing it too often. When you become perfect, then you can start pointing fingers. Keep in mind that you have the dubious honor of being considered one of the most classic and highly skilled cases of a disruptive civil POV pusher. As I recall, you may have even been the pioneer developer of the technique. Your civility covers an agenda that is counterproductive to NPOV by inevitably seeking to wikilawyer, stonewall, and censure anything negative about chiropractic, no matter how well sourced, when we're actually supposed to follow the sources. That's just wrong. Since this is Tim's user page, it's probably best that this discussion not continue here (or even continue at all, since we never get anywhere). I just wanted to set the record straight that I certainly wasn't comparing you to a dog. I actually do have much higher opinions of you. I admire intelligence. I just wish it wasn't being used for such a nefarious and and non-NPOV purpose as """"to protect chiropractic's reputation"""". In the real world that is good from your POV (chiro advocacy and protectionism), but here we follow the sources and let them speak.   14:12""",0

Just because a word is used in an opinion piece, blog, article, or letter to the editor does not mean it needs to be cited as an example.  All of the examples are there because of their political point of view.  They are completely subjective and inappropriate to the page.  All of them should be removed.  I'll go over a couple of them.

""""Character assassination is the Karl Rove tactic of choice, eagerly mimicked by his media surrogates, whenever the White House is confronted by a critic who challenges it on matters of war.

""""I’m glad the efforts to swiftboat Paul Hackett have been exposed for what they are.""""[12]

These are all blog entries which may or may not contain the word swiftboating.  They serve no purpose other than to push a political agenda.

Swiftboat ('swift bOt); transitive verb: (1) To accuse a public figure of questionable conduct without the benefit of physical evidence, usually by an entity informally associated with a person or entity benefiting from the accusation. Noun: (2) An unsubstantiated charge made against a public figure or organization, usually made by a proxy entity. See also: Smear, hatchet job, character assassination. (3) An organization dedicated to swiftboating on behalf of a respectable organization. (4) archaic: a type of boat used by the United States Navy to patrol the shores of Vietnam from 1965 to 1970; see also PCF. [14]

"Incorrect info

 Following the move, the college began to offer a number of Theology and Education
 degrees which were validated by the Council for National Academic Awards (the CNAA).
 When this was scrapped following the 1992 Education Act, the college entered an 
 academic partnership with the University of Oxford allowing Westminster students to 
 read for degrees of the University. 

NOTE: This is not correct. Degrees were those of the University of Oxford until, in what many people felt was a singularly ill-judged action, Westminster parted from the University of Oxford. After that, the degrees were validated by the CNAA until the union with Oxford Brookes. Further, academic subjects while linked with Oxford University were far wider than simply Theology and Education. 220.255.2.100",0

 Editing of Anthony Hungerford 

Dear Phillip,

               My comments regarding your editing of this site are not hostility, they are upset!
I have only ever place three entries onto Wikipadia, and am the first to acknowledge that I have not made myself fully aware to the protocols of the site. After some 30 years of researching my ancestry, my primary aim was to share the information garnered on those few individuals who have been somewhat prominent in history.

My upset comes from the fact that the editing was not sympathetic. You seem to have just wiped the article and started again. 
The upshot was that instead of leaving the information on the page [after all it has been there for some time-what is the rush to change it?] and asking for clarification, certain aspects just disappeared.

If I understand it correctly, it seems that Wikipedia prefers to quote as a source from the Calendars of State Papers – because a contributor to DNB or ODNB [a secondary source] has seen it, and delete my other quote from the Calendar of State Papers with source reference-because I have seen it personally in a printed book of the Calendars?

Likewise, as I mentioned to you in my email, it was obvious that the authors of both the old DNB and the ODNB did not actually know the origins of Colonel Hungerford-they both speculated. Whereas my later research had got nearer to the truth with my finding details given by Colonel Hungerford to the Ulster Herald, when he arrived in Ireland with his Regiment –which you confirmed with the full reference –

•TABDublin: National Library of Ireland, Genealogical Office: Ms.45, pp.59-60: """"Certificate of Arms to Col. Anthony Hungerford of Marson in Wiltshire and his pedigree. He arrived with his Regiment in D]ublin, April 30, 1647.""""
•TABDublin: National Library of Ireland, Genealogical Office: Ms.45, p.62 Certificate of Arms and cadency to Ensign St. John Hungerford, third brother of and ensign to Col. Anthony Hungerford, May 12, 1647.

I apologise if I have been too harsh in my comments to you, but you must understand that it was basic sourced information, which at the time was not on the internet, that I was seeking to share with Wikipedia readers, not style, rules and display.
I hope you have not finished with your editing. If you require any further clarifications please contact me.

"""::::::::::The problem is even the statement """"Jesus is fictional"""" has a large range going from the Jesus of the Gospels is a fiction to Jesus is an entire fiction.  Take Sherlock Holmes for example.  While Holmes is a fictional character he is based on a mixture of Dr Joseph Bell and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle two people who undoubtedly lived and there have been several books and TV programs over the years presenting one or the other as the """"real"""" Sherlock Holmes.  

Similarly, we know that even in Paul's there were """"other Gospels"""" (Galatians 1:6-9) and by the time Irenaeus wrote his Against Heresies (c180 CE) the number of Gospels had definitely increased.  The fact that Irenaeus stated that """"The thirty Æons are not typified by the fact that Christ was baptized in His thirtieth year: He did not suffer in the twelfth month after His baptism, but was more than fifty years old when He died."""" (Book II, Chapter 22) is one Joseph Wheless uses with nearly suppressed glee later on going as far as to say """"In the work often cited, Bishop Irenaeus either falsely quotes the Gospel of Mark, or the sacred text has been seriously altered in our present copies"""" regarding some other point.  While Wheless' ax grinding does get on the nerves and there are some really flaky interpretations and misreadings he does raise some good points.  If as the Pro Historical Jesus camp state that Jesus was born c4 BCE and died c36 CE (a space of only 39 years) then how could Irenaeus expressly state Jesus lived at least 11 years longer than this span and that view was """"as the Gospel and all the elders testify""""?

 Deleted speculation reference in the wings 

""""This raises concerns over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction."""" I'm waiting for V. to format the reference from this source: Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 91, pp. 7487-7490, August 1994 Population Biology Climate change and temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles (eticon/population demography/rate of evolutin/sex ratio/turtles)FREDRIC J. JANZEN* Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 Communicated by Gordon H. Orians, April 29, 1994 (received for review January 3, 1994) [].

I suggest the connection between the concern over global warming and extinction be returned to article based on this passage:

The causal influence of annual variation in climatic temperature on cohort sex ratios in this population of painted turtles serves as a clear empirical example of the biological impact portended by rapid global temperature change. This study demonstrates that the demography of populations of species with temperature-dependent sex determination may be directly sensitive even to modest deviations in the local thermal environment. These results are entirely consistent with earlier work on a nesting beach of endangered loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), wherein 87-99% of hatchlings from the rookery in each of 3 years were females because sand temperatures at nest level were high (39). If such strongly female-biased cohorts lead to highly skewed adult sex ratios, then the probability of population extinction may be greatly enhanced.

In this change, Mike Halterman says """"no need to go through redirects, the point of piped links is for them to go to the correct name"""".

Yes, I know, but as I cited above, the disambiguation guidelines appear to recommend having the DAB page link to the """"full"""" name rather than to directly to the real name.  Rome (disambiguation) links to Rome, Italy even though the real article is at Rome.

Now, maybe you're saying that as long as I needed a piped link to satisfy MoS:DAB#Piping exception #3
3.  Use piping to format or quote a portion of an article whose name consists of both a title and a clarifier; for instance Harvey (film), USS Adder (SS-3), or """"School"""" (song).
I might as well go directly to the """"right"""" page.

Note a later sentence in MoS:DAB:
This guidance to avoid piping means that a link to a redirect term will sometimes be preferred to a direct link, if the redirect term contains the disambiguation title and the redirect target does not.
That could be read two ways:  as a way to avoid piping, or as a preference for linking to the disambiguated name in preference to the ambiguous one.

I would also add that Schlesinger, as a historian of the United States, a country which has never seen viable communist or fascist movements, would seem a poor choice as a specialist to quote.  The point of Schlesinger is not to dispute that fascism is on the right wing of the classic political spectrum, but to suggest that the classic political spectrum itself is somewhat problematic due to these supposed similarities of communism and fascism.",0

it looks like not even your volunteers follow their own advice they say dont insult people and """"lanicoya"""" just because she doesnt like the fact that she wants the nicaragua article to be what in her opinion nicaragua is and what she wishes it was, there is no need to say that just because i have one person that agrees with me now i have multiple accounts how professional is she good job on letting her join a girl left a comment about her on the help desk that got deleted while i was reading it but it said she is known for making various accounts on sites like this one and yahoo answers were she insults people from el salvador and costa rica and i will say just because she does those kinds of things it doesnt mean every body else does i have my account this one and is the only one i need to get my point across so as a person that has volunteered on this site longer than her be kind enough to tell her to read the rules again as a volunteer she is in no position to be calling out people and im so amazed on how i have had my account on here longer than her and she is attacking me as they say people that are used to cheating in life and lying and making millions of accounts think its something that everybody does well """"lanicoya"""" just cus you do it it doesnt mean the rest of the world does it i have a life other than sitting on the internet all day making up people i want to be in websites but obviously you have the time to do that so speak for yourself """,0
I also like the idea of taking it to Arbcom. Regardless of how any debate turns out the issue will just be raised again. There's got to be some neutral solution we can adopt and neither side seems to be persuading the other.,0

Hmmmmm? Sounds like discrimination there? Will you be deleted? (and that's been offered before here) That's just my point, could I get a lawyer to sue you? No. But you could get one in vice versa. Liberals just want to use the system to steal and kill by unfair rules and lies. True criminals. If Wiki had not written liberal lies about me I would not have been here. It all is summed up as this: Give me a fair reason for """"liberalism"""". It has never been forwarded, so go home and stop the insanity.""",0
"Found this site quite by accident.  However, as a resident of Pleasant Hill,LA near where the battle took place, I found the piece very informative.  The backgound of strategic  planning and what happened to the major players after the battle was new information .  The community puts on a re-enactment of the Battle of Pleasant Hill every April.

 Deletions 

This edit by  again deleted discussion of Matthiessen's late 1930s hospitalization for a nervous breakdown and his grief following Cheney's death as possible contributing factors in his suicide.  (Since the motivations for his suicide are much debated, it seems necessary to include all the possibilities to me.)  This edit deleted """"Since he was already financially secure..."""" and the amount of Matthiessen's contribution to Sweezy's journal.  There's no point at all to this, as far as I can tell; all the deleted material is basically factual and is well-sourced (the first from the Levin article, and the second from the Monthly Review citation just above).  I find these deletions unmotivated and unhelpful, so I am restoring the material.  |Talk 15:08, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)""",0

A tag has been placed on Jerome leung kam, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   """,0
