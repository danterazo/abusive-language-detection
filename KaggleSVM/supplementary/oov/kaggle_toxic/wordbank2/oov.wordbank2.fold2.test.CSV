[with regards to Ottoman treaty around 1634]: shared joint suzerainty (a condominium) over Moldavia and Wallachia (Wołoszczyzna). 

Władysław was married twice. At the very beginning of 1634, or even at the end of 1633 Władysław asked pope Urban VIII for permission (or better to say promise of permission, since no name was included) to marry a Protestant princess. The pope refused, which Władysław treated as insult. At the beginning of 1634 Władysław sent Aleksander Przypkowski with a secret mission to king of England Charles I. Envoy had to discuss king's marriage plans and English help for reconstruction of Polish fleet. King's marriage plans were discussed on Senate meeting on 19 March 1635, but only four bishops were present and only one supported plan.

She may have left a posthumous cache of ghazals she wrote, and there may be recordings in her own voice of a few.  But she's certainly not a well-known or well-regarded ghazal singer.

"""irrelevant; only what the world calls her matters. So I checked Google News: 2,753 hits for """"Ashlee Simpson"""", 489 for """"Ashlee Simpson-Wentz"""". I feel this demonstrates that """"Ashlee Simpson"""" is still the correct title. Does anyone oppose moving it back?   

I was going to say the same thing. Her legal name is irrelevant, this article should be at the most commonly used name that most people know her by, which is obviously Ashlee Simpson. 92.1.2.237  
Yes, and even her official website still calls her """"Ashlee Simpson"""".   

I will move the page back to """"Ashlee Simpson"""" in 24 hours unless there is an objection, or unless Google News indicates a significant trend toward general adoption of the """"Simpson-Wentz"""" name.   

I searched Ashlee Simpson as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz and pages are starting to refer to her as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz. Let's keep the article as-is.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.151.137.19   

Yeah, I've searched her as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz in Google News, and they've started referring to her as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz. The article is fine the way that it is.   

You can see the numbers I posted a few days ago above. The current numbers are 3,358 for """"Ashlee Simpson"""" and 559 for """"Ashlee Simpson-Wentz"""". I don't see a trend towards the latter. Most of the newest articles refer to her as """"Ashlee Simpson"""".   

Considering that she got married a couple weeks ago, I think that 559 results as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz is a good number of articles. It will probably increase as more articles are written.   
If that were the case, we'd see a trend, but what I see is that there was a spike in the use of the new name after it was announced, but that subsequently most sources continued to use the old name. The results indicate to me that the new name hasn't caught on.   

Read this: 
she's taking Pete's surname and is going by Simpson-Wentz professionally. I think this settles this dicussion. 24.151.137.19  
The point is that it doesn't matter what she calls herself. Wikipedia articles are titled according to the common name of the subject.   

Exactly. Ashlee is changing her common name. 24.151.137.19  
She can't change her common name. Her common name is decided according to what people want to call her. If they now start calling her Ashlee Simpson-Wentz, then that's her new common name, but if they keep calling her Ashlee Simpson, then that remains her common name. That's why I've been comparing Google News results, to see whether this new name is really catching on. Also, as I pointed out, her website still uses her old name, but maybe they're just lazy. Since there are two of you in favor of keeping it at this title, I propose that we wait one week, then look at the results again and see if there's more of a shift towards Simpson-Wentz.   

I just noticed that Danny has been going around changing the articles on her albums so that they are described as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz albums. Considering we don't even have a consensus on what she should be called now, I don't think it's appropriate to try to extend the Simpson-Wentz name to album articles which were released under the Ashlee Simpson name before she married Pete.   

I've searched Google News for Ashlee Simpson, which had 3,162 results, and Ashlee Simpson-Wentz, which had 1,613 results. So clearly, the results for Ashlee Simpson are dropping while results for Ashlee Simpson-Wentz are increasing. But, as Everyking said, he",0

FYI, """"Snugger"""" is a trademark; it's Emerson's name for their hugger-style fan. Personally, I disagree that a separate section needs to be added. Hugger fans are no different from any other ceiling fan in any way, except for the fact that they don't have a downrodsomething which is entirely unrelated to the fan's operation. The motor, blades, etc. is no different. Refer to the section """"Bases for Comparison"""", subsection """"Height of the fan relative to the ceiling"""", for more info on huggers if you're interested. That section details their sole disadvantage; it is appropriate for it to be in that section since it is not a problem unique to huggers (though all huggers have it). The sole advantage of a hugger is that it saves spacesomething which is such blatantly obvious common sense that it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia article (any more than the statement """"water is wet"""" belongs in the article on water). Basically my point is that huggers are no different from ordinary fans, and so don't deserve their own section any more than each decor-themed fan at Home Depot deserves its own section.""",0

 POV/inaccurate paragraph 

The Vlachs did not pass the same process of forcible Romanization of alphabet or vocabulary as the Romanians in Romania

Forcible? Nobody forced anyone to change the words one uses. There were French borrowings, but this was done also by Bulgarians and Russians, for example. There was an idea in 19th century to eliminate Slavic words from Romanian and it was labeled as absurd.

and they usually say that they are descendants of Romanized Moesians, compared to the Romanized Gheto-Dacians in Romania. The fact is that both Moesians and Gheto-Dacians were the Thracian tribes, so the substrate was not so different. 

Yes, most linguists think that Moesians and Geto-Dacians spoke the same language, labeled by some """"Daco-Moesian"""", but that's off-topic here. Linking modern people to ancient peoples is nonsense. It's absurd to say that some are descendants from """"Geto-Dacians"""" and others from the """"Moesians"""".

Anyway, the Romanians of Wallachia and Vlachs of Serbia speak the same language! I mean even the same dialect! The southern """"Wallachian"""" dialect is what became standard Romanian language. 

Some Vlachs usually emphasize that the difference between them and Romanians """"are the same as the difference between the Serbs and Bulgarians"""".

So, Serbian language is identical to Bulgarian ? I learnt something new today, then. -)  """,0

"You can't have a citation that something does not exist unless that citation contains proof that the construction is impossible.  That the citation author is unaware of the existence of something is not proof that it does not exist.  I am unaware of the existence of cylindrical celled zinc-carbon batteries, but I would never make the claim that they don't exist

In this case, the author of your reference is wrong.  The centre battery in the illustration to the right is of a flat celled alkaline battery.  Zinc-carbon (and indeed zinc-chloride) batteries are made using layer cells wrapped in a wax type coating, or even these days heat shrink plastic, for that is all that is required.  Alkaline cells generate gas during discharge, which is absorbed by the chemistry, though there is a delay.  As a result, some pressure does build up which requires a more substantial container.  In virtually all alkaline constructions, that container is made from steel.  Even a quick look at the centre battery shows rectangular cells made with steel containers.  No manufacturer of zinc-carbon batteries is going to go to that unnecessary expense. 

I have therefore reverted your edit.  If you wish to continue to insist that there are no rectangular celled alkaline batteries, then please provide a citation that the construction is impossible. 212.183.140.5  

Leclanché cells

To describe dry celled zinc-carbon as 'Leclanché' is completely incorrect.  Georges Leclanché did not invent, build, or even conceive of a dry version of his famous cell.  Indeed, the chemistry isn't even the same.  The electrolyte in the Leclanché cell is ammonium chloride.  The (paste) electrolyte in the dry zinc-carbon battery is a 50:50 mix of ammonium chloride and zinc chloride.  The difference gives the dry battery an e.m.f. of a little over 1.5 volts versus the Leclanché 1.4 volts.  Later, so called, high power versions of the cell dispensed with the ammonium chloride completely and just used zinc chloride.

In any case, the most common name for this type of cell is the zinc-carbon and that should therefore be what it is refered to in the article.  Few people (if anyone at all) call it anything other than a zinc-carbon.  I also cannot find any manufacturer who describes it as 'Leclanché'.  I have therefore reverted this as well. 212.183.140.5",0

 Good policy suggestion on class assignments. 

My sympathies about your encountering a class assignment that has gone badly awry. I think your  looks like a good idea, and I support it. It's especially regrettable that we are not receiving more well sourced, thoughtful edits to psychology articles here, as most of those articles badly need better sourcing and more coherent editing to represent current established knowledge from a neutral point of view. Keep up the good work.   (talk, ) 

 An appology is in order 

Dear Colin,

I am not sure if you will have the chance to read this, or if you'll have a moment to respond, but I am a student in the University of Toronto and specifically one of the 1700 psychology students mentioned in the article.  However before I go any further, may I express my most sincere and deepest appologies to you and everyone involved. I will not try to make excuses for my actions, nor will I try to do so for my fellow students as I do not speek for them. I realise (and no doubt others will too) that what we left behind was unbecoming of a sutdent at U of T.  And most importantly, I realise that we did as future scholars was wrong.

I know that you and you colleagues are considering taking extreme measures to ensure the content of Wikipedia stays secure as a responce to our actions. Though I can understand where you are coming from, I do not believe that this will solve any of your problems and will only make things worse in the long-run.  I see this situation as a systemic error on both of our sides, but as a first year student I have very little educational and social clout to enforce my statement. I am asking as both an avid reader of Wikipedia and as a lover of knowledge, please do not black-out our privaleges to use and edit articles.  Let us both use this experience as a steping stone to learn how to go about doing this in a constructive manner benefits Wikipedia and my school. 
 
Looking to make this a better place,

CivCodex 
  
Thanks. We have no issues with people who are interested in Wikipedia coming to edit Wikipedia. What seems to be the issue is when we have a large group of students editing Wikipedia not for the love of knowledge but simply for marks. These students do not stay around and seem to plagiarize at a high rate.   (talk · contribs · email) (if I write on your page reply on mine)

 Proposed new policy  

I'd like to advertise this (very draft) proposed new policy: . 

Comments please. °Talk 
 I think the central dillema is this: a student could make a poor-quality contribution that harms Wikipedia but then recieve partial or full credit. If the grading rubric was accurate, a student would receive 0 or negative credit. My personal solution has been to engage with professors to try and influence the assignment, increase their Wikipedia knowedge, and improve the grading rubrics themselves. I'm fairly proud of Education Program:Saint Louis University/Signal Transduction (SP13), which I helped write. You might want to ask   

 There should also be some sort of policy re: how the community reacts to profs and students.  The active community is more likely to be aware of and act on policies, in the first place; and we are often more unkind than necessary, in the second.  
 I proposed an alternative idea on the assignments talk page - as an example of the sort of implementation that I would hope is compatible with any policy we adopt.  –  +

"Relaunch 86

This was to judge by appearances. As theoretical physicist Robert Grumbold puts it, “It took two decades of IT to reveal what the Cantab editors were really up to, but it’s now clear that their achievement was staggering. Basically if each letter of a Cantab article is plotted as a point in an n-dimensional space, then you find that the piece on the piece on Benjamin Zephaniah, written in early 1988, actually traces out an encrypted set of instructions for twisting vortical gravity fields to produce a singularity in ψ-space. And the City Issue of Summer 1988 is decades, if not centuries ahead of its time. The uninitiated were evidently deceived into seeing nothing more than a shameless piece of careerist self-aggrandizement in the hallowed Cantab tradition. “In fact”, says Grumbold “this is no less than a prototype of a 13-dimensional machine which time-locks a 9-dimensional black hole. We can see the equations but just don’t have enough neurons to even begin to figure out what they really mean”. But where was the portal and why did it have to be closed? Was it in the paste-up room cupboard? Had interdimensional creatures from another universe been progressively using it to control the minds of the film reviewers in 1985/86? Is it true that at 1.41 am on 23 May, 1988, a packet of chocolate Hobnobs on the layout desk suddenly shot across the room and disappeared into the wall? Why did so many people go into the nearby round church and so few come out? And why did so few people go into the nearby Indian restaurant and so many come out? Who or what was the Chief Editor, who subsequently disappeared in South America? Did (he) come from an extraterrestrial civilisation so advanced that trade journalism is unknown there? And why does supernatural sleuth Mike Dash repeatedly censor any attempt to tell what really went on so long ago, years after he’d left Cambridge? What is his dark secret? Had he already experienced something that has tormented him ever since and prevents him from getting a life even today? This is evidently one mystery too many, even for him….

(I hope this is the right way to reply)
Good question. No, of course, it does bump up the principal. How about this thought experiment: for continual compounding, what if the payment is not made continuously? I only mean this rhetorically. The fact is, the payment period and the compounding period do not need to coincide at all; the compounding period is a convention. I hope I express this properly, and I do not do this on a day to day basis, but my understanding is:
 The compounding per se is on a six month basis, but can be calculated at any time.
 So, if you are late three days (and no grace period, etc), the amount payable is added to principal for this period of time. If you ask the bank (and their systems are up to date), you can determine new principal, which is old principal plus payment amount plus accumulated interest to that day.
 If you pay on the third day, you will have interest payable on the original principal plus the delayed payment for three days at the six-month compound rate (expressed as a fraction of days / six months).
 In fact, this is basically identical to interest on a given sum for x% annual interest for y days. You would pay interest of principal times x% times y/365. It just doesn't get compounded for the interim days (for example, on a daily basis).
 Why six months, etc? I have no idea. That was the convention a long time ago and it has stuck, and I think at one point """"they"""" chose to require banks etc to all quote and calculate on the same basis, rather like an APR.
 The point being any rate/compounding period can be chosen, the calculations are just extra work often dictated by convention/regulation. Hope this is clear. """,0

I don't know how large your local paper is; my experience with larger papers is that they verify the author to at least a basic degree (believe me, the items I was writing about are not nearly as contentious as the matter at hand here, nor am I in a position akin to the rector's.) And in a situation like this, there would certainly be a correction if the rector claimed the letter wasn't his, and no such correction appears. As such, that the rector made the statement seems to me quite adequately sourced, even if the claims he makes are not. However, if you would like to slightly reword it to make it even clearer that the rector is making claims that are not otherwise in evidence (replacing stated with claimed or asserted), I would not have an objection.
I think the claim, even if treated as true, is not much of a claim; the count of accused priests has an invisible """"yet"""" hanging over it, as more recent graduates would have had less time to have accusers come forward than those from previous classes. And I think the reference is good to have in there for something it -doesn't- include; the letter is essentially a """"yes, but"""" note rather than a """"no"""" note, as it doesn't deny anything in the Times article and thus to some degree blunts any objection that it's just the Times reporters say-so.

 How they do it. Revealing how vandals prevent accurate information on Poppers, that they disagree with, from being posted here! 

I just figured out what's going on  what these guys are doing to those of us who want to edit the poppers page by adding more accurate and meaningful information, but which they do not agree with. If you can find the time, I urge you to go into the """"history"""" of the poppers section or page (click on the """"history"""" tab at the top of the page), and then go to the bottom of that page. There you can click on the largest number, and essentially see ALL the history of this page  from the day it was created!

I just spent time looking at it, and a clear pattern emerges. To be kind, there are some pranksters among us. More realistically, and at worse, they are vandals. Some of them appear to be working in concert with each other to make arbritary changes to the edits of people they don't agree with. They literally  and very quickly  'revert' the versions back and forth among their own versions, all the while essentially vandalizing the credible information that more knowledgeable people have posted. Then, when the unsuspecting editors realize something's going on, that their edits are being deleted almost within minutes of their having posted them, and when they try to figure out how best to react and deal with the problem, as they begin the inevitable complaining and asking of questions, they are harrassed and threaten with having their accounts 'blocked'; or they're falsely accused of violating various rules of Wikipedia, upon which they are often then threatened with even more sanctions against them.

It is precisely this kind of unethical, irresponsible and despicable behavior that was exposed in the world wide media earlier this week. Had I not seen the news reports which described exactly this kind of activity being rampant on Wikipedia, I would most likely have never figured out what was going on.

 Surgeon's working week 

""""A surgical resident's average work week is approximately 75 hours. Some subspecialties of surgery, such as neurosurgery, require even longer hours, and utilize an extension to the 80 hour regulated work week, allowing up to 88 hours per week. Many surgical programs still exceed this work hour limit. Attempts to limit the amount of hours worked has been difficult because of the large volume of patients who require surgical care, the limited amount of resources (including a shortage of people willing to enter into surgery as a career),Dorsey, et al., """"Influence of Controllable Lifestyle on Recent Trends in Specialty Choice by US Medical Students the need to perform long operations and still provide care to all pre- and post-operative patients, and the need to provide constant coverage in the OR, ICU, and ER.""""

I removed this.  It doesn't seem to belong in an article on medicine, maybe it belongs in Surgery or something even more specific like Surgeons in the USA.  It's about as relevant as a paragraph in the article on Sport explaining the types of injuries basketball players typically suffer from.  Actually I'd like to remove more waffle from this section, but I left it alone for now.  There is SOME relevance in explaining that it takes time, effort and talent to become a surgeon.   """,0

Unfortunately, I don't know the literature on this field that well, just the general background. -) So I know how most of the techniques work, who some of the experts are on a couple of the topics, and I can point out if a particular source doesn't seem to understand the science. But I would say that it's too broad a topic (and not enough is known) for it to be covered in the scientific literature as a single unit. 

That said, these reviews might be useful - please let me know if I can explain anything for you. I've just added them to a couple of articles, so you may come across them in Wikipedia as well. -) I can also recommend more sources on any specific topics of interest. 

Gene therapy is the field that's furthest along. Related articles of interest include vectors in gene therapy (aka delivery methods) and genome editing. There are also techniques such as SCNT (where the entire nucleus is replaced - this is how Dolly was cloned), but I hesitate to consider those genetic engineering. 
Another field that comes to mind is regenerative medicine, although that article isn't nearly comprehensive. This (and the related field of tissue engineering) mainly focus on applications such as the growth of organs for transplant, starting from stem cells. However, it doesn't currently use much genetic engineering; the closest it gets is genetic reprogramming (I was extremely surprised to find that article didn't exist; I've just created it.)
As far as I'm aware, the use of genetic engineering to give humans new traits (as opposed to prevention or cures) is mostly speculative, although the techniques should apply in the same way. Synthetic biology is the closest (in that it attempts to devise new traits), but it's still just beginning and is extremely far from any application in humans. I imagine that most of the descriptions of technology will be like this (not yet applicable to humans but could be in the future), other than that which applies to human cells in culture.
The scope of the article is uncertain to me. Most of the sources that use """"human genetic engineering"""" as a viable description discuss ethics rather than science. (Of course, the ethics is important as well, but my familiarity is with the science.) There is a lot of scientific detail that can be discussed, but as I mentioned above, the science itself doesn't usually use such a broad categorization. 
The science is moving quickly. An article written in 2012 may have a significantly different background context from one written in 2011. 
Modification is easiest at the zygote or blastocyst stage. There is a bit of information on how this is done at transgenic mouse. (It's not done in humans, of course.)
There are a lot of people who use language such as """"the next stage in human evolution."""" (This is something I removed from the article.) I think I also saw it in a couple of respectable sources when I was editing this page, but it's at the least imprecise/poor wording and (at least in my opinion) should be attributed if included. It is valid under a broader definition where """"evolution"""" simply means """"change over time,"""" but it implies some mechanism of progress or goal-directedness (""""stages"""") - so it is somewhat misleading when applied to biological evolution, which doesn't have these properties. 

I won't be available much for at least the next few days, but please let me know if you have any questions. -) If it's more than a week, please feel free to remind me on my talk page (since the message will drop off my watchlist).   """,0

As somewhat of an aside perhaps, don't get me wrong...I fully support the axiom that an immigrant to a Jewish community should become a part of that community, adopting its minhagim as his own.  This is the ruling according to Beth Yosef.  So, when Ashkenazim have settled there, they should have become an integral part of the Bukharan community, as Bukharans.  (The real """"aside"""" is the egregious nature of the establishment of the Rishon LeTziyon """"Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi"""" ba'aretz, in contravention of halakha.)  The reason I ask is because there seems to be a concentration on these individuals with apparently Russified names, if not originally Ashkenazim themselves, and the """"native Bukharans"""" apparently warrant no mention.  Did the Russian Jews that seriously dominate the locals, economically, or did the Bukharans Russify their surnames in order to ingratiate themselves to their Russian domineers?

"""::I believe there was a lengthy study done by the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation & Enforcement Pittsburgh office and the State of Pennsylvania in the early 1980s which determined (1) extinguishing the fires was probably not technically feasible, and (2) it would cost more to try and extinguish the fires than it would to purchase all properties in the town. Hence, Congressional relocation funding. So, the bottom line was money, and questionnable technical feasibility. The study is probably cited in the hearings for the funding legislation.
Keep in mind there are hundreds of miles of old underground mines under Centralia, too deep to strip mine from the surface, too many surface openings to plug, and the smoke and steam are lethal to humans and other living things. That's why people needed to be relocated: living in Centralia is hazardous to one's health. And when coal is burned, it loses 90% of its mass, so the ground above often subsides, opening new pathways for air to enter and fuel the fires. There have long been reports of more people living there than should be, possibly including some who were paid to leave.

"Suggestion to add to first paragraph re: Finger's role vs. Kane's 

I'm the author of the only bio of Finger and I can't quote myself, but hope someone would be willing to add this quotation from Jerry Robinson to the first paragraph:

Jerry Robinson said, “[Bill] had more to do with the molding of Batman than Bob. He just did so many things at the beginning,…creating almost all the other characters,…the whole persona, the whole temper.”

It is from page 43 of BILL THE BOY WONDER (already cited in article). I feel it is the most compelling and authoritative statement explaining how significant Bill's role was, and Jerry is certainly in a position to make such a statement as he was one of the ghost artists who began on the strip during its debut year. He worked closely with both men before National hired him and Finger away from Kane. There is considerable misconception about how involved Kane was in the creative aspects of the strip. He was not an idea man and in fact did not write a single Batman story in his lifetime.

Second, the source has no """"official value"""" and does not address any nickname issue. The whole Québec is a nation and Québec City is its capital debate, I believe, should be left out of this article. It's a can of worms that'll only bring confusion and edit wars. Québec City is in the administrative region (division) called Capitale-Nationale. That's all we can say that is relevant.  """,0

As to The Church of Jesus Christ, they are big enough, I think, with about 15,000 members, to merit an article in their own right. I think there's verifiable material on the group's current practices and doctrines, although I'm not familiar enough with it. As to the much smaller groups like the Cutlerites and the Strangites, I think their notability comes from their history. There used to be a lot more members, and they had significant interactions with early Mormons. For the FLDS Church, there's not much verifiable information about their current practices, but they are in the news so much that they should definitely have an article. Basically, though, I see no problem with allowing an article for any distinct religious denomination. There may not be much verifiable information, but as long as they are either in the news, or have some historical significance, or have published things, that seems notable enough for me. As to particular church buildings or single congregations of a denomination, that's probably where I'd draw the line, unless that particular church building or congregation has some special significance.

It is quite obvious to me, and all the memembers of the SGAS, that your dissatisfaction with the page citations is not an indication of the article's """"dubiousness"""", but rather an indication of your ignorance of Goosebumps and literature in general.

For instance, If i were to write that the sky is blue, of that the earth is round, or that MACman202 has no idea what he is talking about, most reasonably intelligent humans would agree with such widely known facts. Such is the same for Goosebumps and R.L. Stine. When I say that the plots """"are masterfully formulated"""" or imply that R.L. Stine is brilliant, the majority of people recognize that the two statements are widely known facts. 
As for you MACman202, any notion what so ever that you have the ability to recognize fine literature """"has to be one of the most laughable things I have ever heard"""" (NatureBoy, I included quotations in the last quote so that you, always one to want a citation for the obvious, will know that I quote this MACman202 himself). MacMan, it is quite bold of you to assume that there is so scholar behind my article. Perhaps you should stick to editing the Simon and Garfunkel page on wikipedia. I am sure you are quite familiar with it already.
Tony Fox, you and NatureBoyMD seem to be on the  same page as far as your inability to recognize common knowledge is concerned. To me it seems that you label anything you do not agree with as a """"peacock term."""" I find this most repulsive, as I, like most free thinking, intelligent people believe that speech should not be censored because someone does not agree with it. You can take comfort in the fact that you are not the only one guilty of this unjust censorhip. MACman202 and NatureBoy are just as guilty. Each of you should devote, as I have, your mind to understanding the beauty and brilliance of Goosebumps. When you feel that you have researched Goosebumps as much as I have (it is very unlikely that you ever will) then you may suggest alterations to my scholarly review.

Not precisely. You can say Persian Empire crumbled after battle of Gaugamela when Mesopotamia was taken, or after Bessus killed Codomannus, but battle at Persian Gates is completely irrelevant in context of Achaemenid fall.

It's nonsense to say """"Alexander did conquered Persia, but Persians didn't conquered Greece"""" - fact is, Persia fought wars only against Athens and Sparta (and their minor allies), and they razed Athens during Xerxes' invasion.

 mgts 

Next generation wireless networks are evolving into """"all-IP"""" architectures, and SS7 over Internet Protocol (IP) is becoming more prevalent as intelligent gateways become the de facto technology used to interconnect wireline and wireless networks. The MGTS™ is the leading product for testing wireline and wireless network convergence. It is a multi-user, multi-protocol programmable test system that emulates any SS7/PSTN entity or SS7 application database, and measures the functionality and performance of signaling and media gateways. The MGTS uses powerful underlying platforms, a diverse line of network interface cards, and an extensive library of protocol test modules to significantly reduce product development time, lower production costs, and ensure conformance to telecom industry standards.

MGTS reduces product development time by allowing multiple users to perform their tests concurrently. Early in the product lifecycle, the MGTS can emulate prohibitively expensive or difficult to locate network equipment. Farther along, the MGTS can support load testing to measure how much traffic the equipment can handle. MGTS also supports traffic flow monitoring between nodes in live networks. The MGTS is a flexible platform that can be customized to provide the test scripts, software protocols, and hardware needed to solve each new challenge.

Testers can create complex, multi-protocol test sequences using the Protocol Adaptable State Machine (PASM™). PASM is a complete development system that constructs common test cases by defining protocol message formats, sequencing, and operations. PASM can create any type of protocol message for use in test case sequences against a device under test (DUT). With PASM, users can easily and simultaneously test circuit and packet switches over multiple interfaces. The created test cases can be executed in either simulation or load mode for functional and system integration testing. PASM helps significantly reduce the time needed to develop comprehensive 3G, VoIP and SS7 load tests.

The MGTS supports a wide variety of applications:

    * Design and feature verification: Does the device being tested provide the desired features and functionality?
    * Conformance Testing: Does the device conform to industry standards?
    * Interoperability Testing: Will the device work with other equipment in the network?
    * Load and Stress Testing: How will the device perform under load and overload conditions?
    * Installation and Acceptance Testing: Is the device ready for installati""",0

""":It is neither more historically correct, nor more professional. Scholars routinely use the term """"Nazi"""". You cite the Encyclopedia Britannia as evidence of your claim. But, in fact, the Encyclopedia Britanica uses Nazi an order of magnitude more often than National Socialism.

And in the title of the entry for """"National Socialism"""", they write """"also called Nazism or Naziism"""". 

Your claim that use of the term """"Nazi"""" is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routinely use the term. The claim that """"National Socialism"""" is a """"more full and correct designation"""" is inconsistent with the fact that the two phrases are synonymous. And while it is true that """"Nazi"""" can be used as an epithet, so can """"dog"""". Do you also recommend that Wikipedia refrain from using the word """"dog"""" to describe dogs? 

It is interesting that you use Linder as support for your argument. The particular passage that you link to is an explanation by Linder as to why he will use the term """"Nazi"""" rather than """"National Socialist"""" throughout his book. I fail to see why this is evidence that Wikipedia should do the opposite.

I am curious about your statement that use of the term Nazi arises from a deeper intent by political opponents to give a skewed view of their politics. What part of Nazi politics do you feel has been skewed by their political opponents?

I did find it surprising that nowhere is due process mentioned in Arbcom's procedures. There is a fourth problem that hasn't previously been mentioned which is the lack of any practicable route of appeal for Arbcom's decisions. Yes, in theory Jimbo is the final """"court of appeal"""" but that is not a route which anyone takes seriously, as far as I can tell. In practical terms the only recourse is to appeal to Arbcom itself, but how likely is it that Arbcom will admit that it's got something wrong? If Arbcom's conduct during a case has thrown due process out of the window, what is the likelihood that it will find itself at fault? Human pride and institutional defensiveness, if nothing else, will count against it. Right now, if Arbcom commits an abuse of process there is no way of correcting it other than voting out the offending arbitrators, which could take years depending in which tranche of elections they're due to come up for a vote. There is no process for anyone other than Arbcom to review cases, nor for egregious mishandling of a case to be tackled. In effect we have a single """"accountability moment"""" once a year and there is no accountability, no recourse and no effective oversight of how they have conducted themselves. What is needed, I think, is a much stricter set of rules governing what Arbcom does, combined with an independent appeals procedure that is empowered to review Arbcom's own conduct and set aside remedies if they have been passed without due process being followed.   16:11""",0

les plus grands d’Europe. Avec une stature moyenne de 185,6 cm, ils se situent devant les Néerlandais, qui mesurent 184 cm.
C’est surtout la densité de sujets de très grande taille qui confère à la région des Alpes Dinariques sa caractéristique, avec 28%
de sujets de plus de 190 cm, alors que les Néerlandais n’en comptent que 20% et la France 1,5%. Chez les filles, bien que l’on
ne dispose pas de beaucoup d’informations, les adolescentes dinariques, avec une stature moyenne de 171 cm, se situent juste
derrière les Néerlandaises. Pour citer cet article  J.-C. Pineau et al., C. R. Biologies 328 (2005).

Abstract
Average height of adolescents in the Dinaric Alps. This study contributes to an update of average heights among European
populations. Our investigation covering 2705 boys and 2842 girls aged 17 years, shows that, contrary to the general belief,
adolescents of the Dinaric Alps are, on average, the tallest in Europe. With an average height of 185,6 cm, they are taller than
Dutch adolescents (184 cm on average). Above all, the density of very tall subjects appears to be characteristic of the Dinaric
Alps, since 28% measure 190 cm or more in height, as opposed to only 20% in Holland and 1.5% in France. Although our
information is not complete, adolescent girls in the Dinaric Alps, with an average height of 171 cm come a close second to girls
in Holland. To cite this article: J.-C. Pineau et al., C. R. Biologies 328 (2005).

Abridged English version
The diachronic increase in the stature of European
peoples has always been of interest to anthropologists.
Since the 1960s and until now, Scandinavians of both
sexes had been the tallest Europeans, followed, in descending
order, by the Dutch, Danes, Norwegians and
Swedes.
With the recent enlargement of the European Community,
it has become necessary to establish which
European country has the tallest adolescents on average.
In 1968, Montenegrin teenagers, with an average
height of 176.9 cm, had already been found to be the
tallest, followed by Norwegians at 173.6 cm. Since
then, there has been a significant increase in average
heights in all European countries, especially Holland,
where the average height among adolescents increased
the fastest (8 cm in 40 years), to reach 184 cm in
2000. However, given the lack of recent data on average
heights among inhabitants of the Dinaric Alps, we
carried out a study to update the information available.
The study was conducted among 17 year-olds (2705
boys and 2844 girls) in schools in various towns in
Herzegovina and central Dalmatia. Boys, unlike girls,
are still growing in height at 17 years of age. Different
longitudinal studies have shown that boys, on
average, grow by at least one centimetre between the
ages of 17 and 20. We have therefore added one centimetre
to all average heights for boys. As in other
European countries, height is influenced by the social
environment: in our study, lycée pupils were found to
be 2–3 cm taller on average than pupils in vocational
schools. Taking these variations into account as well
as observed differences between coastal and inland
communities, we found that",0

"""Crown corporations ==
VIA Rail is a not a true Crown Corporation in that it cannot raise funds on the money market, rather it is subject to the whims of the government of the day for its ongoing funding. This is a major reason for the failure of VIA to improve its lot.

True enough regarding how political control limits the company's """"viability"""" (pun intended!), however the definition of a Crown corporation throughout Canada's history has been fairly broad.  In the sense that any publicly owned (ie. government) company in Canada is a Crown corporation, then VIA Rail would meet that criteria.  For many years prior to its recapitalization in the late 1970's and the Canadian railway industry's deregulation in the 1980's, CN was not allowed to raise funds either.  Provincial Crown corporations like B.C. Rail and B.C. Ferries or N.B. Power were similarly limited at certain points in their existence.  I could be wrong, as I have not read the VIA Rail Act in-depth but is there a specific provision which limits the company from seeking funds on the """"money market"""" in the way you describe?  I would also argue that there is likely no public transport company in the world which is financially successful in the limited way in which economists in the 20th/21st century measure this.  Since there is no accounting taken for the numbers of vehicles taken off a nation's highways each day, or having to construct new roads to isolated communities served by VIA/Amtrak/etc., or the environmental benefits realized, etc. etc. etc. then VIA Rail, Amtrak, Eurorail, various ferries, etc. will never be financially solvent.  Cheers,  22:00, 31 Jul 2004 (UTC)

The following section was added by User: Andrew Dunning and I have commented it out pending input from others due to several errors:

Officially, the move from the CP to CN line was to keep service to more remote communities on the CN line. However, this move was seen as somewhat more politically-motivated by some. Coincidentally, the CN route goes through more towns that voted Progressive Conservative. Harvey André, the Cabinet minister who represented Calgary in 1990, was fairly public about the fact that he did not care if he never saw a train again in his life. The CN line also went through Edmonton, the home of both Mulroney and Joe Clark.

No doubt politics played a heavy role in this 2nd round of VIA cuts, however I'm unsure as to what the actual political representation played throughout the Super Continental's route (historically, the Super was a CN transcontinental train, and The Canadian was a CP transcontinental train).  In the 1990 cuts when VIA was reduced to a single transcontinental, they decided to keep the more-recognized Canadian brand, and use it on the CN line... why the CN line is the question, however some have suggested CN being a crown corp at the time, gave VIA a better deal on trackage fees, insurance costs, etc. etc.  Politics could also have played a role, or perhaps the thinking was that VIA should be supporting the feds to provide service to the more remote northern prairie communities since the Trans-Canada Highway follows the southerly CP route and was already well-served by inter-city busses.  The main reason I've commented out the above addition was the last line concerning Clark & Mulroney's ridings - Clark represented High River near Calgary, Alberta in the 1980s and Mulroney represented Manicouagan near Baie Comeau, Quebec.  Harvey André...  I have no idea - very likely though.  Once this part gets edited/verified properly, it should appropriately be added to the story surrounding the 2nd round of cuts in 1990. 16:57, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Joe Clark was born and raised in High River, but he represented Yellowhead, a large riding between Edmonton and Jasper, from 1979 to 1993. Mulroney never lived in Alberta, nor was he ever an Alberta MP. 17:30, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Yeah, this is definitely a mess.  Before I put some time in cleaning it up, would anyone like to weigh in as to whether they'd like to see this sort of information in this article?  For Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway we've resisted having the roster in the article, but VIA Rail might be different because (a) its locomotive count is in the dozens, not the thousands and (b) it's a bit easier to compile a complete roster since VIA's under 30 years old.

""":::::::::::::No, sorry, you are still very wrong. Impartialness is a factor of WP:NPOV, and we have to be able to distinguish between opinion and fact. Again, there remain very few facts that we can associate with GG overall short of what's in the current History section - it is a war of opinions here, that's why its a controversy.  Further FRINGE states we give fringe views a neutral, fair treatment with the associated weight of ink they get from RS. So because ethics claims have been discussed, if not then debunked by the authors in the next breath, in these highly reliable sources, we can discuss them in a non-prejudging way and then later include the criticism of them; that's how we meet all content policies. End of the day we cannot appear to take a side in the GG issue, and everything you have said above is against that point. And that I'm """"trying to use an avalanche of incredibly negative stories"""" to say its about ethics is 100% wrong. I'm trying to introduce the required impartiality into the article per NPOV. I don't necessarily believe at the end of the day GG is about ethics, but they have presented that as their case, and as we are an impartial encyclopedia, we should include any facets of their case that have been appropriately documented in highly reliable sources. Failure to do so is showing a partial view of the story. The fact that these claims are made in negatively-charged stories doesn't matter, they are stated in what everyone here is considering as highly reliable sources; most of what we know about Westboro Baptist Church, for example, comes from highly-negative sources about the congretation, but we still can document what the church claims about itself from them. That's exactly what we must do here.  (t)

Hi Math. Thanks for the page with the pictures of her art. I find it very interesting. Her pictures of women's bodies as commodities are very disturbing, while her photos of Morrissey are beautiful. I really want to get my hands on the Morrissey Shot book, but I couldn't order it from amazon, apparently they can't ship it to my country.

Anyway, I know what you're talking about, information on Linder and Ludus is very hard to find. Besides the Ludus biography you quoted, I've come across a couple of articles about an exhibition she did in 2000: The Guardian article http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,,138286,00.html
and here is a long and in-depth article:
http://www.3ammagazine.com/litarchives/nov2001/manchester_voodoo.html

Her real name is Linda Mulvey. The Guardian article gives info on her date and place of birth (1954, Liverpool) and a bit on her background.

I have some pictures from Ludus sleeves that I might include in the article.

Besides The Importance of Being Morrissey, Linder also appeared in Southbank Show on The Smiths. 

What other magazine articles have you found about her? She's usually mentioned in connection with Morrissey, and even that is very rarely. The only magazine article I can think of is that (in)famous Nick Kent """"The Face"""" 1985 article on The Smiths. There are also a few pages about her in """"The Severed Alliance"""", but it's similar stuff as in that Ludus biography you posted the link to, plus some interesting quotes by Richard Boon and Trotter. Apparently her flat in Whalley Range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists. They also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle, that Pete Shelley wrote Buzzcocks' 'What Do I Get' as a plea of unrequited love for her, and that she inspired a lot of Devoto's early work. Her name also pops up a lot in """"Songs That Saved Your Life"""" - besides Cemetry Gates, she's mentioned in entries for Miserable Lie, Wonderful Woman, Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me (in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single) and I Won't Share You. In the latter, there's another quote from the unused Morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled Crepuscule Ludus restrospective - the end of the note sounds very familiar: """"Oh Linder. Oh Linder. I'll see you sometime, somewhere."""" 

However, I'm not sure if you should mention any of this stuff in an article, for one thing it comes close to or falls directly into the realm of speculation on personal matters... then again, it's not like Wikipedia articles do not include speculation and rumours (Morrissey page is one of the examples!) But it would be wrong to make it seem as if she is more important for her relationships with male musicians than for her own work... so I don't know.

"""= Traffic drives improvement ===

The outlines aren't complete, but they are complete enough to be useful to readers.  And what good is a table of contents hidden in the back?  Tables of contents are most useful in the front.

The hatnote issue is very similar to adding the """"Contents"""" link to the sidebar.  And you opposed that too, on the grounds that the system wasn't ready to be displayed.

Shenme captured the essence of the situation very well:

A 'normal' wiki usually doesn't have a core structure, and so people don't expect it, but Wikipedia has quite a lot of material, and various ways of organizing it.  Having a link in the sidebar to the contents page will help people to discover what organization there is.  (whether perfect or not a separate topic).  And, actually, pointing people to the contents page and getting their resulting comments will improve the page.  Don't wait for the improvements first...  

The OOK needs editors for each of its pages, and for the essential pages it's missing.  Relying on a small team to finish all of this will take decades. (Do the math).  I've been on this project for almost 4 years already!

So, if hatnotes will benefit readers while attracting editors to these pages, then that looks like a pretty damn good solution to me.

 BMW Type 255 Kompressor 

The BMW Type 255 Kompressor sold at auction in 2013 is chassis number 'Fahrgest.Nr' no 2.  The BMW Type 255 Kompressor ridden during the 1939 Isle of Man TT by Georg Meier is chassis number 'Fahrgest.Nr' no 6.  The Meier chassis 'Fahrgest.Nr' no 6 was previously owned by the former Formula 1 driver John Surtees and may be now owned by BMW Motorrad or by the Meier family.

In this case, it IS reasonable to assume that, because no one uses the phrase """"the origin of life"""" to describe creationist perspectives.

Well that is not correct. If you are unwilling to learn the difference between in-universe and out-universe then I think editing articles dealing with fictional characters is not fair on editors who actually bothered to. The problem is the date of death field is part of the personal profile section of the info box. This means it is an in-universe element of the article; referring exclusively to events within the series. If the episode was set on a different date, to that it aired on - then a death featured within that episode would carry the date within the series. Fictional characters do not die from our viewpoint - they will always exist, they do not cease to exist, so we do not use our date. So maybe you need to have a rethink.

''Blindly sticking to policy in the face of all the facts is shockingly closed-minded.""""
I ask you—what is a 'fact'? It is something that we can prove to be true. How do we prove it to be true? With reliable, verifiable sources. And what do those reliable, verifiable sources say? That Alonso has an existing contract with Ferrari and that he is considering his options for 2015.

You want to remove Alonso from the table so that the article is representative of reality. If so, that change will need to be supported by a reliable, verifiable source in which Alonso himself says that he will leave Ferrari; alternatively, you can find a source from a senior Ferrari figure—be it Marco Mattiachi or Sergio Marchionne—saying the same thing. To change it prematurely suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of key Wikipedia policies, including no crystal balling, no original research and the need for sources that are reliable and verifiable.

Re this edit, which I mostly reverted. I've run into similar problems elsewhere, where a few works are cited many times, and it's useful to collect the the full citations into a section, and to have the footnotes cite these works in abbreviated form. In Daylight saving time I addressed the problem by moving those books into the Further reading section, which isn't exactly appropriate, as Further reading is supposed to be for books that weren't used as sources; I attempted to work around the problem by having the first footnote mention the existence of the full citations in the Further reading section. In Philitas of Cos I addressed it by renaming the section that is ordinarily called References to Notes and having a new References section containing the list of full citations; but it's a bit weird and non-uniform to have the section title move to the newly-added section when you need the new section. I vaguely recall seeing an list-of-full-citations section called Bibliography in some other article but that's not appropriate either, as the MOS says that Bibliography is for works written by the subject of the article. I don't know of any useful guideline in Wikipedia in this problematic area. The approach currently taken in Tourette syndrome #References isn't clearly wrong, and is arguably better than what's in Daylight saving time or in Philitas of Cos, not only because it doesn't abuse Further reading and References as titles, but also because it puts the most important references first.",0

Is V blind?
The film makes several suggestions that V is blind and benefits from enhanced senses like Marvel's Daredevil. When he emerges from the fire, Delia says he looked at her, but not with eyes, as he had no eyes. Obviously he seems to have no eyes behind the mask, but the citizens wearing the mask throughout the film also have no visible eyes. This could be a screen behind the mask for style purposes, although shots of V putting on the mask show that it has no screen behind the eyes and mouth. V does seem to be wearing a skimask/hood behind his mask, though. In the scene where V is disguised as a police officer and kidnaps Evey, he is wearing a burn prostethic behind the ski-mask and if you look closely, he seems to have large blacked eyes, similar to Hellraiser Cenobites. In the scenes where V emerges from the burning ruins of Larkhill, the closeup of his face also reveals his eyes to be """"black"""". Also while in disguise later as Brookewood(or whatever), he is wearing a pair of shades. This could be for one of two reasons: To disguise his black/missing eyes, or to make rectal identification impossible. 

I believe V is either blind or has mutated pupils. It is possible that he sees in a sort of thermal or enhanced vision, lending to his quick reflexes and ability to predict movements in his enemies. 

I also think it is possible that his eyes are turned black for unspecified reasons, which is what Delia meant when """"there were no eyes"""". The blacking of the eyes in the various scenes also could have been an editing choice for scene enhancement reasons.

Hello MopSeeker. Thanks for patrolling new pages – it's a very important task! I'm just letting you know, however, that you shouldn't tag pages as lacking context (CSD A1), content (CSD A3),or significance (CSD A7) moments after they are created, as you did at Messesarymist bulacan. It's best to wait at least 10–15 minutes for more content to be added if the page is very short, and the articles should not be marked as patrolled. Tagging such pages in a very short space of time may drive away well-meaning contributors, which is not good for Wikipedia. Attack pages (G10), blatant nonsense (G1), copyright violations (G12) and pure vandalism/blatant hoaxes (G3) should of course be tagged and deleted immediately. Thanks..",0

If you are really a very active Jew, then you would know that the Name itself is never pronounced aloud, and that the Hebrew letters that comprise it could possibly be the literal spelling of neither """"Adonai"""" nor """"haShem"""". It is the ineffability of the Name that leads pious Jews to avoid fully spelling out """"God"""", which in English also functions as a name for Him of sorts.

Since the four letters of the Name are never pointed, its pronunciation cannot be determined from texts, and if there exists a Rabbinic tradition as to its pronunciation those who know of it have not chosen to reveal it.

 The debate appears to be skewed. 

It is true that geological studies show changes of the environment that contradicts the strong Gaia hypothesis of ecosystems working towards an optimum state. It is also true that there is evidence that ecosystems have collapsed from within. However, the frequency of such ecosystem collapses through geological history is many orders of magnitude lower than the extremely high frequency predicted by the Malthusian model of maximum reproduction. So evolution must be driven by something other than maximization of reproduction. The selfish gene model (the theoretical mechanism basis of the Medea hypothesis of life destroying itself) appears to be supported by simple computer simulations, but so does strong Gaia hypothesis. The strong Gaia hypothesis failed scale-up to more complex systems, and the missing frequency of Medean ecosystem collapses can be explained if the selfish gene model also fails scale-up to the greater complexity of real life because real life is too complex to be livable to such rigid, unselfcritical entities as the selfish gene model claims that living organisms are. In other words, the selfish gene model is based on the same methodological error as is the strong Gaia hypothesis. This is explained in greater detail on the pages """"Moderating the Gaia/Medea debate"""" and """"Self-organization"""" on Pure science Wiki, a wiki devoted to the scientific method unaffected by academic prestige obsession.

Increasingly, some parties are quoting emails from the leaked archive (ex. . I thought that this was not to be done (""""No quoting of any email is to be done by persons other than the author or intended recipient(s)"""")? Am I mistaken? | talk  
I believe the intention of the provision you have quoted, is to prevent wide-scale quoting of entire emails and entire email exchanges; that is the assumption I will work off when taking affirmative action (as opposed to reactive action, such as this), although I invite you to have the Committee comment on my interpretation of it. Regardless, I'll ask Offliner to paraphrase what you wrote on the mailing list, although having him do this could be to your disadvantage as it provides him the opportunity to represent what you said on the mailing list in whatever way and with whatever language he chooses.   
Daniel, I don’t mind you removing my entire section (at your discretion) for as long as you read it, by going back to my post, and relating to the particulars listed in it. However, there’s nothing in the initial provisions of this case indicating that you’re supposed to prevent only wide-scale quoting of entire emails and email exchanges. – That is your own interpretation of the warning which needs to be confirmed by the Committee. Meanwhile, quoting of illegally accessed emails includes also explaining in ones own words what’s in those emails, which in a way is even worse, because paraphrasing other people is obviously tainted by personal agendas. Cheers,  talk 
Quoting, out-of-context and possibly doctored emails is creating, IMHO, more problems than paraphrasing, as it gives an air of legitimacy to this harassment campaign. PS. Offliner is not the ony party quoting @s, Russavia is doing that as well. | talk  
(edit conflict) I'm charged, as the Clerk of the case, to interpret the directives I receive. Until such a time as I am explicitly overruled by the Committee, how I interpret those directives is how the case will be run. I have interpreted the directives and disallowing the quoting of the contents of emails, allowing the subjects of emails, and allowing the paraphrasing of content of emails where said paraphrasing. If you're concerned about mis-paraphrasing, the other alternative is to give permission to be quoted; otherwise, your emails can and will be paraphrased within reason. If you believe a paraphrase is misleading, you are free to address it in your own evidence section.
These are the rules for the case.   
And in response to Piotrus, either allow yourself to be quoted explicitly, or refute the paraphrasing in your evidence section, or else appeal my decision to the Committee by email to arbcom-l@lists.wikimedia.org.

Definition

TABIn this proposal, I will discuss why the Wikipedia definition for “Probability,” is not a good, valid definition, and needs to be changed. Probability is something that is used every day. It is what helps us further understand the outcomes of the events in life that are uncertain. However, in order to further our knowledge of probability, we must truly understand the definition of the word first. According to Wikipedia, there is not a clear, valid definition for probability, and I propose to change this.

User:Nparibello-NJITWILL/Summer 2012 | Probability

TABThe given Wikipedia definition is as follows: Probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain.[1] The proposition of interest is usually of the form """"Will a specific event occur?"""" The attitude of mind is of the form """"How certain are we that the event will occur?"""" The certainty we adopt can be described in terms of a numerical measure and this number, between 0 and 1, we call probability.[2] The higher the probability of an event, the more certain we are that the event will occur. Thus, probability in an applied sense is a measure of the confidence a person has that a (random)event will occur.

The opening sentence brings great concern as to what probability really is. It begins with, “Probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain.” The word ordinarily is not only ambiguous, but makes the opening sentence tell us very little about what we are reading about. Aside from the ambiguity, the rest of the sentence is extremely confusing as well. Although I am someone who has studied probability not only for my college degree, but also on my own to further my knowledge, I still had to read that sentence over and over again to understand what the writer meant. I would not consider probability an attitude of mind, because this simply does not make sense. The “proposition of interest” and “attitude of mind” are unnecessary and confusing when defining probability. Probability is the analysis of the outcome of an uncertain event. 
TABThe given Wikipedia definition gives several examples of what probability is, rather than defining it. It states that, “The proposition of interest is usually of the form…” This is not only an example instead of a definition, but it is an extremely poor example. The word usually is very vague, leading the reader to believe that the given example does not apply to probability all of the time. The definition also ends with probability in an applied sense. But what does that really mean? Because there are no other examples of another sense that probability applies to, this makes the definition unclear.
TABThe definition then goes on the describe probability in mathematical terms using the range between 0 and 1. For anyone who has not dealt with probability in a mathematical sense, this definition most likely makes little sense. The way it is written is very vague, but what it is trying to say is that there is a range of outcomes in probability starting from 0 (the event will definitely not occur), to 1 (the event will definitely occur). These ranges are also often written in percent form, 0% to 100%. I believe that by adding the fact that these numbers are percentages, the numbers already start to make a more sense and become more valid. The range between these numbers is the percent of likeliness of an outcome. While this definition gave many examples that do not help the reader to further understand probability, I would perhaps include one common example when dealing with the mathematical sense, even though definitions should not include examples. For example, the probability of a fair coin landing heads after it is tossed is .5, or 50%. This is because there are two possible outcomes, heads or tails, and both are equally likely. If the coin had been unfair with heads on both sides, the probability of landing heads would be 1, or 100%, since there are no other possible outcomes. As stated in the original definition, “The higher the probability of an event, the more certain we are that the event will occur.”

TABTwo good quality sources comes from Richard L. Sheaffer in his book, Introduction to Probability and Its Applications, and Glenn Shaffer in his book Probability and Finance. Both Sheaffer and Shaffer are well known mathematicians whose textbooks are used in a vast majority of colleges, including NJIT. Both of their main mathematical focuses aim a probability, making them two of the best sources for this proposal. From a mathematical standpoint, Richard Sheaffer states that “Probability is a numerically valued function that assigns a number P(A) to every event A so that the following axioms hold: P(A) >= 0, and P(S) = 1.” Glenn Shaffer explains these axioms in a more wordy, les",0

Hello, thank you very much.  Yes unfortunately someone decided to go ahead and delete the page before anybody could mediate.  After 10 days the discussion was still very much active and no warning was given of deletion, or consideration of the fact that I requested mediation to resolve serious questions pertaining to bias and bad-faith.  Also, during deletion review I have shown that it is doubtful that the closing admin even read the AFD arguments properly and probably wasn't even aware that mediation had been requested.  This admin says there was clear consensus but the fact is that it was claerly shown during AFD that the advocates for deletion could not motivate their own statements, instead chosing to default anyway with """"Delete"""" endorsements.  I am told that the onus of proof lies on me yet I have addressed every single criticism repeatedly whereas they could not and did not submit proof for their own statements.  Also there were many supporters who presented arguments for 'keep' (probably outweighing the number who wanted 'delete') but these arguments were never addressed and the guys at deletion review are telling me that these contributions have zero weight because the people who want to 'keep' are all first-time users.  Deletion review is also proving unhelpful and in my opinion also biased with nobody seriously considering the arguments that have been raised, or really prepared to read through the AFD discussion properly.  I have no idea of what to do next and in fact if anything can be done.  I am extremely disillusioned with this process as it is obvious that prejudgements and lots of Wiki-speak are employed to 'prove' unsuitability, rather than arguments being actually objectively considered.

If therapy is """"the treatment of physical, mental, or social disorders or disease"""" (and that is a mainstream definition that applies to medicine and psychology), we would only be able to label abortion as therapeutic if we agree that pregnancy is ALWAYS a disease or disorder if the woman does not wish the pregnancy to continue. While some times a pregnancy is diseased or disordered, most pregnancies are not diseased or disordered, and most pregnancies that are diseased or disordered end up as spontaneous abortions (natural miscarriages) that are usually very early in the pregnancy and often go unnoticed by the gravid woman.

If  thinks that two wrongs always must make a right, he has the right to do so. But it takes all credibility out of Wikipedia to keep use incorrect sources only because they in turn copy the same mistake over and over and over and over. The system with Swedish military designations are not exclusive to aircraft or engines and have been the same since long before there were aircraft. This goes back to at least the 19th century, probably more. This is something I became aware of long time ago after spending hours digging in archives doing researches for numerous books and magazine articles about Swedish aviation history over the years. Why do you think it's SK 60 and not SK60 in the aricle(or even worse the Americanized SK-60)? The designation system is the same for Army bases, Air Force bases, Navy bases, radar, cameras, robots, airplanes, vehicles, guns, actually anything that goes into an inventory list including engines both piston and jets! Military systems anywhere are not exactly known for being flexible. Everything should be conformed the same. It should be the same with Wikipedia. If we want to spell the engine designation incorrect, then the airplane designation has to be changed to the incorrect """"SK60"""" as well! This goes for all other SAAB aircraft articles in all languages on Wikipedia! It has to be either, we can't have both! Personally I think it's easier to change a few incorrect spellings than hundreds that are already correct! After all, this is about common sense!! 

Also remember that a commercial website is often made by a webmaster who doesn't really know anything about the subject. This is not only true about Volvo Aero's web, but also the Swedish Armed Forces website who also have some similar misspellings. Sometimes they get it right though! (i.e. misspellings are not consistent on their web!) And yeah, even sorces like Jane's sometimes get it wrong!

Bill Haley, The Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly and many more of the greatest rockers had their roots in country.

 Sorry that you feel this way, Malangali. I don't suppose that I can persuade you, but I did try and do my homework. Iringa is not offically designated a city at present (unlike Mwanza, Dar and Arusha); you asserted this in the article, but it is simply factually incorrect. A seperate question is whether Iringa can be referred to as a city outside of the Tz government's definition. OK. First, I assure you that """"urban"""" can imply either town or city, particularly when contrasted with """"rural"""": see urban area. I checked two English language travel guides for Tanzania, both of whom use """"town"""".

 User:Varsovian 

Instead of keeping a low profile for awhile he immediately inserted himself into a discussion on WikiProject about the Nazi collaborator Anthony Sawoniuk. The nationality of Anthony Sawoniuk is yet determined, the only source which says his mother was Polish is a newspaper article. In a provocative style Varsovian started to compare the Nazi collaborator and war criminal Sawoniuk with Frederic Chopin(!).  """"That makes him more Polish than Chopin!"""", """"If Sawoniuk isn't Polish, neither is Chopin"""". I have asked him what has Chopin to do with Sawoniuk and reply was this:  """"if he isn't Polish, neither is Chopin"""", """"Unless we can find a source which says that Sawoniuk's father was a nationality other than Polish, Sawoniuk is purely Polish"""". This is crazy, he should provide sources that Sawoniuk and his father is Polish not others that he is not. Not happy enough that he needlessly dragged Chopin's name into the discuss on a Nazi collaborator, he opened a new section titled Chopin vs Sawoniuk. . I asked him to provide sources:  and the reply was this:  no sources provided and more comparisons between F.Chopin and Sawoniuk. He also accused me that I am """"trying to distract attention from yet another warning you this week received despite being under a DIRWIGEN official caution"""". I am most certainly not trying to distract attention from anything but I have a problem when somebody compares a Nazi collaborator of uncertain nationality with Frederic Chopin. I request you review if Varsovian's conduct is not in violation of the standards expected in the EE area.

The Objectivity of this Discussion is doubtful (non-existent)

(1) As indicated earlier, the section on Marxist leaders’ views is misleading:

(a) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on Trotsky, creating the misleading impression that other prominent Marxists (Marx, Engels, Lenin) did not advocate and/or practiced terrorism;

(b) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on the theoretical “rejection of individual terrorism”, creating the misleading impression that this is the main (only) Marxist position on terrorism. 

(2) The discussion is not being properly monitored:

(a) no discernible attempt is being made to establish and maintain an acceptable degree of objectivity;

(b) important and relevant scholarly works such as the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism are being ignored or illicitly excluded from the discussion;

(c) though the only logical way to remedy the blatant imbalance in the above section is to include quotes by/on other leaders who are known to have endorsed and practiced terrorism all attempts to do so have been systematically blocked with impunity by the apologists for Marxist terrorism who have done their best to sabotage and wreck both the article and the discussion.

(3) Among the tactics deployed by the apologist wreckers and saboteurs the following may be identified as representative examples:

(a) it is claimed that Marx and Engels did not advocate terrorism despite the fact that scholarly works like the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism show that they did, and Marx himself was known as “The Red Terror Doctor”;

(b) it is claimed that Marx and Engels were not involved in terrorist activities despite the fact that numerous sources from The Neue Rheinische Zeitung to Isaiah Berlin and Francis Wheen state otherwise;

(c) it is claimed that Lenin does not refer to terror in The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade K. Kautsky and other works/statements despite the fact that Robert Service, IET, and other scholarly and reliable sources state that he does;

(d) it is claimed that the Russian word ‘’strakh’’ does not mean “terror” when:

i. the Oxford Russian Dictionary says that it does;

ii. it is evident from the context that this is the case;

iii. any educated Russian speaker can confirm that strakh may mean “terror” depending on the context;

(e) it is claimed that Marxism is “scientific” when in fact:

i. Marx was not a scientist;

ii. Marx’s background was philosophy and law, not science;

iii. Marxism is not recognized as a science by the academic world;

iv. virtually every one of Marx’s predictions turned out to be wrong, as became increasingly apparent during his lifetime and incontrovertibly so after his death (R. Pipes, Communism: A Brief History, 2001, p. 15) from which it follows that Marxism does not qualify as a scientific system by any accepted standards;

v. the evidence indicates that Marxism is closer to a religious sect than to science proper;

(f) apologist literature is being quoted in a fraudulent attempt to whitewash Marxist terrorism, in effect turning the discussion into an advertisement for terrorism;

(g) it is claimed that Marxist terrorism is not rooted in the Marxist theory of class struggle even though there are numerous sources showing that it is (please note that it is immaterial whether terrorism had already been justified in terms of a theory of class prior to Marx, the point being that it was advocated/practiced on the basis of Marxist class-struggle theories BY MARXISTS):

“Karl Marx felt that terror was a necessary part of a revolutionary strategy” (Peter Galvert, “Theories of Terror in Urban Insurrections”, IET, p. 138);

“Revolutionary terrorism has its roots in a political ideology, from the Marxist-Leninist thinking of the Left, to the fascists found on the Right” (Noemi Gal-Or, """"Revolutionary Terrorism"""", IET, p. 203);

“… perhaps the most important key to Stalin’s motivation lies in the realm of ideology. The leitmotif of Soviet communist ideology in the 1920s and 1930s was class struggle – the inbuilt antagonism between mutually incompatible economic interest groups” (Geoffrey Robert, Stalins Wars, 2006, pp. 17-18);

this fact is supported not only by reliable academic sources, but by elementary logic: 

“In 1907 Mehring published in the magazine ‘’Neue Zeit (Vol. XXV 2, p. 164) extracts from a letter by Marx to Weydemeyer dated March 5, 1852. In this letter, among other things, is the following noteworthy observation: … class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat …”",0

 Here is a little something that I came up with myself

Let the boxes equal the letters A-V
Let the prize that you want to win be behind box A (It doesn't matter which box the prize you want to win is in, [also assume biggest prize])
Now if you pick box A, then the probability of getting through to the end of the game with the prize you want still in the game is 1(certain).
This occurs is (1/22) cases.
(1)*(1/22)=(1/22)

If you don't pick box A then the probability of you getting to the end of the game without taking out the prize you want is:

(20/21)*(19/20)*(18/19)... *(2/3). 

This can be re-written as:

(2*((20!)*(1!)))/(21!).

There is one very important thing to note here. In the sum, you don't multiply by 1/2, because you don't need to eliminate all of the boxes, just all but one (plus yours). This means that instead of dividing by (21!), you must divide by (21!)/(2) which is why there is a 2* on the top.

The sum works out with a value of (2/21) = 0.9523809524
This occurs is 21/22 cases so:

(21/22)*(2/21)= (1/11)

Therefore, you are twice as likely to be on the path where you didn't pick the prize you wanted (i.e. grand) first, which means that you should swap. Now there may be a flaw in my logic, and if there is then please point it out.82.26.43.91  15:46",0

The article must provide context to the reader about the question, show the various positions and approaches taken in different fields, and ensure that no single claim to exclusive authority or evocation of essentially meaningless and conflictual universal generalisations is present. It can not possibly be any clearer. The article is fundamentally flawed in two ways 1)claims to exclusive authority and 2) circular and self-referential evidentiary support.

By the way, when I thought about the actual event, as opposed to your group's flame war against anyone seeking to report it, the notion that the incident had no racial significance became ever more ludicrous. First, because you would never have denied the racial significance of a white-on-black attack, and secondly because I have no doubt that the attackers expressly targeted Gordimer because of her race. As anyone who follows life in South Africa knows, such daily race-based attacks, and official indifference towards them, are a part of the institutionalized fabric of that nation's life.

It's admittedly not an easy call and it reflects the zero sum game of trying to decide one way or the other in a discussion where there's fundamentally no consensus across the encyclopaedia, so I won't personally bring a challenge against it in one of the venues that can overturn a DRV, but I also think it's disingenuous to claim that this was the only permissible conclusion.— T/C """,0

"Hi Domer. Firstly, my opinions aren't welcome here. Secondly, I'm not prepared to be trapped by yourself into 'naming and shaming' (Undoubtedly leading to you manipulating wiki policy to get me permanently blocked), its pretty self evident to all but the most deceitful who and what I'm referring to. Academics have always written in encyclopedias because encyclopedias are written by experts in their field. In huge editions many hundred may be involved. Even thousands. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography for example has over 100 historians writing entries (Thats an estimate, its probably more) So there is no doubt that if academics were recruited like any other scholarly project then an internet encyclopedia would be written quite easily. Fourthly, I have nothing to contribute to this article, other than the fact that encyclopedias do not use footnotes, and if they did, they certainly wouldn't have more than 60 for a relatively minor topic.

 """"no you're wrong, it's perfect acceptable. . . ."""" 

Hello,

I always welcome feedback for my efforts, most of which nowadays are editing and writing narrative nonfiction and novels.

And I do appreciate those who have studied the art and science of the English language, esp. grammar and usage. 

I especially love it when those who would criticize another's work do it decently and respectfully.

Having listened to the tone, color and texture of your message, I assume that you're not one of those I describe in paragraph two above. Further, I assume you're not diplomatic in your dealings with other people, in general. Either that, or you're just plain too lazy to be kind and decent. 

Telling me I'm """"wrong"""" is just plain rude, esp. when BOTH of us are correct, according to modern-day usage.

By the way, the correct way your sentence should've been structured is, """"No, you're wrong; it's perfectly acceptable."""" Of course, I may've said something like, """"You're both right, Dean. Happy editing and thank you for contributing to Wkipedia.""""

Of course, that's just I . . . or me, as it were. . . .

I wish you well in your future edits.

Take care,

Dean Garner

 United Wrestling Association 

Thank you very much for your time & effort cleaning up United Wrestling Association. It looks wonderful now. I appreciate that very much.  

 Triple Crown and Grand Slam Champions 

I am not and was never looking to start trouble, all I am trying to do is expand a definition based on fact and references.

The Triple Crown and the Grand Slam are what we have been going back and forth on.

My contention is that The Intercontinental and United States Championships are equal and thus are interchangeable when when deciding a Crown/Slam.

You say no because WWE never explicitly came out and said so.

On 8-4-06, JBL said he was a Slam winner.  A WWE wrestler on WWE TV said he accomplished a WWE sanctioned feat.

It was said that no outside source has verified this, but no one in WWE has disputed JBL's claim either.

Also it must be pointed out that PWI has always considered the two championships as equal.

When PWI used to do their rankings for WWF and WCW, the I-C and U.S. Titles were always listed as automatic number one contenders for their respective World Champions.  The same holds true today when they do the rankings for Raw (I-C) and Smackdown (U.S.).

PWI is considered the main source for what is considered a """"World Title"""" and their word is law here on Wikipedia.

They also have always maintained that the I-C and U.S. Championships are of equal value and of equal standing.

As I have said before, I am not trying to vandalize or add nonsense to Wikipedia, only enhance it with an updated definition based on consensus and fact, based on logic and references.

JBL, PWI, and many other wiki users have backed up this definition. (Look at the Triple Crown Champion Discussion page).

All I ask is my contribution be allowed to stand as I respectfully feel that I am in the right on this one.

Thank you for your time.

Hi, Moe. I'm particularly sensitive about people asking me about the reasons for my votes. So I won't be offended if you are, or decline to answer (heck, I walk that line frequently).

He still doesn't. And frankly, I oppose most RFAs. In this case, though, I've interacted with him a lot and find him to be (I hate to use the term) a real """"standup kind of guy."""" If you'd deign to explain to me, I'd be most grateful. Thanks, Alex. ... aa:talk

Thanks on improving the NPOV of An Inconvenient Truth
Thanks for rebalancing the NPOV equilibrium of this article.  You have achieved by adding rebuttals within the science section in homeopathic doses what I could not by being I gather too straightforward.  I contributed a huge amount of research that was immediately taken out by MastCell.  I just gave up and placed a NPOV tag on this one-sided article at the time.  The tag lasted no more than 2 hours, as it was promptly removed by ILike2BeAnonymous (who is deemed by Wikipedia to be a saint as he apparently as protected many articles against vandalism).  But, ILike2BeAnonymous removed the NPOV tag without making a single contribution to rebalance the NPOV equilibrium.  I gather he thought my tag amounted to vandalism.  Finally, you courageously stepped in.  As you can see per the Discussion history you must be the third or fourth editor who is taking a rebutting balanced stand towards this article.  Of this group, I congratulate you for being so far the most successful.  

If I may, I would encourage you to do even just a bit more.  An Inconvenient Truth's main message is that because of anthropogenic CO2 emission temperatures will rise by the end of the century leading to a probable (entire) melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps leading to sea level rise of 20 to 40 feet submerging our seashore civilization as we know it.  The slides showing what such a sea level rise looks like (maps of cities, states, countries) are pretty dramatic.  But, they have absolutely no scientific bearing.  The IPCC forecasts a sea level rise ranges from several inches inches to just 3 feet in the worst case scenario.  I think this is a critical balancing point to insert within the science section of the article.  I have tried, and got censored immediately.

On the same subject, I am glad you came across the pretty impressive document """"A Skeptic's Guide to an Inconvenient Truth.""""  It is incredibly well researched and referenced.  By the end, there is hardly a page of the book or slide of the movie that is not effectively rebutted by data based scientific studies.  Keep up the good work. """,0

"""
My experiences came up on the talk page but once I understood Wikipedia I didn't post anything on the article related to my personal experiences. That was like the 2nd day almost two months ago.

All of my references are verifiable.There's nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation.  I didn't put my experiences in the Judge Edward Nottingham article either although he was my judge.

I went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue. For instance, I wrote to the ABA and asked for their input, and in fact, asked them to work on the article. I also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses, citing references from a lawyers point of view.  Those references were deleted by someone, I can't remember who and don't know why. At this point, the only reference that I posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and I know for sure that is a valid transcript.  The guy who runs the blog is a 3rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers.   Even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration I had references for. I read in the Wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts.

I don't believe that I did any original research. All I did is search the Internet for references for the article.  I really didn't know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before I started working on this article. I had already been thinking about forms based filing but I started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ECF, which date back to 2004.  Also, when I was younger I worked as a systems analyst.

I did get the info on the Laws and Liberties of MA years ago, but Wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway.  Same as the U.N. covenantcan't really hide that.   I didn't add a and b together to prove a point, at least not consciously. Like today, I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the 5th Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone, which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand, who was in the fifth circuit. And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words """"pro se"""" in the 40s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se (No, there was not).  What I found in the 40s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but Judge Learned Hand seemed pro se friendly.

I believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is """"soap boxing"""". I do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business. I've been an entrepreneur. 

I didn't know about the Federal Judicial Center until I started working on this article. That book on appellate procedure I found looking for references for this article. The manual on complex litigation I found looking for references for this article.

Arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself.  One thing I started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation. I ordered the book Slave Nation at the library but I haven't got it yet. But now when I look at pro se law in the different states I think free state, slave state, border state. Also, there were issues related to Indians in some of the western states. The labor union movement had a lot to do with it too, I think. So did the history of workmen's comp, which is of course related to unions.  """,0

The only """"major controversy"""" is that on this Wikipedia page, the denialists, such as Duesberg and his followers, those whose ramblings are linked out to from this page, and who have had their long-disputed and dismissed theories and misinformation floating around on he web for many years, were being used as the sole source of 'credible' information on the larger controversy around AIDS and poppers  until I happened upon it.

Ultimately, I was blocked, charged with violating unknown-to-me 'rules' of Wikipedia, and otherwise censored, and rendered unable to contribute.  And, that, gentlemen, is what I've been complaining about for the past month here on Wikipedia.

It would be much better if the Wikipedians, with their vast experience of computer knowledge, particularly as it relates to being able to master Wikipedia, would stand aside and let those of us who actually have knowledge about the subject of nitrites and poppers make meaningful contributions to this page.

However, I suspect that will not be allowed to happen.  I say this based on my personal experience over the past month here, and based on the news accounts last month on CNN, ABC Nightly News, and elsewhere, which revealed that Wikipedia was being ruined by those who practice the same kind of censorhip and harrassment that I've been subjected to.

It's a good suggestion. I would go a little further and offer this version of the entire paragraph that circumvents any mentioning of the 'claims':

""""Although the empire had a multi-ethnic character during its history and preserved Romano-Hellenistic traditions, it became known to most of its western and northern contemporaries as the Empire of the Greeks due to the increasing predominance of the Greek element. The use of the term Empire of the Greeks (Latin: Imperium Graecorum) to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire also implied that in the West it was no longer seen as the Roman Empire. The authority of the Byzantine Emperor as successor of Roman Emperors, was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in the year 800. Needing Charlemagne's support in his struggle against his enemies in Rome, Leo used the lack of a male occupant of the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire at the time to claim that it was vacant and that he could therefore crown a new Emperor himself. Whenever the Popes or the rulers of the West made use of the name Roman  to refer to the eastern Roman Emperors, they preferred the term Imperator Romaniæ instead of Imperator Romanorum, a title that Westerners maintained applied only to Charlemagne and his successors.""""

I'd leave the last sentence though since it demonstrates that there was still a certain ambiguity about how Popes and other western rules saw the Byzantine Empire.  """,0

3. Blocks
If you're an Admin and you have blocked me, don't note it here. I'll surely notice it when I try to edit an article. If you want to show others how strong you are, there's always my Block log. In case you want to give me the chance to ask a review of my block, don't bother.

Page Rebuild

For quite some time, the Alcoholism entry has provided out of date or incorrect information. I'm in the process of rewriting it to meet contemporary scientific standards for the disease. I welcome external review and discussion. 
 Stuart Gitlow MD (Chief, Annenberg Physician Training Program in Addictive Disease, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NYC)

Thanks for your contributions so far.  You may be interested in creating a user account.  Some of the benefits are discussed at this page: Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account%3F  

It greatly reduces the chances people will revert your changes, for one thing. -)  

Good points, and I've created an account as you suggest. See my notes below as well. sg

In response to the commentary at the very, very bottom of this page (dupe social impacts), I've rearranged the content of the page a bit.  I believe that it now better reflects the chronology of how people are impacted by alcoholism, and therefore reflects the order in which this information becomes important to people: definition, effects, diagnoses, treatment, broader issues.

FYI, I renamed the first instance of Social Issues to read """"Societal Issues"""" and moved it into the broader issues area.  I moved the latter one up to become a subheading of the """"Effects"""" category.  After this edit I'm going to go remove the original note of this (because it's no longer germain), so you'll have to look at the next edit in order to read it.  

In looking over the article and the discussion of Stanton Peele's perspective et al, I'm wondering whether some of the ongoing discussion held on this page is about a misconception that alcoholism is equal to """"excessive drinking,"""" whatever that is. Alcoholism doesn't refer to someone who drinks a lot. Many people drink a great deal but aren't alcoholic. Conversely, many alcoholics don't drink very much at all compared against the general population's intake.  

The section on """"terminology"""" that you removed was intended to address exactly this misunderstanding.  Since you seem to think it's important, I'm putting it back in.  

righto 

Despite the difficulties that we've had of late, the entry is coming together nicely. I'm looking over the EFFECTS section, which has a good deal of information on alcohol itself, and the impact of alcohol USE. It is difficult to tease out the effects of alcoholism versus the effects of alcohol. The effects of alcoholism when an alcoholic is in recovery, for example, would be different from the effects of alcoholism while an individual is drinking on a daily basis. (This is similar, of course, to the situation with other diseases - the effects of diabetes when an individual has well-controlled blood glucoses are different from the effects of untreated diabetes). Nevertheless, I wonder whether the entire section would be more appropriately found in the alcohol article rather than here in the alcoholism article. Can we build a consensus regarding this area?  

 Alcoholism vs. Alcohol abuse 

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism make a difference between one and the other. What I found more confusing is that from """"alcohol abuse"""" you're redirected to """"alcoholism"""".

""""Alcoholism, also known as 'alcohol dependence,' is a disease that includes four symptoms: craving, loss of control, physical dependence, and tolerance"""". 

Moreover, """"Alcohol abuse differs from alcoholism in that it does not include an extremely strong craving for alcohol, loss of control over drinking, or physical dependence"""", etc etc.

>> Getting the facts @ NIAAA

 

Response:  Good point.  From one interested perspective, AA literature itself discusses this issue and draws a clear distinction between alcohol abuse and alcoholism. 

I can't make the correction. I'm not that good informed and my english is quite lousy. Could you..?  

How about mentioning something about alcoholism as a form of drug addiction? Correct me if I'm wrong, but alcohol is certainly a hard drug, characterized by intense (and possibly fatal) withdrawals... isn't that addiction?

This is mostly true.  The root",0

"Who is Obrides Wedding Dress & Evening Dress Factory

 Welcome to visit Obrides Wedding Dress & Evening Dress Factory.

Obrides was born in 2006. Before 2010, Obrides mainly did business with wholesalers from all over the world and didn't produce dresses.

I know, you want me to hold the burden of proof.  Anglo-Frisian and Old Norse have the most extreme maritime influences, including those Non IE Roots discussed on the Talk:Germanic languages page where you bureaucratically assaulted me also.  As formerly stated(before Diderot POV pushed the article with a massive edit) on the Non IE Roots page(), Celtic is another language group holding a considerable amount of Non IE Roots.  Apart from any Basque influences, Celtic seems to have Non IE terms concentrated mostly in the British Isles, where they were joined by the Anglo-Frisians and Norse.  It is blatantly clear to anybody that the Mediterranean influence on High German is astounding.  The older Nordic and Germanic writings appear less structured and thought out, but the more evolution into current speech, the tongues have been so standardised by latinisation, especially.  One cannot seriously refute that the Anglo-Frisian and West Norse tongues follow the least marked latinising structures on their tongues of the Germanic languages(and especially borrowing scientific terms), apart from writing them in latin script, with a few native letters especially in Icelandic to this day.  The Baltic East Norse tongues gained a considerable conversion by the influence of the Low German speakers of the Hanseatic League in their everyday life, most notable in the Hanseatic Cities, like Visby on Gotland.  Since High German has been standardising itself all throughout Germany, having a marked effect upon such others as Austrian and Swiss German, all the dialects of Germany and even in Eastern Europe are suffering at the officialisation and BBC type overtaking.  See the German language page for more information in this regard.

 Fort Apache 

For two years, this reference has been troublesome. Clearly, John Ford wanted to draw a parallel between Col. Thursday and GAC. However, Ford's intent and the extent of the parallel have been distorted in the previous edit. The similarities are vague at best, and film depicts a clear verbal confrontation and  agreement to do battle between the Apaches and the cavalry; Thursday's """"last stand"""" troop consists of about 20 soldiers, not hundreds; the Apaches create a deliberate ambush of the cavalry with no similarity to LBH; the John Wayne character inherits Thursday's mantle (and head gear) and affirms the value and worth of """"the regiment."""" All of this indicates that Ford utilized fragments of the GAC/LBH history to make a very different and pro-military point that the previous edit ignored. Nothing wrong with what Ford was doing in this classic film - but the previous edit stretched itself to great lengths to make parallels to Custer that do not in fact exist. I have reduced the edit to the only clear parallels that actually occur in the film.""",0

Most peasants had """"Jewish"""" names stemming from religious associations, i.e., the Apostles and early Saints. Therefore that point means very little.

  NPOV (nuetral point of view)

- No one can truly say how or even if the listed items will affect voters

Types of bias include:

Ethnic or racial bias, including racism, nationalism and regionalism. 
Corporate bias, including advertising, coverage of political campaigns in such a way as to favor corporate interests, and the reporting of issues to favor the interests of the owners of the news media. 
Class bias, including bias favoring one social class and bias ignoring social or class divisions. 
Political bias, including bias in favor of or against a particular political party or candidate. 
Religious bias, including bias in which one religious viewpoint is given preference over others. 
Sensationalism, which is bias in favor of the exceptional over the ordinary. This includes the practice whereby exceptional news may be overemphasized, distorted or fabricated to boost commercial ratings. 
Geographical bias which may for example describe a dispute as it is conducted in one country without knowing that the dispute is framed differently elsewhere. 

The presence of this section is biased on several of the basses listed above

Wikipedia articles are not:

Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view.

"UPittIT Block 

Hi Orangemike,

Hope you are doing well and I appreciate your work here on Wikipedia. I have some questions regarding the block of UPittIT. Although I too have some concerns with this account which primarily are the lack of this editor's responsiveness to numerous warnings of copyright concerns (as Hammersoft had pointed out), and editor's lack of engagement in dialogue regarding these issues. This could be simple misunderstanding of the copyright policy for the editor's user space, but the repeated violations are disconcerting. In fact, I can't be entirely sure that the user account is only one person (a kind of reverse sockpuppetry that makes me uneasy). However, it is my understanding that editors are not in WP:COI solely due to their place of employment or username, but rather because of the issues of POV, reliability and neutrality of their contributions. However, in this case, my particular my concern is the work the editor had done in his or her own sandbox (the now deleted  issues, this had not been demonstrated because all of his/her work (as far as I know) had been confined his/hers user sandbox. The editor was an obvious newbie, and had twice sought feedback (see here and here) and had been responsive to suggestions demonstrated by the removal of pervasive external links, downsizing of the article, rewriting so it was not in violation of WP:NOTDIR, and the addition of outside, neutral third-party references. In fact, although I did not see any of the editor's additions to this particular article since July 7th, in my opinion, it contained useful information, was notable, and was ready to be moved from the user space into Wikipedia proper. Mostly, I would request that this page be restored, as I would like to create that particular article myself and will not be able to duplicate the off-line references from various library science journals that had been inserted. I guess you could say that I primarily lament the loss of this particular article. I would appreciate your thoughts on this issue, and your review of the D-Scribe Digital Publishing article circa the July 7th version as I would like to see if there is anything salvageable from that (sans the copyright violations that Hammersoft elucidated).

"Solutions and suggestions ... 

 asked for a third-party opinion, so here goes:
 This long-running discussion makes me think of a few things in general:
 Michael is a newby, so the wiki policy of don't bite the newbies seems to be relevant, and it looks like for the most part,  is sticking to that, apart from personal comments about Michael's English. I can relate to the fact that it is sometimes hard to figure out what someone's point is, and that may be what Kwami was trying to say about Michael, but I think it's out of line to say that someone's English is non-native, or that someone's knowledge of Arabic is similarly less than desirable. So my point on this one is this: stick to the point and leave personal comments out.
 Sometimes, discussions about articles and edits get pretty heated, even without personal comments. If you can't handle it, take a wikibreak. This is what I do, and it works for me.
 Divide up the topics for discussion - it makes it much easier for people to comment without having to read lots and lots of stuff they aren't interested in. For example, if I want to comment about /el/ and /ba'al/, where in that long discussion would I want to put my comment?
 I think one of the best things that can be done for this article is to divide it up. Put the meat of the Wadi al-Hol in an article by itself, and the Proto-Sinaitic script information in its own page. What remains of the Middle Bronze Age alphabets is a general summary of why these two are thought to be related, plus thumbnail sketches of the content of those two articles, with appropriate Main Article type links. I think this will focus the discussion. For example, if Colliss has written about one but not the other, all refutation and support of Colliss's arguments will be guided to the right discussion pages.
 This topic is one of many that has scholars screaming at each other. There are ways of summarizing the opposing arguments that allow casual readers to understand the controversy without getting information overload.
 In relation to both of these scripts, the article suffers from a dearth of citations, appropriate or otherwise. The various assertions are interesting and serve as a stepping-off point for finding the actual sources, so I would oppose the deletion of every single unsupported citation. After all, it was only a few years ago that Wikipedians started to insist on citations - before then, there was a whole lot of original research, some of which still persists without proper citations.
 I for one would like to know how many examples of these inscriptions have been found. From the current state of this article, it seems like there is only one of proto-Sinaitic (which was found in two locations, which can't be right) and that there are only two Wadi al-Hol inscriptions, which we can see in the illustration provided. There is also a citable reference in some National Geographic website about Semitic anti-snake inscriptions in part of Unas's tomb in Giza. Maybe that should have its own page, too, with an appropriate link.
 I don't buy this business about Arabic being irrelevant. It reminds me too much of how European researchers dismissed all Arabic scholarship about the Arabic language itself. However, any references to Arabic in an article on a topic from the Middle Bronze Age have to keep in mind the huge time difference. For example, the hamza was a much later development, so it sheds about as much light on Wadi al-Hol as the development of the letters J, V and W.
 I don't accept the table at all - the article is about an intermediate step that is not represented in the table. The table represents conjecture about connections between two known endpoints, Hieroglyphic and the Semitic alphabet (for lack of a better term). Besides, if the hypothesis is that the proto-Sinaitic script evolved from hieratic writing, then why is that script not represented in the table?
 I don't accept the business of naming these letters. Unless there is evidence to show that these symbols even had names at the time they were used, the names are anachronistic. If the names were in fact attested at a different time in a different script, the person promoting the use of the names has a big burden. In terms of Wikipedia, all we have to do is say that a particular citable scholar has made the connection, and if the connection is disputed, we can point to a citation that says that too. It is our own editorial discretion that says how we portray that dispute, for example,
 A says X, but others disagree, for example, B.
 It is not clear whether X is true, as claimed by A, or whether Y is true, as claimed by B.
 Scholars disagree on whether X is tr",0

 there is nothing more sad then an administrator who bans people just because they have written a superior article. 

Let me clear up a few things here. First off, I am not an """"IRA supporter"""". I am a 36 year old proud former US Marine who served my country and I resent being called a """"Terrorist Supporter"""". I have never given money to the IRA, I am Irish Catholic and I support Sinn Fein, but not the IRA. I personally do not believe the IRA are terrorists in the same veign as the UDA/UVF, Hezbollah or Al Qaida. The IRA is much more like the Iraqi Kurds, Northern Alliance, Jewish Irgun, French Resistence, and American Revolutionaries. I am also not a UDA/UVF terrorist apologist as Jdorney seems to be.

I also resent being banned just because some wanna-be administrator is upset that my article contains more accuracies then his does. I have re-edited my article and placed all the proper Sources, page numbers, and Quotes. I have also added to the """"Sources"""" index. I have never ment to purposely delete anyones work, if I did so it was by accident and I apologize. I spent weeks researching this article, and alot of it is based on an article I wrote on the IRA when I was stationed at Camp. Pendleton back in 2000, the rest of it is from newer sources and books.

I certainly don't mind other people adding to the article, but I don't think that my edits should be deleted, just because they don't """"fit"""" with the bias of some editor's and administrators. I will be checking back often, and if my edits continue to be altered I will inform some senior administrators, some of whom are friends of mine. I have worked on many other Irish, and Military articles and never had any complaints.""",0

"I am really puzzled by the confusion that remains here. First, people need to know that the term prophet is used in two ways by the LDS. In essence, any individual who is given revelation which is pertinent to the future is acting prophetically. Thus, any individual (in or out of the Church) might prophecy and thereby be referred to as a small-'p' prophet. However, some individuals are formally ordained (by laying on of hands) as Prophets, Seers, and Revelators. Thus, Brother Jones may be a Bishop, a High Priest, an Apostle, and a Prophet at the same time (we actually have 15 prophets if you wish to pursue the issue). Unique to the LDS belief is the understanding that the authority of Priesthood offices are retained, based on worthiness, forever. So while Joseph Smith acted prophetically, he also held the titles of, Elder, Apostle, Prophet, President, and High Priest. It could also be said he was a Deacon, a Teacher, and a Priest. These are titles. In fact, broken down by office and (common usage)

Aaronic (preparatory) Priesthood
Deacon (Brother Jones) 
Teacher (Brother Jones)
Priest (Brother Jones)
Bishop (Bishop Jones)

Melchizidek Priesthood 
Elder (Elder Jones)
Seventy (Elder Jones)
High Priest (Brother Jones)
Patriarch (Formerly Patriarch Jones, new policy recommends Brother Jones) 
Apostle (senior Quorum member designated Prophet, or President Jones)

 

Consider this fact. Joseph Smith's father served for years as the Patriarch of the Church. While he was a patriarch (speaking of his role as a father) it would sound silly to state that Joseph Smith Sr. was the (small 'p') patriarch of the church.

Joseph Smith, while a 'p'rophet, was also a 'P'rophet by virtue of Priesthood office. Thus Pope John Paul, President Obama, Prophet Smith (though the term President Smith is more commonly used). So feel free to refuse to identify Joseph Smith as a 'p'rophet. But it is insensitive to both the RLDS and the LDS and erroneous to ignore the fact Joseph Smith was a 'P'rophet (an office in the High Priesthood). I don't follow the Pope, but I wouldn't deny he is one. You don't have to believe Smith was a prophet, to accept he was a Prophet in the LDS Priesthood.",0

Ditto on GAN. To me, the article is ready, though I still intend to make some minor edits. On another front, I think we ought to leave the dating issue where it stands, even though I disagree with Heylin's assessment of mid-July, which he guesses at based on the fact that BoB made its debut on the charts on July 30 (see Shades, p. 264). I find that ridiculous. For example, BIABH took six weeks from its official release on March 7, 1965, to reach the charts (May 8). Highway 61 got out much quicker, with a one-month lapse from its August 20 release before charting. Going back earlier, Another Side took about six weeks to chart and Freewheelin', more about than three months,  Using mid-July, then, means giving BoB  two weeks to debut, which is absurd. Of course, the whole problem centers on what is meant by """"release."""" In this case, it's being used to mean distribution, which was obviously delayed in BoB's case. However, the Billboard advertisement of June 25 gives at least three other clues to that: pressing, packaging and promotion. With those three in place, distribution couldn't have been more than a week behind if not already in motion.   """,0

"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now.

Exactly, I don't own Wikipedia or have the authority to randomly delete articles. We have discussions, then we build consensus. That's why I'm discussing you here other possibilities, such as merging these battles to related articles. Please do not take offense, as I sense a change in your tone. To answer your question:
We require multiple sources so that we can write a reasonably balanced article that complies with Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, rather than representing only one author's point of view. This is also why multiple publications by the same person or organization are considered to be a single source for the purpose of complying with the """"multiple"""" requirement. (WP:WHYN)
Lack of multiple sources suggests that the topic may be more suitable for inclusion in an article on a broader topic. It is common for multiple newspapers or journals to publish the same story, sometimes with minor alterations or different headlines, but one story does not constitute multiple works. Several journals simultaneously publishing different articles does not always constitute multiple works, especially when the authors are relying on the same sources, and merely restating the same information. Similarly, a series of publications by the same author or in the same periodical is normally counted as one source. (WP:GNG, footnote 3)

 Scientific evidences stating Meucci's priority on Bell

1) Anti-sidetone circuit

Meucci began investigating topics related with the telephone """"system"""" in 1858, as shown by a drawing of the same year, reproduced below http://www.chezbasilio.it/immagini/corradi_drw.gif. 
This drawing formed the basis for Meucci's caveat of 1871, but, as Meucci's lawyer did not file it with the caveat, it was later notarized by Meucci himself in his affidavit of 9 October 1885.The drawing shows a two-way, simultaneous, telephone conversation, with a complete separation between the two directions of transmission (indicated by arrows). This contrivance is aimed to counteract the so-called """"side-tone"""" effect, that is, the hearing of the echo of the speaker's own voice (as well as any background noise) in his own receiver. 
This layout is known today as a """"four-wire circuit"""". With it, Meucci anticipated any other inventor, as proved by the following:

No mention of side-tone effects, nor measures to counteract it, are found in Bell's patents, nor in Gray's caveat, both of 1876. In the first Bell's subscriber lines, the four (initially, two) instruments were simply put in series on the same line.
The first anti-sidetone (AST) circuits were introduced by the Bell people in the 1900s, particularly by George A. Campbell, with his nine patents of 1918, many decades after Meucci's solution was shown in this drawing, and over thirty years after the same drawing was notarized.

2) Inductive loading

The drawing reproduced above http://www.chezbasilio.it/immagini/lemmi_drw.gif is taken from a note jotted down by Meucci in his Laboratory notebook on 27 September 1870, and reported in an affidavit by M. Lemmi of 28 September 1885, containing the English translation of said notebook (see also my paper on """"Antenna"""").
It can be seen that diagrams """"No. 2"""" and """"No. 3"""" differ from """"No. 1"""" in the insertion midway along the long-distance line of an inductor (with either a horseshoe or bar iron core). In diagram """"No. 4,"""" the inductor is split into two parts, inserted at both ends of the line. In his notes, Meucci pointed out that, in this way, he could get rid of the battery, and that, by splitting the inductor, he obtained better results.
This technique is known today as the """"inductive loading"""" of long distance telephone lines, allowing to increase the distance and/or the quality of speech. The proof that Meucci came first, can be drawn from the following events, occurred many years after Meucci's discovery (or its notarization):

In June-July, 1887, Oliver Heaviside and Alfred Vaschy predicted, on the basis of mathematical calculations, that telephone signals could be transmitted without distortion by increasing the line's self-induction.
On 19 June 1900, M. I. Pupin obtained the first two patents for said technique. The Bell Telephone Co. acquired both patents and, later on, applied them in its lines

3)Means to counteract the skin effect

Because of the increased bandwidth of the telephone with respect to the telegraph, telephone lines were subjected to increased attenuation, due to the so-called skin effect.
In two notes of 1862 in his Laboratory notebook (notarized in Lemmi's affidavit of 1885), Meucci suggested to treat the surface of the (copper) conductor in various ways (basically with graphite) to increase its surface conductivity.
Moreover, in his caveat of 1871, Meucci stated: “I believe it preferable to have the wire of larger area than that ordinarily employed in the electric telegraph.”
Another note in his notebook, dated 17 August 1870, reads: “To be adopted, for having long distance, bundles of copper wire insulated with cotton or any other kind of wrapper; by this means I have obtained a distance of about one mile.” For this """"bundle"""" of copper wires Meucci filed a US patent application """"Wire for Electrical Purposes"""" on 2 July 1880.

That Meucci was first in said techniques, is proven by the following facts:

Skin effect in telephone lines was neglected by all inventors till 1880, when it began to be investigated by David E. Hughes and Oliver Heaviside.
Following their studies and the development of """"hard drawn"""" copper, the Bell Telephone Co. decided to use copper in place of steel, beginning from the Boston-New York line, which was inaugurated on 27 March 1884.

4) Call signaling

Meucci adopted a telegraphic call signaling, simply effected by a Morse key, attached to each end of the line, momentarily short-circuiting the local transmitter. In this way, strong pulses of current were sent along the line, and the distant receiver would emit intermittent ticks, much louder than the ordinary speech. In his caveat of 1871, Meucci gave a detailed description of his call signaling, consistent w",0

 Spin-off, character pages 

When first writing, for example, The Brittas Empire character page, I thought it was written in 'an in-universe style'. However in retrospect this does not seem to be the case entirely, and I will be reviewing the page shortly.

Just a quick point on 'Edio*Magica', although it wasn't you who blocked me directly, it was still rather silly to think I would vandalize the very pages I have been improving (Sooty & co., The Brittas Empire), and to think that I would replace content with insults directed at myself. Due to the blocking I had to create this new account in order to edit pages, but I'm willing to forgive and forget about the misunderstanding.   
It wouldn't be the first time that someone has disrupted Wikipedia. In the past, we've had people create vandalism on one account, so that they can look good on another by fighting it. I realise, though, that your case is that there are probably some other bored little school kids using the same computer pool as you. talk to me 
Well i'm glad you've seen sense. What makes their actions even more pathetic is the fact they're university students; nevertheless they seem to have stopped now.

 regarding International humanitarian law 

The protection of hospitals is according to the Geneva convention. The agreement from 1949 was also signed and ratified by the USA.
According to that agreement hospitals are protected.
The exception is: unless the facilities """"are being used, outside their humanitarian function, to commit acts harmful to the enemy"""" as rightly commented in the article.

Why having qualifiers, as if the Geneva convention is not clear on the point of the protection of a hospital. And this scenario, an unannounced air strike by an AC-130 definitely falls outside a hypothetical proportional attack.

but i am going to revert the change.  the reason why is that your movement of these words did change the meaning to something that is not, in my opinion, as factually accurate.  it is possible that  the vast majority of modern Mennonites do not consider """"The Ban"""", in and of itself, to be a pathological malpractice of church discipline, but the particular extreme application of it (that breaks up families, etc.) to be pathological.

"Better quality image of Wyatt Earp 

You uploaded a faded, blurry, B&W; image of Wyatt Earp some time ago, and I believe I've found a better quality and much higher resolution image from the collection of Western author Craig Fouts. There is a much smaller version here that shows more detail of Wyatt's coat, buttons, and vest that appear to match the features on your fuzzy B&W; version. 

I strongly believe they are two versions of the same image. I'm unsure how to replace your image on Commons, or if that's the right course of action. Please advise.

There is another image that some attribute to be Wyatt Earp, but the proof is sketchy. Thoughts?

"FrankTobia, I am sorry to say, but when you say the debt can be paid off you are, in fact wrong, because of one and only one thing, the application of interest by the federal reserve that is applied to the only money printed and in circulation. So that fact being true in all terms, The debt will never be able to be repaid to that which is the Federal Reserve Bank. If the debt were repaid, the money would cease to exist leaving no value in the monetary system. Frank, im sorry to say that the only banking book that is a valued resource is the book Modern Money Mechanics written in 1913 by the Federal Reserve Bank. Also, if you look at the shareholders of each Fed Bank they will all lead back to the same people, mostly located in Europe. By saying that the federal reserve bank/system does not work for profit, yet they apply interest to all loans derived from them as a source is really denying that you are credible in any way, and im not saying this as an insult, but the only reason of interest to be applied IS to make a PROFIT.

 """"Ants evolved..."""" as a statement of fact. 

I was wondering if we could have some references inserted after the second sentence of this article:
""""Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the mid-Cretaceous period between 110 and 130 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants.""""
Also, perhaps this statement should begin with the words """"Many experts believe..."""" or """"Evidence suggests..."""" etc. etc. rather than making a statement of fact since this is not an established fact.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 62.6.149.18   
 This brings up a good point that many things are stated as fact when it comes to science.  I think that people are only careful to state things the way you describe for things that haven't been statistically proven, which points out several flaws in the statement.  Evolution is well enough established as well as ants evolving from wasps, but them first appearing the the mid-Cretaceous period is hard to statistically prove.  I suppose this should be changed if I'm right, but I may not be.   ~talk 
The Cretaceous period is not a short duration even on an evolutionary scale. The sentence might appear precise if used with some small unit of time but putting it at somewhere between 110 to 130 million years is not exactly being very precise nor does it appear to be an arrogant statement of the available evidence.   
Very true.   ~talk 

 ants 

where do ants mate.
how long do they live.
do they have sex.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.7.207.156   

heh, viable question.  This spawned me to look over the reproduction part of the page and I did some rewriting.  It should be double-checked for good measure.  The article answers these well enough.  Ant's live varied amounts of time depending on many things.  Some workers only live a few months while some queens have been recorded to live more that 30 years.   ~talk 

 Common ants varieties 

There is almost no mention of Little Black Ants or Red Ants in this article. I see these ants everywhere and think that there should be more mention of them.
I'm not sure where you are but if it's Europe then those guys are probably Lasius niger and Myrmica rubra. They aren't common everywhere. '''[[User:Sean.hoyland|",0

Resolution Must be Made

I have been an observer of this article on Abbas Babei since the start of this conflict. I want to point out that we this issue needs to be solved otherwise both users will face blocks. Hooperag has offered a proposal that makes logical sense, Imagine this was the article of Barack Obama, we can't just say: """"Obama is notorious for his merciless treatment towards the minters of parliament who oppose his policies"""" (that's a totally random example, but whatever). It is more appropriate that if you wish to include a subjective statement like """"Babaei was """"notorious for his merciless treatment of the pilots and officers"""" considered disloyal to the new regime"""", you include some background info on who made that statement (add more context). The word """"merciless"""" is very subjective (opinion based) and if it is to be used you can't use it as if it was fact based, when you say """"Babaei was notorious for his merciless treatment of the pilots and officers"""" you are making a strong statement about him that makes it seem as if it is a 100% true fact that he was merciless.
 For these reasons I suggest we rephrase the sentence to be something along the lines of Hooperag's suggestion whish was to rephrase it something like this: """"According to the famous historian Tom Cooper whom interviewed various Iranian pilots, Abbas Babaei was considered """"merciless"""" in his treatment towards pilots disloyal to the new regime"""".

I wish to make it clear that I do not endorse any party, neither Hooperag nor the IP. However the proposal sounds reasonable and has been the only proposal to resolve this dispute so far.If this issue is not resolved with in the next 24 hours or so and the conflict continues, I will request to an admin that both users be blocked.134.39.77.59

"Malabarian Jewish - Nasrani tradition

Hi Veliath, you are right the page Nasrani should be redirected to the page Syrian malabar nasrani, or to the page Syriac Christianity.

it was originally redirected to Syriac Christianity but several vandals tampered with the pages on syrian malabar nasrani and st thomas christians. In fact there was an entire section on st thomas christians explaining its nasrani context which was systematically destroyed by vandals. Instead they wrote in factually inaccurate statements about the st thomas christians being marathas and telegu which is still there on the page Saint Thomas Christians.

here I post to you the passages destroyed by the vandals:

>>>>>

This article deals with the Saint Thomas Christian churches and denominations of the Nasrani people

The Saint Thomas Christians (Malayalam: Nasrani) are a group of Christians from the Malabar coast (now Kerala) in South India, who follow Syriac Christianity. The different groups and denominations within the St Thomas Christians together form the Nasrani people. Their tradition goes back to the very beginnings of first century Christian thought, and the seven churches that are believed to have been established by St. Thomas the Apostle.

Nasrani and Saint Thomas Christian tradition

The Nasranis are an ethnic people and in that sense a single community. However the Nasranis have various denominations as a result of Portuguese persecution. As an ethnic community they refer to themselves as Nasranis referring to the common cultural heritage and cultural tradition. However as a religious group they refer to themselves as the Mar Thoma Khristianis or in English as Saint Thomas Christians referring to the various and diverse religious denominations between them in terms of their religious tradition, despite a common ancestory of being the descendants of the early Mar Thoma church or Saint Thomas tradition of Christianity.

These first century churches, according to tradition, were, from north to south: Palayoor near Guruvayoor/Kunnankulam, Cranganore (believed to be the ancient Muziris of Pliny, and the Periplus, on the north bank of Periyar River today), Paravoor on the south side of Periyar, Gokkamangalam or Kokkamangalam, Niranam, Chayal or Nilakkal (the only inland church) and the Lakes or Kaayals, and finally Kollam. The visit of the Apostle Thomas to these places and to Mylapore on the East coast of India can be read in the Ramban Song of Thomas Ramban, set into modern writing c. 1500.

 Wikipedia Ambassador update! 

Hi! You're getting this message because you are or have been a Wikipedia Ambassador. A new term is beginning for the United States and Canada Education Programs, and I wanted to give you an update on some important new information if you're interested in continuing your work this term as a Wikipedia Ambassador. 

You may have heard a reference to a transition the education program is going through. This is the last term that the Wikimedia Foundation will directly run the U.S. and Canada programs; beginning in June, a proposed thematic organization is likely to take over organizing the program. You can read more about the proposal here.

Another major change in the program will take effect immediately. Beginning this term, a new MediaWiki education extension will replace all course pages and Ambassador lists. (See Wikipedia:Course pages and Help:Education Program extension for more details.) Included in the extension are online volunteer and campus volunteer user rights, which let you create and edit course pages and sign up as an ambassador for a particular course.

If you would like to continue serving as a Wikipedia Ambassador — even if you do not support a class this term — you must create an ambassador profile. If you're no longer interested in being a Wikipedia Ambassador, you don't need to do anything.

Please do these steps as soon as possible
First, you need the relevant user rights for Online and/or Campus Ambassadors. (If you are an admin, you can grant the rights yourself, for you as well as other ambassadors.) Just post your rights request here, and we'll get you set up as quickly as possible.

Once you've got the ambassador rights, please set up at a Campus and/or Online Ambassador profile. You can do so at:
Special:CampusAmbassadorProfile
Special:OnlineAmbassadorProfile

Going forward, the lists of Ambassadors at Special:CampusAmbassadors and Special:OnlineAmbassadors will be the official roster of who is an active Ambassador. If you would like to be an Ambassador but not ready to serve this term, you can un-check the option in your profile to publicly list it (which will remove your profile from the list).

After that, you can sign on to support courses. The list of courses will be at Special:Courses. (By default, this lists """"Current"""" courses, but you can change the Status filter to """"Planned"""" to see courses for this term that haven't reached their listed start date yet.)

As this is the first term we have used the extension, we know there will be some bugs, and we know the feature set is not as rich as it could be. (A big wave of improvements is already in the pipeline. And if you know MediaWiki and could help with code review, we'd love to have your help!) Please reach out to me (Sage Ross) with any complaints, bug reports, and feature suggestions. The basic features of the extension are documented at Wikipedia:Course pages, and you can see a tutorial for setting up and using them here.

Communication and keeping up to date
In the past, the Education Program has had a pretty fragmented set of communication channels. We're trying to fix that. These are the recommended places to discuss and stay up-to-date on the education program:
 The education noticeboard has become the main on-wiki location for discussion of the Education Program. You can post there about broad education program issues as well as issues with individual courses.
 The Ambassadors Announce email list is a very low-traffic announcements list of important information all Ambassadors need to be aware of. We encourage all Ambassadors (and other interested Wikipedians) to subscribe to the list; follow the instructions on the link to add your email address.
 If you use IRC regularly, or need to try to reach someone immediately, the  IRC channel is the place to find me and fellow Ambassadors.

Ambassador training and resources
We now have an online training for Ambassadors, which is intended to be both an orientation about the Wikipedia Ambassador role for newcomers and the manual for how to do the role. (There are parallel trainings for students and for educators as well.)

Please go through the training if you feel like you need a refresher on how a typical class is supposed to go and where t",0

 More information on Lenin's partial Jewish ancestry

 """"But of course the most sensitive """"nationality"""" [ethnicity] of all was Lenin's. In 1924, Lenin's sister Anna discovered that their maternal grandfather, Aleksandr Dmitrievich Blank, had been born Srul (Israel), the son of Moshko Itskovich Blank, in the shtetl Starokonstantinov [Old Konstantinov] in Volynia [Volhynia, now Ukraine]. When Kamenev found out, he said, """"I've always thought so,"""" to which Bukharin allegedly replied: """"Who cares what you think? The question is, what are we going to do?"""" What """"they,"""" or rather, the Party through the Lenin Institute, did was proclaim this fact """"inappropriate for publication"""" and decree that it be """"kept secret."""" In 1932 and again in 1934, Anna Ilinichna [Lenin's sister] begged Stalin to reconsider, claiming that her discovery was, on the one hand, an important scientific confirmation of the """"exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe"""" and """"the extraordinarily beneficial influence of its blood on the offspring of mixed marriages""""; and, on the other, a potent weapon against anti-Semitism """"owing to the prestige and love that [Vladimir] Ilich [Lenin] enjoys among the masses."""" Lenin's own Jewishness, she argued, was the best proof of the accuracy of his view that the Jewish nation possessed a peculiar """"'tenacity' in struggle"""" and a highly revolutionary disposition. """"Generally speaking,"""" she concluded, """"I do not understand what reasons we, as Communists, may have for concealing this fact. Logically, this does not follow from the recognition of the full equality of all nationalities."""" Stalin's response was an order to """"keep absolutely quiet."""" Anna Ilinichna did. The enemies of the regime were deprived of additional anti-Semitic ammunition"""" (pgs. 245–246)

 """"All advanced Jews supported assimilation, according to Lenin, but it is also true that many of the """"great leaders of democracy and socialism"""" came from """"the best representatives of the Jewish world."""" Lenin himself did [have Jewish ancestry], through his maternal grandfather, although he probably did not know it. When his sister, Anna, found out, she wrote to Stalin that she was not surprised, and """"this fact"""" was """"another proof of the exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe,"""" and that Lenin had always contrasted """"what he called its 'tenacity' in struggle with the more sluggish and lackadaisical Russian character.""""

""""This article includes a list of references, related reading or external links, but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations. Please improve this article by introducing more precise citations where appropriate.""""
This implies since I did not do in-line citations that the source material remains unclear and uncited, which is not true, though I understand Wikipedia's policy for standardization.
I do politely disagree that the word """"reference"""" by itself implies internal citation.  It does not.  Many professional journals' ending sections say """"References Cited"""", because """"References"""" by itself could mean simply works used but not cited anywhere.

"""similar statement was made about methane. I revised using """"widely considered"""" and """"purported"""" to be consistent with the idea of making the statements less absolute. I recognize weasel wording dilemmas, but seriously, this accurately portrays the qualitative information without misleading.  
Not necessary. The """"debate"""" over global warming is long over. The """"debate"""" was a farce created by the people who wanted to pretend that it didn't exist. There is no reason to cater to them. It's an insult to honesty and good science.  

If we're talking about this part:
It is the largest single source of fuel for the generation of electricity world-wide, as well as one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide emissions, which is considered the primary cause of global warming. Coal is extracted from the ground by coal mining, either underground mining or open pit mining (surface mining).
Then I don't see a problem with the global warming statement (except """"is considered"""" isn't specific), but saying it is """"one of the largest sources"""" is a weasel approach and sounds uninformed.  I will try to improve. - (talk • contribs) 

Amount of coal remaining
""""At the current global total energy consumption of 15 terawatt,[30] there is enough coal to provide the entire planet with all of its energy for 57 years.""""  This sentence is not supported, and ignores the growth in coal consumption trends, and is therefore unencyclopedic. Please support it per WP:RS or it will be removed shortly.   
Actually the only reason it is there is because someone else had the questionable statement that coal could provide the entire planet with all of its energy for 600 years, which was based on the typographical error that has been fixed. Feel free to remove. The source was simple arithmetic of the numbers given.

since when was this true. Oil and it's bi-products exceed by far any other source of energy when it comes to CO2 emmisions. Someone needs to change that statement.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.234.149.235   
The article does not say anywhere that coal is the largest source, it says it is one of the largest sources. Coal and oil are so close to each other that it is not easy to definitively say that either is the largest. Coal is also increasing much faster than oil, which is likely to be declining soon, if it hasn't already begun to decline.  

 Question about units 
The article sometimes measures coal consumption in tonnes (metric tons, one tonne = 1000 kg) and sometimes in tons, which could be either the short ton (2000 lb) or the long ton (2200 lb).  (See the section, """"Coal as Fuel"""".)   Is this change intentional or simply a typo?

 Understanding how to write Wikipedia articles 

You are obviously a single-purpose account, contributing only to Ashwant Dwivedi. The chances are high that either you are that person, you are related to him or you know him personally. In any event, you are pretty consistently making a mess of things at the article and I'm struggling to clean up the problems that you create. It's not a vendetta against you as a person, though.

There is little doubt in my mind that you would benefit from contributing to a wider range of articles in order to gain exposure to how we actually write things here. There is, for example, no rationale for including every news story that you can find about a person - especially not when they are trivial soundbites or repetitive information - nor is there any need to misrepresent sources by saying he is a """"Pacific Islands Diplomat"""" when, at best, he was a Fijian one. Things like this would be more obvious to you if you were not so constrained by your self-imposed concentration on one article. They would also be more obvious if you actually tried discussing things with other people and listening to what they say. I'm not always right but I am pretty experienced here and, as with anything in life, one key way to learn is to pick up things from those who have done it before.

I'm absolutely fed up with you at the moment, having given you a massive amount of rope over many months. But I'm quite happy to let bygones by bygones if only you can actually demonstrate a willingness to develop your skills here. The article will, in my opinion, be deleted anyway but there is much else here that you could work on in the future if you are prepared to spend a bit of time understanding how Wikipedia works. I rather suspect that we could use more decent contributors for Fiji-related subjects, for example. -   """,0

 TruSilver, Mediation, et al 

You can include the following statement as part of the mediation template if you wish: I'm not able to edit at the moment because jdchamp's admin shopping on WP:AIV finally paid off

While, obviously, I'm happy to accept any attempt to produce a better US Mobile Phone Companies template, I have concerns about the mediation proposal currently made on the subject.

My first concern is that mediation is supposed to be one of the tools used after discussion has failed on the relevant article's discussion page. At this stage, the only person who appears steadfastly unable to posit views other than attacks on editors and the fact he disagrees with them (a discussion requires that you express your reasons why, and address the reasons given by the people who have opposing views) is jdchamp. A better position at this point would be to ask jdchamp to participate fully in the discussion on the Talk: page of the appropriate article. I have contributed my views to that discussion page multiple times in the last two weeks, and given my reasons for my beliefs. I have done also said that I believe this is the most appropriate action at this stage to jdchamp, and to TruSilver, the admin jdchamp has involved in the dispute about what is going on there. Unfortunately, he has instead repeatedly posted the same comments over and over again to my talk: page, varying from false accusations of bad conduct from me, to expressing a willingness to discuss the article (yet, for some reason, not followed by actual action on his part.)

Mediation only makes sense if the parties involved continue to have a dispute that's based upon a genuine difference of opinion after proper discussion. While that different of opinion might exist at this point, unless jdchamp actually expresses his differing opinion fully (as in, gives valid reasons and challenges the reasons his opponents give with legitimate arguments), there has been no discussion, and therefore going on to the next stage of dispute resolution seems premature.

My second concern, and believe me I'm not happy in saying this, is that I have concerns about TruSilver as the mediator. Please do not take anything I say about this as assuming bad faith, I'm absolutely sure TruSilver thinks what he's done is right: but that said, I don't trust his judgment on this issue, based upon an on-going harassment campaign leveled against me by jdchamp. TruSilver has consistently misrepresented my actions while doing little to challenge jdchamp's on-going campaign. In particular:

 TruSilver has accused me of using his talk: page to continue my apparent argument with jdchamp. This is untrue: I have only ever posted once to TruSilver's talk: page, posting an apology for the fact he'd been involved in the mess and expressing my concern about it. After it became obvious that jdchamp was posting at the same time, and challenging my comments about my personal state of mind, I made the decision to not post there again.

 TruSilver has accused me of refusing to discuss jdchamp's differences with me, these differences concerning the Mobile Phone Companies template. This is also manifestly untrue. I have have been a full participant in the discussion on that page's Talk: page, even participating in a poll that I believe was posted prematurely, arguing why I believe what I do and suggesting compromise solutions that might suit all parties. I have removed jdchamp's vandalism of my page, which in some cases involved posting claims that he was """"willing to discuss"""" various issues, but were neither posted in the correct place, nor actual discussions of those issues.

 TruSilver has also leveled unnecessary personal attacks on me, accusing me of being dysfunctional, and of disruptiveness, edit warring, and incivility. With the possible exception of my (pretty justified) expression of frustration last night, nothing I've done of late fits the latter category, and the nearest thing I've done that comes to """"edit warring"""" consists of removing spam that has been repeatedly added to my page by jdchamp. The other comments are just plain insulting and wrong.

I've suffered a sustained campaign of harassment against me for most of the last 15 days. I asked for help, and instead the admin who put his hand up has essentially acted as an enabler for the person harassing me. Other than an ultimately unenforced threat to block jdchamp if he continued to spam WP:AIV with inappropriate demands I be blocked, nothing has been done to encourage jdchamp to tone down his behavior, and as he showed last night with three warnings, and multiple reverts on my Talk: page, his behavior remains as bad as ever.

While I'm sure TruSilver has acted in what he believes is the most appropriate way given the facts immediately available to him, I don't believe he h",0

"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE

a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?

b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. 

c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.

d. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.

e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.

Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.

So now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.

Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.

So GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.

I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.

While some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.

Now I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.

Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.

Now Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.

The fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.

9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.

2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.

So 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.

My site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. 

Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due",1

"""Forgetting about the in-depth meaning of the verse 34 in Islam==
From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An-Nisa,_34
In the Qur'an, verse 34 of Surah an-Nisa (abbreviated as 4:34) concerns the issue of marital relations in Islam. This verse is interpreted by some Muslims as giving women a degree of autonomy over their own income and property but obliging them to comply with the husband's wishes should they be congruent with Islamic principles and beneficial to the marriage. The verse is also interpreted to mean that men are also obliged to be responsible for maintenance of their female relatives.[1]

There are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original, and all vary to some extent. [2]Some Muslims, such as Islamic feminist groups, argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for domestic violence.[3] However, some have translated """"beat"""" as """"separate"""", as Arabic in its nature is a multi-meaning language, and as such no word has a fixed sole meaning.[4]

Ibn Abbas, a companion of Muhammad, wrote the earliest commentary on the Quran, and to this part he himself said this is only a light tap.[5] When asked about the light hitting, he said it refers to using a siwak (toothbrush). There are sources that say that Muhammad himself never hit a woman and forbade it.[6] Furthermore, Muhammad commented on this verse, where he said “a light tap that leaves no mark.”[7]

 Germany -  four entries 

You did not respond to my argument at all - please read it more carefully:

The IOC cannot be seen as the single authoritative source on this article, as the IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes only unofficial tables per single Games. Therefore this article is in violation with WP:No original research! The official source for the German National Olympic Committee (DOSB) does list the Olympic Medals for Germany from 1896 to 2012 → .

There were no official country codes before 1976: Only in 1976 did the IOC start to assign standardized codes. Before that time, the local Organizing Committees of each Olympic Games had chosen codes, often in the local language, resulting in a multitude of codes.

At the Games of 1956, 1960, and 1964 the German team was simply known as """"Germany"""" and the usual country code of (GER) was used. Yet, the IOC code EUA is currently applied in hindsight in the IOC medal database, without further explanation given. 

Yugoslavia does not exist anymore as a country - the FRG does. The (FRG) Federal Republic of Germany did not cease to exist. It was a simple code change, same country, same NOC. NO alternate NOCs: EUA, FRG and GER have always had the same German National Olympic Committee (NOC) recognized in 1895, same NOC President (Willi Daume, 1960–1993), same Olympic Committee located in Frankfurt - only the codes have changed. Germany is officially still called (FRG), the Federal Republic of Germany - it's the same country, with the same NOC since the first modern Games held in 1896 - only the GDR had a separate NOC, because it was a separate country (although not recognized by Germany). """"West Germany"""" did never exist, and is nothing more than the common English name used for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG. The """"enlarged"""" Federal Republic of Germany (known simply as """"Germany"""") is thus the continuation of the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany - the very same country, with the same National Olympic Committee since 1895.

Jayjg, is there any edit to this article you would accept? What are your objections to clarifying ethnic vs. religious definitions of """"Jews""""? The article is currently confusing as to which is which, and it would help to clarify that JfJ means ethnic Jews. I think in the case Mackan points out, """"many"""" is appropriately used-many Jewish groups do see JfJ that way, but certainly not all (I would imagine there are plenty of Jewish groups without any official position on JfJ.) Also, most religions are rather fluid and change over time, and there is often debate over interpretation. It is, therefore, not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact (Jews don't believe in Jesus as Messiah? What about Messianic Judaism?) Of course, religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism (""""my way is the correct one"""" type of thinking), so sometimes it's difficult to see debates to that as valid. WP:WEASEL does not object to ever using """"many"""" or """"most"""" or the like as qualifiers, it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing. What we have here is a lot of sourcing, which does not, however, show that all Jews object to JfJ (as I explained above, that would be effectively impossible). It does, of course, show that """"many"""" do (I wouldn't even object to """"almost all"""" or """"most""""), but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of WP:NPOV (JfJ's assertion that it is Jewish must be treated as plausible), it is impossible that all Jewish organizations disagree-as JfJ doesn't!

"""::You'll have to do it.  Ziplocal is protected  I can't start an article or move anything there.  I think most of the """"ZipLocal, inc"""" article is incorporated in the """"User:Misterkellas/ZipLocal"""" article.

But that was seven years before Tamec was renamed Zip411 then bought by redCity, then that company was renamed Ziplocal, then that company was bought out, then that company was bought out and in the meantime a completely new company renamed itself Ziplocal then traded stock in exchange for the US parts of the yellow page search information.  I think the financial ramifications of the Corporate Bureau's proceedings were minor enough that trying to dump in two paragraphs about stuff that basically happened to some other company a decade ago would sort of be a major digression from the rest of the article.  That's my opinion  I have absolutely no connection to this Ziplocal company, though, so whatever you want to do with it.

Another likely conflict of interest matter with respect to Rick Warren and Saddleback Church

Hi Steve. I don't mean to dump gasoline on an already difficult situation, but you might say that duty calls.

 The contributions list for CarverM indicates that he has almost exclusively been editing articles that are in some way connected with Saddleback Church, including Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Life (Warren's book), The Purpose Driven Church (also a book by Warren), Doug Fields (a pastor at Saddleback), and Richard Abanes (a lay minister and former staffer at Saddleback).

 There is a rather remarkable mockup of a version of the Saddleback Church page in CarverM's user space, here. It is written as a promotional piece and certainly wouldn't qualify as an actual article. Why is it there?

 I'll note that the username CarverM bears a resemblance to the name Mark Carver. Carver was at one time (2006) described as """"a top aide to mega-church pastor and best selling author Rick Warren."""" Throwing """"Mark Carver"""" and """"Rick Warren"""" into Google yields 290 hits that I'll hesitate to characterize, but there are strong indications that CarverM is potentially not just another editor, and may be tightly connected with Warren.

How did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? 

Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant """"to knock, as on a door"""" up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like """"you're"""" and """"your"""", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier """"gay"""", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex """"gay anal sex"""", but that's really irrelevent. 

I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, """"splash"""", from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person's face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it.

""":::::::::: Tim, firstly I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline, and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive diffence between, say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions, or between the Chinese and U.S. jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets.

 Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in, say, Paris or Toulouse, even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. I appreciate that the situation in the U.S. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. To give an example, the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech. 

 To give another example, in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn't have an office in London, even if it had offices in every other big city. In fact all of the very top tier UK firms (DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them, despite its size) have just one UK office, in London, although they have other offices overseas. 

 Saying that DLA has """" has 69 offices across the United States, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Thailand, China, ..."""" would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. We could fall back on using descriptions like """"in major financial centres"""" or """"in major commercial centres"""" or """"in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres"""" but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness, imprecision and even original research.

 I do accept that DLA, with 69 offices, is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. However I do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it, and should be included as much as possible.

"I am the author of Qutbi Bohra article. I had written this article just as an informative content for wikipedia and my intentions were to update the information regarding a new sect that was formed. I am a writer and have written many articles in different media. I love to write. I came to know of Wikipedia editing very recently through a friend when he showed me how wikipedia works and editors can make contributions. It was a time when i had heard of Qutbi Bohra and when i searched the internet i got evidence regarding the same in 3 newspapers mentioning it and a newsletter. This satisfied the noteablity ans verifyablity condition of the article. I gathered information regarding the sect from the community members whom i know and have recorded my discussion with them, with their permission. Further more i also got information regarding some past acts of Khuzaima Qutbuddin which were defamatory in nature but would prove the formation of the sect. But i did not use it as per the rules of wikipedia. I have written the entire article from third person point of view, as usually written for publications and have provided supportive evidence in most of the cases and due to frequent coercing by Ftutocdg i have also written a complete article,'succession issue' to explain the actual situation which Ftutocdg is trying to hide in his bid to get the Qutbi Bohra article removed. The reason that he is giving is just his point of view that he is trying to impose on the article. He has regularly done vandalism to this article and also has done the same to many Dawoodi Bohra articles along with some other editors in his group. As mentioned by Ftutocdg you can check the contribution i have made to Wikipedia, i have done all my edits with thorough study and reliable references. I would also like to suggest you to please look into the contribution of Ftutocdg and his group of editors they have just created a lot of chaos using the dark side of the very principles of Wikipedia the helps develop an article. I am sorry to say but i have spend more time giving explaination to Ftutocdg than write or edit an article. Whenever i login i first check whether he has vandalised the article or not. I have applied for protection in comments while reverting but i dont know the actual procedure involved. As regards your taggings i am very new to Wikipedia and i will require the help of experienced and well established administrators like you to guide me in my efforts.

The White Tree incident
In your article concerning this incident you list that there were 2 nooses found on the tree.  However, most news websites claim there were 3 nooses (CNN and The Toronto Star)

 

 Apparently the reason some people are so eager to claim it was two nooses rather than three nooses is because traditionally, in the Klan, the hanging of three nooses stands for """"K - K - K.""""  

 The timeline published by the Jena Times—which uses much non-neutral wording—says that there were two nooses.  My default assumption would be that a newspaper is a reasonable and generally NPOV source.  From it's own website, the Jena Times appears to be small operation (primarily by writer/editor/publisher Sammy J Franklin since January 1, 1968).  Does anyone know more about Franklin, the paper's past, and/or its position in the community? — • TALK •

I am sure once the presidential race is over, there would be no such argument of the deletion of this article whatsoever, and people discussing about this speech would be doing so solely because of its content, its linguistic delivery, and other reasons solely for historical and educational reasons.

Today there are 350 million google hits for the 'I Have a Dream' speech [3] and 20 million for 'Martin Luther King' [4] but only 2.3 million hits for 'I Have a Dream Martin Luther King' search, [5], suggesting that many people especially in non-American countries perhaps would know the speech but not even knowing who said it in the first place. By contrast there are only 1 million hits for 'A More Perfect Union Barack Obama' [6] 722 thousand hits for 'Barack Obama Speech on Race' [7], but 30 million hits for 'Barack Obama' [8]. My argument is that I implore Wikipedia users to please let go of this dilemna and constant debate of trying to keep Wikipedia non publicity and solely information, because by deleting articles some Wikipedia editors find is adding publicty to one person named Barack Obama, they are also deleting something which is so much potentially informational for many other billions of people who just want information on this particular speech.

Vandalism warning
One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

 Note 

The current lead implies Israeli aggression against Hamas by stating that Israel killed several Hamas members in Khan Yunis on July 6, and Hamas retaliated with rockets. I have been trying to seek consensus for including the Israeli claim that Hamas started firing rockets circa June 30 at DRN. However, it may also be worth noting that Israel maintains the Hamas members killed in Khan Yunis accidentally blew themselves up in one of their tunnels: """"Hamas has vowed revenge for what it saw as Israel's deadliest attacks in which six Palestinian militants died, though Israel denied any involvement...The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted """"terror sites and concealed rocket launchers"""" in the enclave, but had not hit the southern Gaza area of Rafah, on the Egyptian border, where the Hamas gunmen died. Military spokesman Lerner said the militants had died when explosives went off in a tunnel that Israel had bombed several days ago, fearing gunmen planned to use it to try and penetrate into Israel."""" It turns out the same account was given by The New York Times: """"When Hamas militants entered the damaged tunnel a day or so later, they apparently set off explosives there...Hamas blamed Israel, escalating the hostilities that grew into the current confrontation."""" Hamas' claim that seven of its members were killed by an Israeli airstrike is not an assertion Wikipedia should parrot uncritically.  """,0

 Role in Russian civil war 

That section states the Bolsheviks won that war in the late 1919. That is completely wrong by any historic books and textbooks. Officially the war ended in 1922, but there was still fighting going on in the Russian Far East. That is what the Soviet historical textbooks say. For some reason the war with the Ukraine is being perceived as the Civil war in Soviet times and it seems that the same trend exist today as well. That is also wrong. Ukraine was a recognized state by the Soviet Russia as well as by the other numerous countries. That was a straight aggresion against the Ukrainian republic, following an unbelievable slaughtering of population in Ukraine by bolsheviks (Kyiv and Podillia still remembered). In 1920 Ukraine united with Poland to stop the bolshevik bandits. The Soviet textbooks state that it was an intervention of the """"White"""" Polish burgouis, relating it to the Russian white movement which is way off. 

Not on the subject of the section, but Stalin should be recognized as the enemy of the world and, at least, should be on the same page with Adolf Hitler. Stalin was way more evil. Not all of his wrongdoings are uncovered, but the one that already are known can easily convict the guy. His name should be cursed for the eternity and humanity needs to learn to avoid the next Stalin.   

Define """"convict."""" What exactly is Stalin guilty of? Killing off men and women that he believed threatened the unity and safety of his nation? Knights did that all the time. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union became incredibly well-developed, albeit uncaring towards others. They even beat us in the space race. I'm sure all of our wonderful presidents would have thought that would happen with the amazing ideals of wonderful democracy. Luna RainHowLCry

(2)  The Quackbuster manipulation of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia: 

Wikipedia is an odd thing.  It is made up of a so-called """"volunteer system.""""  Several years ago, a team of quackbusters infiltrated various levels of the Wikipedia operation, and are now entrenched in the middle, and lower, level volunteer management system.  If you try and put any positive information about advanced medicine, or the problems of US health care, on Wikipedia, or change false or misleading information the quackbusters have installed, you will fail.  You will be blocked from further """"editing"""" and the pages of Wikipedia will now carry information about what a """"terrible person you are.""""  The only way to have ANY influence over what Wikipedia says about  subject is to approach them with a legal threat letter at the highest levels.  Nothing else works.  Even that has problems, for Wikipedia management operates on a financial shoestring, and apparently has no ability to police its own encyclopedia.  Unfortunately, people use the encyclopedia - and they get very bad information about health care.

Below is a paragraph from the editor’s section of Wikipedia.  The editor, here, is discussing the problem of the quackbuster slime, acting to control the information flow on Wikipedia - and what to do about it.  so you understand the abbreviation POV stand for Point of View, and NPOV stands for No Point of View, which Wikipedia wants.  The part in red is for emphasis. Read this:

I guess it depends on what purpose the External Links section serves. Do the links have to serve the NPOV interests of the article or can the links section be a place where specific points-of-view can have a chance to be expressed? As it is now, the chiropractic link section is broken down into Advocacy and Critiques. I think that this warns the researcher that they are leaving the NPOV environment that Wikipedia tries to provide and will be entering a POV external site.

If these links are truly just linking to the page for marketing reasons and don't serve a primary function of adding to the knowledge-base, I would then say to axe them. I haven't checked every critical link, but they do seem to link to essays or research on pages that don't directly try to sell you anything (other than their POV). If they are all offering the same POV with no really distinguishing differences, then they should be reduced in number.

The soapbox point is interesting. These are external links so it would seem that Wikipedia is not being directly exploited as a soapbox. However, the abundance of critical links could be seen as an attempt to present bias... using the amount of negative criticisms to invoke a negative POV about chiropractic. My solution up until now has been to add to the advocacy links to balance out the criticism. You can certainly try to delete the critical links and claim NPOV but I can almost guarantee you that you be quickly (and improperly) accused of """"vandalism"""" by one of three specific chiroskeptics who police the chiropractic page all day long as far as I can tell. They love to throw """"vandalism"""" accusations around - and usually are vastly overstating the matter. That being said, I have suggested a """"disarming"""" strategy, where both sides would remove links in a balanced way, but my suggestion was met with silence.

Now as far as the link farming goes. Yes, virtually all of the critical sites are linked together through the SkepticRing, Anti-Quackery Ring, Chiropractic Subluxated Ring and other ways fashioned specifically for the purpose of boosting Search Engine ranking. A lot of those sites are operated by Stephen Barrett and his buddy Sammy Homola - Chirobase.org, Quackwatch.org, and NCAHF. They're three organizations all saying the same thing. What's really slimy is that they state opinions then reference their sister-sites support to that opinion. A lot of the links are operated or moderated by Fyslee (one of the three chiroskepics users who regularly accuse people of vandalism for removing links to his sites). Check out his userpage to see which sites he operates and moderates for. These chiroskepitics are working together to actively employ search engine tricks such as artifically boosting Google ranking by adding external links to their sites all over Wikipedia. I have documented this. Their goal is for a researcher curious about chiropractic to encounter their anti-chiropractic sites first on a Google search. Given these organizations' objective, I can certainly understand why they would want to do this. Unfortunately, the tactics that they employ are objectionable to both Google and Wikipedia. Hopefully these organizations will get wise to the chiroskeptic ring and ban their sites.

I'm not sure what to do in the meantime. One thing that I would like to suggest is that a website is linked to only once in the external links section. As",0

 US emissions description is totally contentless now. 

The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US """"partial zero emissions vehicle"""" could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.

Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.

Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad """"20mpg"""" reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.

"And now for some... amusement 

After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

Until this edit yesterday, which smuggled in some changes under a misleading edit summary, the map/diagram simply used standard three-letter abbreviations for all the countries included, generating the common name of the country (including China and Taiwan), a link to the relevant country page and a flag icon.

The bid to change that - and introduce different formats with separate flag icons and name-links for China and Taiwan and also full-form names for the two of them - was, reasonably enough (and entirely correctly in my view), reverted.

Lanier see """"Trinitarian Idealism,"""" pp 135-147, esp. Syllabus II, p 136

1) First of all, none of the sources cited say anything about the three context """"forming a triunism or trinity"""". None of them. Your claim that this is """"According to orthodox Jewish eschatology and Christian eschatology, and secular historians and scholars"""" is completely unsubstantiated by the citations given.
2) Secondly, all three of the sources you cite are sources which you have been told repeatedly not to use because they are not WP:RS. One of them is predictably yet another link to the website on which your own work is advertised, with your idiosyncratic view. So you're not adhering to Wiki policy, and you're deliberately disobeying what you've been asked to do on many previous occasions. Your edit here is a typical example of your WP:SYNTH and WP:OR.
3) Thirdly, you haven't ever provided a single quotation from Bruce or Reed which shows they support your idiosyncratic """"triunisms"""" idea. Your claim that they do is completely unsupported by the works of theirs which you cite, and is another example of your WP:SYNTH and WP:OR. You can't point to something they've written and claim that because you interpret it as supporting your view, that it supports your view. That's not how Wikipedia works.

After the Christian population of the bishoprics of Skopje and Ohrid voted in 1874 overwhelmingly in favour of joining the Exarchate (Skopje by 91%, Ohrid by 97%), the Bulgarian Exarchate became in control of the whole of Vardar and Pirin Macedonia. The Exarchate was also represented in the whole of southern Macedonia. The “Macedonian Question,” became especially prominent after the Balkan wars in 1912-1913 and the subsequent division of Macedonia between the three neighboring states, followed by tensions between them over possession of Macedonia. This partitioning of the territory had a tremendous influence on the development of the Macedonian national identity.Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe - Southeast Europe (CEDIME-SE)MINORITIES IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE - Macedonians of Bulgaria, pg. 6  In order to legitimise their claims, each of these countries tried to 'persuade' the population into allegiance. Paul Fouracre. Cambridge Encyclopedia of Medieval History Some scientists argue also that the use of any ethnic definition of the Slav speekers in Macedonia during the 19th and early 20th Century did not refer to ethnicity, but rather a socio-occupational description. The Slav population in Macedonia tended to be Christian peasents, farming folk,The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World - Loring M. Danforth, ISBN13: 978-0-691-04356-2 attested socio-political circumstances, such as in what language the local schooling was provided, or whether the local church aligned itself with Serbian, Bulgarian or Greek Orthodoxy. The majority were under the influence of the Bulgarian Exarchate and its education system, thus in the early 20th century and beyond, were regarded as Bulgarians, whatever that meant.(Brubaker 1996: 153; Ruhl 1916: 6; Perry in Lorrabee 1994: 61)The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica.

To Inquire into the causes and Conduct OF THE BALKAN WARS, PUBLISHED BY THE ENDOWMENT WASHINGTON, D.C. 1914  However, the key events in the formation of a distinctive Macedonian identity emerged during the first half of the 20th century in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 when the Bulgarian Exarchate discontinued its activity in most of the region. The process strengthed especially following the Second World War, with the withdrawal of Bulgarian authorities from Macedonia, the establishment of Yugoslav Macedonian Republic and the signing of Bled agreement. With the founding of the People's Republic of Macedonia in 1944 as part of SFRY, a sense of a Macedonian national identity gained strength and became systematised.(Bell 1998:193) The Yugoslav government began a policy of removing any Bulgarian influence and cementing the Macedonian identity.Europe since 1945.

You wrote:
The term proto-Protestants has been in use now for quite a long time to describe religious movements sharing the beliefs very similar or even identical (as far as key issues are concerned) to those professed by Protestants of the 16the century. 

I was unable to find this definition online can you post a link.

Continued:
There clearly is a group of such movements, including the Waldensians, the Lollards, the Hussites, but also in the earlier centuries, the Vigilantians, the Aerians, the Helvidians, the Jovinians, whose views were identical to those of many Protestants.

I don't know that it is all that clear. Identical? Aerians insisted that the observance of Easter was a Jewish superstition and they fasted on Sundays. Not very Protestant. The Vigilantians argued against the veneration of relics, the sending of alms to Jerusalem, the rejection of earthly goods and the attribution of special virtue to the unmarried state, especially in the case of the clergy. No mention of the Bible, no mention of justification, nothing else Protestant. All that is known about Helvidius is that he did not believe in the Virgin Mary.  That doesn't exactly make him a Protestant. Identical is laughable - there is no evidence to back up such an assertion. Wikipedia is not about truth, it is for fact that can be cited with recognized secondary sources of evidence.

You went on:
This becomes even more obvious when we consider the fact, that the Waldensians, the Lollards and the Hussites joined the Reformation and often mixed with various Protestant groups. The Waldensian Church, still existing in Italy, is considered a Protestant group and not a sect, as User:Secisek tries to imply. This is because all key beliefs the Waldensians have professed since the 12th century are common to most Protestant groups and are different from those professed by sects considered heretical by both the Catholics and the Protestants.

Whoa, I did not imply they were a sect, I wrote that they were. I intended no offense with that word. The Waldensians were a sect, and they revised their doctrine at the Reformation to conform to the new Protestant thinking. This is taken from the Waldensian's article:

""""In 1532 they met with German and Swiss Protestants and ultimately adapted their beliefs to those of the Reformed Church. Moreover, the Waldensian absorption into Protestantism led to their transformation from a sect on the edge of Catholicism that shared many Catholic beliefs into a Protestant church adhering to the theology of John Calvin, which differed much from the beliefs of Peter Waldo. From that moment the Church became the Italian branch of Reformed churches.""""

This contradict your assertion:
The Waldensians have never altered their key beliefs, they are considered Protestants and still they had existed for over 3 centuries before the proper Protestants and the Reformation. Many scholars have used the term proto-Protestants in their articles, although there do exist historians who argue that the term should not be in use for various reasons.

The fact is, they have altered their key beliefs - that is what made them Protestant.

The problem is, however, that the Catholic historians often argue against the term to show that Protestants appeared only in the 16th century, while before them, there was just one Church of Christs and many small sects. For this reason even Waldensians, now considered a part of the Protestant Church even by the Church of Rome, are called a sect by Catholic historians. This dychotomy is absurd, as it implies that the Waldensians were at first a sect and then a Protestant group, while they have never changed their beliefs in the course of History. If the Waldensians are Protestants now, and they maintain the same views they professed in the late 12th century it means, that they have always been Protestants, even when the term had not been in use.

They have not maintained the same views, read the Waldensian article. They were still taking Roman Catholic Eucharist until the time of the Reformation, with the belief that the validity of the sacraments depends on the worthiness of the priest performing them. Seven sacrament is not very Protsestant.  

I am not a Roman Catholic, nor do I care what Roman Catholic historians argue, although I am sure RC historians would at least acknowledge the existance of the Orthodox and Oriental Churches rather then maintain that there was """"just one Church"""". The facts are quite clear - Protestants appeared in the 16th century for a variety of historical and cultural reasons that existed at that moment in history. They could not have appeared before that moment and it mental gerrymandering or wishful thinking to believe otherwise. I will be happy to discuss this further, but it seem that the",0

Review
Book of the Year Award 2010 Nominee
FROM COMMONS TO LORD'S Volume 1 1700-1750 
Ian Maun 

From a statistical and historical perspective one of the most important books of 2009 was the first volume of Ian Maun's series on eighteenth century cricket. In fact, after delving into this rich assemblage of material, published in association with both the MCC and the ACS, it is probably true to say that this is the most important book of the past few decades. This claim is based on the fact that the author, who works at Exeter University, has meticulously unearthed many new details as well as hitherto unknown matches from the early 1700s. 

This book draws heavily from newspapers, journals, letters and other documents housed in national and provincial collections, as well as other resources not generally available to, or used by, the majority of cricket historians, including history books, dictionaries, novels, plays and poems. Moreover, this is not a reworking of other writers contributions, as the author is not afraid to question previously published material or other works which have hitherto been accepted by historians as being chapter and verse on 18th century cricket. Indeed, this book includes more than 200 references to cricket which, until now, have never before been published whilst several errors and omissions have been carefully corrected and filled. One can only wonder at what further riches lie in the next three volumes of this series. 

The work stemmed several years ago from the author’s desire to understand the relationship of the Hambledon Club’s exploits to the cricket which had preceded those illustrious days. What started out as a series of notes trying to disentangle what was fact and what was fiction has metamorphosed into a work which provides a sharper and more complete picture of the noble game than previously achieved by many previous authors as well as some of the great scholars of cricket history.

This period of tricorn hats, curved bats and two-stump wickets is vividly brought back to life by the year-by-year listing of references, supported by the accompanying notes and the series of beautifully reproduced images. As such, it is not a book which will be slavishly read time and again from cover to cover. Instead, it is a fantastic reference book with, as one would expect from someone with a strong academic background, a superb set of footnotes and bibliographical tools. 

Indeed, in his accompanying notes, the publisher claims that this book “will assuredly become the premier recourse for anybody interested in early and 18th century cricket history.” I would unhesitatingly venture one step further and suggest that in years to come, the author’s name will be spoken of in the same breath as Haygarth, Waghorn or Buckley. High praise indeed, but so richly deserved.

I'll confess to being a bit lost among these theological discussions. I can say that we should include all significant points of view, even Geaves'. If some say that Rawat had a Sant Mat lineage, while other say he had an Advait Mat or Radhasoami lineage, then all of those views should be included, in proportion to their prominence, and we shouldn't take sides either directly or by implication. Note that each of those linked topics has an article of its own, so we don't need to discuss them at length in this article. Anything we do say about them should be relevant to Rawat himself.

Um, yeah, sorry about the wall o' text... I get a bit carried away with this stuff.

The problem with the whole """"505%"""" thing is that 5x the insolation at the top of the atmosphere does not necessarily equate to 5x the insolation at the surface.  The effect the atmosphere has as far as where that energy ends up  scattered back into space, absorbed and reradiated in the upper atmosphere, trapped near the surface via a runaway greenhouse effect, etc.  is huuuuuuuge.  We don't know anything about the atmosphere, so it's not really as cut and dried as you might initially think.

Macedonians
Hi Realek, sorry if I didn't awnser yesterday, but you seemed a bit angry with me, so I decided that letting some time pass would have helped to calm all down. Now, passing to your last message, let me thank you for having clearly stated your objections. Now I'll try to awnser your points: 
Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia. The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed.
The first part was already there: """"Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia."""" As for the second part, """"The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed"""", I admit responsability; but I only wanted to mean that the birth of the SRoM represented the completition of the formation of a Macedonian national identity, not that Macedonians were """"invented"""" in 1945; an identity that freed itself of the ambiguities and contraddictions that were present in the fathers of Macedonian nationalism, like Misirkov and Delchev. If you want to put it better, feel free to do it.
Greek Macedonians are actually an ethnic group
I think you know quite well how I feel about this, as I clearly stated it in the talk page. But sometimes compromises are necessary; and after all, it's only stated that """"Greek Macedonians"""" live in Macedonia, not that they represent an ethnic group. And it does seem that the Greeks who live in Macedonia call themselves Macedonians,like those that live in Crete call themselves Cretans.
Tito separated Yugoslav Macedonia from Serbia
I think you must have wrongly interpreted this; I simply thought it meant that Macedonia was administratively separated from Serbia, under whose control in the Kingdom of Serbia before and that of Yugoslavia after it had been
There was no resentment towards the Bulgarian repression during the beginning of the Bulgarian occupation of the region, by removing that sentance.
Honestly the removal of this sentence slipped me, but I can't help noting now that the statement is unsourced. Personally, I don't know how Macs reacted to Bulgarian occupation. After all, my field is ancient, not modern Macedonia.
In conclusion remember that I only edited Telex's text, without adding new statements.
In my view, the best way to awnser to those editors who say that the Macedonians were invented in 1945 is in collecting good, strong sources. For example, to make some names, Danforth's Macedonian Question or Poulton's Who are the Macedonians.
As for Telex, you should remember that it's a wiki rule to not bite newbies. Telex is a very recent that is among us only since April 25, and is clearly not a nationalist, but a honest editor who is striving to be NPOV. If you believe to see bias in his editing, remember that every single editor here (me included, obviously) has his POV, and it's a pure illusion that we can kept them out of our editing. This is why wikipedia has great possibilities: because our bias are emended by the work of others. Sorry this was so long. Ciao ;-) """,0

"""Note from the subject book::

Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta:
«And he did not have to flatter anyone, support anyone, or manage anyone's life. His mind and intelligence were free and dwelt constantly on his service to his spiritual master. He saw his present circumstances as a preparation for a greater task before him. Despite his advanced age, he felt that he had barely begun his work. Yet he felt confident. He had his vision of a world association of devotees. It was not an idle dream, although he was not certain how it would all come about. But he knew his duty. For the present he would go on describing his vision, the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters, in articles and books. But as soon as possible he should go to the West. Westerners, he had concluded, were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding; more than his fellow Indians, they would be open to the message of the Absolute Truth. He knew he should go. And he would go-if Kṛṣṇa desired.

Abhay lived frugally in Vṛndāvana, keeping exact account of every expenditure and every receipt. He carefully kept a ledger, just as if he were running a substantial business, even though his purchases were only a little milk, a few vegetables, charcoal for cooking, bus rides, and his major expenditure, postage.
-
Abhay composed a Bengali poem, """"Vṛndāvana-bhajana."""" Its opening stanzas were especially self-reflective and personal.

I am sitting alone in Vṛndāvana-dhāma.
In this mood I am getting many realizations.
I have my wife, sons, daughters, grandsons, everything,
But I have no money, so they are a fruitless glory.
Kṛṣṇa has shown me the naked form of material nature;
By His strength it has all become tasteless to me today.
Yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ:
""""I gradually take away all the wealth of those upon whom I am merciful."""" 
How was I able to understand this mercy of the all-merciful?»

Śrīla Prabhupāda is here in the ADVANCED AGE of 61– his supporters, friends and family left him broke.

Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta another reference:

«Prabhupāda's most ambitious literary undertaking, the completion of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, was to be no less than sixty volumes. He had begun in India in 1959, and all along he had been aware that he was attempting a gigantic task at an advanced age. Now Kṛṣṇa was giving him opportunities both for writing Vedic literatures and for travelling, and he was working at an amazing pace.»

Prabhupāda is here in ADVANCED AGE of 63 starting to write his Bhaktivedanta Purports – I guess in India it was an advanced age, but not in Florida.

""""nina phunsta"""" is associated with IF Records so there is a clear conflict of interest. 

A Google search for nina phunsta adequately demonstrates the above claim when reading through various posts on forums. 
Various forum profiles of nina phunsta contain the IF Records website in their signature. This is in contrast to previous claims that Andrez Bergen is a former writing colleague on nina phunsta's talk page .

As for the Little Nobody page:
 ^ Wayward Seafarers Review, Chris Downton. 3D World, June 2008.
This review does not exist on the 3D World website, the link is to the homepage of that website. There are no other external links under references that can be used to verify any of the text on the Wikipedia page. Some of the articles cited are recent so a link to the article on the web version of the newspapers should be provided. The ABC artist profile is the only reliable source and is dated, from 2003 and refers only to a local dance music scene. Many of the links under External Links are broken. 

Much of the information appears to be fabricated as it does not appear anywhere else when performing a Google search. 
Colloquial language in background information: """"Website TABLittle Nobody's dodgy MySpace site"""". This indicates that the article is largely a puff piece. 

Thus, articles related to Little Nobody and IF Records should be removed for:
1. not meeting notability guidelines; and
2. being written in an advertising format
3. large amounts of unverifiable information
  

 (1) No admin has denied the speedy yet but (although it was tagged 12 or more hours ago) neither has anyone deleted it.  I agree that it's spam and deserves deletion.  The problem may be that, promotional puffery that it is, it's been around for so long, but that can cut both ways.  —   ✉

He served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, along with his two older half-brothers. In 1783, after the war, he married Jane Cook; she was born in 1759 in Christian County, Kentucky, to William Cook and his wife Sarah Simpson.

 Response about noone in particular 

I do find it suspicious why it took an entire month for """"he who should not be mentioned"""" to comment.

To repeat what I'd already said at ANI, I am not alleging a topic ban breach, except perhaps under the """"broadly construed"""" wording. I am stating that, based on the manner of this series of reverts on The Automobile Association , followed by this 'rewrite', and based on the fact that HighKing has yet to make any associated comment at Talk:The Automobile Association, instead choosing to treat this as an issue of """"vandalism"""", HighKing has inarguably ignored the warnings Cailil gave him when he re-enacted the BI topic ban about his future conduct. Those can still be seen on his own talk page under the """"Removals of the term British Isles (again)"""" section on HighKing's talk page, so he has no excuse for not remembering them. You're going to have to read that whole thread to get the picture, but it shows quite clearly that Cailil was quite explicit in what he expected from HighKing going forward, in addition to simply adhering to the topic ban: he must stop edit warring and start discussing, he must stop this behaviour of policing terminology on Wikipedia, he must stop introducing (and maintaining by reverts) innacuracies (his altered version of the quote is not in the source, so is clearly innacurate). Basically, he was telling him to just go and find something completely different to do than this, because it is of no benefit to the project. What he has done instead, is just transfer his focus from policing usage of the term 'British Isles' on Wikipeda, to policing the term 'Republic of Ireland', while mainaining the same bad behaviours - edit warring, lack of discussion, misrepresentation of sources, misuse of guidelines/policy, etc, etc. As an administrator, the onus is on you to step in and stop it. Five years is long enough to be still getting away with this sort of WP:TE in the way you have so far allowed him to in this case. You need to block HighKing now until he gives cast iron assurances he understands why Cailil wrote those things on his talk page, and tells you precisely how he proposes to avoid it in future. That's it. As far as evidence goes, short of me pulling out direct quotes of what Cailil said to HighKing, I don't see what more you need to see, to do what is required of you.   """,0

"Factual errors in Nelson and Pearson 

The egregious factual errors in Pearson's book on Oxford's wardship and finances are explicated in detail in Christopher Paul's article in The Oxfordian cited in the references for this article.  Nelson openly admits he merely followed Pearson concerning Oxford's wardship and finances, thus compounding Pearson's errors.  There are also a myriad of factual errors on topics other than Oxford's wardship and finances in Nelson's book.  And although Nelson does not always openly credit his source, even a cursory examination of his book establishes that he largely follows Ward's earlier biography of Oxford.  In consequence, the only accurate source of factual information on Oxford's wardship and finances and a number of other topics is primary source documents, and an earlier Wikipedia editor approved my citation of them at the time I edited the article some months ago.  These primary source documents themselves, along with transcripts of hundreds of other documents mentioning Oxford, are readily available in modern-spelling transcripts at www.oxford-shakespeare.com/documents.html, so no user of Wikipedia need go to an archive to determine what the primary source documents actually say.

 Vandalism by 99.44.204.232. Please stop it  

Would 99.44.204.232 stop vandalising this article.  People have invested a lot of time and effort to improve this article  it doesn't help if you keep vandalising it.  In future if you have something positive to add to this article please discuss it in the talk page.  I have to spend hours undoing what you have just done.  Citing several sources (some of which are unreliable) about one particular issue which has already been addressed and sourced with notable sources is one thing, deleting edits with notable sources and then copying and pasting those sources to make a point is another.  You wanted the article to talk about Serer Nile Valley migration.  That had already been discussed several times with notable sources like Gravrand, Cheikh Anta Diop, etc.  You also wanted the ethnonym of Serer to reflect the thesis of Diop.  The article already did that with notable sources including Diop himself.  If only you took the time to read the whole article you would have realised that, all these had been addressed. However, you should also appreciate that not every scholar and certainly not the ultra traditionalist Serer who wants nothing to do with Egypt agree with Diop and in fact his thesis were rebutted by several scholars including Schuh, etc.  These are relevant view points which should also be taken into account in other to avoid bias.  

I will now respond to the """"sources"""" that you have provided.

http://books.google.com/books?id=EZLF3T-5tlgC&pg;=PA706&lpg;=PA706&dq;=serer+wolof+north+east+africa&source;=bl&ots;=6ZlcoUiSsf&sig;=zOFR1CQY5BWf2thxHjWIhmq9Q8Y&hl;=en&ei;=BMFiToPpH6HL0QGE142OCg&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=6&ved;=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q;&f;=false

Have you realised that this source is not credible contrary to all the sources cited? Have you also realised that the author referred to the Kingdoms of Sine and Saloum as Wolof states?  Even the least verse on Senegambian history can easily find out for themselves that the Kingdom of Sine and Kingdom of Saloum were Serer Kingdoms not Wolof never mind a supposed scholar.   
Further, all the sources, historical and archaeological evidence shows that the Senegambian stone circles were built by the Serer people. (See: Gravrand, Pangool; Gamble, Salmon and Njie; Burke and Else; and F. Richard).

Since they were built by the Serers, and evidence have shown that they are built well before the 14th century, how then could the Serers have migrated into the area into the 14th century?  That doesn’t make sense.  Now the Serers may have migrated to from the Nile Valley as implied by Henri Gravrand in “La Civilisation Sereer, Pangool”, which is one of the sources cited in the article,  but as noted by Gravrand, if they did came from the Nile it was more than 5 thousand years ago and certainly not the 14th century. Further, as demonstrated by Gamble, Salmon and Njie, the Serer are the oldest inhabitants of Senegambia, others later moved in.  This backs up archealogical source, backs up Gravrand, Kleine, Richard  and so on.  
If your source was referring to the Guelwars of Kaabu coming from Kaabu to Sine in the 14th century at least I could understand that because it was at that time the Battle of Turubang (1335) occurred as stated by Sarr, Becker and others.  Even the Wolofs were already present long before the 14th century never mind the Serer people who have been present for thousand of years. Further as substantiated in the article with credible sources which all backs up each other, the Almoravid wars on Takrur due to religion (Islam) led to the Serers of Takrur who were finally defeated in Battle to leave Takrur and headed south.  That was in the 11th century during Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar and War Jabi.  Even those “Takrurien” Serers came south long before the 14th century to join their other Serer relatives (See Daggs).

Redirect

I didn't redirect the article. What I said is that it probably should be. I'm happy that you're getting in there and editing and learning the ropes, but my personal opinion is that it should be redirected, and that is based on the idea that what's there is mostly about alternate states of consciousness and reality, and not really about the extrasensory clairsentience. I don't think there's enough published material to write an article just about clairsentience and that it should just be a subsection of ESP or another page. 90% of the clairsentience article was laying the groundwork for a state of reality where clairsentience could be real. That's fine, but it had very little had to do with clairsentience itself. The content about altered states of reality, etc. should probably go in an altered states of reality article instead of this particular article. I didn't, however, redirect it.

The most serious aspect of this dispute, in my opinion, is edits such as [2]. Devin79 alters properly cited figures (from BBC News [3]) about the Provisional IRA's weapons arsenal. This change was made not only without providing a reference for the different numbers, but without changing the reference itself. So the article was left in a highly unsatisfactory state where it contradicted its own references, and this has been done several times over the past few months [4] [5]. Not only has Devin79 not responded to attempts by myself and other editors to engage with him on the talk page [6], but he announced his intention to keep on reverting regardless [7]. Demiurge 

These accusations are completely false, and slanderous. Every single edit I have done of the PIRA article is based on a number of sources all of which have been cited in the article edits, and source page. Jdorney has infested this article with innacuracies and outright lies, due to his biasd view of the IRA. The edits I made are proven and the proof was cited again and again. I even gave him specific information on how to find this info, which not surprisingly he ignored. Jdorney is an arrogant little punk, he has no idea what makes a good article and is an example of why Wikipedia is ridiculed in academic circles. I have access to several other IP addresses, and I will be using them to continue to edit the sad, amateurish work of this biased little loser. 

All of the above is also relevant to Jdorney's girlfriend SWATJester. SWATJester wouldn't know anything about the SAD if it slapped him upside the head. Having served 4 years as a Force Recon Marine, I would argue that I am far more knoweldgeable about this particular subject then some basement dweller who runs around calling himself """"SwatJester"""". I will also be editing his articles with various IP addresses. Both of these little dirtbags can go to hell.""",0

I said clearly """"from their understanding, rightly or wrongly, from verses in the Bible, they arive at the date and believe to be the historical"""" date.   Obviously NOT from anything outside of that, in the way of secular authorities etc.   And yeah, of course YOU (as well as I) are going around in circles, because you keep rowing with one oar, making me do so too in a way.   I was merely answering your question (which I was a little surprised why you asked it) of what I meant by """"believed-to-be historical"""", as you seemed to think I was meaning (for some reason) that it was from any outside source.   That's not what I meant.    As far as the """"theological reasons"""" the point too is why would they be so """"vested"""" if they didn't believe it was the actual actual actual genuine historical date to begin with?    That makes no sense.   It's all TIED IN, was my point.   And also, if it was """"587"""" instead of """"607"""" (according to the whole """"2520 years"""" view, which I know you don't believe as an atheist or whatever, but again from THEIR perspective) we'd still be living in the """"last days"""" anyway.  Instead of it starting in 1914, it would be 1934.   So side point, we'd still be in the """"end times"""" if that's the case.

You were not sure what I meant by """"believed-to-be historical date"""" not just solely """"theological"""".   The WT believes it to be the accurate true date as a point of general history.

I was addressing your question, that was it.  And yes, I noticed your addition in the other discussion, and your contention that they """"mis-translated"""" Jeremiah 25.29, when they didn't, because seeing other translations they say """"I begin"""" or """"I am beginning"""" it does NOT say what you said of """"already beginning"""".   There's no real difference between the word """"beginning"""" and """"start of"""".    THAT'S THE POINT.     It says """"I am starting off"""".   You could easily claim even with the NWT rendering that God """"already started off"""".   So?    Because in all versions the word """"already"""" is NOT there.   Whether you use the word """"beginning"""" or """"start"""".   Also, I'm a little confused as to what your point is, either way, wheether the words are """"already beginning"""" or """"first"""" or """"starting off"""".   Because if it's """"already beginning"""" as you said, wouldn't that ALSO be (obviously) before the other nations anyway?   The point is that all versions is obviously that Jerusalem would have evil caused by God to BEGIN with with, before the other nations.    Why would He say """"I am beginning with you"""" (as other versions have it, which makes the point too)?  Also, again, how does your """"already beginning"""" negate the point that Jerusalem would get it first?   Before other nations?     .........""",0

 ODNB 

Hello David, I read at Wikipedia:WikiProject Middle Ages/Resources that you had an access to ODNB and you could provide articles. I recently stumbled accross William II's bio which was available for free through their 'lives of the Week' service, and I now plan to rewrite the norman kings' articles on the french wikipedia. Could you get me William I, Henry I and Stephen articles ? Thanks a lot in advance !    PS  my mail is purplehz at gmail.com.

I have a totally unrelated question, but I don't want to add a new section. ALthough I guess I should? Could you give me a brief on fraternities? Are they inherently notable? Sometimes? Usually? Always?  I guess it's based on the usual criteria..., but if you have any insight for me that would be great. There's a whole slew of Philipino frats up at AfD including a """"list of"""". And I know how much you like lists of! If you're busy no worries. Holler back when you have time. Thanks for all your contributions to Wikipedia and your willingness to help me out by sharing your viewpoints. I probably should have told that young author their book would be difficult (very) to get included. I guess I was trying to be positive and hoping for the best... live and learn. )   

It would be easier if I could send them directly, because one cant put attachments in WP email, so please email me from here to give me your email address.  If you also want Henry II. & Richard, let me know. It would be good to use other modern sources also; there are good recent bios of all. 
Hello, I sent you an email through wikipedia. You're right, the Angevins kings would be interested too ! You now have my email address (purplehz -at- gmail.com). Regards   
I didn't requested articles to someone else recently, to answer your question. Regards,   

As for fraternities, my understanding of the current practice for US fraternities is that all established national college fraternities are notable, but (as for local chapters of all organizations), their individual chapters almost never are, unless there is something rally special. Fraternities at a single college have usually been rejected at AfD, but not always. Fraternities with a few chapters only, it varies. I'll look at the afd. There is a certain reluctance to include organisations in countries where most people here cannot judge the importancethis can be called either sensible realism, or cultural bias.'  

On the issue of Fraternities, I would tend to think the """"Alpha"""" or first chapter of a fraternity or sorority Organization would hold a right to have a wiki page dedicated to it, as typically the """"Alpha"""" or first chapter holds the most information on the fraternity/sorority's creation and history.   tombstone00

It's pretty obvious what I would have liked to hear from you, but I suppose intentionally ignoring people is the way of Wikipedia. This situation is obviously more complex than you phrased it - I am not 'having a go' at people for not writing the article, I'm having a go at them for having got it deleted for no good reason at all (and while you gave reasons, they're not very good and didn't really address what actually happened anyway, which is presumably why you're not willing to continue discussing it). And I've already given you extensive reasons why 'write it yourself' isn't really going to cut it as a solution. I'm not going to write it, and neither are they. Nobody is going to. Even though it is an eminently appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article, according to Wikipedia's own rules (and a passable first draft already existed). Perhaps we just have different ideas on what's the worst thing Wikipedia could be doing. Me, I think it's this. You, well, you clearly put more value on, well, I don't know to be honest. Obviously you have absolutely no interest in the subject matter, just like Dave (despite his claims), and the others, so I guess it's not really all that important to any of you at all that Wikipedia's already poor coverage of this area just got a little bit poorer, for no good reason, and despite the best efforts of a subject expert to inform you why your reasoning was completely erroneous and was simply flying in the face of common sense (such as the very obvious fact that the list I linked above has several companies on it which are actually smaller than NIBS). Not that you can even tell for half of them, because the articles are so crap they don't even give such basic details as that (for the reasons I've extensively documented). Which merely leaves me still wondering why any of you think this sort of approach would motivate me, or anyone else who realises this is the way of Wikipedia, to fix/write the articles for you. You must really think people are fools.   17:46",0

 Move to Marie Leczinska? 

Since English language obviously doesn't have its own name for this woman (Mary Leszczyńska?), Anglophone historians have to choose between Polish spelling - Maria Leszczyńska - and French spelling - Marie Leczinska. French language was, and still is, naturally closer to English than Polish, which is probably why most Anglophone historians choose Marie Leczinska. A quick Google Book Search confirms this: Maria Leszczyńska gets 96 """"English-language"""" results (though all I've seen are Polish books), while Marie Leczinska gets 808 English-langauge results.

Besides being closer to an Anglophone (for whom the article is written), the proposed title has another benefit: the lack of diacritics. """"Diacritics, especially Polish diacritics, make articles much more difficult to link to (it takes me about a minute to track down the proper letter and then copy/paste it), they interfere with proper alphabetization in category listings, are visually very intimidating to many English-speakers, cause confusion for pronounciation, and do not always display correctly on all web browsers.""""

Another posibility is Marie Leszczyńska; it is significantly more popular than Maria Leszczyńska (c. 400 hits), but Marie Leczinska is twice as popular as Marie Leszczyńska. Moreover, Marie Leszczyńska lacks the aforesaid benefit: it contains diacritics.

That being said, I informally propose moving the article to Marie Leczinska.   """,0

 Ayers 

He's never been convicted has he? X 
As far as I know, no.  Pretty sure of that.  Why?    
He's never been prosecuted, never been convicted. Calling him a terrorist is OR as well. X 
I mean, it's a BLP issue. There's no proof to it. X 
Where is he called a terrorist?  We just closed an WP:RFC with consensus against doing so, so that can pretty much be summarily reverted if it shows up.  There is some thought that his own statements about terrorism may be included with context as appropriate.    
He admited to setting bombs and being a member of a certified terrorist organization. Ayers is a terrorist.   
You certainly have a right to that opinion.  On Wikipedia we have agreed to not call him one.  Incidentaly, the Weathermen is not """"certified"""" as anything, nor does Ayers agree that he is a terrorist.  There is considerable reason why we don't do that here.  But that's moot.  That's gone up and down through all the available dispute resolution channels so for the moment that decision is final.    
You are wrong. I know it is hard to admit when one is wrong, but you should try. The Weatherman were declared a terrorist organization by the FBI - if that isn't a certified then I don't know what is. If someone belongs to a terrorist organization and sets bombs then they are a terrorist. I mean, you might as well argue that Paul McCartney isn't a singer unless he is declared as such.  
 You must have missed the dozens of reliable sources that Noroton posted at the RfC calling Ayers a terrorist.   
And you must have missed the point. According to the legal system, Ayers has never committed a violent act. X 
 Put down the keyboard.... you really need to find something else to do right now.    
Gentlemen, perhaps you can have a debate over whether Ayers is a terrorist or not on some other page - there are a million pages on Wikipedia, three million really, and I don't really feel like hosting a moot debate on the issue.  On Wikipedia we have decided to not apply that label to him.  There are probably a hundred thousand blog pages, message boards, etc., where you can call him a terrorist to your heart's content.    
Wow, you are a flaming liberal, aren't you?  So, let me get this straight...

In your opinion, someone who builds bombs for use against the U.S. Government and civilian buildings is not a terrorist.  Let us all hope you aren't in a position of leadership in real life.  Simply appalling, really. 75.40.204.26  
No! What don't you fucking get? Nobody is saying """"Ayers isn't a terrorist."""" Just that per Wikipedia policies, he should not and cannot be labeled as such in his biography. X 
And the organization, which he helped found, was classified, by the FBI, as a terrorist organization. What more do you want? Shall we repeal the 5th amendment and waterboard, """"I'm a terrorist"""" out of him?  """,0

 Re: References 

This article's references appear to be entirely bipolar.

Are there any neutral sources available?  01:21, 10 January 2006 (EST)

It is hard to find a """"neutral"""" reference about Scientology.  Anyone that has studied it seriously soon discovers that its a viscious cult and a global scam, and therefore their """"neutral"""" report becomes a critical report.  There are sources in the media like Richard Lieby (now at the Wash Post) that have written numerous newspaper articles exposing the cult.  There has been an article in Time Magazine about the cult that was reprinted in Readers' Digest.  60 Minutes has done a couple of exposes on the cult as well, but none of these have been flattering for Scientology.   The task you are expecting is akin to asking someone looking into the pit of hell and write a neutral non-POV article about Satan incarnate.  Unfortunately, it just isn't possible.   

There is a page that purports to be a neutral resource at [Bernie's Scientology Pages], but even a cursory examination of his site shows that 99% of his words and pages are either criticizing critics of Scientology or making excuses for the Church of Scientology.

I edit from the United Kingdom, and under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act, the editing of information online is illegal, without permission.

 Recent edits by User:Ramorum 

Ramorum, please discuss your recent edits here instead of accusing me of vandalism for undoing your edit.
I will explain here why I think that your recent edit represents a violation of WP:NPOV and WP:NOR.

You have changed the title of the section """"Constitutionality"""" to """"Unconstitutionality"""" and added a paragraph that reads:

The REAL ID Act violates the following articles and amendments of the United States Constitution: Article I, which does not grant the Congress of the United States the powers asserted in the  REAL ID Act. Section 8 enumerates the powers authorized to the United States Congress. The Fourth Amendment, which states:  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. The Tenth Amendment, which states: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. The legal encyclopedia American Jurisprudence says the following in regard to constitutionality: The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and the name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void and ineffective for any purpose since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it; an unconstitutional law, in legal contemplation, is as inoperative as if it had never been passed ... An unconstitutional law is void. (16 Am. Jur. 2d, Sec. 178)

These are fine legal arguments and I personally agree with them. But they clearly represent a personal judgement (correct as it it may be) on a controversial political topic. But that is not what Wikipedia is about. WP:NPOV implies that statements of opinion, such as The REAL ID Act violates the following articles and amendments of the United States Constitution, are not appropriate in a WP article. It would be perfectly OK to say, however, something like Critics charge that the REAL ID Act violates the following articles and amendments of the United States and then provide a reference to some reliable source
where such criticism is raised. As your edit reads now, not only does it represent a statement of opinion, but the way in which this opinion is justified also, in my view, violates WP:NOR. Instead of citing some sources where consititutionality of the Real ID Act is questioned in the way you describe, you list some general legal sources that in your view (and in mine)justify your opinion. This is a clear instance of original research that WP:NOR prohibits.

There are plenty of newsarticles and other reliable sources that criticize the Real ID Act and I think you will not have much trouble finding a few of them that raise the same points as your edit does. So if you want to make a constructive input, please find such sources and add them to the article. Regards,   """,0

As WP:OI says,
Original images created by a Wikipedian are not considered original research, so long as they do not illustrate or introduce unpublished ideas or arguments, the core reason behind the NOR policy.
The published information which is the basis for the annotation (i.e. the three letters/arrows) is explained on the image description page for the uncropped map  and also in a footnote to the map's caption  i.e.
Macmillan gives the steps in setting a blast, the location and circumstances of the accident, and the location of Gage's lodgings and Harlow's home and surgery..
Thoughts on this? As with the image links, I've put the map back so we (and others) can see what we're talking about.   

A9 Proving a negative
This regards a recent edit  to the passage 
Macmillan's comprehensive survey of accounts of Gage (scientific and popular) found that they almost always distort and exaggerate his behavioral changes...
which removed the word comprehensive.

This is a delicate point and I want to come up with something everyone can live with. I think there are two questions here.

First, Was Macmillan's analysis indeed comprehensive? No one who's been participating have any doubt on that, but just in case, open the collapse list.

""""first rate example of carefully done historical work"""" (Psychological Reports, 2001)
""""obstinately searched all possible sources. It seems very unlikely that anyone else could find a relevant piece not considered (Cortex, 2004)
""""fastidious archaeological removal of the layers of legend"""" (Lancet, 2001)
""""Even some of the most prestigious academic researchers have disseminated erroneous information..."""" (Neurosurgery Quarterly, 2002)
""""The definitive account. One of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary."""" (Science, 2000)
""""Macmillan scoured all the sources and commentaries on the case and as far as material regarding Gage is concerned this must be a definitive work.  (History of the Human Sciences, 2007)
""""Macmillan has shown that the record of how Phineas Gage’s character changed after the accident must be considered with caution..."""" (New England Journal of Medicine"""", 2004)

Second, Do we need to say the analysis was comprehensive? IMO I think we do, because it the analysis assserts a negative, which requires extraordinary research; just saying Macmillan found no mention omits that such extraordinary research was in fact done. (Two examples from the collapse box: """"Macmillan has obstinately searched all possible sources. It seems very unlikely that anyone else could find a relevant piece not considered""""; """"The definitive account. One of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary."""")Without such a clear statement, we get edit summaries such as this one: .

Actually, there's a third question: Do we need to include a quotation (such as the """"further research is not necessary""""  above) supporting the comprehensiveness? I don't think the reader needs that. I had put it in a footnote to the article recently only because another editor had questioned the comprehensiveness  in other words, the quotation was there for editors, not readers, and this discussion can take its place.

So what I suggest is that the article say Macmillan's comprehensive analysis of accounts of Gage...'', where [97][98][99] cite to a few of the sources supporting the comprehensiveness, but without quoting them. What do you think?

I'd like to issue a public thank you to the Wikipedia community for their attention to this area.  This article has defiantly shown an improvement and is closer to scientifically accurate after my posts.  It is a big responsibility that Wikipedia has, and that responsibility should be free of cultural bias, even if it may seem to go against what we have been led to believe by American media and culture.

When I first started looking into this topic, the articles I found were woefully inaccurate and defiantly biased.  I still feel that objectively, the definition should clearly state that most cross-breeds lead to a reduction in fitness.  Heterosis can be induced through breeding stragity such as line-breeding but it is a wasteful effort.  Random mixing of genes is similar to random mutation, most of which is deadly and not beneficial to the gene pool.  99% of mutations are deleterious.

Respect of natural selection should be the default position.  There are quantifiable difference between the races which were developed over hundreds of generations and whatever diversity we have managed to achieve should be cherished, what makes us different is what makes us special.  By mixing the races, in one or two generations we can undo the work of hundreds or thousands of years of evolution.",0

"""COPY OF MAIL JUST SENT TO THE WIKIEN_I LIST
In answer to the point of no legal threats - 
The legal reference was to the fact that I was
being threatened with various forms of complaint that
would need defending against, by the AFF couple, at
the same time as the block began, thus obstructing my
actions. I don't see that as a legal threat to sue
anyone. The point is one should not have personal
feuds from outside Wikipedia brought into it, and if
any harrassment that would be a wrong in the world
outside Wikipedia had been effected during the block
which it had blocked me responding to, then that
clearly would have been a legal wrong, because
Wikipedia can't opt out of the world. It is not
isolated from the existence of those factors in
society as a whole.

e.g.in the argument about Nazism that's going on here,
you are taking a position against having Nazis' target
groups put in danger, and you are doing that because
it's an outside world legal issue.

""""Wikipedia is not a democracy"""" needs quite a sharp
answer given to it. For the reason of keeping itself
in passably right relationship with the outside world,
i.e.readers, Wikipedia holds a policy on neutrality of
content. But the only way this policy genuinely exists
and is not a lie to readers, is if unconditionally
anyone who falls victim to crowd psychology can lay
claim to by right, not have to beg for by favour, any
measure that prevents a force of group numbers keeping
a bullying bias in place without having to find NPOV
ground. Now, """"laying claim to"""" anything, inherently
means being entitled to anything.

This is actually a case-study in how society emerged
from the Middle Ages. To have any credible claim to
work by any principles, a society must show they
operate reliably fairly, and to do that means that
people are entitled to it. No way out of that. Hence,
as soon as any group tries to follow any policy code
like neutral POV, immediately people are entitled to
things and all things are not dependent on favour. So,
it stands absolutely logically proved:

either * it's wrong to say to any user ever """"you'renot entitled to anything"""",

or * it's wrong to say to the public that Wikipedia has a neutrality policy that works.They can't both be right because anyone can see they contradict each other head-on. At least one must be wrong. Which is it?end of copy. Right, what this means is perfectly clear. Unless Wikipedia can answer the question I put there, """"which is it?"""", then Wikipedia is illegal. It's as simple as that, and I'm immediately posting so in every single aspie forum I belong to. I will also be asking real-life organisations to file details on it as being part of a hate campaign. The illegality is shared by every person who does not leave Wikipedia. Unless - there is an unless - unless the question is answerable. There are only 2 answers: if it's the second answer, no neutrality policy, then Wikipedia would stand obliged by its own public admission to shut down, while if it's the first answer, the mob is not in charge and people are entitled to things, then this block ends. It's as simple as that.
Now, I have a right to challenge the block and this has been the challenge. The block forms part of a group-bullying hate campaign to establish that the mob is in charge, and if that is not the case, Wikipedia has absolutely firmly no other choice than to admit that people are entitled to things, and that inherently means it is not a """"legal threat"""" to say so!!! That means being  entitled ''' to challenge any admin who claims it is. Now, people outside Wikipedia are going to see whether this has been passed on to every place for challenging blocks, and then what answers it gets.

"Jung And Einstein 

In 1895 Albert Einstein was a pupil at cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland. In 1896, after school in Switzerland, Einstein renounced his German citizenship. Carl P. Jung was born in in the Swiss canton (or county) of Thurgau. While Jung worked on Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious), tensions grew between Freud and Jung. 

Frank P. Geyer continued to serve as a detective until August 15, 1903 when he resigned. He had been transferred to the 18th Police District in the United States. Detective Geyer had arrested James Anderson; whether this is the same Anderson mentioned in Detective Geyer's 1896 work is non-determinable. In 1912 tensions between the two psychologists came to a peak. In 1901-02 Albert Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship and completed a scientific paper, obtaining a teaching position at school in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. 

The FBI file on Einstein came to light in 1983 when Robert Alan Schwartz wrote an article on the subject for The Nation magazine. Between J. Edgar Hoover and John Hutchison, democratic rights didn’t stop with McCarthy’s downfall nor with the demise of so-called notorious J. Edgar Hoover. Yet for years, zero-point energy according to Hutchison is obtained from the quantum vacuum. Hutchison claims on scientific phenomena are regularly featured and discussed by various media coverage. John Hutchison's claims of inventions and discoveries of a variety of phenomena are, like, NASA. The FBI should do an article on NASA and their non-determinable webers.

I do not find it too surprising Schwartz once more wrote about not only Frank Geyer, but Albert Einstein with not too much said about Carl P. Jung during these years around the turn of the centennial.",0

That is not to say that Whitman would not be used later for techniques on how to deal with his type of scenario in the future, but Whitman was unknown to John Nelson and Daryl Gates in 1965. The """"notable events"""" mentioned in the paragraph in the article, came after Whitman, but SWAT was fully funded and implemented at those times. Whitman was not a factor in 1965, nor the """"Black Panthers"""", """"SLA"""" or any other SWAT related issues. Is Whitman used by SWAT as a teaching method? I know he is.

Could this Highly Questionable Block kindly be reviewed in light of the ongoing WP:DRAMA and history of DRAMA that the editor  has been linked to. 

1.) His activity at ANI in making misleading claims about BLP Violation which he shared blame for whilst he used it to attack anther editor. Diffs

2 - Not Answering the Questions and Blowing More Smoke does not work ! Kindly address the direct questions already asked. 

3 -  Again I advise that you stop blowing smoke and moderate your tone and language about others. It's making you look bad.

4 -  I see that you have 2nd time stated I have accused you of taking Drugs. Can I have a reference to show me when and how. Other readers are interested too!

5 - Again - Kindly stop your misconduct and refrain from behaviour which is Bullying and Harassing.

It is interesting that in asking for much misconduct - misdirection - mendacity and twisting of wiki I am supposedly derailing in the view of  ? 

It is fascinating that he kept expanding the ANI entries under the heading [ A gross breach of WP:BLP at the 'Derby sex gang' article.] - To which he has added FOUR Subheadings and flooded the whole subject with yet more layers of misdirection, false and constructed claims all of which waste time and effort in having to address - and please not It Is NOt Possible To Prove The Negative.  

So he keeps adding to his misdirection - attempt to hide the questions of his failed conduct and confuse readers who were unwary of his patterns of misconduct - or even empower sympathetic ones to cherry pick. YET more Smoke An Mirrors. He evidently loves the attention it gains him. 

I fear that   has been happily misdirected by the ongoing misuse and manipulation of Wiki systems and content by  - as has also been revealed as part of his BLOCK which is featuring on ANI. 

I think that it needs to be reassessed - especially as the editor   has been focusing upon the ongoing claims of   under only a subheading created to claim that my responses and requests above were derailing so as to further 's pattern of misdirection and attack upon editors who are not gulled or beguiled by his (now revealed) well developed antics. 

I remain concerned that manipulation of content in this way is yet again being used to cause editors(Especially Admns)  to see what Manipulators wish and not the bigger picture. It is  a known pattern of exploitation of person/interface in the areas of Cyber Abuse-Harrassmnt-Bulying, and indicates that unwary editors(Especially Admns) are being made agents of the abusers.

 Sources, offers, and 1975 Iraqi government ads in Toronto Star, New York Times, and Le Monde 

It should be mentioned how different Arab governments have said they would allow former Jewish citizens of their nations to return and live in the Arab world (Morocco, Egypt, Yemen, Iraq, etc). Putting aside if one considers this a credible offer or possible. The clearest example of this (again putting aside what one thinks of it) was again by the Iraqi government on December 11, 1975 putting full page advertisements in numerous Western newspapers (The New York Times, Toronto Star, and Le Monde) asking any Iraqi Jews who left Iraq to feel free to return to Iraq (again putting aside whether one views this as a genuine offer or not). This page is sourced  and is done by someone with a Ph. D.  Also the reality of the existence of in particular the Iraqi government advertisements of December 11, 1975 (calling for any Iraqi Jews to come back to Iraq) is admitted even by ideologically Zionist website [www.eretzyisroel.org/~jkatz/discredit.html] which state that pro-Zionist groups """"scoffed at"""" the Iraqi offer. 

This info should be included and the sources are valid (written by a Ph. D.), especially if writings of the """"JCPA"""" is included as the JCPA is an obviously partisan think-tank associated with the Israeli Likud party in particular (so any noting of the legitimate sources I'm providing, putting aside the pro-Zionist source corroborating in particular the 1975 Iraqi government advertisements, being partisan to one side should also then have the """"JCPA"""" links and writings removed for partisan reasons). This info should be included in the """"compensation"""" section as it by itself (the offer, whether one believes it or things like it are genuine or not) would be an offer of not just """"compensation"""" but a return to where one originally came from in the first place. Putting aside that one of the most thorough discussions of the whole issue has been done by Professor Shenhav.  """,0

 POV concerns 
I'm not (yet) going to put the NPOV warning up, but the statement """"Maher is also fair to his conservative guests"""" is getting dangerously close to POV, since I'm sure many conservatives would disagree with this statement. 
Whether conservatives, liberals, or little green men would disagree with that sentiment does not make it POV.  It is, instead, POV in its own right as it's a judgement that a wiki editor made on their own.  It's someone's take on the show, which may indeed be 100% true, but we're also abutting the area of No Original Research here.  If we were to make a general statement about conservative guests being defended by Maher, I think we're on safer territory as it's generally true and easier to verify.
My point being, if you want to add a POV tag, do so.  Your first inclination is probably correct.  Just please cite your reasons here and we'll get a discussion going on how to fix specific issues you bring up.   08:48, 29 August""",0

 Pris and Racheal are the same android 

I'm afraid this is going to be quite a useless comment at the moment, because I don't have the book in front of me to quote from.

However I came to this Wikipedia article originally to see if it could help me decide whether Pris and Rosen are in fact the same android (not just the same model).  The article makes no mention whatsoever of something that has really been puzzling me.

Why do I think that Racheal and Pris might be one and the same:

- Pris originally introduces herself as Racheal Rosen when meeting JR Isidore and then changes her mind and calls herself Pris (if Pris is simply using her name for cover how do she know her?)
- Deckard says that Racheal and Pris have the same eyes (in fact the only difference he notes are clothes)
- We hear no more from Racheal after Pris has been killed (I'm assuming there she killed the goat before she went over to the conapt building)
- When Pris runs towards Deckard before she dies her last words are along the lines of """"For all we meant to each other.""""  Surely they don't know each other at all; Pris and Deckard have never met if she is someone else.
-  Pris also runs towards him from outside the conapt as opposed to inside it - i.e. she has been following Deckard as Racheal and not holed up with the rest of the Andys
- Racheal is really distraught in the hotel room when she finds out about Pris being the last android, it would make much more sense for her fear to be because it is her rather than the same android model.  It is only when she offers to kill it herself that she calms down.  But then she would - she had just claimed to kill herself (i.e. bluff Pris' death or possibly commit suicide).

Admittedly there's a couple of snags.  If she is Racheal then she is working for the Rosen corporation, so why is she hiding with the runaways?  Unless she """"ran away"""" from the corporation after Deckard originally tested her.  

Anyway I'd like to add something to the article - obviously nothing conclusive, but just acknowledge the possibility.  But if anyone would like to blow a huge smoking hole in my theory that I haven't thought of, then I won't (and it would stop me putting more time into trying to figure this one out too, which would be handy).

"I did not perceived you attempt to discussion, sorry. Actually the article is doing worst possible by the so named “finding of a number only” there estimations which are intentionally increased like the “Centre Against Expulsions” work. Unnecessary you need to point on somebody who is responsible it is enough offensive providing numbers which are subjective and biased. There are official more or less numbers of all nations population killed in WW II. You should start from this, until I know the Germany lost 8.7% of population in it 2 810 000 civilians. Thus it is impossible that the numbers can reach 3 millions during expulsion. Are you count also those who were collaborators of Nazi Germany? Well, …
I ask you to be reasonable. Do not put numbers which are just somebody biased “supposition”. Any way I found only one non-German estimation, which are Cold War effort most probably. Do you have UN or other independent sources regarding this numbers? Instead public “findings” which are very irritating you should look for objective source of information. Private multiplication of possibilities is offending. Do you know it? It is particularly such if you consider that other nations in fact lost much more and were not responsible for spark the hell of war.
In total proportion for one German in the WW II was kill ten people of other nations.
When somebody unleash beware dog who the culprit is? Dog or the person, and this is the case. I do not contradicts that after the WWII could occur lawlessness and lynches. Are you surprised of it? I am not, but you see if in competition during the 80’s the Soviets would invade Poland and Jaruzelski would support it in some way – we would blame Jaruzelski for our deaths in first place. The Soviets we world also, but first and above all Jaruzelski. He was the totalitarian and collaborator. Exactly the Germans should immediately and in first place blame Hitler and Nazi, though some love the Nazi ideology and activity.
Instead I see the article where numbers are juggled for God knows what. 
Thus I say to you the article look unbalanced and with bad faith. I just do not have time to discuss details as it is from the start bad. The tags are unimportant until you will point to Hitler and Nazi in first sentence as the primary culprits. You or others definitely opposed the introductions, so…?
The “recent” is not for philosophical deliberations. I took the word and sentence from the same article written long before I knew about it. Just I emphasize existing points – maybe deliberately hidden somewhere in the back and under carpet. Again, somebody dos not like the truth? Put “most recent” if you like. Do you?
You must be referring to Overmans and Ingo Haar, two historians. Does the total number two really justify a plural expression? Anyway, let's take a look at them.
I agree that total number of German deaths in Poland could be 1.1 milions. Twice there, 6 years of ocupations and guerrilla warfare, escape front od Soviet Army in winter 1944 and last the expulssion, which I can be shure was fewest deadly. But be specific with this numbers do not stick others. I very much beleave that in the post war phase the were revanges, but again are you surprised ?– evry 5th person in Poland was killed. Are you expecting after the “total war” against civilians evry of Polish citizen will be ideal christian and give you other chick to hit. If that was expected so it means the Nazi sin is all the more bigger.
Also, the XX236 sugestion is good . Change the title of the article.

 Taking this to your own talk page as you don't seem quite as keen on listening to what I've got to say over on my page as you are hellbent on defiling everyone's edits for your enjoyment 

Alright, I've just had it up to here with you and your blasphemous claims of everyone's edits being """"unreferenced crap"""" because you're the only one who can't remain content of having others contribute to the site. I can put up with your labels of every edit you find disastisfactory to your bigoted tastes as """"vandalism,"""" but going through everyone's freaking contributions list to make it some White Man's Burden to undo every small trimmings of blatantly incorrect or dingy information is just pushing the line, so I suggest you don't break the 3-edit rule yourself if you're so pompously insisting the rules and law enforcements here are on your side.

Let's see back where this started in the Freeza section, for example. Like I said on my edits page, I haven't familiarized myself with making those neat little references at the bottom to add to my edits, so in straight, bold text as clear as day, I posted the chapter number where the psychic ability itself was displayed, and could well post an image to back up my claims, while each and every one of the rest of the information I posted was seen throughout his extended fight sequences with Goku and co., you can bet your money on it; it's not Berserk or Blade of the Immortal we're talking about here, but plain-out, simple everyday Dragonball, which everyone (save you) would be fully capable of seeing. 

Then, the Vegeta article? Please, Vegeta himself professed about the 17 million zenos required to initiate his Ozaru transformation which can only be produced by a full moon or his power ball that mixes with the planet's oxygen to create a replacement, which both he and Gohan used to transform, and after his tail was sliced off by Yajirobe, he fled to the Freeza Planet and stated that his tail would grow back after he came out of the healing tank with the tail stump in plain view. None of this is uncited information by any means, and you're well striking a chord with everyone's anger by hellbenting on removing all that on the crappy pretense that because you can't deal with someone else making contributions, you're right in labeling them """"unreferenced crap"""" or """"vandal"""" and digging through everyone's records like a 40-year old wanker to annul every effort.

And again, the Piccolo article? I simply added that Nail was the one he first fused with to gain his """"massive increase"""" and that he was the one who kicked Freeza away to help buy time for Goku's Genki Dama to charge, and I myself removed some so-called """"crap"""" information like """"Piccolo's bukujutsu being a different technique"""" when the Japanese manga simply states that his technique is a superior kind. What little others there were (my contributions, I mean) are simple, medial additions like """"scientist Gero"""" added to the unclear information that simply said """"Red Ribbon"""" at first, when it was just the one guy and nobody else that was working for vengeance. 

And finally, I've been on this site since back in 2005 or 6 or so since I was 14 and fully know my rules and qualifications, and haven't been blocked once, so I'd suggest that you take it to my profile if you've got such a beef with my edits that you need to act like a petulant, 4-year old child who wants his toy back destroying everyone's contributions on your whim when you yourself are no authority. 

Thanks for your time.""",0
""" The sentence you deleted says""""dog is NOT AS WIDELY consumed as beef, chicken, and pork"""" Although the fact that dog meat comes 4th after beef, pork, chicken (In the """"meat"""" section, the author claims their popularity has been in this order in Korea.) in the original quotation shows the importance of dog meat. (Wild animals are mentioned after dog meat).

Stop adding so much unnecessary edits to the C train article. I don't know why you're going into more detail about the R32s. It's just a damn train. Nobody cares how often a train breaks down or whatever issues it has. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a Mean Distance Between Failures figure about how often any train break downs or whatever. Besides, the C train and the R32 car articles already mentions the breakdown rates anyway, just in a more subtle way. All it matters is just simply saying that the R32s were moved to outdoor lines to save their aging air compressors from having to work underground all the time. That's it. There's no need to mention what kind of issues the cars themselves have nor how they are/were solved. At least, in my book, your edits to the C train article were either completely over-opinionated, unsourced, or both, and thus, are not needed to mention. It's not like you work for the MTA anyway, so don't speculate about railcar maintenance, inspection or issues. If you don't work for the MTA and therefore, have no experience about the inner workings within the transit agency itself at all, by all means, stay silent, sit back, and relax.",0

 The Cramp Twins 

The Cramp Twins is an animated series created by cartoonist Brian Wood. The show was produced in association with Cartoon Network Europe. It is about Lucien Cramp (Kath Soucie) and Wayne Cramp (Tom Kenny), not-so identical twins who live with their hygiene-obsessed mother (Nicole Oliver) and their Western-obsessed father (Ian James Corlett) in the fictional town of Soap City. Wayne and Lucian's personalities clash, and they rarely get along. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe (Lee Tockar), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Reverend Andrew Sparks) has a crush on him, but he hates her. Wayne's and Lucien's teacher is Miss. Hillary Hissy (Demi Buchanan, who also plays Tony's mom Lily and Mrs. Winkle). Lucien's friends include environment-friendly Tony Parsons (Terry Klassen who also plays Tony's dad, Seth) and Mari and Luke Harrison (Adam Little).

Season one premiered in the UK in September 2001 on Cartoon Network (UK) and on February 2, 2002 on CBBC on BBC One respectively and has reached high popularity with children. Season one ended on 21 June 2002. A second season premiered in Autumn 2003. Season 2 finished in 2003.
Season 3 started in 2004 and ended in 2005. Season 4 began in 2006 and ended that same year.
The show is currently licensed to Cartoon Network.

The show was originally canceled in the US in February 2005, when Mew Mew Power (aka """"Tokyo Mew Mew"""") was airing in its slot February 19, 2005, and it was originally intended to be a sneak peek for the series to air September 2005 with Cramp Twins continuing to air there, but 4Kids TV decided to cancel The Cramp Twins to put Mew Mew Power in its slot. A press release went out about a possible 3-part finale answering any unanswered questions, but the show returned in the summer of 2006, and later with more new episodes.

 Main characters 
 Lucien Cramp: Lucien is the smarter of the twins, but also considered the 'eco-loser'.  Gentle and sensitive, Lucien is frequently bullied and name-called by his brother; Wayne's favourite choice of addressing Lucien is """"Girlpants"""", but he sometimes calls Lucien a """"nerd"""". Lucien enjoys science, nature and is a vegetarian. Lucian longs for a pet, but due to his mother's extreme cleaniliness rules, he is denied owning any.  Secretly, Lucien keeps a worm farm under his bed, that only Tony, Mari, Wayne and Wendy know about. It is shown in many episodes that Lucien has a fear of clowns. He has many skills, including knitting, and has shown interest in playing the harp. Lucien likes going to Soap City's only swamp (the only place he gets peace from Wayne, who is afraid of the place) where Tony lives. Lucien is technically the older twin as he was born first in the opening credits. Lucien Cramp is voiced by Kath Soucie. 
 Wayne Archibald Cramp is the blue-skinned antihero of the series. He is taller, destructive, and the less intelligent of the twins. Wayne is obsessed with junk, which he collects and hides in his room; he spends most of his time at the junkyard, owned by only friend, Dirty Joe. Unlike Lucien, who loves the swamp, Wayne is terrified of the place, and also has a fear of frogs. Wayne is constantly annoyed by Wendy Winkle who has a crush on him. Wayne's only love is anything sugary, his main source of energy, and if he is deprived from it, he becomes tired and speaks nonsense. Wayne likes to give the impression that he's the best-behaved of the twins to his mother, and sometimes Miss Hissy, but in truth, he likes to manipulate to achieve his goals.  Sometimes Lucien who gets in trouble for Wayne's behaviour, although in many episodes, somehow the tides turn and Wayne is punished by pure coincidence. Wayne is vo",0

She is being held in Imphal on judicial warrants if there weren't any trials in Imphal then she wouldn't be in prison. The last dates of the trial in Delhi are correct 11 & 12 August 2015 but it is nonsense to claim that there are no trials in Imphal or that it is impossible to find any reference to them. If in doubt use Google. 

The SS group has no standing with Sharmila but is also run by Mr Babloo Loitongbam. He comes from a very powerful police family and people suck up to him.

"Help clarify an artice: John Stark 

I was looking for information on John Stark and came across a confusing section. In the part about his early life, there is a paragraph that reads:

On April 28, 1752, while on a hunting and trapping trip along the Baker River, a tributary of the Pemigewasset River, he was captured by Abenaki warriors and brought back to Canada but not before warning his brother William to paddle away in his canoe, though David Stinson was killed. While a prisoner of the Abenaki, he and his fellow prisoner Amos Eastman were made to run a gauntlet of warriors armed with sticks.

The problem is that there is no mention of who David Stinson is, only that he was killed. I see that an edit you made (10:57, 2006 January 25‎) removed some clarification on him, instead identifying Amos Eastman as the fellow prisoner. As you have better knowledge on the subject, can you please put back some info identifying him? (or possibly remove the unclear info??)

 Allende & Friends  Some Quotations 

Upon Stalin’s death in 1953, Chilean Communists held a “Homage to Stalin” in Santiago’s Baquedano theater. Salvador Allende declared that “Stalin was a banner of creativity, of humanism and an edifying picture of peace and heroism!....Everything he did, he did in service of the people. Our father Stalin has died but in remembering his example our affection for him will cause our arms to grow strong towards building a grand tomorrow — to insure a future in memory of his grand example!”

In January 1971 his minister Carlos Altamirano boasted that: """"We’re following the example of the Cuban Revolution and counting on the support of her militant internationalism ... represented by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Armed conflict in continental terms remains as relevant today as ever...Hear me loud and clear!...We will employ revolutionary violence!”

“In the final analysis only armed conflict will decide who is the victor!” asserted his governmental ally, Oscar Guillermo Garreton “Without the complete destruction of the bourgeois character of the state we cannot march on the path of socialism! The class struggle always entails armed conflict. Understand me, the global strategy is always accomplished through arms!”

His deputy economic minister, Sergio Ramos noted mid-1973 “It's evident that the transition to socialism will first require a dictatorship of the proletariat""""

""""We have no choice,” asserted Chilean Communist Volodia Teitelboim, “but to act with resolution and a civil war is not a careful affair. It draws targets on both the political and the apolitical”.

Luis Corvolan declared “We have never considered the path of the Chilean Revolution to be exclusively an electoral one.”

All above quotes and incidents are fully documented in La Agresion Del Oso; Intervencion Sovietica y Cubana en Chile by Gonzalo Rojas Sanches, a Fulbright Scholar and visiting professor at Notre Dame who heads the History Department at Chile’s Catholic University.""",0

The latter two fields are distinctly separate even thought archeoology is a kind of social science, scholarly, it belongs to anthropology and history. Fujimura is an archaeologist, so that his case has been a good example of the archaeological fraud.

I'm not sure and will think about it. , I'm doubt anything could be written about the SNPU that we couldn't fit into the Svoboda article, and so I tend to agree with you.

Now, related to the 2nd one, what do you think about:
While Vargas and the military leadership were supposed to assume the government temporarily to implement democratic reforms related to 1891's Constitution, they instead closed the Congress and ruled with emergency powers, replacing the states' governors with their supporters. With the non fulfillment of promised democratic reforms, in 1932 the oligarchy of São Paulo tried to regain the power, as well as in 1935 the Communists rebelled, having both been defeated. Using the communist threat as an excuse, Vargas and military preclude elections, launching a coup d'état in 1937, formalizing the then dictatorship. In May 1938, there was another failed attempt to take over the power by local fascists.

Support Current Lead  The Queen herself would be horrified if someone thought she or others regarded her UK responsibilities as more important than her other responsibilities as Head of State of the other realms. I am not a royalist by heart but I am by head. There is great value when there is a non political Head of State and her having many hats as it were has greatly benefited (IMHO) all her realms. The Queen has been faultless as far as I am aware in handling this juggling act. And part of the reason for that is because she does take her other roles very seriously. Apparently it sometimes annoys UK Prime Ministers when she swaps hats and speaks to them on behalf of some country other than the UK. They get an unfair advantage in that sense because the Queen meets with the UK Prime Minsister weekly. In practical matters the legal situation is very clear and the Queen takes her various roles very seriously indeed. To suppose otherwise is pure devilment.,0

""":This is not original research, it is just presentation of the actual data used by Rodgers in his research, abstracted directly from his paper, from an earlier paper by Petty which Rodgers is re-analysing in his paper, and from a US National Safety Council report which Rodgers cites. However, from these data one can assess what importance should be attached to the Rodgers study. After reading the Rodgers paper and assembling the data he used, it became clear that quoting one sentence from Rodgers' conclusion overstated what could validly be drawn from the Rodgers analysis of the data shown above. The following text would be an acceptable compromise:
 """"Rodgers analysed annual (1973 to 1987) national time-series estimates of cycling injuries, annual counts of cycling and pedestrian road accident fatalities, estimates of bicycle use and bicycle standards compliance, and estimates of helmet use based on sales of one particular brand of (now obsolete) hard-shell helmet. After fitting a linear regression model to these data he concluded that: """"There is no evidence that hard shell helmets have reduced the head injury and fatality rates. The most surprising finding is that the bicycle-related fatality rate is positively and significantly correlated with increased helmet use"""".

"Droop is not better than Hagenbach-Bischoff!!!

Using the Hagenbach-Bischoff quota of 50, both parties reach quota, and there is a tie.

Its is common knowledge in South India as to who the Sengunthar/ Kaikolar are and its not my problem if you've been living in a very close knit community or unaware of this.

1. The following is quoted from a legitimate third party website. http://globalindiamissions.org/newsletter/nwsltr0802.htm

The Kaikolan are a large Tamil and Telugu caste of weavers. There are seventy-two subdivisions (nadu or desams). Their name comes from a mythical hero and from the words """"kai"""" (hand) and """"koi"""" (shuttle). They consider the different parts of the loom to represent various gods and sages. They are also known as Sengundar, which means a red dagger, which is traced to the legend of the earth being harassed by demons, which led to the people asking the god Shiva to help them.

Traditionally, one girl in every family was set apart to be dedicated to temple service and becomes a """"Devdasi"""" (meaning female servant of god). In the temple, the girl is considered married to the temple deity but in practice becomes a prostitute, especially to the Brahmans and she learns traditional music and dancing.

2. This is taken from a journal research article with abundant valid references. This is as legitimate as it gets.

This article talks in much detail about how women from the Sengundhar/ Kaikola caste get into the sacred prostitution in temples.

""""Contending identities: Sacred prostitution and reform in colonial South India Priyadarshini Vijaisri A1, A1 Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), New Delhi"""" South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies Publisher: Routledge, part of the Taylor & Francis Group Issue: Volume 28, Number 3 / December 2005 Pages: 387 - 411

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q;=Contending+identities%3A+Sacred+prostitution+and+reform+in+colonial+South+India

3. This is taken from another legitimate webiste http://www.go2southasia.org/l_peoples.html of a world renknown organisation recognised by many countries. They have no gain in just picking on the Sengunthar caste.

The KAIKOLAR people are a caste of weavers 1.5 million strong in southern India. They are Hindus and view different parts of the loom as representations of various gods and sages. Traditionally, each Kaikolar family sets aside one daughter to serve in a Hindu temple. That daughter is considered married to the temple deity—often the Hindu destroyer god Shiva. In practice, the daughter becomes a temple prostitute.

All 3 of the above references are quite legitimate and I can quote many more. There is no question of coincidence or any error in any of these sources.

 Response to Earlier Morality Accusation 
This is inresponse to a cowardly """"unsigned"""" who suggested that Thomas Alva was a pedophile. The entire section was deleted. I think the response is worth keeping as it delves into the intrigue in Edison's life.
""""Isn't the U.S. age of consent 18?""""-(as """"unsigned"""" stated).  Hey IDIOT, this was the NINETEENTH CENTURY!!! Thoughout the western world, females marrying at the age of 16 were common. Never raising as much as an eyebrow from the emerging Victoian era. Actually, a young girl marrying a man who was middle-aged and still in the prime of life was applauded AND encouraged, as well as her parents for matching her with any man who had established means. What was frowned upon at that time (and still very-much today,)was if the man were eighteen to her, say sixteen, or both were the same teen age (Though today, as was true then, a parent could get a waiver, and consent to the union). A young marriage was mightily discouraged by society AND the girl's parents in that bygone era, as they saw """"young love"""" as impetuous, irrational, and especially IMMATURE. Unless the man was shown to be of more than sufficient means, maturity and responsibility; that he came from a respected family, the whole idea was nixed. Also, remember that arranged marriages were still quite common in turn-of-the-century America. (And too, fathers were eager to get their daughters """"married off"""" as soon as possible, so they wouldn't get """"radical"""" ideas of """"independence"""" floating in their heads.) Not like the """"mail-order brides"""" of the rambling Old West! (Actually, would it surprise you that arranged unions are still widely carried out today accross every interested section and spectrum of society in the West. It's just more informal, as the female ESPECIALLY is tasked by parents and relatives to choose a mate within the liking of the parents, and often-times, relatives. """"Gotta please Mom and Dad, my grandparents AND priest, ya know?"""" You should also study more about Edison's life before making moronic and scurrilous accusations. If you did delve further, you would find that Edison's second marriage was more a """"politcal"""" arrangement than anything else, as little Mina was a neice of Thomas Alva's principal enemy and competitor JUPITER PIERPONT MORGAN. Struggling as the latter was to keep his floundering gas-light industry afloat against the inevitability of the electric street lamp. So, the marrige was a very strategically diabolic """"investment"""" on Morgan's part to overtake Edison' business, which eventually happened. (We are reminded that Morgan a a ROBBER BARON: This is what they do.)It is strange that you'd call Alva Edison a pedophile. Why, unless you seek to marr his reputation? |talk]]) Veryverser

Following this clarification, perhaps it was the article's author who attempted to resolve this by offering the results of his """"genelogical study"""" of what was conventional in such relationships in that period that Edison lived. This I felt was inadequate, so I countered with... 

We are talking SOCIAL CONVENTIONS here, of course. Naturally long before the 1960sA.D. """"women's liberation"""", all females needed their parents or guardian(s)'s consent, whether they were co-habitating with them, or the women were apart from them and\or had indepenent means. This was common all over the world, with this tradition being broken, beginingin in North America by enforced emigration(for example)of Irish and other European refugees in the nineteenth, and then again in the early twentieth centuries. Even women who were twenty-one years old in the turn-of-the nineteenth, and early twentieth century's """"middle-class"""" strata were required to seek a respectable, well-heeled sponsor, to give consent to a bethrotal if these females ever were to hope to enter what was then regarded as """"respectable"""" society"""". This all seemed to chagge in America after World War I, as there seemed to have been a definite """"cultural shift"""", throwing-off those old traditions of a previous generation and epoch. Edison's age difference is a non-issue. Even in most parts of Asia and Europe today, age in a marriage of an older man to a (well, sometimes much) younger woman is revered. Here, in the States, various wealthly and powerful men, among them old Hollywood and media types flaunt their marriage to virtual child-brides(Woody Allen, Rupert Murdock as obvious examples. Curious-wouldn't you agree-that in both cases cited, these men chose YOUNG, ORIENTAL WOMEN, rather than western ones for their """"sunset years""""). In Alva Edison's case, this was sort of a """"wirlwind romance"""" manipulated by the girl's uncle, as I cited above, to get at Edison and control of his company. Think Napolean Bonafart's divorce of Josephine to marry a Hapsburgh princess, and the world-shattering events that ensued from such a """"political"""" union. Special:Contr",0

It's a newbie test, resulting from clicking the buttons above the edit window.  | T@lk 

I think that the article hematology should define hematology (as in what a hematologist does), not blood diseases.  We should create that article separately.  

I think that haematologist and haematology should remain separate pages.  They are not the same.  It is easy to click on a link to look up haematologist on the haematology page.  

I disagree. Being a hematologist is practicing hematology. Hematology is not just the diseases but just as much diagnostics, epidemiology and laboratory medicine. Together with gastroenterology it is one of the few fields that has retained its own diagnostic process (no need to send the blood film to a dedicated expert). I'd suggest moving the diseases to a seperate page and using this page to mention the main ones (red cells, white cells, transfusion and coagulation).  | T@lk 

SPELLING!
Can we please have this page retitled as hematology. It is NOT spelt hematology, sorry if american people think it is spelt like that. But ARGGGHHH, doctors were around in england long before america, the language was born here, spelling it wrongly just makes you look stupid -  regards  .

I think there is room in the world for both spellings as all things evolve differently in different locations. Including language and it's details.

 Since when were doctors in England before America? Native Americans practiced medicine. And if you refer to doctors as practitioners of modern Western medicine, remember that at the time America became a country, doctors were still trying to save people by bleeding them. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 67.173.46.246  .

 There is a redirect from haematology to hematology, so we English will find the page.  

The page was at Haematology until  changed it to Hematology in an edit on the 5th of November, 2004, apparently in order to """"keep the American spelling into Wikipedia"""". According to Wikipedia policy, it should have stayed at Haematology (there is no preference for US English in Wikipedia), but it has been at the (admittedly awful) title of """"Hematology"""" for so long, trying to get it restored may be something of a fruitless exercise.

I think that probably we should leave it at hematology because moving it would provoke the opposite argument and there is a redirect, after all.  """,0

 PLEASE READ BEFORE ADDING ANY MORE RUBBISH 

As far as I can see Wikipedia has become a very turgid shadow of what I originally signed up to - and I really can't see any point editing it any more.

Having followed the climate articles for many years and now having a great deal of expertise, I can no longer just sit back and hope that Wikipedia will some day come around to a NPOV. There are certain simple things that are so obviously POV pushing that it beggars belief that they still go on: 

Not using common names when they are used by everyone else
Not admitting simple facts like it is not currently warming.
Pretending """"global warming"""" is a """"scientific"""" issue when everyone knows it is mainly political rhetoric even when practised by the """"scientists"""".

And don't you dare think I'm pushing POV - I have not once added anything to a climate article without first seeking consensus (which basically means I have never edited a climate article)!!!!

I KNOW WHAT IS A NPOV ... BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED FROM WHEN I USED TO BE A GLOBAL WARMING ADVOCATE AND NEITHER HAVE MY VIEWS ON THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGED ... I JUST CAN'T STAND PEOPLE BEING DISHONEST, AND I JUST THINK SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS

From the day I first tried to get a NPOV on the climate articles (when I used to work in wind and was openly saying global warming is happening) till today, I haven't once managed to get a substantial change toward NPOV into a climate article. '''I'm angry ... not because I f*cking wanted to put the sceptical view ... it is because you bunch of pr***s have turned me into a sceptic because you refuse to see the obvious POV pushing that has been going on.

And the great consolation, is that the climate articles have been so POV that most decent people can spot it a mile off and what with climategate, the propaganda in Wikipedia is no longer considered a reliable source.   """,0

For a certain editor
""""In 1952 BMW in West Germany produced its first car since before the Second World War. The 501 competed with and failed in terms of performance, price and engineering excellence to match the middle-range sedans made by Mercedes-Benz. The 502 was a still more dismal failure. In the years that followed BMW made every mistake in the book. They launched expensive new luxury models with temperamental high performance engines in a country that had not yet recovered its prewar confidence. They suffered huge losses, panicked, and attempted to escape downmarket by making “bubble cars” under licence for an Italian company, Isetta.

These cars had some success in post-imperial Britain where there was no Marshall Plan and the Suez Crisis brought on the first of many oil shocks. But Germany in the late 1950s was enjoying the fruits of Wirtschaftswunder. The country that had been in ruins only ten years earlier was no longer poor enough for the BMW Isetta Motor-Coupé, known colloquially but never popularly as “the egg”""""

Extract from: Car Wars, Fifty Years of Greed, Treachery, and Skulduggery in the Global Marketplace by Jonathan Mantle

But then there was a fuel crisis and so, briefly, the Germans bought it. What a happy happy accident.

""""The BMW Isetta. Despite its reputation for automotive elegance and craftsmanship, BMW laid a multimillion dollar egg in the 1950s with its Isetta minicar, sneeringly dubbed, “das rollende Ei” or “the rolling egg” The Isetta’s engine was in the rear; passengers exited and entered through the nose of the car as if it were a D-Day troop carrier. In fact, when the front door swung open the steering column and dashboard came with it. As for safety, the entire vehicle, front to back, was one big crumple zone.

Steering the Isetta was difficult, largely because its body was tapered towards the rear, like a wedge of Emmenthaler cheese. Most models had only three wheels, which didn’t make the car any easier to control. But the design enabled the manufacturers to have the Isetta officially classified a motorcycle and thus taxed at cheaper rates.""""

"There are 3 articles.  Contract Bridge, Rubber bridge and Duplicate bridge.  It is possible there are more and that I've missed something.  One article is the parent article, it should include some history of how the game developed from Whist and that article would be Contract Bridge.  That there is bidding should be spelled out in the parent article.  That there are only 15 useable words which partners may use to describe their hand and to arrive at a contract should be spelled out, the concept of strain or demonination should be presented and the rules of play.

Then, Duplicate bidge adds another layer of scoring complexity in addition to the already present and continually used, rubber bridge scoring. In addition, Duplicate Bridge adds another layer of rigidity to what cards partnerships hold.  In this manner the element is skill is boosted while the element of luck (unavoidably present) is made smaller.  The Duplicate bridge article could get into the bidding boxes, the curtain used in large, international tournements and so on.

Magnum Crimen

 Smears 

Hi Turqoise127

A number of your recent edits (the AfD for Boba Phat, Cyclopia's talk page) state or imply the existence of editors ganging up to game Wikipedia's processes, and further imply the inappropriateness of such. 

First, if you want to talk about inappropriate ganging up, you should be aware of a formal body that exists in practice almost solely to vote in blocs against deletion. The Article Rescue Squadron works by tagging articles with a template, so that other editors are alerted to the existence of a speedy, prod, or AfD nomination. The usual result is vote packing at AfD discussions without improvement to articles (the nominal goal of the squadron). This leads to far more """"unfair advantage"""" by virtue of """"block votes"""" and """"sway[ing of] opinion"""" than a few editors who occasionally show up at the same AfD discussions. 

Here's the great thing about AfD discussions. Anyone (except sock puppets and blocked users) can show up and opine. All someone needs to do is go to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion#Current discussions and start browsing. You may think that when a number of editors show up opining """"delete"""" for an article, and none on the other side show up to opine """"keep"""", it's an indication of unfair voting blocs. But in fact, it generally indicates that:
 editors who have a predilection to stringent interpretation of WP:N agree it's not notable;
 middle-of-the-road editors agree it's not notable; and
 editors who have a predilection to a lenient interpretation of WP:N either believe in their hearts that it's a clear-cut case, or realize that the obvious weight of the consensusnotwithstanding their disagreementmakes it not worthwhile to bother opining. 

The same occurs where """"keep"""" is either obvious to all, or so widely supported that editors with limited time don't bother to tilt at windmills. I don't know how other editors do it, but when I browse through AfD discussions, I tend not to bother with snowball cases in either direction unless I have some knowledge of the subject or believe an important principle is being illustrated. 

In any event, your continued smear campaign against """"certain groups"""" as """"plainly unfair"""" is against policy and has become more than tiresome. Cut it out. 

Bongomatic 

Hi Bongomatic, it is flattering how you stalk me and react to every single contribution I make. However I think you are over-reacting a bit. I mentioned no names in any of my comments; they were general. If expressing my views on certain events that I witness is against policy, please tell me how so, because it reaks of censorship. I do stand by my views, I think you know that. And even though I like and respect you, I am not really looking for friends here. Your article rescue squadron comment and illustration is definitely a valid point, but you must take into account that they (squadron) are reactionary, so they (at least I think, could be wrong) react to deletionist strong-arming of marginal or worthy articles that really could/should be kept. Be that as it may, if you ever feel something I do is against policy, do what you gotta do, caus I will not be changing anytime soon. I am still looking at my options regarding my issues; do nothing and attempt to soften influence with my presence on here, write essays, discuss at water pump, arb com, whatever.

"While the overly simplistic capitalist view I expressed may seem naive it would also be naive to assume that there is such a solution.  While there are exceptions to every rule it is generally a good assumption that price and performance will diverge.  Unless the answer is exceedingly simple and cheap you will be at a competitive disadvantage if only because you have research and development expenses to cover in the sale of your product.

Debate of market economics aside (as this is not the place), I still feel the last sentence is either not very encyclopedic (lack of supporting research or citation) or not clearly conveying its message and therefore should be removed.

The Christmas holiday has nothing to do with Christ.  I would like to cite the historical section of our artical which clearly illustrates that the holiday was and is Pagan, not Christian.

Brews, he's given citations for the very things that I have been arguing about. Polar coordinates in the inertial frame are the correct and standard way to analyze planetary orbital motion.

The section that I put in yesterday was standard textbook planetary orbital theory. I mentioned Goldstein's.

I can only conclude that most of the editors here are schoolboys who have done the basic circular motion theory and are totally unwilling to examine the general cases of curved path motion such as ellipses and hyperbolae and the role of the radially outward centrifugal force.

I would say that my section was erased yesterday for no other reason than that nobody here could understand it since they have never done planetary orbital theory in advanced applied maths at university.

[This discussion has been  transplanted from another user's talk page.  I have opted to reply to sentences as they appear.  My replies are in [green]. Sorry SD/WP.]

I don't know why  and  are spending their time arguing on your talk page. Neither Wayne or PresidentitstVB have submitted any strong reliable source that claims Punch wasn't a slave, sentenced to slavery, or wasn't enslaved.  [I agree that it is possible Punch could have been made """"subject to a superstition, passion, etc.,"""" and thus, enslaved, according to the definition of the word at the time.  I have stated ad infinitim et nauseum that he was not in any way made a slave, when viewed through any lens of the time, no matter how many oxymoronic historians state otherwise.  Slaves were specifically identified by the edicts of 1618 (as """"slaves to the Colony""""), by the slave traders and, most significantly, by the slaves themselves, especially those who converted to Christianity as slaves on board the early 17th C ships for the sole person of not being treated as slaves upon their arrival in the new world.  I'm tired of trying to argue the facts with a brick wall, except to ask you, , if I were to write what two other, reliable sources had considered in publications...  """"Scoobydunk is a brick wall,"""" would you be able to find two reliable sources, which specifically stated, as if to state the obvious for no apparent reason, """"Scoobydunk is not a brick wall?""""  I rest my case.]  They've also failed to provide any reliable source to claim there were slaves recognized and officially documented by a legal institution before Punch.  [Go ahead.  Do what  did at 5:36 PM (EST) on July 31st 2012, just make that leap of faith and write it!... (over and over again). [WP:OR]  After all, you have already said you removed it in response to my objections, so why should I be surprised, looking at the article's history, that you wouldn't continue the """"flip flip flam?""""]. Wayne thinks this quote from Foner supports his argument but it doesn't because Foner is specifically talking about the institution of slavery and when historians consider the institution to have originated. I've already supplied a quote from a strong reliable source by Vaughan that further substantiates this point:

""""On the first pointthe status of blacks before the passage of the slave lawsthe issue is not whether some were free or some were slave. Almost everyone acknowledges the existence of both categories by the 1640s, if not from the beginning."""" Alden T. Vaughan. The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 97, No. 3. July,1989.  [It is well known, , that slavery existed long before Punch's case - it was documented in Massachusetts (in present day Somerville, I think), in the Sugar Islands (the English colony of Barbados, primarily), from where a number of our first black immigrants emigrated, and most notably, on the slave ships departing West Africa, from where Punch himself is alleged to have come.]

So, even though historians may differ on when the institution of slavery started, Vaughan clarifies that """"almost everyone"""" recognizes the existence of both slaves and free blacks by 1640, if not, from the beginning of the colony. Wayne is trying to use his OR interpretation to pretend what Foner says contradicts what numerous historians have said about Punch, and it doesn't. He's failed to refute this fact and has repeatedly ignored this point made",0

Sorry, I'm not. As you can read in the article for Palestine, the term """"Palestine"""" does derive from the Philistines, but it was given to the land by the Romans only in 135 AD, after the Jewish revolt. In the 20th century it was brought back to life by the British, and thus became recognized world wide as """"Palestine"""". In any case, the Philistines themselves were not present yet in the land in the year 4,000 BC - they arrived around the time of the Israelites/Jews, and they settled mostly in a relatively small strip along the coast, an area which is partly the Gaza strip.

 Nice job on autism causes page 

  Common sense award I think what is on the causes of autism page is well done.  I also like your common sense approach.  I am not really sure how to send you a message on content but thought I would try this.  I see the vitamin D deficiency hypothesis which should be there because it is in the literature, but the hypothesis does not make any sense because oral supplementation of vitmain D among the very young has increased dramatically over the last 20 years and autism increases with it.  An alternative cause of the epidemic is the opposite: too much vitamin D supplementation and fortification among the very young, which makes a lot of sense considering the calcium channel nature of many autism syndromes, the biochemistry of those with autism, and the epidemic.  I have a book about it on amazon and some academics have told me the ideas in it are provacative.  Does something need significant media exposure before it can appear in wikipedia?  As you seem to know a lot about autism causes would you have any interest in reviewing it?  I could send you a .pdf copy.   
 Hi, .  I appreciate your kind words, but causes of autism in fact, most of our autism articles was mostly written by now-departed ; it would need to be a high-quality journal because autism is a featured article, and it would need to be an independent secondary review per our medical sourcing guidelines.

more on consensus
The following (about consensus) followed slrubinsteins Wikipolicy essay
I pretty much agree with all that, but it seems incomplete.  There are other important policies and guidelines.  For example, there's WP:Consensus, and WP:Summary style, and WP:Undue weight to name a few.  Just because some inserted material satisfies WP:NPOV, WP:V, WP:RS, and WP:NOR does not mean that an editor can insist (repeatedly) on inserting it into an article.  And whether the material satisfies those policies should be determined not just by an individual editor but by consensus.  

Ferrylodge, I certainly accept that other policies may apply.  And I know you are acting in good faith with good intentions.  But with all due respect, I think your message muddies the waters.  First of all, """"undue weight"""" is a subsection of NPOV.  By my linking NPOV, I simultaneously included undue weight.  The difference is, I made it clear that NPOV is the umbrella policy and """"undue weight"""" is just a component of that policy and has to be interpreted in the context of the policy as a whole.  You took it out of context which could mislead some people.  Also, """"Summary style"""" is not a policy.  I was talking primarily about policies.  Summary style is a guideline and it may be useful to editors but it does not have the force of a policy.  Finally, I agree with you about consensus, but the consensus policy addresses a different issue than I was raising.  My point was about what can go into articles.  Consensus says nothing about what can or cannot go into articles.  The consensus policy is about interpersonal behavior and process.  The consensus policy is not about content; NPOV, V, and NOR are about content.  It is NPOV, V, and NOR that determine what is acceptable and unacceptable content.  The consensus policy lays out a process for resolving conflicts over content.  But it does not establish principles for resolving the conflict.  The principles remain NPOV, V and NOR.  When editors get into a conflict, we should consult WP:CONSENSUS for ideas about how we can better work together.  But before consensus-based editing, the first step to working together is agreeing to abide by the content policies, NPOV, NOR, and V.    |  Talk 

I agree that """"whether the material satisfies those policies should be determined not just by an individual editor but by consensus,"""" but consensus does not mean unanimity (according to the policy), it is a process of collaboration.  And to participate in this process everyone has to agree that """"if content is a notable significant and verifiable view from a reliable source it will go in even if I do not like it,"""" if they cannot say this, and mean it, they are not participating in a consensus process.  And some people above have argued that content should not go in even if it is notable, verifiable, and from a reliable source.  Those people are not participating in a consensus-building process.    |  Talk 19:51, 6""",0

 Felice Beato 
Thanks for your message. I am delighted, that you are pleased that it got translated into German.

To my literature, a large encoclypedia on the history of photography, Felice Beato got naturalised as a British person in the 1860s.

"As Roland perceptively noted, Sand's book is not so much propositive of a theory, as deconstructive of theories about a people. The most invaluable part of the book consists of a perfectly normal historian's history, i.e., of the socio-ideological forces influencing the construction of a modern collective Jewish identity. In this I am reminded of Martin Bernal. His propositive theory, which however took up far more space than Sand dedicates to the Khazars, was almost self-evidently silly. But his analysis in volume 1 of the modern historiography of ancient Greece as that was influenced by racial theory, is still regarded as a tour de force. One doesn't throw the baby out with the barfwater. As to genetics, Sand himself deals with that pp.273ff., and in so far as RS reviews challenge him on this, they cannot be excluded, even if, it's just a personal view, many of those reviews are incompetent and show a lack of familiarity with the book. The criterion should be, genetic criticism or evaluation of Sand should be admitted if Sand's book is specifically targeted or mentioned by those papers, and ignored if not. What should not happen is the application of a double-standard.",0

xkcd

Hey!  A fan pointed me over to where you had deleted the line about my working for NASA from the short article on me (Randall Munroe), labeling it """"patently made-up information"""".  Understandable and taken in good humor, of course, and nothing on the page is sourced (it's more of a stub than anything).  But I'm curious why you were so sure it was fabricated.  )  xkcd
I find it hard to believe that a 22-year-old could have been working full-time for NASA. Of course, you may well be freakishly gifted and the kind of person that NASA would have been all over, but it just seems ever so slightly hard to believe.  - Schreit mich an 
I interned there during college and started working for them a bit before I graduated.  I stayed for the better part of a year until late 2006.  NASA is a huge organization with a tremendous number of contract positions on all sorts of projects.  It's not all rocket scientists leaning over mission control screens and talking to astronauts on their headsets.

Anyway, the information is taken from my published bio page, but you're right  you have no way of knowing whether I'm lying or not.  I guess it's probably safest to assume that I am.
In that case, I'll admit my mistake and congratulate you on interning and working in a pretty impressive place (I know very little about science, but anyone who got to work for NASA has got to be a smart cookie in that kind of area). Feel free to re-add the info, although the impression I got from the original version was more than you weren't just a contract worker. If that's not even a valid distinction in the States - it's increasingly less of one here in Oz - then my apologies there in advance.  - Schreit mich an 
 Honestly, they never really explained to me which one I was.  I went to work every day in a building at NASA where I worked on NASA robots, and NASA paid me (through a government contractor).  When I said """"I work for NASA"""" no one argued.

 It was a lot more Dilbert-esque than you would expect.  Old, echoing tile hallways with quiet, gruff middle-aged men working at blueprint-covered desks, mild office politics, lots of presentations and buzzwords, and hours spent wading through computer code trying to figure out why the motor on the lab bench was spinning the wrong way.  I thought it sounded like the perfect place to work, and it was good in a lot of ways, but I was happy to leave.  xkcd

 Can you nominate my entry 

Hey BigHaz, can you please show me how the nomination process goes for DYK, I mean is it nominated the same way like featured articles are nominated. Actually, this thing is new to me. Thanks  
Sure thing. The way it works is that your nomination which you made is called the """"hook"""". That gets put onto the Suggestions page, which I'll move it to in a moment. Over the next few days, people will make various comments about it - if the """"hook"""" is too long, if it needs sources, whatever else. If you're able to respond to those comments (if there are any made), then your article might get selected.  - Schreit mich an 
 By suggestion pages you mean to say talk pages or what  
  
It's not easy to do that, since the suggestions are cleared from the page after they get onto the front page, so I really can't just point you to a page and say """"here you are"""". What particularly do you want to see? If you're after examples of the kinds of comments people make, just keep an eye on the Suggestions page.  - Schreit mich an

If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Polyurethane - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay.

Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

Personally, I agree with the general usage, like I said, I think its much of the same reason that the history is a separate page and text submission isn't credited in the article either - accessibility, readability and standardization.  I don't see a compelling reason yet to change the guidelines - in this case, there was another free image available without the caption concern.

Someone made this edit saying that Minneapolis had one of the lowest high school graduation rates in Minnesota, citing this page from the Minnesota Department of Education.

I'm not exactly sure if some of the other school districts listed are actually charter schools or some special vocational school districts.

Regardless, I think an explanation of the school graduation rate should be listed within Minneapolis Public Schools, since they're the responsible school district, and the data should be better qualified as to exactly which districts are selected within that sampling.

After an email correspondance with Prof. Gil-White himself about this claim, I recieved the following response:

Dear Ryan,

In reply to your question concerning somebody's claim on my wiki page that
I was fired by Jared Israel from Emperor's Clothes, this is false. I was
never fired by Jared Israel because I was nevery in his employ. There was
never a contract that made Jared Israel my employer. My work for Emperor's
Clothes was volunteer work. Jared Israel and I had some differences and I
quit. Moreover, since I was supporting Jared Israel and Emperor's Clothes
financially, at the time, if anything it was I who employed Jared Israel. I
have the email that I sent him, in which I quit, if Wikipedia needs to see
it. But the whole thing seems rather irrelevant to me, and I doubt that
every personal dispute a person has with another person needs to be on
Wikipedia.

Best,

Francisco Gil-White

I have therefore removed all mention of such a firing, and I think it is best if the particular claims about Steven wise and the shoah, etc. be kept on the blog discussion pages they are on, as they don't seem too relevant to this biographical page.

As a further note, please keep all major edits on the discussion page before changing the bio.

"Thanks for getting back so quickly. That makes sense to me – no worries, and glad you approve of the rest of the article. However, I'm wondering if you're aware of the fact that there are some stringent policies about conflicts of interest on Wikipedia, to ensure that articles reflect a neutral point of view. You might like to read through Wikipedia:Conflict of interest, which gives you a run-down of this whole area. The aim is to try to maintain the encyclopaedic nature of Wikipedia, and ensure it doesn't get used for advertising or biased opinions.

The reason I asked about a reference was because of the policy outlined in Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons – there are no particular problems with your statement about the book in this article, but in general all statements in articles about living people need to be verifiable via citations to reliable published sources. This protects people like you from unfounded statements and rumours that could otherwise appear in your article (since everyone can edit Wikipedia).

"My edits
I rewrote somewhat to avoid a combining of the traditions of different parts of Polynesia. I also tried to change the emphasis in the opening line to Pulotu as 'Polynesian mythology' which gives the mistaken impression that the concept is found all over Polynesia. It is important to maintain the separation of the individual traditions - otherwise we are at risk of rewriting the traditions. The association made with the Māori concepts of Hawaiki and Te Reinga I thought was taking it a little too far - Hawaiki is not always/often conceived of that way by my people. I also took out a reference to 'Purotu' since there was no evidence offered that the word occuring in that form means underworld. I also took out the reference to Pulotu having changed in Tahitian to purotu meaning a girl of marrying age. The word occurs in many Eastern Polynesian languages with the meaning beautiful:

HAW   Puuloku. Comely, tender (Pki)@
MAO   Purotu. Handsome, clear, pleasant (Wms)@
MVA   Porotu. Beauty, handsome person (Bck)@
PEN   Purotu. Beautiful (Rsn)@
PUK   Pulotu. Beautiful (Bge).
RAR   Purotu. Pleasant, pleasing, agreeable (Sve)@
TAH   Purotu. Joli, beau (Mte)@
TUA   Purotu. Slightly handsome, attractive (Stn)@

 I am not sure if I understand your reply above correctly:
 UNSD uses the term  """"statistics divisions""""  ( I agree, but the term refers to division(s) in the UN headquarter or agencies in different countries, NOT a specific way of geographic divisions of the world.)
 You still prefer previous title (i.e. """"United Nations statistical divisions"""") to the current one (i.e. """"United Nations geoscheme"""")?
If so, please allow me to repeat a bit on the following:
 The term """"Statistics Division""""(capitalized singular form) in the UN context refers to the organization of United Nations Statistics Division with the website at unstats.un.org.
 The term """"statistical divisions""""(plural form) can mean any categorization schemes, not just geographical ones. Google this: """"statistical divisions"""" site:un.org
 The term """"statistical divisions""""(plural form) can ALSO mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments.  Google this: """"statistical divisions"""" site:un.org
Therefore, it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term """"statistical divisions"""", or the wrong organization term  """"Statistics Division"""" to refer to UN M.49 . UN statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the UN system, or imply that there are certain UN statistical categorization schemes in a general sense (not geographical). 

I agree that UN geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and ALSO mapping. Natural Earth has region_un and subregion metadata for each country. I use it quiet often. It is why I notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization/classification scheme as """"UN geoscheme"""". Try Google BOOK search and you will find at least the following:
""""The best option to identify the states from Asia could be use the United Nations (UN) geoscheme for Asia. As per this, Asia is subdivided to four broad categories:....""""
""""The UN geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States; conversely, the European Union excludes Belize and Mexico from its definition of the region ....""""
""""Country groups are based on UN Geoscheme and World Bank regional classification.""""
""""...were grouped into regions and subregions based on the United Nations Geoscheme (http://unstats.un.org /unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm)""""
""""... that the United Nations Statistics Division would later classify as Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and Southeastern Asia according to its geoscheme. In fact ...""""

I also agree that many UN agencies (in fact, many other reports, consultancies, etc. have different """"statistical divisions"""" (in the general sense of categorization schemes) for research. This is exactly why I believe the term """"UN geoscheme"""" is better. Although it is NOT official term or a technical term (UN M.49), I have not yet found an ambigous use of the term. Correct me if I am wrong on this, so far every online and academic citations that I have found when the term  """"UN geoscheme"""" is used, it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in UN M.49 .

 Why will Gwen Gale not read the sources? 

On 01:27, 5 August 2010 I posted a section on """"Talk: Death of Adolf Hitler"""" titled “Random Questions” which started “I am not a scholar, I read Wiki but would not think of editing it. But I was disappointed in this article, and many points in the discussion, so I am asking some questions. Perhaps someone else will read and address them.” The section went on with several rethoritical questions, and ended with “As to sources, the last books I have read are The Murder of Adolph Hitler by Hugh Thomas (sort of shaky) and The Last Days of Hitler by Anton Joachimsthaler (English translation, I buy much of this).”

Gwen Gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator, because at  she replied with: ”As the article lead says,...This said, this talk page isn't a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic, it's meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. I say this because the article seems to already cover, with thorough citations, most if not all of what you've brought up...dodgy. Gwen Gale (talk)”

By this reply it appears that Gwen Gale is NOT FAMILIAR with the work of Joachimsthaler, who I have just referenced, and thinks that I am asking a personal question, not a rhetorical one. At that time I apologized, tried to explain myself, and restate my questions.

At  I posted” If I had read Kershaw's Nemesis Chapter 17 note 156 and Epilogue note 1 I wouldn't have wasted your time. You can't get much clearer than that. Should be required reading. Perhaps someone else should read them, and possibly edit the article. Thank you for your time.99.41.251.5 (talk)”

At  I posted “I would like to direct people to the work of Ian Kershaw Hitler, 1939-1945: Nemesis ISBN 0393322521. Chapter 17 and the epilogue relate to this article. Please pay attention to his notes and sources. Be warned, his book Hitler: a Biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....The source Joachimsthaler is basically an English translation of a German's analysis of 1950's post-Soviet interviews of bunker survivors. The original transcripts must be available somewhere. There are many other bunker interviews, some with questionable intent, and not all agree. Wm5200 (talk)“

Since those posts I have posted a huge amount on the talk page, virtually all of which Gwen Gale has disputed. Much of the material I have posted I have later deleted, often because I felt that the endless conflict between Gwen Gale and myself is counterproductive to the article. 

Anyone who is Wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. Was I sometimes rude and argumentative? Absolutely. Was I making legitimate points which related to the article? I thought so. Did I receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? I think not, but you judge.

My main point was that Joachimsthaler had reviewed the information, and had made a solid case for positions which Kershaw backed. I repeatedly begged anyone, especially Gwen Gale, to read Joachimsthaler and Kershaw, specifically, two footnotes, I even told the pages of the footnotes. Gwen Gale clearly had not read either source.

 I posted, under the heading “Question for Gwen Gale” , the following: ”I lost you, but I’m confused myself. It appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.

My very low budget suburb is in a system which serves 225,000 people with 4 MILLION titles (numbers approximate, thanks Carol).

If someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion, that also should be addressed...I know that this is P.O.V., and that I am personally involved.

"My preference: to show how the equation of motion is derived

What is represented in the animation that gives the straight-above view is that the overall rotation affects the vibration; the dynamics falls in the category of coupled oscillators.

I believe that an encyclopedic article that features a mathematical treatment should focus on the derivation. In the material that I have prepared the mathematical treatment starts with first principles, and subsequently works its way towards the equation of motion:

Once the equation of motion is formulated the physics has been taken care of, and I proceed no further.

"Entry of Akhter Munir Marwat 

You yourself mentioned that Khan Habibullah Khan Fakhr-e-Marwat was no qualm a prominent and great Marwat. So you should know that Akhtar Munir Khan Marwat is his son and being a Captain (Retired), currently an Additional secretary to Government of Pakistan is quite famous, prominent and notable Marwats.

I met almost 500 Marwats in past 7 weeks and all of them told me that Akhtar Munir Marwat is well known to them. Even many were politically opponent to him or his family but they presented their salutation for him.

If there are 500 Marwat Civil Servants, could you name them that how many are working in Grade 21, at the present? Are they so famous as Akhtar Munir? Are they all sons of Khan Habibullah Khan? Do all of them held the same positions as he held?

Now, let me answer one thing. That Separate entry for Akhter Munir was deleted, no doubt. But this is not separate entry. There are thousands of names, entries mentioned in various articles but they themselves are not prominent to be having a separate article.

You are vandalising this page, I am sorry. As I immensely challenge you here, to prove that if Dil Jan Khan ever went to be a Federal Secretary? You yourself know better that he was an Additional Secretary to Ministry of Interior but he was unable to share Federal Secretary-ship. But you love to vandalise.

I am worried, that when this topic was locked, still after directives from administration, you never replied any of my discussion, suggestion here on this talk page and you kept quite.

It was you who must have talked before editing.

Don't vandalise this article, my brother, as this is not the property of Ghazni Khels who even are unable to protect the property of their ancestors.",0

Meagan Meagan Hey Meagan, I think Kathleen covered most of the stuff I was going to say. But in your third guideline, theres a sentence that begins with """"Choosing: choosing"""" I think it's a great point, but I'm not quite sure that the way that it is worded fits with the rest of your guideline. I would either make """"Choosing"""" stick out a little differently, or just get rid of the """"Choosing:"""" introductiong to the sentence and begin it with """"Choosing the more..""""

Overall I think you guys have all done a great job! I just kinda looked at some rewording issues because your content is great! Congrats girls, we're almost done! Tianna   

Shannon's Editing Comments:

Hello  I loved your beginning section on social support and found the definition of social support to be very helpful in my understanding. However, your second paragraph was a little too wordy for my liking and difficult to remain interested. Also, in your third paragraph """"with these types of communication.."""" you did not mention any types of communication before, and therefore you cannot use these, until after explaining each type of communication.  Finally, I would suggested maybe making your points in your verbal/non-verbal method section bulleted. Overall, you added great information to our article, take my suggestions as you wish.   

Hello  You added some great information, I am just concerned that it is all from one source, or have you not quite finished adding your additional citations? I really love your choice of bolding and italicizing your guidelines, however guideline three is not separate from guideline two, nor is it bold/italic. Finally there us a Which, in your final guildline that should not be capitalized. Great work Meagan, take my advice as you wish.   

Hello  You have made some great additions to our article, especially the use of the General Adaptive Syndrome. However, in stage three, stressor is missing a letter (small typo). You had a great point of how inadequate sleep leads to irritability, however, I suggest that you change """"less inclined to communicate"""" to less inclined to communicate effectively. Also, in your section of language barrier, you used the word intercultural, I believe interlingual is a more suitable term as culture is not only defined by language. For instance citizens of Quebec, have Canadian culture despite speaking a different language than most Canadians. Finally, the point on imaginary friend, might be a little far-fetched, but it would be fine to leave if you see fit. Great work overall!   

Thanks for the tips Shannon. I used them all! The interlingual suggestions was perfect!   23:""",0
"""In the olympics section, it mentions him as being one of the few """"Chinese ...""""  

He's American. Nothing else. His nationality is American. You guys are debating his ethnicity. 

My understanding is that he's """"外生人“ －but his parents are from Taiwan while his grandparents are from China.  I'm really not sure what the debate here is about. He's American. Honestly, their all Chinese American. People that are debating on whether someone is taiwanese american really need to drop the debate. It's in nobody's interest for Taiwan to be completely independent and even the ROC politicians know that. Drop the Taiwan / Chinese debate please.

"Animal deaths==
I've added an animal deaths section. This article definitely reads like an advertisement (I also added that tag) and I believe this will help rectify that. There's too much focus on the aesthetics of the park, prices and attractions and not much focus on the history. The park does have a less than positive history when it comes to animal cruelty even compared to other marine parks like Sea World. The Animal deaths section can be expanded as I believe there are more marine animal deaths (and perhaps land animal deaths) I haven't found. This section could perhaps be expanded into a 'Criticisms of Marineland' section or perhaps even its own article if there's enough material. I'd be willing to support that venture. Drop me a line if you want to help out!

 Continuation of original AfC discussion 

 Thank you for putting inline citation into the lead. 
 Primary sources are discouraged by the guideline delineated on WP:MEDRS. The rational behind this is discussed in detail on that page. This policy is the result of a period of evolution after several years of community discussion. If you disagree with that policy, the correct place to raise your concerns would be on the talk page for the guideline. While that guideline stands however, please let me assure you that the primary sources need to be removed, and if possible replaced with reliable secondary and tertiary sources. If no replacement sources are available, then the content is not notable [yet] for wikipedia. This does not mean that the content is irrelevant on a wider stage (e.g. in scientific circles), but Wikipedia has guidelines for what is notable enough for inclusion in the encyclopedia entries.

"TO: Sushi Leone
>The value of human life is absolute and indefeasible ( and so are human rights). To deny it systematically is nothing else but inhuman relativism that leads to totalitarism.
That is right. Thus put the number of other nation death close to German casulties. Putting the numbers separately suggests you “selective” intentions. One cry about his looses and forgot about the offended party casualties. I say put first think first. I proposed to mark in first sentence that the expulsion was direct result of Nazi German aggression and unprecedented savagery. Is not truth?
>When someone tries to rape a child or to burn it alive and you do not help it because your intervention depends on the ethnic background of the child, I would seriously question your moral integrity!
That is right. Unfortunately German Nazi did it and why? Germans supported Hitler so much or what? Why the Germans did not stop Hitler before he got to much power? Etc. etc. That question the ethic of all nation is not it? And, are you referring by some accident to others then the Nazis actions? Where is the proof that some bandits of Polish nationality did it? Do not you accuses others for German Nazi attitude just for “moral” confort?
>The same when you help to conceal this incident – that would be a ( retrospective ) participation in this incident or at least an act of aiding and a betting it.
You are damn right? So what is you explanation to Hitler success? Why he was not stopped before WW II started?
>But this article is not about moral philosophy, it is supposed to be an objective description of a specific issue – based on quantitative research. And it should be left to the reader to come to a ( subjective ) conclusion.
I do not think the spreading of ESTIMATIOM is quantitative research. I challenge you to provide international research result. And about the subjective reader conclusion, let me remain you Dr. G. says: “A lie repeated many times become truth.”

In particular, has some criticism from people who are to MoveOn's left, something that is missing from the article as it stands. Among others, it quotes John Stauber to the effect that MoveOn has become """"primarily a money-raising and marketing arm of the Pelosi wing of the Democratic Party.""""

Well, I'm not going to get into an edit war over it. However, out of interest I checked 22 other bios on similar individuals. All were culled from links here: School massacre. Three of twenty-two mentioned ethnicity. Two of twenty-two mentioned religious affiliation of some sort. Zero of twenty-two mentioned both ethnicity and religion. So I suppose there is some sort of precedent although it doesn't seem to be applied evenly. I'm not sure what valuable knowledge is imparted by providing information about the religious affiliations of someone's parents.

I entertained her at being interested in getting a tarot card reading. As she drank a drink on the phone, had her TV volume up very loud, was talking to """"homeboys"""" in the background she told me all sorts of prices.

Just as plain as day it clicked.

Stephanie Adams is a 2 bit whore that WAS in PlayBoy, is NOT now in PlayBoy, is now a NOTHING and is trying very HARD to become a something by creating small websites all over the internet that make her LOOK like something.

IE: The so called Public Release about her that was done suppossedley by a person named Saphica (Who is in fact 100% verified Stephanie Adams)

After I told her I was not interested in any of her services she was very upset and hung up on me. I have watched this entry on to Wiki now for almost 3 months.

I did my fact checking, which NO ONE here has done.

Her books ARE NOT IN PRINT.
They are DOWNLOADABLE ONLY.
She made them with Cafe Press Instant Publicshing.

ANYONE here could write a """"book""""

The books of hers at Amazon.com, try to order one, it takes you to her homepage. Amazon cannot sell the book because it DOESN'T EXIST.

Do some fact checking. The user Goddessy has about 15 sock puppets on here, anyone with half a brain can see it. User Goddesssy IS IN FACT Stephanie Adams. And for all you admins that think making changes to her entry and kissing her butt will make a difference, she's doing this ALL OVER THE NET.

Hi, I've  to get users to multi-license all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike  (CC-by-sa) v1.0 and v2.0 Licenses or into the public domain if they prefer.  The CC-by-sa license is a true free documentation license that is similar to Wikipedia's license, the GFDL, but it allows other projects, such as WikiTravel, to use our articles.  Since you are among the top 1000 Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at minimum those on the geographic articles.  Over 90% of people asked have agreed.  For More Information:
Multi-Licensing FAQ - Lots of questions answered
Multi-Licensing Guide

To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" template into their user page, but there are other options at Template messages/User namespace.  The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page:

Eleland made a unilateral decision about all this and was quite perturbed when I reinstated the article. Eleland proceeded to get into a deletion war, would not entertain discussion prior to making wholesale deletions, and then contacted administration to have the sections struck out. Please check discussion for Admin's response. I do not question anything said by Manning, however it does not appear that he has looked at the sources as thoroughly as Fluri. Also Eleland placed warnings on the article regarding the veracity of the citations.

Admittedly, I have responded vigorously in discussion, but only to protect the material that had already been checked by Fluri. Anyway it appears that Eleland is on a messianic crusade to have it struck off the record. This is somewhat surprising given Eleland's herculean efforts to include material about Israel on the Caterpillar.Inc issue. Clearly Eleland is not the impartial arbiter that he would have us believe under """"Ed O'Loughlin"""" but a bit of an anti-Israel activist himself.

This is perhaps strange considering, and I quote Eleland in the discussion on Caterpillar Inc.: Editors must not remove information about an argument because they personally disagree with the argument. Wikipedia must include all notable points of view which appear in verifiable published sources. Reporting that activists have said something does not imply that the activists are correct. Removing those reports because you think the activists aren't correct contradicts Wikipedia's core policies. Eleland

 2 items of work on the """"making the case"""" section 

The discussion immediately above (regarding how to incorporate Obama's presidential re-election statements regarding the jobs bill) and how we do it.
The paragraph needs a sentence at the beginning, something benign & innocuous like """"President Obama took his case to the American public and toured 00 universities and 00 public speaking events across various states."""" then it rolls into the next sentence """"He has appeared before constituents of Eric Cantor's congressional district to press the Congress to pass his bill immediately.""""

Making the case
President Obama appeared before constituents of Eric Cantor's congressional district to press the Congress to pass his bill immediately. On September 12, he gave a speech in the White House Rose Garden in front of a group of teachers, police officers, construction workers and small-business owners in which he stated that """"if Congress does not act, just about every family in America will pay more taxes next year. That would be a self-inflicted wound that our economy just cannot afford right now."""" In Speaker Boehner's home state of Ohio, Obama gave a speech described as """"fiery"""" in a Columbus high school that led to the audience chanting: """"Pass this bill!"""" In a campaign-style rally at North Carolina State University, Obama told college students """"Every single one of you can help make this bill a reality. … The time for hand-wringing is over. The time for moping around is over. We've got to kick off our bedroom slippers and put on our marching shoes."""" At a black-tie dinner for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, Obama pitched his jobs plan to Latinos. In anticipation of criticism that the legislation was motivated by the upcoming election, the President noted that the election is fourteen months away and that Americans do not have the luxury of waiting fourteen months for jobs to be created.

Re item #1 I propose we tack it onto the very end of the paragraph with a sentence like """"Some of the criticism refers to Obama's own remarks, including past statements that he will (blank blank blank)"""" (I won't complete the sentence, but just letting you overlook my generalized proposal.) We could even take off the final sentence that is there now, and I could incorporate via some other measure. I'm a very good writer, and don't want to over-invest before I get more feedback at this point. 
As an aside, I plan to do some work Tuesday to help explain the backstory to the """"Related bill"""" section, because it fails to tell the reader the funny story (i.e. that a witty republican thought he could steal the """"antecedent"""" referred to by Obama's """"pronoun"""" because Obama was saying to pass a bill which had not yet been trademarked, so that witty republican guy trademarked the patent before Obama's people could register the name). That will require a better source than just newser and the daily caller. That will be Tuesday's work, so I just wanted to tip my hat off on what's next. On Wednesday/Thursday I'd like to create the Yuan article, then by Friday we can incorporate this week's major updates to this article, which c",0

 """"Certaion Other Editors"""" 

 MB,
 I noted your question on SqueakBox's page and figured that I was """"certain other editors"""". I was only """"eager"""" to vote opposite because, as I would support the RFA, it seemed as though SqueakBox's jumping-the-gun needed some balance. It might have been a little POINT-y, literally copying the words and formatting and all, but that was the point of the point. How could it """"look"""" like it was live? I went to the main RfA page and his was not listed. I agree with the others that Squeak had to be watching or stalking for this so as to attack it at its earliest possibility. His """"oppose"""" was two minutes - TWO MINUTES - after the """"I accept"""" was put on the page, and as has been point out, long before it was officially live.
 Anyway, I have seen him in discussions and don't always agree with him, but I support the RfA. As for off-wiki happenings, that's part of the problem with having them... it strengthens the """"secret society"""" feeling that a lot of people seem to have (from the oft-made references to """"The Cabal"""" - something I have never made reference to).
 FWIW, I have nothing against you. I have worked hard in the past to work with SqueakBox as well, even making consessions to try and smooth things over. For my trouble, I have been blocked for making general statements while enduring pointedly direct, targeted personal attacks. Anyway, . I'm working on being less WikiDragon-ish and to stay out of WikiPolitics (at least not be involved as much as I have - less WikiStress).
 I know that doesn't help understand why SB voted oppose, but now you understand why I voted in support when I did... I support the RfA, though, because I have confidence in Martijn and his ability. For the record.  •   •  • 03:07 (UTC)  27 Mar '08 -)""",0

But this phenomenon makes total sense when we take into account the fact that this """"sham"""" acupuncture is not analogous to placebo at all, but in fact is strikingly similar to a very authentic traditional style of Japanese acupuncture (shallow needle insertion/non-penetration, alternate acupoint and meridian location, etc) that has been in common use for centuries are is still widely practiced to this very day.

The fact is, acupuncture is effective, and its silly to even try to test it against a placebo in the first place, because its not a pill or a drug or a substance that lends itself to such methodology. 

So what if some of acupuncture's effects originate in the mind? TCM theory itself states that, in therapy """"the mind leads the qi, the qi leads the blood"""", indeed predicting itself the main criticism that fanatic skeptic extremists have against it.

Its time to realise that Chinese Medicine is a valuable body of knowledge and lore, and to end the racism and xenophobia that insists that only Western culture is capable of developing an effective system of medicine.

You also might want to talk to him about accusatory statements such as this one, personally pointing me out by name. I never did anything comparable to this. Is this in accordance with your policy of """"we discuss articles, not users""""???? 

As for the unsourced tag, it's been discussed in the talk page. The article does not provide any sources discussing the subject of the article. All the sources provided are about other ethnic groups, but they make side comments that have been taken out context and are contradictory to some of the other statements appearing on the page. The article is on Iranian peoples, so it should contain at least one source discussing who these people are. Such a source has yet to be provided. 

I think the article was initially meant to be written on the linguistic group of all speakers of Iranian languages, but the definition has changed considerably due to some misunderstandings (Iran is also the name of a country and some Iranian citizens see themselves as part of a greater ethnic group, that of """"Iranian peoples"""" - see the article on Greater Iran for signs of this). I'm not sure what's the best way to move on from here. The article definitely has to be rewritten with a clear definition in mind, but a lot of users are not being cooperative. I'd consider any advice or mediation. Thanks, Talk

"Hey Cjchan2016, it looks like you got some good material and flow started in your sandbox, and simply require some touch-ups on Wikipedia algorithms to remove any excess notations.

"Dating the exoudus 
I added this over in the book of Joshua section and it has relavence here:
There is now a theory postulated by Dr. Gerald E. Aardsma and Dr. Emmanuel Anati that states the occupation of Palestine by the Israelites occurred prior to the late Bronze Age as had been originally theorized. Doctors Aardsma and Anati say they have found evidence to support Joshua’s conquest occurring in the early Bronze Age at around 2200-2500 B.C. They state that both a settlement bearing topographical similarity to the biblical city of “Ai” and the city of Jericho were destroyed in this time frame and that both sites had defensive walls at this time. In addition, it was found the city of “Ai” was burned to the ground at this time, which fits the events in the Book of Joshua. Furthermore, it has been found that at this time the previous inhabitants of the areas around these cities gave way to a more nomadic people with different types of pottery than the original inhabitants and which developed into a pastoral society dominated by small villages. All of this would more accurately reflect what was recorded in the Biblical accounts of Joshua’s invasion, but it also conflicts with some of the Bible’s Old Testament chronology. Dr. Aardsma argues the Old Testament chronology must be an incorrect recording of the original chronological information.

This argument has a profound effect on dating the exodus since it would mean the Israelites would have left for Palestine just after the end of the Egyptian Old Kingdom, maybe even during its downfall. It would also push the age of the patriarchs back to about 2800-3000 B.C. which would mean any evidence of Joseph would need to be found in the Early Dynastic Period. I referenced Anati's article and Aardsman book over in the book of Joshua section. Last time I checked Anati's article was free to peruse online.",0

Notes for the blind communist Castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man himself

There seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize Castro for what he is. But not to worry. History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer.
There is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. 
Castro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. 
You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! 
But you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. 
You claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. 

""""Right""""!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! 
It amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.
Do not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. 
You do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  
You must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.
This is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! 
That is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, 
he(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.

Ask yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?

Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. 
 
Castro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. 

For you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime. How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution? how much intolerance! how many times he has sell out his """"principles"""".

You should not make any kind of link between them on-wiki, but equally it would be imperative that you privately communicate the link to AC and assure them that you intend to respect the restrictions applicable to your current name while they are in force.  Assure AC that you reject the imputations of proxy-editing in the past and give them your assurance that you will be sure not to do anything of the kind in the future.

This article, once completed satisfactorily, will simply be a repository of verifiable facts about slaughterhouses, their genesis, their necessity (as it stands right now in our modern world), and their operating procedures.

Checking the history of Irving Kupcinet's career will establish who was familiar with him.  I believe you are arguing just to be arguing.  

Washington, DC might not have been a mecca for Hollywood movies in 1963, but it was a respectable newspaper market where Irving Kupcinet would have loved to gain more readers.  But he didn't.  His column never reached that city.  All the way until he retired in 2001, very few people in the DC area gave a damn who he was or who his Hollywood friends were.  I was there.  And I can prove Kup's column never was.  If you don't want to be """"little known"""" outside of Chicago, then you better make friends in DC.  It's the Shakespeare capital of the Western Hemisphere because of all the pressure to succeed academically and in public service, but it still has migrants from Illinois  the land of Kupcinet and his name dropping.  Do you know how many people have to work for a congressman or a senator ?  Yet these Illinois people in DC could not read Kup's column when they got homesick.  They couldn't introduce other DC people to Kup's column.  

He was little known outside Chicago, indeed.  So he had something on a network for six months on which Carolyn Jones appeared ?  That's nothing.  In the 1950s the networks were begging for commentators to go on live television, and they came and went without any impact.  Carolyn Jones needed all the exposure she could get.  Her career wasn't on the level of Audrey Hepburn's.

My addition to the article allows that Kupcinet was well - known in Chicago and Los Angeles.  Elsewhere he was a ship passing in the night. News flash: there was no Internet when Karyn Kupcinet died.

Let's see someone other than Wildhartlivie say Irving Kupcinet was well-known outside Chicago and Los Angeles.  Wildhartlivie did a great job on the man's resume, but let's be realistic about who would have given a damn about his daughter's death a month after it happened.   """,0

Political question?
I not sure if this is """"political;"""" and in fact, I'm hoping it is not ....  

At WP:AN/I, you suggested a """"fresh start"""" in the context of a discussion I have not followed.  My interest is only in that term  where did it come from?  This term does not appear to be associated with any Wikipedia conventions.  Fresh start (an anti-Maastricht Treaty group within the British Conservative Party opposed to the Maastricht Treaty) and Fresh Start (detergent) (a  Colgate-Palmolive laundry product) are unrelated.  If it's just a term you've introduced in this unique setting and nowhere else, fine.  I just wondered.

I attempted to use a similar concept in a military-related setting  at Talk:Hyūga helicopter destroyer#RESET, but it fell on deaf ears.  In retrospect, it seems likely that it would have made no difference if there had been a pre-existing link to Reset (military term); but perhaps it may make a difference in future.  

The political question has to do with this military term.  How do """"depoliticize"""" the article I'm about to create.  It seems likely that there may be numbers of editors and users for whom American military terminology becomes a priori political before it's even possible to reach the content threshold which implies something like your """"fresh start?""""  

As a general rule, most of the new Wikipedia articles I've created have to do with pre-Meiji Japan, and this odd, overly-sensitive hesitation simply doesn't arise.  However, I'm not unaware of those critical voices on the francophone internet decrying the American bias in the World Wide Web; and I've noticed similar comments across a range of English-language Wikipedia articles.  Other than searching for British and Commonwealth military specialists in an effort to discover a congruent British and commonwealth term, can you think of something off-hand which might be relevant in creating an article which would have broader usefulness in Wikipedia contexts like you yourself created?

A further point: I really like the term """"fresh start""""  not as much as """"reset"""".  Can you foresee any reason why I shouldn't re-name the article about the British activists in the 80's as Fresh Start (British politics).  This would leave something like """"your"""" fresh start in the primary position.  

Final question: When I noticed your sub-heading, my first-blush plan was to create """"Fresh start"""" as a re-direct page; but now that I think about it, maybe the perceived """"political"""" problems with an article about an American military term would be diminished if the article itself were entitled """"Fresh start""""  with """"Reset"""" as a re-direct page?

Freud's ideas are certainly much discussed today, and I would be the first to agree that they must be grappled with and dealt with seriously, if only because of their currency.  So Freud deserves a long and thorough article in Wikipedia.  I believe that a balanced article would include A) explanations of Freud's theories, and B) the status of Freudianism today.  The existing article is quite thorough on """"A"""" and had almost nothing on """"B"""".  A neophyte who read the article as it stood a month ago would imagine that Freud's work has the same relation to current psychology that Darwin's work has to current biology.  

Let's compare them:  Darwinism thoroughly permeates modern biology, and his fundamentals, built on copious observation and collegial collaboration, now much extended with new data and new theories, continue to provide accurate predictions and fruitful avenues of exploration.  Freud's fundamental ideas were founded on minimal and dubious observations, and his theories do not meet the test of being logical, minimal, reproducible explanations of the data.  As far as Jung goes, I haven't gotten to him yet  ), and I don't know anything about Maslow.  Freud draws my fire precisely because he is so high profile, so influential, and so wrong.  I was required to study The Interpretation of Dreams in high school as if it were scientific fact, and the disgust I felt when I later realized it was all as stupid as it sounded has turned me into - yes - a Freud critic.  Of course, I am striving for NPOV.  Do you really feel that presenting Freud's pseudoscience without comment is NPOV, whereas quoting one of many eminent critics is not?   21:55, 14 Sep 2003 (UTC)""",0

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh",1

 Re: I've moved List of Samurai Shodown characters to a user sub-page. 

That's all well and good, but I have one major objection: present tense is how we discuss legend and literature in the English language, even if they never did happen, and even if it is a retelling of the distant past (see , for example). Unless there is a WP guideline for fiction that I am seriously missing, the present tense is correct. -NOOO 
Nonsense. If this is being done absolutely to-the-letter correct, it should be very clear when things are taking place (and I don't think it's going to be that hard, considering how little backstory most characters have). It would be something like:
In SS5, character is looking for blah.
In SS, character is motivated by meh.
Prior to SS2, character is on trip to ___ and does not make appearance.
In SS2, character etc. etc.
Granted, I'm nowhere near done revising the entire damn article, but what can I do? I'm busy in real life. Kind of on the """"if I don't haul butt right now, I will not stay in school"""" level. -NOOO

Speedy deletion of Bivattchee
 A tag has been placed on Bivattchee requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for musical topics. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. -  (Talk to me)

"""==Correct and True Etymology of English words """"Myth, Mythology""""==
Greek μυθολογια """"legend, storytelling"""" is derived from μυθος """"speech, thought, story, myth"""", itself of unknown origin. English mythology is in use since the 15th century, in the meaning """"an exposition of myths"""". The current meaning of """"body of myths"""" itself dates to 1781 (OED). The adjective mythical dates to 1678; English use of myth is later, first attested in 1830, in its original English meaning of """"untrue story"""":

""""These two stories are very good illustrations of the origin of myths, by means of which, even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous history."""" Westminster Review 12:44 (1830)

This is the earliest known usage of """"myth"""" in English. In case anyone didn't know, in 1830 English """"fabulous"""" doesn't mean """"wonderfully aesthetic"""", it is the adjectival form of """"fable"""", that is referring to a fantasy or fairytale.  In 1830 the term """"myth"""" was new, so it carries what we call a gloss, things """"by means of which even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous (i.e., fictional) history."""".  This was not only the original use of the word, but the original academic use of the word, note the source, Westminster Review. That is still the way most all people define """"myth"""" today.  It's for reasons like this, that Wikipedia is so notorious for its mental disconnect with mainstream thought, and its enforced use of its own internal terminology / jargon, or to put it less nicely, doublespeak.  (ውይይት) 

In 2005, a single-purpose account added """"mythology categories"""" to a wide range of articles including Death and Resurrection of Jesus, Virgin Birth, and Transubstantiation, creating a huge uproar.  The outcome of the discussions then was overwhelmingly to reject the categories as imflammatory and inappropriate.  It was agreed at that time that theological and scriptural articles do not fall into the category of """"mythology"""" and today, none of these articles are so categorised, apart from Noah's Ark.  

Just last month, WP:RELIGION undertook to move the article """"Yoruba mythology"""" to Yoruba religion.  This is because the term """"mythology"""" is held to be demeaning, because Yoruba religion is still practised today, and the Yoruba who practice it constitute a significant viewpoint.    It is indeed regrettable that so much resistance is facing the prospect of extending the same consideration to the canonical Book of Genesis.  The Churches have drawn the line by indicating which books they consider canonical, inspired texts.  Genesis is among them with no exceptions as far as I know. What gives Wikipedia the right to draw the line so as to exclude other Biblical Books from """"mythology"""", but include the stories of Genesis?  No books that are considered sacred scripture by ANY large religion of today should be portrayed as """"mythology"""".  That's simple common sense.  We shouldn't call the Quran """"mythology"""" either, we shouldn't call anyone's sacred books widely adhered to today """"mythology"""".    (ውይይት) 

Now things like Hesiod and Orpheus are another story, I think the reason Hesiod and Orpheus have conventionally been referred to as """"mythology"""" for some time is because no significant numbers of people have ever come forward claiming to believe these books to be historical or literally true since the year 400.  At least I will go out on a limb and say I don't know of any, not a single one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's pretty safe to say they have been discarded, and nobody objects to the conventional use of """"mythology"""" for these.  But please realize that this is not the case with Christian, Muslim or Bahai writings, nor indeed the writings of many other living religions.  (ውይይት)

 NPOV of GW article 

I'm adding an {{POV}} tag at the top of the GW article.  This will add the GW article to the Category:NPOV disputes.  This talk section can serve as a springboard to add specific content to the article.    
Sounds like a silly idea to me. -  
Very silly. I just explained why in some detail in the thread above. There are only two views with regard to settled science: Those who understand it and those who don't. Claiming that an article on settled, mainstream science is unbalanced because it doesn't give enough weight to discussing the fallacies of 'those who don't' is just silly.   
 Second the POV Tag Motion - The polarized POV must be neutralized for the reader to understand.  In addition, NPOV changes just like the science does. Above, I've found evidence that the article does not adequately address the scientific views on carbon cycle effects on Global Warming.  As well, the article's comparitive revelance to the """"Anthropogenic Global Warming"""" hypothesis could be better attributed.    

Raise specific issues here first. Discuss them with your fellow volunteer editors first. Make specific suggestions for improvement first. Failure to engage at the talkpage is disruptive and may lead to blocks. - 2/0 (cont.) 

Seems like double standards here. My recent change was reverted within 15 minutes but still no one on this page can tell me why. Many editors believe that this article is biased and represents one POV but that must be discussed here first.   

 I've been discussing my concerns here after being reverted. The POV tag is necessary to reinforce the POV disputes occurring in this talk page, there are at least two sides in the dispute and at least 3 issues underway with multiple editors involved, the POV tag may pave the way for further dispute resolution methods should talk be stymied.  I applaud Mytwocents for taking about the tag before moving to post it, the right way to go for peaceful resolution.    

I support a POV tag on this article - this entire tree of articles is pretty bad from a POV perspective.   

This article as it stands, written from a scientific perspective (which I believe to be appropriate), does not have a POV problem. There are a fair number of editors who want it written from another perspective, that's the problem, and not one likely to lead to a resolution (just look back through the last few years of discussion on this page).   

I support the tag. The article fails to address a lack of concensus on the issue.  
 How about you make a small, good faith effort to impove it?   
I support the tag.   
 On what grounds? All I've seen from you is complaints of talk-page stuff. What edits have you made to improve the article that have been reverted?   

I propose that we close this thread unless somebody comes up with an actual POV problem and shows that it hasn't been honestly addressed here.  NPOV tags are not to be applied for frivolous reasons. TS

"Yes, I am Russell Noftsker.  I had noticed over the years that the errors and loss of detail were compounding concerning the reported events surrounding Symbolics, Inc.  As the principal founder and keeper of copies of written records concerning many such events, I though it would be useful to pass along some of that detail.

The particular events I commented on concerning Richard Stallman were the product of Symbolics’ employees still using computers in the MIT AI Lab.  Our employees had begun to notice that software which they had authored and placed under the Symbolics' copywrite notice had started showing up in the software released to other licensees but without the Symbolics copywrite notice.  One of our employees, Dave Andre, extracted MIT Lisp machine screen session copies from various Lisp machines in the AI Lab and found that Richard Stallman had been the one removing the Symbolics copyrights and giving our software to the other Licensee, LMI.  Andre made paper copies of the incriminating screen sessions.

These paper copies and the above explanation were presented to me by Dr. John Kulp, our VP of R&D.;  When John and I presented paper copies of these screen sessions to the AI Lab Director, Prof. Patrick Winston, and insisted that he stop his employees from breaking copyright law, he called Stallman in and barred him from entering the AI Lab and from using its computers.

Richard Stallman and Richard Greenblat, as I recall, took the position that although the MIT Lisp Machine technology license under which Symbolics, Inc. and Richard Greenblat's company had obtained their rights to use and sell the MIT technology, the “intent” of the license had been that enhancements would be shared freely among licensees and MIT.  Of course, when I negotiated that license, I had intended and stated carefully in the license that licensee produced enhancements would be copyrighted and not made available to competing licensees.

Greenblat had represented the AI Lab as well as his own company, LMI, during the negotiation for the license which both LMI and Symbolics ultimately executed.  Wording to express this particular issue had caused Greenblat considerable difficulty but he had been forced by the MIT administration to accept it just as Symbolics wrote it so he knew well what was intended and that the intent had been clearly expressed in the signed licenses.

This incident played a key roll in causing Stallman to spin out of the AI & Lisp field and to tackle creating a public domain copy of Unix.  Gifted as he is, my colleagues and I feel it is useful for people to know what motivated Stallman’s change in course of action and to get a sense of how opposed he was and may still be to conventional business and business law.

Although I have not laid hands on the documentation for this event within the last two decades, I believe that my copies are still in my possession and the Dave Andre, John Kulp and Patrick Winston can verify the details cited above.

 Brian Chen's analysis of Apple and Flash 

The article quotes Brian Chen:
Allowing Flash — which is a development platform of its own — would just be too dangerous for Apple, a company that enjoys exerting total dominance over its hardware and the software that runs on it. Flash has evolved from being a mere animation player into a multimedia platform capable of running applications of its own. That means Flash would open a new door for application developers to get their software onto the iPhone: Just code them in Flash and put them on a web page. In so doing, Flash would divert business from the App Store, as well as enable publishers to distribute music, videos and movies that could compete with the iTunes Store.
Because this quote is heavy in opinion, analysis, and POV – in other words, unbalanced – I think it's best to summarize the author's factual statements and use a short quote to capture the tone of the source. Including the full quote compromises the article's neutral POV.

I replaced the text with this, which was 
In November 2010, a Wired columnist said """"allowing Flash — which is a development platform of its own — [on the iPhone] would just be too dangerous for Apple, a company that enjoys exerting total dominance over its hardware and the software that runs on it,"""" and that it would allow developers to circumvent Apple's App Store.

 Significant quote 

An interesting glimpse into Rice's POV regarding critical thinking:

 """"Scholars are trained to scrutinize, to insist on adequate evidence, to ferret out logical inconsistencies and weak arguments. We are naturally suspicious of claims that go beyond our experience. Scholars are trained skeptics. Our professional motto is 'show me'. Where's your evidence? If you can't prove it, you shouldn't believe it!...If trust is the natural disposition of childhood, doubt is our disposition as adults. Academic training cultivates an ethic of suspicion, if not unbelief....we've learned to put every aspect of life through the fire of critical reflection....[But] the fact we don't know everything doesn't mean we don't know anything."""" - Richard Rice, Ph.D.;  Spectrum, v. 28:1, pp. 39-40.

"Mod Problem 

I see that on your user page you list pages/users blocked, articles edited, etc etc.

Is this just a history of your stalking, trolling, and abusive bullshit? It seems to be that you're a loser who needs to brag that you troll Wiki and block users who try to make the site a better place. Most of your stuff is done in secret, but when somebody does expose you for being a trolling loser, you simply block them from even being able to talk on their own talk page. Guess what? A person's personal talk page is not yours for editing as it does NOT need to be factual. If it did, it would be the user's Facts page, not the Talk page. It's for Talking, which you as a troll clearly wouldn't want if that discussion revolved around you abusing your privileges as an admin.

 Question concering RFA votes 

As you have not answered my question that I asked you on Download's RFA, and before you show me that subpage, I already read it, so there is no need.  Secondly, do not quote policy on me and evade, simply answer the questions, please.

 1.How many more active admins do we have now then we did at the time you nominated Child of Midnight for adminship?
I nominated him because he asked for it. I probably would have opposed if he actually accepted it, but he didn't. I do not care about active/inactive admins. I am only concerned with good/bad admins. Remove all the bad admins, and then start nominating good admins.  
 2.Please explain your ideal active admin-to-article ratio.
The number of admins is fine, there are just too many bad admins that hurt the project more than they help it. Again, there could be 20,000 admins, and I would be fine with that, but there must be no BAD admin. If all 20,000 were active or inactive I wouldn't care, as long as they were good and followed policy. The current 1000+ has many bad administrators, this is why there are too many. I would be fine with 500 or 5000 admins, as long as they are all good. As soon as an admin blocks some maliciously, or deletes something that wasn't within policy - he should be desysoped by policy without a vote.  
I've always seen you vote in oppose, and while you are indeed entitled to your own opinion, I would like to understand what you view as a good admin / bad admin. I find it hard to believe one should assume bad faith in that all potential admin candidates  are considered bad. Could you please explain your criteria for what makes a good admin in your opinion?  
I also wish to still know what your desired admin-to-article ratio is, and why, if you think an admin is bad, don't you just say that, instead of answering with .— dαlus Contribs 

That is all, since you put great thought into your votes, I'm pretty sure you should be able to answer these questions with absolutely no problem what-so-ever.  Than you for your time.— dαlus Contribs 

 Something to take note of 

Hi DougsTech. I just wanted to make you aware of a bit of information regarding your RfA voting pattern. In the past you have claimed multiple times that you're not violating any policies/guidelines with your RfA votes, but you seem to be in violation of WP:AGF. You are obviously not assuming good faith when you oppose every admin hopeful you see. If you think someone will be a bad admin, you need to provide a reason specific to that candidate, otherwise you're assuming bad faith, which is contradictory to the principles on which Wikipedia was founded and on which it still operates. meh!(review me) 
No, he's not.   
Someone else can has already found their flaw, and the other that oppose the candidate give reasons why he/she is a bad admin.   
That doesn't excuse you not to give a reason though. — (talk • contribs)

SUPREME COURT, STATE OF COLORADO 

No. 98SA447 

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING IN DISCIPLINE 

January 25, 1999 

IN THE MATTER OF FRED BAUDER 

EN BANC ATTORNEY SUSPENDED 

Linda Donnelly, Attorney Regulation Counsel 

James C. Coyle, Assistant Attorney Regulation Counsel 

Denver, Colorado 

Fred Bauder, Pro Se 

Crestone, Colorado 

PER CURIAM 

In this lawyer discipline case, a hearing panel of the supreme court grievance committee approved the findings and recommendation of the hearing board. The board and the panel recommended that the respondent, Fred Bauder, be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law. We accept the recommendation. 

I. 

Fred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976. He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him. The allegations of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See C.R.C.P. 241.13(b); People v. Paulson , 930 P.2d 582, 582 (Colo. 1997). Based on the default and the evidence presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence. 

On July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for prostitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client. See People v. Bauder , 941 P.2d 282, 283 (Colo. 1997). Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058.97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. As a result, a request for investigation was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation. 

The hearing board concluded that Bauder knowingly disobeyed an order of this court in violation of Colo. RPC 3.4(c); and that his conduct also violated Colo. RPC 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and C.R.C.P. 241.6(7) (failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). 

II. 

The hearing panel approved the board's recommendation that Bauder be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and as a further condition of reinstatement, demonstrate that he has paid the costs incurred in the 1997 proceeding. 

Under the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 & Supp. 1992) (ABA Standards ), """"[s]uspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a client or a party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding."""" ABA Standards 6.22. However, disbarment is warranted when a lawyer """"(a) intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession."""" Id. at 8.1(a). 

The 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline. See id. at 9.22(a). Other aggravating factors include Bauder's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, see id. at 9.22(g); his substantial experience in the practice of law, see id. at 9.22(i); and his indifference to making restitution, see id. at 9.22(j). Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence, no mitigating factors were found. 

The lawyer respondent has defaulted and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings. We elect to accept the board's recommendation. See People v. Rishel , 956 P.2d 542, 544 (Colo. 1998). We are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo reinstatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public. Accordingly, we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel. One member of the court, however, would impose more severe discipline. 

III. 

It is hereby ordered that Fred Bauder is suspended from the practice of law for thirty days, effective thirty days after the issuance of this opinion. It is further ordered that, prior to seeking reinstatement a",0

"""::::: How is saying """"At least they are historians and not terrorists"""" to be construed as attacking another religion ? Saying someone is an historian is attacking a religion ? I did not know that """"historian"""" has any abusive connotations, please correct me if my knowledge of English is wrong and historian is an abuse. I really need to understand how this can be seen as an example of """" Extremist-style one way traffic"""". And your equating me with Osama is a personal attack, Please! being an admin and an arbcom admin at that some restraint is expected of you. Cool down Sir and be civil. It is a wind up, and you having warned me of windups should know better. Please do walk the talk.
If you were not so bent in trying to show my faults, you would in the same section  as you have linked to above also find my response to your current accusation, which said it is """"not the number of times Subhash was banned by Blnguyen but the number of times he should have been and  he was let off"""". So it would seem that someone who cannot read is busy worrying about the counting ability of another.And this issue was discussed last year, the time to respond was then, at that time you were also asked direct questions by me, which you chose to ignore.
And that an arbcom member is so bent of fighting with a mere editor and besmirching him  must be also a source of great pride for some. I have not commented on your religion or your country, you have on mine. Shows who has  attacked people based on national identities or religion. So that too must make someone very proud.
 Defending a person, or standing up for them does not mean one agrees with every statement that they may have made. Show me where I have defended Bhaisaab's anti religion comments. So you have now made another false claim above that I defend anti semetic speech. By the same generalisation what would you say about an admin not even reacting to an virulent anti Muslim speech made by his protege, even after I posted it on the admin's talk page ? Further that admin's  defending his protege then makes the admin  (by your logic above) a defender of anti Muslim speech!. That  I an editor with no powers is fighting a biased and prejudiced person, misusing his position , is a great source of pride for me.
 Also please do note that since the arbcom elections I have not bothered to be involved with you, till you went about posting details about me;and your attempt to trace my location , to an editor hostile to me. So rather than me bent on besmirching you as you seem to potray, the fact is that my opposing you on the arbcom has got me special attention from you, which is gross abuse of your position.

 VfD on Jews by country 

This has not yet been submitted, and John would wig out if I submitted it myself. But I suggest you discuss this with others ASAP. I submit for your discussion with others that the author has little regard for misrepresenting the reliability of his figures, that the article gives a inferior knowledge than the Jewish population article does both of current and pass population tends. That the title is questionable in its honesty because as he shows at the top of the discussion page, following his prevuious pattern he should have used the less offensive title Judaism by country. And finally, the figures which he has published do not come from the listed reference pages as he infers but have been generated by himself by multiplying the est. 2005 populations by the rough percentage numbers for the countries.

As an example, being Australian I checked his figure for """"Australian Jews"""" in his words. None of his references give his figure of 100,452. Nor do any of the reputable sources pretend to give percise religious numbers to six or eight digit accuracy. In fact, checking the references you quickly discover that the 2001 Australian census gave the figure of 84,000 people who marked Judaism as their religion. That all other real estimates are based upon adjustments to that figure, as is discussed on this page I found by a Christian Research Association. I finally did a Google searchon his claimed figure to discover that Wikipedia is the only publication claiming such a figure. So I finally submit that this article relects badly upon Wikipedia and adds no meaningful value beyond the fine work already done in Jewish population. I am afraid this is seems to be another example of where this author has misrepresented certain details to create the illusion that he is scholarly NPOV author. 17:32, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0

I submit that this is not a """"fictional"""" phobia. While mentioning it in a conversation in 1988, I met a long-time sufferer. As a child, when her family first came to America from Russia, she found a jar of peanut butter in the refrigerator of the person with whom they were staying. It was something she had only read about, but never tasted. She dug out a big spoonful, put the whole thing in her mouth, and nearly asphyxiated! (Cold peanut butter is particularly sticky.)

Since then, I have heard similar tales of childhood trauma from choking experiences. As adults, even the smell of peanut butter can trigger a severe anxiety attack. See ChangeThatsRightNow.com for details.

Basic concept of GPS
A GPS receiver calculates its position by precisely timing the signals sent by GPS satellites high above the Earth. Each satellite continually transmits messages that include
 the time the message was transmitted
 satellite position at time of message transmission
The receiver uses the messages it receives to determine the transit time of each message and computes the distance to each satellite using the speed of light.  Each of these distances and satellites' locations define a sphere.  The receiver is on the surface of each of these spheres when the distances and the satellites' locations are correct. These distances and satellites' locations are used to compute the location of the receiver using the navigation equations. This location is then displayed, perhaps with a moving map display or latitude and longitude; elevation or altitude information may be included. Many GPS units show derived information such as direction and speed, calculated from position changes.

In typical GPS operation, four or more satellites must be visible to obtain an accurate result.  Four sphere surfaces typically do not intersect.  Because of this, it can be said with confidence that when the navigation equations are solved to find an intersection, this solution gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a very large, expensive, and power hungry clock.  The very accurately computed time is used only for display or not at all in many GPS applications, which use only the location. A number of applications for GPS do make use of this cheap and highly accurate timing.  These include time transfer, traffic signal timing, and synchronization of cell phone base stations.

Although four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known altitude, dead reckoning, inertial navigation, or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.

"""==Ugly Personal Attacks - You Approve??==

'''Good Morning, Philippe.  The post above yours, by LoverofArt, is typical of his posts in my direction.  An ugly personal attack, by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization  the National Civilian Community Corps  by posting false and misleading information at the Wikipedia website.

If your / Wikipedia's best idea is that what should happen next is that I enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person, hoping to reason with him/her, while he/she continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes, then your processes leave a great deal to be desired.  A responsible adult  a real Editor  should have interceded long ago.  He/she and the others working over the NCCC text at this time seem to feel that any statement introduced by the phrase """"According to ___,"""" does not belong at Wikipedia.  As I read it, there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation.  Why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims (as if fact) without reference to the source in its text eludes me.  It would give the impression that the encyclopedia had evaluated the statement, which is obviously not the case. 

I appreciate Wikipedia's effort to provide freely accessible information to the public.  I am not impressed, however, by the response to gross errors made at the Wikipedia site.  Your crew is attacking the messenger at least in part because it is the message that it does not like.

A pretty sorry performance, which you seem to be joining by failing to address the issues I raise or the attacks on me.

Pull LoverofArt out of this situation and I will join in a dispute resolution process regarding editing the NCCC site.  I refuse to have further dealings with him/her.

Oddly enough, I am truly agnostic on this particular bit of software. It's always been my position that it should have a fair trial, but it seems that at every step things have been problematic.  First off, there was the fact it was introduced immediately on the heels of two other major UI changes (the addition of revision deletion to the admin toolkit, and the switchover to Vector).  Then there was the fact that the version on the test wiki was *not* the version to be introduced here, so nobody could even test it properly on the testwiki.  The trial criteria were not developed until just days before the trial itself, and there were no benchmarks set to determine whether or not there was any change over time, or whether that change was positive or negative. The majority of early supporters in the original PC poll wanted it to be focused on BLPs, but for some reason at the end of the poll it was decided that PC should be applied to currently protected or semi-protected articles instead, and those were the articles targeted in the trial. The WMF press on the subject specifically referred to the ability for anonymous and newly-registered users to edit long-time semi-protected articles of high profile topics (the George W. Bush article was specifically mentioned), without discussing this in advance with the community. (It lasted less than 2 days on pending changes, with mountains of vandalism during that period.) Then there was the promise by the lead developer that PC would be shut off at the end of 60 days unless the community clearly requested otherwise. Four days later, when lead developer responsibility changed hands, the new lead developer announced that he would rather keep things running during any review, on a quiet page with only the most interested editors watching.  Even with all of this disarray, I still hoped that we could get a reasonable trial of the tool. It was agreed that we'd start off with 2000 articles in the trial, starting with just a few and ramping up so that we'd hit the 2K articles around 2 weeks into the trial, with the expectation that if things went well, we'd add more incrementally, perhaps up to 10K; however, only a handful of administrators participated in adding articles to the trial, and I don't think we ever got above 1500.  Further, at that point, we'd pretty well added all of the articles that were eligible under the criteria for the trial, except for ones in categories where one or more administrator had objected to inclusion; as best I can tell, their objections were based on the articles being honey pots for socks.  I was one of the most active admins in adding articles to the trial, and I confess I sneaked in a pile of BLPs that technically didn't meet the criteria (they had been semi-protected in the previous 6 months and had fewer than 10 watchers). Indeed, one of the most telling factors on this trial was the fact that very, very few administrators appeared to be interested in using the tool as currently configured. I also note that the time that it has taken edits to be reviewed has continued to lengthen as time has gone on. A few weeks ago, I led a panel on the topic of Pending changes at the New York City Wiki-conference. Thanks to DGG, Becksguy and Jamesofur, who were also on the panel.   That same day, keynote speaker Clay Shirky talked about the fact that once a culture is """"broken"""", it is not able to rebound back to its prior state. In my own closing statement, I reflected on that comment, and wondered if pending changes might be the """"culture-breaker"""" for Wikipedia and, if it was, whether or not that would be a good or bad thing. Certainly the manner in which this entire trial has proceeded has shown that there are some pretty huge differences in what people perceive as the way we do things around here. I don't think  the pending changes software or its use will be the culture breaker, but the manner in which it is being integrated and promoted into the project might very well be. I am very considerably concerned that this pressure to keep a bit of trial software running has resulted in a level of divisiveness between good-faith Wikipedians from which the community may not recover.

Reader's Digest, Jack/Joe
Hey, a few years ago I was reading a really old Reader's Digest and I swear I actually read an article written first person from an organ's point of view.  (I don't remember which.)

...and the guy's name was Joe.

This was before I read the book, so I just thought it was a really odd coincidence at the time...I can't seem to find the article anymore, though.  Does anyone else have any info on this?  Was Joe changed to Jack to avoid legal troubles with the original """"Joe's XXXXXX"""" author?

 The author of the book was talking about real stories from Reader's Digest, so you probably did read the same ones he refered to. """"Joe"""" is changed to """"Jack"""" in the movie because Reader's Digest wasn't willing to allow them to mention it in the film.  LGagnon

I have a copy of John Pekkanen's article """"I am John's Brain Tumour"""", from Reader's Digest (South Africa) 1990-12, volume 137, number 824. Chapter 7 of my copy of Palahniuk's Fight club has """"I am Jane's Uterus. I am Joe's Prostate. [...] I am totally Joe's Gallbladder"""", ISBN 0-099-28333-6, Vintage (1997) UK Random House. The English RD sites I searched came up empty. The earliet """"Joe""""s I found were two 1974 videos  from """"Pyramid Films"""". I found that """"Pyramid Media"""" credits it to RD . Does anyone have a source of an actual Reader's Digest article with """"Joe""""? - , 2004-04-15t22:37z

 It is mentioned on the commentary for the DVD that Reader's Digest told them not to use """"Joe"""". Apperantely they own the copyright somehow. Either way, the narrator in the book does use Joe rather than Jack. And given that the book is the original story, I believe that """"Joe"""" should be used more often in the article than """"Jack"""" (though """"the narrator"""" fits the character's """"name"""" more accurately). The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book. It would be best that we keep the article based mainly on the book, with details on the movie where applicable. Otherwise, what we would be doing would be the equivelent of someone making the Lord of the Rings article more about the Peter Jackson movie than JRR Tolkien's work.  LGagnon

Tyler section
We should merge the Tyler Durden section into the characters section. There isn't a need for 2 separate sections on him. As it is it looks redundant and a bit sloppy. Any details that don't fit that section can go into a different one.  LGagnon

Backstory of the novel
I just recently updated the article on Chuck Palahniuk with info on how Fight Club came to be. This is in the first paragraph of the Biography section. I was wondering if anyone thought we should include that info in this article, since it gives the backstory of how it was written.   Talk]] 12:00, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Question about Edit

Where is the proper place to put forth an individual and allow his talents to be fully utilized? Would you suggest I use the edited text as the basis for an RFA? Surely any poly-degreed Oxforder with 18,000 edits in 22 months can be, indeed is, a formidable Wikipedian exerting a vast influence on the quality and tone of the project. Here is the meat of the text - I would appreciate any guidance you might be willing to offer:

I think this project could possibly use the help of the Editor . He has not one, but Two, degrees from Oxford - has written several books [Love Songs and Other Mysteries (1991) - Bad Choice (1989) - Sorry, No ISBN numbers exist to link to ...] and has made just a hair under Eighteen Thousand edits in 22 months at Wiki. 

As he has frequently invoked the """"Superior Authority"""" of his multiple Oxford degrees and education and on numerous occasions brandished his Oxon academic honors to defend and enshrine his edits in Wikipedia and to eliminate the need for discussion, perhaps he could be of some use here - building the entry for his alma mater. Surely an American 'emergency responder', author, 18,000 count wiki Editor, and pedigreed intellectual with the rare accomplishment of two Oxford post graduate degrees would be of special use to the project.  

""""With respect, I went to Oxford, so i am fairly well aware of Brit English...penultimate being the climax of the story."""" - Arcayne

""""Regarding the 'penultimate' stuff - not worries - as I said, it's just a word. I always thought is was used as next to the end, as in right before the ending. A slightly different meaning has become popular, like how the original phrase """"buck naked"""" (meaning, naked as a male deer) becoming mispronounced so often that now people say """"butt-naked"""". It would render me a crabby old man to decry the loss of the word meanings. It was also make me something of a jerk. Words evolve. - Arcayne  14:34, 3 July 2008""""

""""I did attend Oxford. I did graduate from there with the two degrees I have previously noted"""" - Arcayne

These are the two degrees Arcayne previously noted:
the EU is not a single nation, nor is the UN or UAE. They are actually something called NGO's, or non-governmental organizations.  - Arcayne
 The EU is nothing BUT a governmental organization. Its purpose is to politically unite the countries within the European Community. ... it is a united entity. Ditto the UAE. Kapowow 
Are you seriously trying to suggest that the EU is not an NGO? ... If you consider me throwing my political science and international relations degrees at you to be derogatory, then I have to say that I am sorry you feel that way. I am not a potted plant; I know the policies of which I speak,' ... - Arcayne'''

I trust the Project will be the better, as has Wikipedia in general, with such a confident and industrious Oxonian on board.

Surely Wikipedia, or the Oxford community, have a place for those such as Arcayne, who are able to place 18,000 edits in 22 months as the very public face of Oxford Wikipedians.75.57.205.135  """,0

 Actually, the men's rights page discussed the men's rights movement for years before the last month in which these editors slid in and decided to change the very meaning of the topic, opposing the widely accepted meaning of """"men's rights"""".  There is no reason that the hard work over the years of many other editors should have to be rehashed just because some vandals came along in the last month and decided to throw it all away and replace it with unrelated material.

"You reverted me and gave a reason when I called it external links, I reverted you and gave a reason again. I don't see the dispute. Now, if you read verifiability, self published sources are reliable published sources:
 At the other end of the reliability scale lie personal websites, weblogs (blogs), bulletin boards, and Usenet posts, which are not acceptable as sources. Rare exceptions may be when a well-known professional person or acknowledged expert in a relevant field has set up a personal website using his or her real name. Even then, we should proceed with caution, because the information has been self-published, which means it has not been subject to any independent form of fact-checking.

OK, done. I've merged the other 15th (Josey's) article to here. I've changed the heading here; it said """"Arkansas Volunteer Infantry"""", but wasn't that the designation used by Union regiments? I've also re-jigged the introduction; it's probably more important to have an overview of the regiment in the introduction than the detail of the eccentric numbering these regiments had.

Æµ§œš¹ There is an Afrocentiric view of the world and there is a non Afrocentric view.  As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora.  The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics.  The counterfeiters and plagiarizers that have for years attempted to filch the word Ebonics and with the intent to deceive used the word Ebonics as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other such appellations clearly have Hoary confused. [See Smith (1997) and Smith and Crozier (1998)].   In the “About Wikipedia” section on the main page of  Wikipedia we are told the following as the etymological origin or genesis of the word “Wikipedia”:  “Wikipedia (pronounced /ˌwɪkɨˈpiːdi.ə/ WIK-i-PEE-dee-ə) is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia project based on an openly-editable model. The name """"Wikipedia"""" is a portmanteau of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning """"quick"""") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links to guide the user to related pages with additional information.”  Now, just as the word Ebonics is a is portmanteau of the words ‘ebony’ and ‘phonics’ the word or name Wikipedia is portmanteau of the words ‘wiki’ and ‘encyclopedia’.  According to the ‘About Wikikpedia’ section the word or name ‘Wikipedia’ is from the Hawaiian word ‘wiki’ meaning ‘quick’ not the word ‘wickyapi’ an Algonquian Indian language from which the word ‘wickiup’ is derived.  Thus the word Wikipedia is not derived from the Algonquian Indian word ‘wikiyapi’ and it origin has nothing to do with the word’wickiup’ that means “a hut used by nomadic Indians of the arid regions of the western and southwestern U.S.” (see Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (2001:1347)  As defined by its author the word or name ‘Wikipedia’ is not a portmanteau of the word ‘wicked’ and ‘pedophile’ and it has noting to do with “wicked pedophiles”.  User Hoary thinks it is allright to encompass meanings for the word ‘Wikipedia’ that the founders of ‘Wikipdeia’ never intended and defend the use of any and all counterfeit meanings on the web all over the world. 
I accept what is presented in quotes above as being the origin and true meaning of the name “Wikipedia”.   I believe the meaning posited for Wikipedia above is the only authenthic meaning of word ‘Wikipedia’.   I wonder how the author(s) originator(s) of the name ‘Wikipedia’ would feel if there were counterfeiters and plagiarizers going all over the world misrepresenting and outright mis-using the name “Wikipedia”?

"""===Notes===

 One Buzzfeed article has suggested that this accolade has since been surpassed by Desperate Housewives. However, this claim has not appeared in any other mainstream publication and it has not been discussed by cast or crew of either series. While several of the main cast members of Desperate Housewives are female, two male actors, James Denton and Ricardo Antonio Chavira, have appeared in every episode of the series. In the title credits, the mixed-gender cast is credited together; in the first season, the series is billed as 'Starring Terri Hatcher', [et al], Steven Culp, Ricardo Antonio Chavira, [...] and James Denton'. By contrast, only female cast members, Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano, have appeared in every episode of Charmed and have been credited as main cast members in every series. The introductory credits bill the series as 'Starring Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, and Alyssa Milano' (for seasons 1-3) or as 'Starring Alyssa Milano, Rose McGowan, and Holly Marie Combs as """"Piper""""' (seasons 4-8), followed by supporting and guest actors. While several published monographs, including the Handbook to Life in America by Rodney P. Carlisle (Rutgers University) and the Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, have analysed Charmed as 'the longest-running show in history featuring female leads', no reference to this accolade in relation to Desperate Housewives has ever appeared in print. Aaron Spelling, Brad Kern, and the cast members, Milano, McGowan, and Combs, have all publicly recognized and discussed the accolade.

I'll say this, as one of the very few truly experienced patrollers; most patrollers are not particularly good, and copyvios in particular can take considerable skill to pick out.  With this group, it's made somewhat easier by the fact that most of them show obvious signs of being second-language speakers, so English that looks a little too good gets my attention, but it's still not easy.  I've been working on another major issue for the last couple of weeks, but I intend to get back into NPP once that's cleared out; I have a list of the students so I know who I'm looking for, but I can tell you most patrollers will not, and with a few exceptions most won't know to carefully check them over.

There are simply too many pedophiles who are talented at circumventing Wikipedia's """"good faith"""" processes to edit these articles with any sort of information.

If that were really the spirit in which Wikipedia created content, every article would simply be people... talking about themselves. The worst part about editing here is having to kill enough braincells to pretend that an editor like this is anything other than what he is.

"You are cheating with the rules.

Undeletion

To request that a page (or image) be restored,

 Place the page title on Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion, with the reason why you think it should be deleted
 It will remain there for a period of ten days, giving other users the chance to agree with the undeletion nomination or to object.

A user's opinion will be counted if that user:
 has been in existence at least one week before the listing, and
 has at least 25 non-minor article edits logged

Regardless of the above requirements, the page's initial author may vote (once).

 If at any time prior to ten days elapsing, at least 3 people currently want to undelete and a majority are currently in favor of undeletion, the page may be undeleted by a sysop. If ten days elapse and fewer than 3 people or a majority want to undelete, the page remains deleted. When a sysop undeletes an article, they should list the article on Wikipedia:Votes for deletion. Further discussion can take place on the votes for deletion page, and after about a week the undeleted page will either be deleted again, or left undeleted. (But see the talk page for discussion on whether this will happen for all users). 

Unless I am wrong, at least 3 people want to see, at least temporarily undeleted. All three are old users. I am a sysop. I listed it on votes for deletions.

Mr. Davis,

Thanks for your note on my talk page; I really appreciate it, and it's an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book.  As this article's creator and main editor, I'm sorry that you thought the review section was so negative.  Please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that I was in any way trying to disparage your book.  In my rush to get the article published, I did a google search and those are the reviews I found.  Also please understand that this is a Wikipedia article, and the article as it now stands will never be """"complete"""".  It's a work in progress.  I thought an article about Street Gang was important enough to get out there.  I am by no means a professional writer, so I'm certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it, so I depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors.  I would've thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work.  I appreciate your feedback, something I always welcome as a Wikipedia editor.  If you are aware of other sources that I wasn't able to locate, please send them my way, on my talk page.  I'll repeat this message via your webpage, to ensure that you see it.

You should also know that I've taken it upon myself to improve all Sesame Street-related articles on Wikipedia.  It's a big project, and a great need.  For example, Sesame Street, at one point was actually a featured article, but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons.  It's an unfortunate state at the current time.  Your book came out shortly after I took on the project, so it's been a boom for me.  I thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start, so your book has been a valuable resource.  I've already started working on this article: History of Sesame Street, and if you look at the reference section, you'll see that I've used your book extensively.  It's also a work in progess, and no where near finished.  My goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by Sesame Street's 40th anniversary in November.  I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.

On a personal level, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your book.  It was a fun read, and immensely interesting.  I was brought to tears many times, especially when I realized while reading about all that Joan Cooney and her team did to get the show on the air.  See, I'm turning 45 this year, which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it.  I had to put the book down to compose myself when I realized, """"They did all that for me!""""  I appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly, and now the life of my own children, who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as I did and still do.  I believe that Sesame Street deserves high quality articles on Wikipedia, and I've taken it upon myself to help accomplish that.  If you, as the ultimate expert, could assist me in that goal, I can't tell you how valuable that would be.  Again, thanks for the feedback and communication.   """,0
"I'm referring to the slightly hysterical remarks concerning Edwards, and this somewhat curious passage; 

Pearse in his address to his court martial and his prediction of future events in history would no doubt contrast Edwards assertion - When I was a child of ten I went down on my knees by my bedside one night and promised God that I should devote my life to an effort to free my country. I have kept that promise. First among all earthly things, as a boy and as a man, I have worked for Irish freedom. I have helped to organize, to arm, to train, and to discipline my fellow countrymen to the sole end that, when the time came, they might fight for Irish freedom. The time, as it seemed to me, did come and we went into the fight. I am glad that we did, we seem to have lost, we have not lost. To refuse to fight would have been to lose, to fight is to win, we have kept faith with the past, and handed a tradition to the future… I assume I am speaking to Englishmen who value their own freedom, and who profess to be fighting for the freedom of Belgium and Serbia. Believe that we too love freedom and desire it. To us it is more desirable than anything else in the world. If you strike us down now we shall rise again and renew the fight. You cannot conquer Ireland; you cannot extinguish the Irish passion for freedom; if our deed has not been sufficient to win freedom then our children will win it by a better deed",0
"And you have a point in return, and a dilemma with which to grapple.  But to my mind, it still doesn't justify the excess length, especially given the level of detail present in one section as opposed to the others.  

I might also suggest that one newspaper article is proof of nothing, despite some rather emphatic insistence it is.  Newspapers have editorial standards and biases of their own.  Consequently, we're left to determine the veracity of individual quotes, and have no way of knowing evidence was omitted from the article in order to paint a specific picture.  The implication I draw from earlier comments is that what Irvine says is not true (unless he's admitting he lied) and everyone else is truthful. Yet even a cursory glance through the comments accompanying the article and associated material in the same publication indicates one of the other major parties involved has a pretty dicey history herself.  I'd say hanging the word proof on any of what you have is pretty questionable absent a second reliable source of evidence (i.e.: not another entity that has picked up and recycled the original source article.)",0

 Example 

""""For example, a train that weighs 1 kg moving at 500 m/s and that hits a 'perfect' steel wall where it uniformly decelerates from 500 m/s to 0 m/s in .02 seconds, has an approximate impact force of 25000 N. Thus, a body which decelerates more quickly has a greater effective impact than one which decelerates more slowly.""""

I'm not doubting the calculation here, but the example is a bit unusual.  500 meters per second is equivalent to about 1118 miles per hour, faster than a bullet train.  And a 1 kg train is like a toy train or something... so in my head I'm imagining a toy train breaking the sound barrier and smashing into a steel wall.  I'm not sure what a typical train weighs (maybe 50,000 kg), but apparently their max speed is about 50 mph or 80 km/h or 22.222 m/s.

50,000 kg * 22 m/s / 0.02s = 55,000,000 N

 Angolan Civil War 

Hello: having worked on Angola for more than four decades, I have over the last two years or so tried to improve articles on Angola in WP (several languages). I was thus delighted to see your recent work on the en:WP article on the Angolan Civil War, which is a period I have somewhat neglected with regard to the military side. I wonder whether we can agree on the following points:
 The civil war in Angola ran from 1975 to 2002. The war for independence stopped effectively in April 1974, although a formal peace agreement was signed in January 1975 only. What I call the """"decolonization conflict"""" is the fight between the nationalist movements & allies from April 1974 to November 1975 (independence). This conflict becomes a civil war after independence. Civil war can be divided in two periods: until 1991 (Cuban and South African military involvement) and 1991-2002 (external support only). I think this periodization is important, because it permits to specify the participation of other countries.
 There was direct participation of Cuba and SA in the fighting in 1974/75 as well as in 1975-1991. 
 I have never heard of the involvement of French & Morroccan troops: what are your sources? 
 The support of the Soviet Union consisted of air transport for Cuban troops, furnishing military equipment, and a few advisors, mostly in 1974/75, less in 1975-1991.
 Zaire supported the FNLA (logistics, equipment) and (small) contingents of troops, mainly in 1974/75, less so in 1975-1991 (when, as far as I know, the FNLA ceased it military activity as early as 1976/77)
 The US gave UNITA logistical, material and diplomatic support 1975-1991.
 China gave the FNLA some (unspecified) support in the early 1960s, and shifted this support (which then included military training in China for come cadres) to UNITA after 1966. This is uncontested  see e.g. John Marcum's book.
 Algeria supported the MPLA 1961-1974, mainly by hosting a pivotal group of MPLA exile cadres. I don't know about any further support.
 I don't have any sources on Libyan involvement.
 I am quite surprised at you mentioning the FNLC: what are the sources?
 Gabon and Côte d'Ivoire: I don't have sources, either.
 Mozambique: the FRELIMO regime has given """"fraternal"""" moral and diplomatic support to the MPLA from the 1960s onwards, but as far as I know, there was no military involvement (so much the less as there was a civil war going on in Mozambique as well).

Do you think you could answer to all this, on this page? Thank you in advance    """,0

 Bob Ross edits 

What we have here is a failure to communicate.  You stated that certain details pertaining to Bob Ross' life were not pertinent to the article. Specifically, details about his wives.  This information isn't trivial content.  Details about lots of notable individuals' nonnotable spouses permeates Wikipeda unrelentingly.  Properly sourced information about significant events in people's lives, such as marriage, divorce, births/deaths of loved ones, is not the same as saying, """"Bob Ross like cheese,"""" even if one were to find a source for that statement.  Your deletion of this isnormation does, in fact, fly in the face of well-established community-driven consensus.  Examine any biographical article, and you will find lots of information, [presumably] properly sourced, that you, as an apparent deletionist, might find strictly banal and useless.

It should be noted that the details about his wives was very short, noting only their names (obviously their last names were Ross, and unless their maiden names were in a source, one could not publish it) and the durations of their marriages.  Such a short, sourced statement is surely not worth pursuing like this.  Yuor edits were reverted because you did not provide a valid reason for soing so.  As per the widely-held and practiced policy of including any properly sourced information in biographical articles mentioned above, you need to discuss first changes which go against the consensus.  There's always the possibility that you might provide convincing arguments, and even influence consensus-driven policies  but definitely not in this case.  The users who addressed your actions are well-seasoned, and are familiar with the consensus to the point of being able to enforce it on matters presicely like this without needing to query the community.  For you to be able to make the changes you made  as I said  you must discuss it first.

Making changes that violate policy can easily be construed as vandalism  it suggests that you either didn't read or care to abide by the community standards  but that is incorrect.  The policy of vandalism states, in part:Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated.It appears to me that you indended to be helpful, as a deletionist, but it flew in the face of established community consensus and policy.  I will remind those editors who made those comments to you about vandalism the specific of policy, but the bottom line is: do not remove properly sourced information from Wikipedia without prior discussion.  This is really not a matter of needing to arbitrate, because this is a matter of content dispute, which whould be discussed on appropriate talk pages. -  talk """,0

 Thomas Jefferson - Paleontologist 

I propose adding Paleontologist to the Categories. From the Wikipedia article, Vertebrate paleontology:

Thomas Jefferson is credited with initiating the science of vertebrate paleontology in the United States with the reading of a paper to the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia in 1797. Jefferson presented fossil bones of a ground sloth found in a cave in western Virginia and named the genus (Megalonyx). The species was ultimately named Megalonyx jeffersonii in his honor.Jefferson, Thomas, """"A Memoir on the Discovery of Certain Bones of a Quadruped of the Clawed Kind in the Western Parts of Virginia"""", Read before the American Philosophical Society, March 10, 1797. The """"certain bones"""" consisted of three large claws and associated smaller bones. He theorized that they were the remains of an extinct lion which he named Megalonyx (""""giant claw""""). In 1799, Dr. Caspar Wistar correctly identified the remains as belonging to a giant ground sloth. In 1822 Wistar officially named it Megalonyx jeffersonii.Jefferson, Thomas (1799), """"A Memoir on the Discovery of Certain Bones of a Quadruped of the Clawed Kind in the Western Parts of Virginia"""", Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 4 pp. 246-260.Wistar, Caspar (1799), """"A Description of the Bones Deposited, by the President, in the Museum of the Society, and Represented in the Annexed Plates"""", Transactions, pp. 526-531, plates. Jefferson corresponded with Cuvier, including sending him a shipment of highly desirable bones of the American mastodon and the woolly mammoth.Rice, Howard C, Jr., """"Jefferson's Gift of Fossils to the Museum of Natural History in Paris,"""" Proceeding of the American Philosophical Society, 95 (1958): 597-627.

He also carried on a well known lively debate and correspondence with Buffon, and engaged others, including Lewis and Clark, to procure specimens for study. He is just as much the Father of American Paleontology as he is the Father of American Architecture, neither for which is he primarily known, nor from which he deign make a livelihood. If cryptographer made the cut, I'm just sayin...

To restate the questions: His name is on the front cover of the book as editor right? His name is listed in the weekly publication as editor right? Are those facts in dispute by you? 
Does Who's Who list Blitzers middle name? Does Who's Who contradict Buffalo edu who detail how Wolf """"I"""" Blitzer graduated in 1970? Does Who's Who contradict the publisher who printed """"Editor: Wolf """"I"""" Blitzer"""" on to Myths and Facts 1976? Does Who's Who even list the book, as does Amazon.com, as involving Blitzer?  If Blitzer changed his name or dropped the """"I"""" since 1970 when does Who's Who record that as taking place? When does Blitzers press office record that as taking place and why dont they list an association with AIPAC and Near East Research Inc's Myths and Facts 1976?  According to you its because it never happened which can probably be considered a conspiracy theory- all the physical evidence says otherwise!
I made a point of detailing the exact wording in the American Jewish Yearbook which makes it crystal clear that the detail they used was based on what the actual organization, Near East Research Inc., reported to them:
""""Looking to the section detailing the accuracy of the American Jewish Yearbook we find that his [Blitzers] information: """"..is based upon answers furnished by the publications themselves..""""
Now is that out of context? Not one bit. If you want to claim that the American Jewish Yearbook is less accurate than Who's Who, only because you think that Who's Who is going to be more accurate then you are onto a loser. 02:59""",0

 No. At least the whole section is. I used the """"relic"""" part to show it, coz it was an obvious utter nonsense. Not found anywhere apart from english wikipedia. And i was certain you won't be able to find facts to back it. I was right, but it did not shutter your uncritical perception of the saint trinity ;) Unfortunately you can't read the article on other languages to have better impression of what am i saying. And how ridiculous the english one is looking. For the provided example paragraph the factual statement would be """"the SU provided X canons of type Y from year Z..."""" essentially using facts, rather than views (interpretations) of a particular historian whether they are British or Russian or from another galaxy. And that is btw how it's done in Spanish and Russian versions. There are just plain numbers of types of equipment delivered.

"Totally ungrateful 

I can't believe that someone would perpetrate intentional vandalism on a site like this which really espouses the ideals of information sharing, open information exchange, and honor-system based knowledge transfer.

I don't take his vandalism on my work personally, but I do take offense to two things:
1) People like this undermine the spirit of something like Wikipedia, something that has the potential to change the way that people learn and to help everyone in society have access to all kinds of information, for free (not counting Internet access).
2) People like this have no respect for the sacrifices of our predecessors.  Without people like Jimmy Launders fighting in conflicts such as WWII, and putting their lives on the line, the ability to openly share information and to have opinions would not exist - we would live in a fully censored society, as Nazi Germany was.  So by vandalizing Launders' page, this loser shows tremendous dis-respect for the risks that were taken and the sacrifices that were made by our ancestors who put their lives on the line and in many cases made the ultimate sacrific to ensure that we could live in a world where our thoughts, ideas, and communications were not censored.  But people like Kanupur don't consider that, they only think of things selfishly.

Personally, I'm glad that he's been blocked, and I don't care if he gets in trouble at work because of his work's proxy being blocked.  In fact, I hope that they do figure out that he was a vandal on Wikipedia, and that that's why his work's proxy has been blocked from Wikipedia, and that he gets disciplined appropriately by his employers.",0

Speedy deletion of Opuce

This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement.

You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here.

I am not sure what the Shirra has to do with this. Surely it's documentary, graphic, archaeological etc evidence that counts, not the unreferenced thoughts of the early 19th century Scotland's answer to Jeffrey Archer.

Though in one respect you are quite right. The article is incomplete - there is no reference to F  J Grant's little book - Islay is on p 11 of gthe 1914 edition - available as a pdf download online.

""""The Scottish officers of arms formed an important part
of the Royal Household, and were in attendance on the
King on all occasions of state. Besides the duties enumerated
above, they were employed in accompanying embassies
abroad, making royal proclamation throughout the country,
carrying important messages of state between the King and
his subjects, and a summons for treason could only be
served by a herald or pursuivant.
As early as 1364 mention is made of William Pittolloch,
Herald; and in 1365, in the Great Seal Register, of John
Trupour, Carrick Herald (probably a mistake for pursuivant).
Lyon Herald appears in 1377, and ten years
later as Lyon King of Heralds. Rothesay Herald, officer
of the Prince of Scotland, is first mentioned in 1401:
Marchmont, a title derived from Marchmont, the ancient
name of the Royal Castle of Roxburgh, in 1436 ; Snowdoun,
derived from a part of Stirhng Castle, in 1448; Albany,
from the Duke of Albany, a title of one of the King's sons,
in 145 1 (he is called pursuivant, however, in 1447); Ross,
from the Royal Earldom of the same, in 1474; and tslay,
from the island of that name, in 1493. Other heralds are
also found from time to time, such as Ireland in 1498 and
Orkney in 1581.
Of the pursuivants, Carrick, Pursuivant of the Prince, who
was Earl of Carrick, appears first in the year 1365 ; Unicorn in
1426; Aliszaiin 1426; Dragancein 1429; Diligence in 1472;
Dingwall in 1479; Montrose, Bute and Ormond in 1488;
Falkland in 1493; Ireland and Kintyre in 1495 '> March in
1515 ; and Ettrick, """"pretendit pursuivant,"""" in 157 1.
The number of heralds and pursuivants became fixed at
The Heraldic Executive
six of each by the reign of King James VI., and continued
at this number till by the Act of 1867 their numbers were
gradually reduced to three of each as vacancies occurred.
The titles now [at the time of writing] in use are Ross, Rothesay, and Albany for
the heralds; and March, Unicorn, and Carrick for the

I think that it is important to mention national syndicalism at the beginning, as that eliminates a good amount of the problems with temporality associated with some of the more generalizing and overarching terms that have been suggested.
As for the left-right thing, it should be apparent that national syndicalism itself was a nationalistic movement, but the economics they embraced were not generally what would be considered """"right wing"""". I agree that it is problematic to harmonize all of the elements, but the next paragraph focuses on the right wing stuff (i.e., totalitariansm, etc.), and the third paragraph delves into the economics ideology. Neither of those is contradictory to the lead. Fascism arose during a fragmentary, transitional period, and it ideology embraced what today may seem to be contradictory elements. It's probably better to try and get that across earlywhich the reference to """"national syndicalism"""" should facilitate, than oversimplify.
Regarding the deleted material, I think there are some claims made there that would have to be sourced and attributed or based on a substantial body of text in the main article that provided context (and sourcing). It should be borne in mind that the WWII-era fascist states of Italy and Germany along with the then quasi-fascist Japan formed the """"axis"""", for example, so the claim of xenophobia seems somewhat specious to me, though ethnocentrism sounds plausible. Just because it sounds plausible, however, does not mean that there are RS describing it as such. Militarism is a common thread, but how does monumental architecture relate to that?

Did you hear this with relation to an Euclidean topology or some other naturally occuring topology? It cannot be redundant in general since if we take a non-empty set X and choose a non-empty proper subset U of X, then the """"topology"""" on X consisting only of U would satisfy the two axioms you stated but would not contain X nor the empty set. Of course, this is a trivial example. 
Suppose we call a collection of subsets of a set X a """"relevant topology"""" (this is not a real name; just something I made up just now so it is easier to talk about these things) if it satisfies every axiom except possibly that """"X and the empty set are in the topology"""". Then a non-empty set with a """"relevant topology"""" that is Hausdorff (here """"Hausdorff"""" means that any two distinct points are separated by neighborhoods; the same definition as the usual one on topological spaces) would necessarily have to include the empty set in the """"topology"""". Thus for """"many"""" topological spaces, requiring the empty set to be open is indeed redundant. 
On the other hand, the requirement that the whole set X be open is in general not redundant with fairly natural topologies (I suppose). For example, take any topological space X and let Y be a set containing X as a proper subset. Declare a subset of Y to be open if and only if it is in the topology on X. Then this """"relevant topology"""" on Y satisfies every axiom that a topological space should satisfy except that Y itself is not open. For example, X could be some Euclidean space with the standard topology (and Y could be any set containing X as a proper subset). But this construction is probably not very interesting since (at least as far as I can see) there is not any new information or insight obtained.
This might be too elementary for you, but I wrote the following section in open set a while back that roughly describes why the axioms are the way they are and the motivation for the abstract formulation of a topology: Open_set#Motivation. The following discussion at MathOverflow may perhaps be more appropriate to your question: Do the empty set and the entire set really need to be open?. T """,0

 Edit war brewing at Yosemite National Park 

If you have some spare energy, please come and lend a hand. Thanks! —  

Looked ... acted ... )   

I was also approached recently with regards to possible edits to the Yosemite National Park article. My input on the matter can be found at the following link;
user talk:Edit Centric#Hantavirus Risk in Yosemite

Noted,   

 Thmc1 / 173.63.176.93 sill sockpuppeting / REPLYU REQUSTED 

This person (blocked sockmaster Thmc1) is still block evading by not logging in, even after he was warned by SysAdmin Kudpung. I would suggest that you block the suspected IPs(173.63176.93, 74.88.160.244) as well as IPs used by his other blocked account (Nyc88) and any other accounts affiliated w/them. Why are sockppuppets of a blocked sockmaster still allowed to edit even after ample warnings? To make matters worse, he even violated his block and continuted editing the day after he was blocked! Please see Thmc1 sockpuppet investigation archive for latest investigation/evidence.   

No clue  links would be helpful.   

Actually I think it's the other way around, if I'm not mistaken, I think I remember   being mentioned to admin Ronhjones as a possible sockpuppet in the past few months in conjunction with an edit disagreement issue. Are you stocking this address? Is this some sort of retaliation? First of all, I have no idea who any of these other users are, much less others who use this IP address. 173.63.176.93  
Hmm... Thanks, I think, hadn't noticed the 173... above was the same as the 173... I just talked to .. still no clue why MBaxter showed up here. Aw well - keep on keepin' on   

Vsmith- Don't let 173.63.176.93 fool you. It was him who attempted to mention this to RonHJones using IP 74.88.160.244. That IP was found to be one of 173.63.176.93's sockpuppet and blocked after a recent investigation. 173.63.176.93 is actually a sockpuppet of Thmc1, blocked for excessive sockpuppeting back in 2010. Even though 173.63.176.93 was ruled most likley as one of Thmc1's sockpuppet, he was let off with a warning. For the full story, I suggest that you check out Thmc1's most recent investigation, August 2012. The final assessment was one account (Nyc88) permanently blocked, one IP temporarily blocked, and one left open with warning. If he causes you anymore trouble, you should report this to the SysAdmins and don't hesitate to mention the sockpuppet investigation. The reverting of your edits is the same kind of BS he conducted on the London City article that got him blocked back in 2010. He has an anti-UK bias amongst many, and you can confirm this with user Eraserhead1.   —Preceding undated comment added

VSmith, I actually came to your talk page for a different reason and just happened to notice this. It looks ridiculous and I think this MBaxter1 character is highly suspicious himself. In the meantime, can you please look at this story seen on the main CNN.com page today? http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/05/health/hantavirus-warnings/index.html?hpt=hp_t1
I think that this Yosemite hantavirus story is worthy of at least brief mention in the article because it is now having international implications. I just don't see a justification in ignoring it completely, thanks.173.63.176.93

"""

 The very concept of """"discrete mathematics"""" itself is a vague illusion  

The thing is, analysis is like anything else in mathematics. It can be built up from the basic principles of counting. That is, the simplest principles that build the addition function, which we think of as the number of elements in a union of finite disjoint sets of given sizes, and the multiplication function, the exponentiation function, etc, and anything required for general talk of """"the"""" number of objects corresponding to some act of counting, that is, to prove that it is well defined. These basic counting principles are responsible for all of mathematics, including analysis. There is only one mathematics. There is no distinction between discrete and continuous mathematics that is not exposed as an illusion if you look hard enough. There are no walls. 

It's fine to think about discrete mathematics in the same sort of loose way that people think about the distinction between number theory and combinatorics. For example, the Goldbach conjecture is easily stated combinatorially, and that's fine as long as you recognise the inherent looseness in what these two areas of mathematics represent. An article about """"discrete mathematics"""" can never be very good. All it can say, is that discrete mathematics is a hodgepodge of areas of mathematics which do not implictly involve the areas of real or complex analysis, or topology, for their study. Anything else would be far from the truth. I say """"implicitly"""", because real and complex analysis, and topology to some extent, can be very useful in these areas.""",0

 Whoever keeps deleting this with no comment to me is being unethical and a literal fascist (I mean literally at this point)

````Please do not block me for trying to improve the integrity of the article.
Hello, My name is JohnHistory. I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume """"Good Faith"""" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume """"good faith"""" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.
I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.
I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.
Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not """"assuming good faith"""" or """"positively contributing to the consensus"""". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for """"Making a point instead of wanting to edit"""". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the """"TALK"""" page says no writing will be allowed that involves """"general discussion"""" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts. Additionally, the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or pot",0

'Fraid not. This used to happen a while back; either pages for both British English and American English would exist, or more often editors would fight to move a page from one to the other. In June 2005, the Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee ruled that """"when either of two styles is acceptable, it is inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change. For example, with respect to British spelling as opposed to American spelling, it would only be acceptable to change from American spelling to British spelling if the article concerned a British topic."""" So since an enterprising Brit got there first, American English words like millimeter and liter redirect to the British English equivalent, but the opposite is true for colour or carburettor.

In the case of geologic map, an American was the first to create the article, so you have to edit that page. However, here's a few suggestions of what you can do:
The text in bold in the opening line should reflect the title of the article. Therefore, since geological map redirects to the page, you can change the first sentence to read """"A geologic map or geological map is a special-purpose map made to show subsurface geological features.""""
If there's a difference between U.S. and U.K. maps, I'd split the two into separate sections after the opening paragraph, and detail the differences for each (re-ordering the page as I'd done with this edit). If there's no difference, I'd just remove the specific references to the United States as being unnecessary, and expand on what's there.
You can also provide links to British geological maps if such a resource exists, as has already been done for USGS maps.

An explanation of the style ruling can be found at Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Disputes over style issues and Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English, or if you're really bored you can read the original case at Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Jguk, which concerned and edit war over the use of BC or BCE for Biblical dates.

I think Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworth’s involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better. I think that the IMG reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little, otherwise the article might appear weighty. I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth))

But bedsides, this brief dalliance with Marxism, in an overall consideration of his political career, pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: """"His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who """"considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth"""" but this was dismissed as """"speculative opinion"""" by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment).

 Failed Edits Problem 

I was browsing a forum in which a number of Wikipedians were discussing the failed edit problem. And I think that I have the solution.

From what I understand, the problem could result from human error. Many people, when editing, have a number of windows open on an article. They enter an edit to one window, and then, without refreshing their browser, edit that same page again, negating the original edit with their save....

"Philatelic categorization 

Hello.  Can you please bear with me re the categories as I have a massive amount of data to input.  Unfortunately, I do not have very much time to spend on the project and all my data has to be reformatted to meet Wikipedia’s tagging standard.

I have amended the categories because they lacked structure and there is need for a systematic approach.  A friend, who is a postal expert but only an occasional computer user, told me he was going round in circles trying to tie up relevant articles.  I am an IT professional and even I struggled to make any sense of the category structure.  

There should be a single root category and in this case philately is the obvious choice since that is the umbrella term for the entire pursuit.  Philately itself is a hobby or pastime or subject or whatever so it is entirely reasonable that it should also be a sub-category of those wider categories.  I found that philately had such as postage stamps, postal markings and postal history as sub-categories but philately was also a sub-category of each of those, which is nonsense and does not help new users.  Equally, similar articles such as the postage stamps of a particular country were categorised across the board instead of being allocated to a single category within a hierarchical or relative structure which non-IT people like my friend can easily navigate.

After I made a few amendments to the philatelic/postal categories, I asked my friend to try again and he found what he was looking for immediately.  This is the benefit of a structured, systematic approach.

Whereas philately is the root, it splits into two main sub-categories.  One of these is philately ‘’per se’’ which could be defined as the study of the physical aspects of stamps (e.g., watermarks, types of paper, gums, etc.).  The other aspect is the actual issue of the stamps for postal purposes and this is all done at the behest of a postal authority (on the chicken before egg principle).  Anything to do with issuing stamps and organising collection, sorting and delivery of mail is done by a postal authority which is why we believe it must rank as a main sub-category along with “physical” philately.  The term “postal authority” is a catchall for any organisation that has issued stamps and processed mail: national government, army of occupation, foreign postal agency, etc.

Having said all that, I agree that it is a good idea to categorise types of stamp independently of a country’s issues and, on that basis, “postage stamps” should be a sub-category of “philately”.  There is a clear difference between the two disciplines.  I will endeavour to make use of that difference, especially as our inputs will fall into both of those categories.

"Wikipedia:Wikiethics 

Hi,

We started a proposal Wikipedia:Wikiethics to state the existing policies coherently and make suggestions on improving the editorial standards in Wiki. I thought you might be interested in contributing to that proposal.

Unfortunately, a pro-porn and pro-offense lobby is trying to make this proposal a failure. They unilaterally started an approval poll although almost no one including me believe that it is time for a vote, simply because the policy is not ready. It is not even written completely. 

Editors who thinks that the policy needs to be improved rather than killed by an unfair poll at the beginning of the proposal, started another poll ('Do we really need a poll at this stage?') at the same time. The poll is vandalized for a while but it is stable now. A NO vote on this ('Do we really need a poll now?') poll will strengthen the position of the editors who are willing to improve the ethics policy further. 

If you have concerns about the ethics and editorial standards in Wiki, please visit the page Wikipedia:Wikiethics with your suggestions on the policy. We have two subpages: Arguments and Sections. You might want to consider reviewing these pages as well...

Thanks in advance.",0

 Demand for too many sources 

Some people have demanded way more sources than are necessary for this article. For example, the request for a secondary source for the fact that The Inquirer has criticized the publication of EG's real name. This is utter rubbish. From WP:NOR:

An article or section of an article that relies on a primary source should (1) only make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge, and (2) make no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, explanatory, or evaluative claims.

The section in question states: """"The Inquirer has criticized this deletion[8] as well as the revelation of the model's real name during the deletion discussions by Wikipedia users (the model's name and identity had been kept confidential by The Inquirer).[9]""""

We comply with (1): the claim is only descriptive (it reproduces what the Inq stated in their article) and is EASILY verifiable. The information is also not interpreted, thus we also comply with (2). As such, I'm removing the redundant second source.

Further, I recently added a citation for Mike Magee's quote from BusinessWeek. Again, I am removing this. The quote appears in the earlier reference to the same BusinessWeek article, and citations are allowed to span multiple sentences. """,0

 Formatting of references 

I see there's been a lot of discussion on this page about sourcing, which is good, but in the current form it's still hard to actually tell how reliable information is. Most of the links go to fan sites, which aren't necessarily suitable sources. I realise that in many cases  those sites list information from more reliable sources (e.g. RIAA, SoundScan, Billboard, UWC), but there's no way of telling that from the references. Would be good to restructure them to more accurately reflect their contents  e.g. for the stuff from the MariahDaily InfoZone pages, have references that say """"Billboard Magazine Date x quoted by MariahDaily"""" (that's not the exact format, but you get the general idea).

This isn't true at all, the only reason Franco worked with the western democracies was because Spain was in dire need of the supplies they could provide for Spain's weak economy, and later on, during the 50's and 60's, it was because Franco's advisors realized the need for Spain to take place in the burgeoning international economy.

"Your recent edits 

Your recent moves/edits to articles/categories/templates etc. can be commended per WP:BOLD - but unfortunately they are controversial and undiscussed. The correct venue is WP:RM, WP:CFD and WT:TFD - these moves need consensus behind them. If you continue to make such moves - especially ones to incorrect titles! - without that consensus then your actions could be deemed disruptive and may result in you being blocked from editing.

Hi. GS, I think you are being completely mislead and do not have the facts in hand.  I have been following the proper avenues and have been meticulously improving the information that had remained incoherent prior to my immense contributions.  Absolutely I should be commended for it - not that I need, request, or desire commendation.
If you take your time, and really sit down to look through the entire history logs of both myself and what the Category:Fort Lauderdale Strikers page looked like, you would see that there was an entire mess.  Everything was disorganized.  I would gladly have a conversation with you in reference to the methodology used to place the information in order.  It is now in a suitable form that is representative of a Wikipedia index.
From the onset of my entrance to the Wikipedia team, I have been a contributor for the site who has only been bringing more insight by expanding articles or creating new ones.  You really should look into my entire contributions before pointing fingers.  This is not right and is counterproductive towards Wikipedians who are here to do good.
I have recently been putting in countless hours of tedious work towards improving the history of the Fort Lauderdale Strikeres and have placed very useful information.  The person above who is making the dispute and has come here making requests for your assistance has not made any significant contributions to the history of the team, other than fixing a title that was hyphenated on a couple of articles.  If anything, this person should be speaking with me as I am the one who has the proper knowledge of the subject in question and have been making consistent improvements to the relevant articles.  Furthermore, you should be speaking to this individual instead as he/she is the one who is editing without proper consultation to users who have been contributing significantly.
I ask that you seriously do some research on my history from day one to now, and put into proper context the positive value of my participation in Wikipedia.  Thank you.",0

Templating The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time
Thanks for soliciting my opinion. There seems to be little support for adding awards and such to infoboxes:
Infobox Musical artist
And templates for awards of the """"magazine's top ten list"""" type tend to be deleted:
Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame inductees
I don't have a strong opinion in the matter, but it seems the general preference is to not have awards templated at all, but rather mentioned in the article body text where appropriate, and omitted when such mention gives undue weight to the award. If a template like this is to gain acceptance, it needs to be less intrusive. Putting the 500 Greatest list in the article infobox is the most intrusive possible placement, suggesting that Rolling Stone's perspective on a record is as essential an element as the release date—even I consider that undue weight.

If you still want to try this, my suggestion would be a collapsible box placed much lower in the article, the way  is placed at the bottom of Miles Davis. However, it might be a good idea to seek feedback on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Songs before putting much work into this. /  ☺ ☭ 17:00, 1 May""",0

The first two sources for the """"Legacy"""" section are explaining the situation where Jack Welch in 2012 tweeted an implication that the Labor Department could be fixing job numbers. He had a lot of criticism and also attention from the Obama campaign, but told WSJ that he should have used a question mark in the original tweet because he wanted to raise a question about the legitimacy of the job numbers. He states in his own words that the debate has led to people looking at unemployment data more carefully and skeptically. Quote: “The coming election is too important to be decided on a number. Especially when that number seems so wrong.” 

The NYT source talks about the future of GE as it “gets past the Jack Welch Era” and the fate of GE Capital enterprise as a spin-off many years after Welch has left.

The current article mentions very little about the Jack Welch Management Institute, but the WiredAcademic article provides a direct interview with Jack Welch where he discusses the school and his view on digital learning. The article provides a lot of details about the Institue as well as his opinions.

Does it still form H2, or more complex compounds?
Does it form compounds with any other elements?
What are its density, melting, and boiling points?
What does it take to convert it back to hydrogen?
Miscibility in solvents?
1) In addition H(1/n)2, where n is an integer > 1, representing the fractional state of a given hydrino pairing, it forms more complex compounds such as hydrino hydride crystals.
2) Hydrinos being a gas, there is no specific density it may have. Detecting the boiling point and melting point of hydrinos requires cyrogenic cooling or exotic pressures. The formation of hydrinos results in increased temperatures. It is unlikely that BLP will place measurement of boiling points and melting points ahead of understanding the catalytic processes which may form hydrinos in the first place.
3) High energy radiation
4) Miscibility is a property that occurs between two or more substances. Hydrinos, being a gas with an effective cross-section much less than ordinary than hydrogen, would be highly immiscible with most substances due to a much greater ease in passing through matter, in such a manner that it will easily escape into space.

 Definition of witchcraft/Wicca 

I have some problems with this section. It's all very nice to be able to laugh and say """"you're wrong on all these points"""", but in fact this section is misrepresenting Wicca just as much as the Harry-haters.
The heading itself seems to imply that witchcraft and Wicca are synonymous. Wicca is merely one variety of modern witchcraft.
Wiccans commune with the dead and the spirit world. At Halloween (or Samhain), for example, we invite the spirits of our ancestors and deceased loved ones to return and share our warmth and companionship for an evening. Extensive spirit contact by Wiccans (via ouija board and channeling) is recounted in A Voice in the Forest by Jimahl diFiosa, an Alexandrian High Priest.
Sorcery: well, Wiccans definitely perform magic. The word 'sorcery' has a sinister sound to it, which perhaps doesn't fit with Wicca so well, but if it merely means 'performing magic', then certainly.
Occult symbology: this is merely a catch-all phrase for anything that looks a bit 'occult', isn't it? Well, Wicca is very definitely 'occultism', since it deals with magic and the hidden parts of reality. And yes, Wiccans use occult symbols, such as zodiacal signs.
Curses are of course forbidden in Wicca, as is all malicious or harmful magic.
Demon posession: Whoever accused Wiccans of practicing demon posession is pulling a swift one. Wiccans practice what could loosely be called """"posession"""": calling our God or Goddess into the body of a priest or priestess. I guess this is fairly similar to what Christians call """"being filled with the spirit"""", but if you happen to consider the Wiccan gods to be demons (and of course they're demons, aren't they, since any deity other than Jehovah is a demon), then you could term this """"demon possession"""", feeling only a tinge of guilt at your verbal chicanery.

The real reason why Harry Potter has nothing to do with Wicca is because Harry Potter is fantasy, presented in a manner that has virtually no resemblance to the reality of modern witchcraft, whether it be Wicca or any other variety. How many kids watch the Power Rangers and decide they want to enter law enforcement as a ranger when they grow up? The Texas Rangers, just like the Power Rangers, wear uniforms, fight bad guys, protect law and order, have headquarters and so on. The parallels are all there, but any rational person will immediately discern the vast differences.

I don't think we need to misrepresent our religion, simply because some people get the flutters whenever the words 'magic' or 'occult' are mentioned. Lets show a bit of backbone, rather than trying to turn our faith into what we think Christians want it to be! ★ """,0

 Jesus article too long 

Recently, I was trying to add quotes of Jesus to the article but I got a revert with this response:  """"this article is long enough - refer reader to wikisource or other articles"""" Doc glasgow

The problem with this is that many if not all wiki articles on people have quotes of them, and many of them have """"quotes"""" sections.

If the article is too long and you want me to refer to other articles to shorten it up, then I propose we do just that and take some sections away and add a """"Other topics about Jesus"""" towards the bottom that adds the main articles of items we got rid of.

I propose that we condense these topics:

1. Chronology (which is under life and teachings, and we could include a reference to this article's main article in an introduction to the whole Life and Teachings section)
2. Background
3. Names and titles
4. Ethnicity and physical characteristics
5. Artistic and dramatic portrayals

And then, since some of this stuff has sources at the bottom, but is now gone, we can get rid of it.

Also, since most of the sections point to reference articles which discus the sub-topic in more detail, we can get rid of many of the other sources.

This should substantially reduce these sections:
1. Notes
2. Sources and further reading
3. See also
4. External links

After this the whole Jesus article will be much shorter.  Then perhaps we can focus on the stuff left over and make it really nice, and maybe Jesus can become a featured article.

"Yes, I am saying that 9.000... > 9. This follows from the previous steps in complete agreement with previous assumptions. I will not discuss the  infinitesimal because it is nonsense. There are no infinitesimals in the real numbers or any other numbers. Non-standard numbers are also nonsense. I have illustrated clearly what happens when you treat a 'false' assumption as true, you end up with a contradiction. The false assumption here is that 0.999...=1.
It is not possible to find an epsilon = 1-0.999... just as it is impossible for you to completely represent an irrational number. You don't seem to have a problem with using pi or other irrational numbers as approximations but you have the audacity (or rather foolishness) to make wild claims like the ones in your main article. By definition, 1 > 0.999... There is no duplicate representation. It is your attempt to have this equality that gives rise to duplicate representation. Quite frankly it does not matter that we can't find an epsilon = 1 - 0.999... because our arithemetic deals only with *finitely represented* quantities or approximations in all other calculations where we cannot completely represent given numbers.

"Kristof the problem here is a lag from the old Ukrainian orthography that has since changed. A similar case existed in Belarus, but much more amplified, when the changes of 1930s and subsequent orthographic reforms were very noticeable it affected the way whole cities were spelled. Example Minsk and Mensk. In fact that is the reason why there are two versions of Belarusian edition wikipedia, one uses the old and the other the official adopted version. In Ukrainian language a similar happened but to lesser extent, and only some cities were affected e.g. Rivne became Rovno, Luhanske became Luhansk, Konotip became Konotop and so on. With our city as far as I am aware it too became Мукачево. During the 1990s some of those changes were reversed, and it really falls to because in Ukrainian there are sufficient differences between dialects, in fact if you compare western and central Ukrainian the differences would be more vivid than that of British and American English. So for some cases like Rivne, it was much up to the locals, because Volhynian dialect pronounces the city like its spelled, whilst somewhere in Poltava they will say it as Rovno. It seems that with Mukhachevo it is a case that the version used by locals is not entirely adopted nationwide. But then again there are some silly people in the government who use spellings such as Sevatopil but that is outright stupid, because even in classic orthography that version would never be used. The -pil originates from the connotation of field like Ternopil. The -pol comes from the Greek root for city, like Sevastopol. All the more reasons why we should stick to Mukachevo and help to leave the archaic spelling where it belongs in history.",0

Please sign posts, folks.  I'm sure the Jones link will be scrubbed.  That said, if you're looking for humor, I'd say it was hilarious when Rothschild claimed Jupiter was closer to the sun than earth.  It was also hilarious when Jones said """"Take me lord Rothschild, take me!"""" in immitation of a woman being impressed at Rothschilds self-given title of """"adventurer"""".  Also, Jones never accused David Mayer de Rothschild personally of being the head of a neo-feudal empire, he did however infer that his family was involved with such.  Rothschild repeatedly accused Jones of being an oil baron, which is absurd and ironic considering the Rothschild investments in big oil.  Anyway, if we're to believe David de Rothschild's book, then the solution to global warming is to wear sweaters, ride in electric geo metros packed like clown cars, and build straw houses.  If anyone can show me a Rothschild (of the actual European banking line) that doesn't live in a castle and instead lives in a straw house, I will actually waste money on this chap's silly, insulting book.  I wonder how many beautiful trees are now dead because David de Rothschild wanted to publish this book.  As for Rothschild's demeanor, of course he was somewhat calm, it's part of the training.  The best liars are always calm because they have gone to schools where that selling point technique is taught.  It's called public relations, and it only works on dullards in my opinion.

14:58, 21 September 2009 Kelly A. Siebecke (talk | contribs) (10,340 bytes) (the facts were there and JoyDiamond insists on replacing them, removing them, or exaggerating them - edit reverted) 
This just an example of the misrepresentation of the type of continued harassment I have been receiving from Kelly Siebecke.
I replaced parts of articles that were erroneous, removed undue repetition, I exaggerated nothing.
I received a warning this morning that I had been previously warned about removing anything from Kelly's talk page. This is simply untrue. Her only warning was not to TALK (what are talk pages for ?)
A little history: I am a senior citizen who is an acquaintance of Karel Bouley. My first edits were to change things I considered unkind and then all heck ensued as I was told I was not using an objective point of view. My mistake. After discussion with  Feral Druid and another editor, I apologized for my error and assured them  I could be objective and neutral. They accepted that.I am not a wide-eyed fan or close friend. We have a very intermittent working relationship. However, I am privy to the truth of his schedule, personal facts, his history and the details of the death of his partner, whom I also knew. I also participate in his chat room. 
In the chat room, I was warned that there was a room who ostensibly had a grudge against Karel and that may be in an issue. I didn't really take it seriously. As I mentioned I am an older woman with much experience in dealing with difficult people. So, I was not expecting any problems. FYI, I have a Master's degree in Medical Sociology, a Doctorate in divinity. In my B.A. studies I minored in Communication and problem resolution. 
In my observation of Karel's article, I began to notice subtle and not so subtle changes in his article that were making it increasingly negative, positive aspects were deleted even though properly referenced. I made what I considered objective and neutral edits. My edits were reversed and replaced with even more negativity. AS I fumbled my way thru Wiki I discovered the history page and the person of Kelly Siebeck. I checked with the person who had warned me and found it was indeed Kelly. He described it as a vendetta after she had been banned from chat. She denies this is not the issue and angrily claims she is not angry! Please read her  page and decide for yourself about this woman. The problem has escalated recently into personal attacks, removing positive facts and their references. She will tell you I am not good at references. She is right. Feral Druid has been very kind in helping me with those. I still have a lot to learn. BUT I will correct information that is an outright lie and/or demeaning to Karel. I have deleted several times her claim that one of his radio shows was once a week. It is a daily show and was properly reference until she deleted it. SO  now I am reported for excessive deleting of outright misrepresentation and lies!
I do not want to argue with this woman claims her knowledge is superior to mine. That is just ludicrous. I have 14 years of education and 40 years of experience of which she had no knowledge when she claimed she was just WAY more informed than I was. I would just like her to cease and desist and preferably be blocked from Karel's page. Go back to the original article and compare if you can. I will have NO reason to edit when Karel's page is cleaned up and stays that way. Karel has requested that it be locked. There is no reason to repeat he was fired at the beginning of too many sentences. She does that repeatedly. Yes, he was fired, Twice. No reason to repeat it over and over. Much of his colorful history and various talents have been deleted. It is sad. I tried writing her a nice ministerial letter to no avail. I am tired. I edit ONE article and am repeatedly attacked dismissed and insulted.  She is petty and without relent. AS the """"great"""" philosopher Rodney King said """"why can't everybody just be nice? ;-) I work with Karel. I know the good the bad and the ugly, and will record such as long it is truthful and factual.
I am sorry this dear woman a has a problem with Karel and myself. What started out as a relatively decent article has turned mean spirited and wildly inaccurate. Karel is controversial enough with someone adding to it. Please help. I am a nice lady with a little temper. My grandchildren think I am awesome. I am funny, I have something to contribute. I was Valedictorian at age 42. Work with me please. I thought if I could work with Karel I could work with anyone. I was wrong.

"""== Article flagged - could use a photo of a pit bull in attack mode ==

Before we get into discussing this article there is some background information that everyone needs to understand. First,statistically, pit bulls are less agressive (naturally) than, beagles, german shepards and other breeds. Secondly, the dogs only want to please their owners, that is why if you watch the [disgusting] videos of dog fighting you will see 90% of the dogs are wagging their tails because they hear their owner(s) encouraging them to fight. A perfect example is the Michael Vick case, his dogs were taken and put into kennels, as per a federal jury they were not killed because of the [high] profile of the case. Out of the 66 dogs there were taken 8 were put down; which means that is only 12%. Out of the other 58 dogs they have all been adopted to families along with being trained for hospice and hospitals to help raise self esteems on patients. The best saying to sum up the Pit Bull breed is too """"Blame the Deed NOT the Breed"""" which means dont classify ALL pitbulls as fighting agressvie dogs, just the one's that are beaten and treated like crap by the owners and bred for fighting. Pit bulls are NOT agressive by nature. If you look at american history we used to LOVE Pit Bulls, I mean there was Petey (little rascals) and betty boop had a pitbull. Plus many other famous actors/actresses.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

The article discusses at length the dangerous nature of pit bulls, but lacks a picture of a pit bull attacking or behaving aggressively. The photo of a muzzled pit bull is a start, but is insufficient. I realize it may not be easy to obtain a such a photo in the public domain or by permission, but I'm adding a request in any case.   

 Why does the article need that? Any dog breed can attack.  There's nothing special about the way that a bully breed attacks. The muzzle image is fine; it illustrates that fact that some bully breed individuals do have aggression tendencies which need to be addressed if the dog is in public.  Talk 

 A photo of an agressive dog would be better suited for a dog fighting article.  To place a photo of an aggressive dog in an article describing a breed would be similar to using a photo of a soldier shooting an enemy during war on the Human article...  Or a Jew in a concentration camp, or I suppose a photo of a mugging would compare to animal aggression, but those wouldn't be true to Human character would they?   

Isn't a photo of a muzzled dog more relevant to a discussion of dog muzzling laws? Some places, such as some public parks, require all dogs to be muzzled while attending, regardless of breed, so a photo of a muzzled dog can have different interpretations. As I wrote in my first post, for an article that discusses pit bull attacks, an illustration of such would not be improper to accompany the text. Wikipedia:Images: """"Images must be relevant to the article they appear in and be significantly relative to the article's topic."""" Here are a couple of news media stories that felt it appropriate to use such images: http://www.ktul.com/news/stories/0108/485244.html and http://dallasmorningviewsblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2008/02/mandatory-confi.html. Perhaps a pit bull owner out there would be proud to have such an image of their guard dog in attack mode displayed in the article or perhaps a kennel owner or victim of an attack was able to snap a photo that they would donate and upload to Wikipedia Commons. I remember there used to be a photo of a """"smiling pit bull"""" in the article (see archive Nov 1, 2007). We could return that in the positive press section at the same time to maintain balance.   

A single screenshot image could also be obtained from a television news report about pit bulls and included under fair use. Research: Wikipedia:Image_copyright_tags/Non-free_content and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Non-free_television_screenshot Template:Non-free_tele",0

"""
Dear Mr. Bunkov! Thank you kindly for your note. It is always a thrill to have someone working close to a certain subject to join the ranks of Wikipedia editors. Welcome again; I look forward to future cooperation, and I am sure other participants of WikiProject Russia will be equally delighted.
That said, I feel obligated to comment on the situation you are in. Pardon me if you are already familiar with what I am about to say, but I feel it's safer to include it for the sake of completeness. Since you are not an individual editor but rather a representative of a government organization, you should be extra mindful of Wikipedia policies and guidelines covering your position, of which he guideline on the conflict of interest is the most significant. Another important point is that Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia, so it's not supposed to include any material which is purely promotional. Even valid encyclopedic content may routinely be edited by any other editor, and understanding this point is vital for anyone who is planning to contribute anything. One cannot prohibit others from editing one's additions and no permission is needed to be able to edit content added by others. This, in fact, is one of the five pillars of Wikipedia.
This isn't to say that you must agree to each and every change others make to things you add, but all such disagreements should be resolved within the framework of applicable policies and guidelines. You'll notice, for example, that I've made a number of fixes to the style you used to format your addition to the Kaluga Oblast article—this is not because the style you used is somehow inferior, but simply because it does not conform to the style used across other articles in the series on Russian oblasts. At any rate, style matter are pretty low on the chain of importance, and as a new editor you are not expected to immediately be familiar with all nooks and crannies of Wikipedia's Manual of Style. You should not, however, be surprised when others fix it.
Style issues aside, Wikipedia is all about content, of course. It's understandable that as someone close to the source of information you will have a lot to share, but the applicable policies to bear in mind here are those on verifiability and reliable sources. What this means in practice is that every statement which can reasonably be expected to be contested must have a source, and the source must be a reliable one, published by an organization with a reputation for checking the facts and/or with editorial oversight. Ultimately, this means that articles should be based on reliable secondary sources, and in your situation it means that sources produced by the Government of Kaluga Oblast in general and by the Agency for Regional Development in particular would most likely fall under the definition of a primary (not secondary) source. Primary sources are still perfectly acceptable to verify hard facts, but they immediately become unsuitable once judgement is passed. In other words, it's OK to to use a primary source to back up a statement that Kaluga Oblast's GRP in 2010 was 214.5 billion rubles, but a secondary source is mandatory to back up a statement like """"this demonstrates the oblast's high economic potential"""".
With formalities and general introductions taken care of, let's address your question about """"Kaluga Oblast"""" somehow being a wrong translation. That actually is not the case. The term """"oblast"""" is a loanword in the English language, included in all major dictionaries, and it is much more precise than a more vague """"region"""", """"territory"""", or """"province"""". This isn't to say that any of those terms are """"wrong""""—they are not—but they are simply not as suitable for use in a reference work with such a huge scope as Wikipedia's due to their ambiguity. This issue had been discussed on several past occasions, and the general consensus is that using a more precise term is better than using a less precise one. Precision is actually one of the criteria used to select an article's title. Note also that all major English-language reference works use the term """"oblast"""" (see, for example, Encyclopedia Britannica). Additionally, since the article about Kaluga Oblast is a part of the series on the Russian oblasts, its title is expected to conform to the same format as the rest of the articles. WP:NCCS is the applicable guideline covering all this, if you are interested in reviewing it.
I hope this has been helpful. I apologize for dumping so much information on you all at once, but since your situation is different from that of a regular editor, I feel certain points should have been touched upon. If you have any further questions or need anything clarified, you are welcome t",0

You state that the previous statement (""""helical inserts, more commonly known by the tradename Heli-coil..."""") is correct. 

It is not.  HELI-COIL is a trademark, not a tradename.  And it is owned by Emhart Teknologies: See U.S. Trademark Registration Nos. 2987760, 0514560, 0759898, 0707397, 0419109, 0419476, and 0399390.  

Also, there is no citation for the proposition that all helical inserts are """"commonly known"""" as HELI-COIL inserts.  It is not that the inserts are commonly known as HELI-COIL inserts, it is that a well-known brand of helical inserts is the HELI-COIL brand.

Please explain.

Strange.

Only after that was discovered started Mauco to write """"officially"""" in TIraspol Times with the name William Maurice. Comparison:

Wikipedia's Khozyain, stub written by Mauco 21 July 2006: Khozyain is a Russian term often used to describe a certain type of political leader. It is rich term which traditionally refers to a leader of a given social domain, a home, a village, an enterprise, or a country. The khozyain of a household is usually the oldest male and is entrusted with the welfare of the group. For someone to merit the title of a real khozyain he must take care of those in his domain. Russians tend to judge leaders, including politicians, on whether they are (or give the impression of being) a real khozyain. They are sometimes hard to classify in a classical political sense since their overriding concerns are not a leftist or rightist political agenda, but the welfare of the group where ideology is less important than pragmatism, strength of character and problem solving skills. A person who displays talents in this direction is called a khozyaistvennik. A khozyain politician can easily be seen as authoritarian in a Western political context. A more accurate description would be to classify him as a father figure. Examples of khozyain politicians: Yuri Luzhkov and Igor Smirnov.

article in Tiraspol Times by Karen Ryan, 11 September 2006, part """"The Khozyain president"""": Khozyain is a Russian term often used to describe a certain type of political leader; the prototype of the style of Igor Smirnov, Pridnestrovie's own """"Khozyain"""" head of state. It is a rich term which traditionally refers to a leader of a given social domain, a home, a village, an enterprise, or a country. The khozyain of a household is usually the oldest male and is entrusted with the welfare of the group. For someone to merit the title of a real khozyain he must take care of those in his domain.

They are sometimes hard to classify in a classical political sense since their overriding concerns are not a leftist or rightist political agenda, but the welfare of the group where ideology is less important than pragmatism, strength of character and problem solving skills. Igor Smirnov and the other founding fathers of the republic have declared on many occasions, from the earliest day of the independence struggle, that what they wanted to create was a society free of """"isms."""" A khozyain politician can easily be seen as authoritarian in a Western political context, and, true to form, Igor Smirnov has been called both a """"strongman"""" and, by the more radical Smirnov-haters in Moldova, a """"dictator"""". A more accurate description, for those who understand the true meaning of the word khozyain, would be to classify him as a father figure.

What is sure is that Mauco is pushing everywhere in Wikipedia Tiraspol Times, not only here but in any Transnistria-related page.

"(The following is not a formal request to be unblocked)

Thank you AnthonyBradbury your comments made sense. The issues I raised relate to the ANI thread still remaining open. Both Erpert,  NEEnt, and now you as an administrator have said that the matter is 'closed.' 

Despite me being blocked 5 days ago and despite Erpert closing the thread and stating no further comments, another editor whatamidoing, removed that and continued making false, baseless claims, quoting inaccurate details, that easily be proved. Further, entirely separate matters, to what my block was for, are now being discussed 'after' I was blocked. Without me having an opportunity to present clear contrary evidence based purely on the objective editing history. And have a fair minded neutral and independent administrator to judge both sides. 

These editors knew there was a ANI thread, but did not comment for 2 days until I was blocked. After I was blocked they then and only then, stuck the boot in, without any facts to back up their false claims. They may have waited until I was blocked because these baselss claims would have been proven false immediately, through me providing diffs and objective facts to the contrary. In fact, they only ceased when I asked for a temporary unblock above to respond! They would have kept 'hammering away' with baseless false claims, providing no facts to back them up and all the while, me being unable to provide the facts. 

I have made some very solid edits to numerous articles. I respect Wikipedia. I respect Wikipedia's policies. I accept the reasons for my current block and would appreciate, after such a significant period, ie. 2 full weeks, to start afresh and be provided an assumption of good faith in my editing rather than editors judging me already. I think all editors, after being blocked should be given the benefit of the doubt. Not to have this thrown in their face for ever more. That's not right. 

I know a lot about some topics. Very little about other topics. My reliable sources have good. My editing and additions have been good. Productive in many different articles. I completely reject being 'incompetent' as whatamidoing states, without me being able to respond. Simply because of differing points of view. I understand whatamidoing and Bilby are very experienced editors who have made great contributions to Wikipedia as editors. No-one is disputing that. They obviously gain a great deal of enjoyment from the project too! Does that provide these editors 'unequal' rights over less experienced editors who are also adding value to the project? Where they can make false baseless assumptions? I realise I have had some previous conflict with the same small group of editors in the past. But that says nothing about my edits being productive and of benefit to the project. 

I believe strongly in the principles of assuming good faith amongst editors. I did not think blocks were punitive whereby other editors can 'mock' the person who has been blocked? Nor are blocks an opportunity to make false, entirely baseless assumptions about an editor's competence. Is the ANI thread closed or is it not closed please AnthonyBradbury? I am hesitant to ask this through a formal request unblocking request. So could an administrator tell me if this ANI thread that was abruptly re-opened by whatamidoing, after the block was already applied, and the thread closed?",0

Latest from Sarfatti about the Ira Einhorn case

jpg of CIA Memo of 1963 by Richard Helms on Soviet Paranormal R&D;
and Clandestine Services

""""Most of Ira's book is like reading Casanova, about his erotic exploits with women in Ireland. I have no doubt they are true, but the tales, though entertaining at first quickly grow weary if one is not a teenager or an Oprah addict. They are irrelevant, except to prove that Ira did not smell. Women were attracted to him. He did not smell at all when I met him in 1974.  Ira's understanding of """"free energy"""" and his reference to Tom Bearden are not to my liking because the physics is wrong. However, his connections to the Yugoslavs in 1977 when Holly was murdered, the Shah of Iran's family and many of his political activities made him many powerful enemies with the motive and opportunity to frame him and to weaken the movement he was spearheading. Ira's account of a UFO close encounter rings true. Note Ira's mention of Michael Murphy, Kit Green and Jacques Vallee.

For """"free energy"""" read """"zero point vacuum energy"""". Ira is not a physicist and he was fooled by disinformation agent Colonel Tom Bearden whose claims are worthless. At that time I had not yet figured out the physics of what Ira was after. He was my book agent and I was one of his network of """"300"""" that corresponds also to http://stardrive.org/cartoon/spectra.html

I would not solve the paranormal physics Russian psychotronics weapons problem of DCI Richard Helms until the mid 1990's, i.e. the necessity of signal nonlocality from """"two way relation"""" between pilot BIT wave and IT particle """"hidden variable"""" and the consequent replacement of micro-quantum theory with the macro-quantum theory of """"More is different"""" emergent systems.

I would not solve the UFO problem until 2001 when the meaning of """"dark energy"""" for """"metric engineering warp and wormhole"""" dawned on me as through the glass darkly. The glass is getting less opaque.""""

 Referencing 

I'm beginning to feel that the improved article would benefit from using the """"sfn"""" template refs. The advantage of these is that they allow precise page numbers to be used for each ref, but at the cost of an extra click being required to get through to the full ref, and any online text of it. The majority of the refs here need updating, and there is an excellent set of very recent papers (several above etc). Some are long and cover large parts of the subject: eg Wolfgang et al. """"Recent Progress..."""" is 24 pages of text, really too long to refer to without page numbers. Equally one doesn't want to clutter up the references section with the full title details up to 20 times.  

I must say I've never used the sfn templates before, though I normally prefer plain short footnotes for the reasons above. See Help:Overview_of_referencing_styles#Shortened_footnotes here for an explanation of how they work.

WRT """"innocent""""  this is not a """"verified fact"""".  
 Does the Chinese government agree they are """"innocent""""?  No.
 The DoJ appealed Urbina's ruling on Razakah's habeas.  Did they think he is """"innocent""""?
 Urbina wasn't ruling on Razakah's """"innocence"""".  None of the habeas rulings were on whether the captives were """"innocent"""" of a crime.  None of the Uyghurs were charged with a crime.  All of the habeas rulings were on whether the """"preponderance of the evidence"""" supported the Executive Branch claim that it was justified to hold them because the were enemies of the USA, or had supported al Qaeda.

The first Uyghur to get a ruling was Huzaifa Parhat.  His 2008-06-20 ruling was in the only DTA appeal to run to conclusion.  The Executive Branch considered appealing that ruling.  The Executive Branch had a schedule of when it had to file factual returns in the Uyghurs' habeas cases.  The Uyghur's factual returns were due in October.  In those factual returns they would have been obliged to lay out valid evidence to justify the Uyghur's detention.  It is important to quote our sources accurately.  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were """"innocent"""".  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were not, after all, """"enemy combatants"""".  The DoJ simply said that they were changing their plans, and would not put forward arguments that the Uyghurs were """"enemy combatants"""".  Some commentators went on record as interpreting this change of plans not as an acknowledgment that the Uyghurs weren't enemies, but merely as a strategic decision that the value of establishing that the Uyghurs were enemy combatants was insufficient to justify making classified sources public.

Personally, I agree, that the Uyghurs were wrongfully imprisoned.  But I understand that personal opinions like that don't belong in article space.  The wikipedia is not supposed to be used for advocacy.  We shouldn't rewrite history to improperly imply the Uyghur's """"innocence"""" has been an established fact.
As I have explained to you before, if you find Urbina's ruling, and he used that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  properly attributed to Urbina.
If an WP:RS, like a newspaper or legal magazine quotes Urbina's ruling, and he used that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  properly attributed to Urbina.
If an WP:RS, like a newspaper or legal magazine, in summarizing Urbina's ruling, uses that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  attributed to the WP:RS, not to Urbina.
If you find Urbina's ruling, and he used a different phrase, like, """"...the USA has no legal justification to hold Razakah..."""", you are stuck using that phrase, even if other judges used the phrase """"wrongfully imprisoned"""" in other habeas rulings.

WRT where to find the DoJ's appeal...  A reference to the CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard was offered right in the paragraph where I added that the ruling in his habeas was appealed.  The CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard has a column for whether a habeas ruling was appealed.  That column in Razakah's entry says his ruling was appealed.  I urge you to double check references more carefully before claiming assertions were unreferenced.

WRT his """"innocence"""", you assert above: """"There is hardly anybody now who doubt this...""""  this is an argument based on common knowledge.  Further, your draft asserted that their innocence was established """"early"""".  We don't base our articles on common knowledge, or our personal opinions as to what is common knowledge, we base them on what we can verify from authoritative reliable sources.    """,0

 Well, since we're making a list, individual bootlegs don't need to be notable themselves, but I know what you mean, we need some standards for inclusion.

Generally, I would say if we can find enough information to write a short paragraph or so on it, then let's include it.

 Stub sorting guidelines 
I sincerely believe that we really need to lay down the law in stub sorting, and really provide a guideline.  I believe that we should all attempt to reach a general consensus by April 2, 2005 in a set of rules that we can follow.  Once we have built a set of guidelines, we can formally create a policy out of those guidelines.  We need to define what a specialized topic stub is, how many articles it should cover, when is it appropriate to create it, what defines its need for its creation, what defines its need for deletion, what criteria it should follow, what are the general steps should one take when sorting a stub, whether or not to start using subst: for all templates, whether or not use subst: for all templates created by the meta-templates, and any other matters that may come up in consideration.  I thank  for initially creating the subpage for the project at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  Even though they have been discussed, I feel that we really need to confirm everything.  For that, we should discuss each issue with its own sections, and raise a list of issues that we need to nail down before really continuing on.  The English Wikipedia is nearly at 500k articles.  Either the MediaWiki software needs to handle stubs such that they can be found with a simple union of categories, or the sorting is done manually by Wikipedians.  Personally, I think the latter is less taxing on the server load, especially when we use subst:, which I think would help the Wikipedia out, performance wise.  Please make your comments at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  I apologize for making this somewhat of a spam notice, but since the project has more members, the project can finally decide on these important issues at hand.  (talk) 23:23, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

That thing you did
‘’Hi Gadfium - a while back I was having trouble with some geography stubs, and (via the Village Pump) you found out for me that they'd been created twice, and fixed them. What did you do?’’
Just delete and restore the article which is appearing more than once. If that doesn't seem to work, try refreshing the category that they're in (edit the category page and then change the URL to say refresh instead of edit), and as a last resort, make a trivial change to the duplicated article to force a change to the database.  01:47, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

 changing geo-stub 

this is bordering on the absurd.  I have ended a number of my articles and stubs with Oceania-geo-stub, and someone has changed them to just plain stubs, so now I make it just a stub, and someone comes in behind me and changes it first to a geo-stub and then to an Oceania-geo-stub.  07:09, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)
Nuthin' to do with me - and anyone involved in the Stub sorting project should know to leave it as a oceania-geo-stub. Which articles do you mean? |hello? 
I don't even know precisely which articles they are anymore...most of my recent edits have had to do with the islands of French Polynesia and the Cook Islands.  I haven't bothered to look at who's changing the stubs, or if perhaps it's a problem with the db (I've had on occasion to submit several times...)   07:46, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)
The db may be the culprit. These stubs are very heavily used and the system does seem to slow down a bit with them. Not sure why that would result in the multile template changes though. As to an overhaul of the names, that would mean changing 50+ different regional stubs which between them are used on close to 10,000 articles. It's simply not practical. |hello?

"""
That is an interesting spin on your earlier comment: my views have """"zero validity"""" on my talk page, but """"100% validity"""" at an RFC. I am not sure I can make a cogent response to these conflicting statements.
In answer to your question, I think it important to maintain clear personal boundaries when it comes to disputes between editors. Not accepting personal attacks is one such boundry, another is courtesy, and another is mutual respect. If these personal boundries break down, subsequent discussion can degenerate into generalised mudslinging, which I think is what happened with the RFC's I have been the subject of. These RFC's have brought accusations that are too generalised to either prove or refute. As a generalisation, it is generally a good idea to avoid accusations based on generalisations, because I would end up being painted in a bad light whether I particiated or not.  
With regard to the RFC, the lack of courtesy shown by not being notified of a draft being started is indicative of a lack of respect for myself, or at least that is my personal view (valid or not). Evidence support this view is indicated by the fact that if the proposers of the RFC were really interested in resolving their personal disagreements with me, they would have brought their pet peeves to this talk page first, and we could resolve them in an amicable way. Unfortunetly, that did not happen. I can only speculate why, but I think it has something to do with the inabilty of a group of editors (myself included) not being able to come to shared understanding of how notability applies to certain topics.
I am a reasonable editor, and I am confident when it comes to disputes (personal or editorial), a that shared understanding of the issues involved can be reached. But it can only come about in an atmosphere of mutual respect and courtesy. (talk|contribs) """,0

 Your revert - IRC nick parameters 

Hi, thanks for your comments when reverting me here, but I'm not sure if you understand the confusion experienced as a helper on that IRC channel. While I do see you in -helpers from time to time, these days I rarely see you in -help itself, so it's hard to grasp where your reasoning stems from. I do welcome your explanations.

I'm confused about the supposed benefit of using WPhelp### over Guest###. In any given day, I see tens, if not over a hundred, instances of the WPhelp nick. The conversation often ends up something like this: WPhelp98392 asks, """"Can you help me with my draft?"""" The helper says, """"WPhelp89643: Do you understand conflict of interest?"""" Then WPhelp98392 says, """"Sorry what?"""" And the the helper must explain with !public. Sometimes the helpee will say """"I really have to look at the numbers to see who is who."""" On the contrary, I see few Guest### nicks, and while they are confusing, they are definitely not as widespread as the instances of WPhelp. These users came from the template  which does not supply a nick parameter.

It takes a long time to manually squint to look for each WPhelp's number if not using autocomplete, and when using autocomplete, you really do run the risk of autocompleting the wrong nick. If you remove the nick parameter, just like the way it is in current freenode webchat, then helpees would ideally choose their own username as the nickname field, eliminating the amount of asking, """"What is your username?"""" In short, it would be easier to deal with Guest### nicknames (the few that we'd have) than the piles of confusing WPhelp usernames when everyone literally has almost the same nickname and nobody knows what's going on, with the added benefit of perhaps helpees supplying their usernames. IRC is already a confusing environment for newbies - better to make it less confusing if possible. —  oh hello! """,0

 A hint 

Here's a hint. If your textbooks in grade schools didn't claim Israel doesn't have a right to exist, if parents in your society weren't teaching their kids that blowing up my people is a wonderful thing that will get them 72 virgins, if your government didn't name streets after mass murderers, pay blood money to the parents of mass murderers, put them on camera hailing their kids as heroes, and if YOUR PEOPLE weren't spending their time and money on buying weapons and digging smuggling tunnels instead of fixing infrastructure, starting businesses, and building better lives, then there would be no need for checkpoints, no need for a big-ass wall, no need for anything of the sort. And you'd have your state. You'd have had it decades ago if your goal was to have a state.

You could have been living freely, if the Arab states had accepted the offer, signed a nonagression pact, and let you come home instead of stuffing your parents inside """"refugee camps"""" cynically turning you into shock troops and poster children for """"oh look what the Jews did to 'our people' when we stuffed them into refugee camps instead of taking the easy way to let them go home.""""

You could have had a Palestinian state in 1948. You could have had one at any time after that.

But it's as you say. """"On the last day, even the rocks and the trees will shout 'O Muslim, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him!""""

Your goal isn't a Palestinian state. It's the death of my people and establishing a sharia state on top of their cooling bodies.

I just cleaned up some of your ridiculous lies on one page. I'm not going to bother checking anywhere else - YET. That would be wikistalking.""",0
"""Whoa whoa whoa! You're making a huge leap in saying """"They merely list it under that category because they realize some ppl label them"""" that is blatant original research! The fact is that the site clearly says Christian rock as the category. I have never NOT acknowledged that the site lists other elements that their genres draw from, again a band can encompass multiple genres. No need to be so bitter.

"Cottesloe band night

Hiya. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the article itself - for a description of a band night, it's fairly well written. My issue here isn't with the way it's been written, or the fact that it's informative, but more that I don't think it satisfies Wikipedias criteria for notability. Now, I'll be the first to admit I'm no expert on this, which is why I've moved it to AfD (rather than just prod), so that more experienced heads than mine can have an opinion -) I'll abide by whatever decision they make. So, as an article in itself, no issues, but I'm not (yet) convinced that Wikipedia is the place to have it.",0
"Nancy, I am not after a propaganda article, I am after an accurate article, and I think that there is no serious argument that Irenaeus faked the list of popes in his writings as of 190 AD. Therefore I don't think the unsupported comment by Duffy has a place in what is already a quite lengthy section.

With regard to the Mexican points, these will have to be checked. The idea that before 1527 the church didn't agree that indians hads souls, yet converted them before this, doesn't stand up. Just because something has been printed somewhere doesn't mean that it is true. If the book is POV or the writer has only a slender grasp of relevant issues material can be wrong. Similarly with the corporal punishment points, this is very vague and gives no law, date or time that can be pinpointed. The idea that Xavier only preached among Thomas christians is simply wrong. 212.140.128.142",0

 my stupidity? 

I should receive an award for attacking that horrible """"coldplay"""" rock group, whose popularity must be based upon hooking up with McDonalds or Holiday Inn, because that seems to be how music groups get attention in the USA, if they go to bed with some big corporation.  

That other editor had the nerve to revoke my edits of a Russian female musician even though he admits limited musical knowledge.  Somebody needs to remove the tags from that listing and leave it alone. It would make me very mad to see that listing removed, as some have threatened, that would be the ultimate sin.   I mean, this whole notability issue is just senseless.  """"coldplay"""" is notable for selling records, not quality, and somehow Wikipedia needs to pay more attention to quality, less attention to whether or not a rock musician sells a lot of t-shirts at a Wal-mart in Iowa  lol   Hell, if Wikipedia lists an artist who only sold one CD, and that CD is high quality, something far superior to """"coldplay,"""" then I say, list the musician who sold one CD, and erase """"coldplay.""""

content moved from bennelong medal talk page
I feel this page is notable as it is not included on the Bennelong Society entry, where it should rightly go. I attempted to put it there and it was repeatedly deleted and I did not want to enter an edit war. Therefore it exists as a separate page.

 There appear to be some mentions in Google; you should add some to the article.  

I removed the notability warning as  seems to have contradicted himself by adding a notability warning prior to checking basic searches such as google. I'll add some links and expand the article so it can be merged back into Bennelong Society when time permits (unless  would like to make some constructive edits? ) ).  

 Article did not cite any third party sources when I added the tag; the onus is not on other editors to cite sources for material.  

 What on thi spage needs cleaning up? It states the data and the source. What else could there be. The article did site one third party source at the time of you first tagging, it was within the body of the article, as it was a hyperlink, as opposed to at the end. This surely suggests that you have not actually read the article fully. The added sources to keep you happy are in fact irrelevant as they add nothing to the article and in adding to the length of the article, remove some of its encyclopædic nature. Is it these you would like removed for the clean up? - - [[User talk:A.J.1.5.2.|TALK]]

To Hersfold, what you asserted in your reply is incorrect. Just visit at WP:SOCK under the header about shared IP addresses. It states the exact opposite to what you’ve just claimed   """"If two users live or work together, their accounts may appear to be sock puppets, especially if they share a single computer or IP address. Checkusers cannot look through the wire to see who uses the computer at the other end."""" That claim was a """"duck"""".

This isn’t just two users, but an entire network, which hundreds of people use in a busy workplace. What the blocking sysop seems to have done is a mass block of everybody from it.  This kind of thing makes Wikipedia look like bad. I feel I had the right to be slightly angry because being blocked when I've done nothing and still have not been unblocked after giving the explination of the mistake is understandably frustrating.

I just ask that one example be presented  of me ever doing what WP:SOCK says they are for  IE - to vote showing false support and getting round a 3RR. Where do I do this activity or evidence of me supporting this vandals activities? If I was a sock, you would be able to show an example of something along those lines. Is there a member of staff I can call to get this taken off since no sysop is currently offering reasonable help? -   """,0

As a practitioner in this field for over 20 years and editor/author of The Handbook of MultiSource Feedback, I strongly disagree with the statement that 360 cannot succeed as a tool for decision making. Many organizations have and continue to use 360 for decision making, including not only appraisal but also succession planning, high potential selection/development, staffing, and leadership development. The fact is that 360 data, generated under the right conditions (including things like rater training), provides information that is more valid and fair than that created by traditional sources (i.e., supervisor evaluations). Yes, it can be misused and abused, which is true for any tool/process. And it is difficult to do well and to sustain it. But it is overly dogmatic to dismiss it as useful only for development.

I am sick to death of your continual WP:SOAPboxing on this talkpage and will simply delete or revert (rather than archiving  as you simply remove the archive templates) any further irrelevant material. ''TalkStalk''(P)

I've been published in two scientific journals (working on more), have you?
I've asked you on your site to at least allow time respond to the rule violations I have been accused of before you archive. Is this unreasonable?
You are saying you are going to simply delete discussion.  Is this not the same vandalism?

Here is the statement on WP:SOAP
Wikipedia is not a soapbox, a battleground, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. This applies to articles, categories, templates, talk page discussions, and user pages. Therefore, content hosted in Wikipedia is not:

Propaganda, advocacy, or recruitment of any kind, commercial, political, religious, or otherwise. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view. You might wish to start a blog or visit a forum if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views.[1] 

Opinion pieces. Although some topics, particularly those concerning current affairs and politics, may stir passions and tempt people to """"climb soapboxes"""" (i.e. passionately advocate their pet point of view), Wikipedia is not the medium for this. Articles must be balanced to put entries, especially for current events, in a reasonable perspective, and represent a neutral point of view. Furthermore, Wikipedia authors should strive to write articles that will not quickly become obsolete. However, Wikipedia's sister project Wikinews allows commentaries on its articles. 

Scandal mongering or gossip. Articles about living people are required to meet an especially high standard, as they may otherwise be libellous or infringe the subjects' right to privacy. Articles should not be written purely to attack the reputation of another person. 

Self-promotion. It can be tempting to write about yourself or projects in which you have a strong personal involvement. However, do remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other, including the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view, which is difficult when writing about yourself or about projects close to you. Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles is unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography, Wikipedia:Notability and Wikipedia:Conflict of interest. 
Advertising. Articles about companies and products are written in an objective and unbiased style. Article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small """"garage"""" or local companies are typically unacceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they identify major organizations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Wikipedia neither endorses organizations nor runs affiliate programs. See also Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies) for guidelines on corporate notability. Those promoting causes or events, or issuing public service announcements, even if noncommercial, should use a forum other than Wikipedia to do so. 

Clearly I have not tried to recruit, sell, gossip or self-promote.  The opinion peices are clearly talking about article and not discussion pages and are stated as such. The opinion I have stated are backed up with facts and hence on the discussion page.  Please enlighten me with what definiton of WP:SOAP you are using.  You are deleting with cause, harassing with provocation, and stating opinion with out any basis in facts.""",0

Re: Giovanni's mother (The Woman Boss)
I see in a recent edit you made to Giovanni that you made a hidden (is that the word? I mean those tags that have the """"!"""" sign in them and are visible only in the edit box) question concerning the bit in the article about Giovanni's mother. (i.e """"WTF is this?"""") It's true that this is not exactly mainstream knowledge, so let me explain:

In Japan, a """"radio drama"""" (which as I understand it is basically a Pokémon episode without the animation) was produced, which was about the story of Mewtwo until the events of the first movie. Part of the radio drama was the short """"Birth of Mewtwo"""" video that also exists in English.

The story is narrated by Giovanni, who tells us about when Team Rocket was led by a very beautiful woman that he then identifies as his mother. This woman is referred to as On'na Boss, meaning the Woman/Female Boss. Jessie's mother Miyamoto, a TR agent, brings to her attention the existence of Mew from a recording in the Andes, and On'na Boss sends her to investigate. Miyamoto eventually finds Mew, but is subsequently lost in an avalanche and never heard of again. The story then continues with Giovanni's own attempts to find Mew one generation later, whose results we all know. Hope this cleared things up without being too long-winded!  """,0

Jennifer O’Neill gave an extensive and very detailed """"behind the scenes of Summer of '42"""" interview to columnist / features writer Louis Hillary Park of Scripps Treasure Coast Publishing from her Tennessee home.[5] In this interview she reveals that her agent had to fight to even get a reading for the part, since the role had been cast for an """"older woman"""" to a """"coming of age"""" 15 year old boy, and the director and Warner brothers were only considering actresses over the age of thirty, Barbara Streisand being at the top of the list.

Hi. It's from the same user who was changing the images before on similar articles. Not to mention that, both images are good resolutions, contrary to what the user says, which is why I don't see the need to change images, delete galleries and remove content. It's unnecessary.   
It is nevertheless a content dispute. Neither the repeated switching of images nor the edit summaries that you consider misleading amount to vandalism, per Wikipedia:Vandalism#Types of vandalism and Wikipedia:Vandalism#What is not vandalism.  Donald Albury 

It was vandalism, but not mine.  Your images have extremely bad lighting and are not encyclopedic quality in the least.  One of them replaced a photo of a street in the article for that street Brickell Avenue and doesn't even show the street.  THE ARTICLE IS ABOUT THE STREET.  Also, you're supposed to answer a talk on the same page (Yours') that it initiated on, not put the answer on the initiators page so there are 2 half conversations on two separate pages.

Even what little is (or was) here that is not there rightly belongs to that page. Therefore, I suggest that this page be merged with Phrase structure grammar. Any thoughts?

By the way, should Phrase structure grammar redirect to Chomsky hierarchy?

Look, this is all very simple.  Not once have the child molestation allegations been presented on wikipedia as anything other than an investigation that, to everyone's knowledge, has not led to formal charges.  If you, or anyone else, want to edit the page to elaborate on the matter, saying, """"Due to the fact that no evidence can be found that the investigations of Mr. Fitch resulted in formal charges, the veracity of the allegations is very much called into question."""", then guess what?  THAT'S FINE!  That's both factual and quite possibly the most accurate portrayal of the truth, to everyone's knowledge, I would assume.

But you know what else is factual?  That SABC claimed that he was a child molester.  If SABC lied about that, don't you think people ought to know so the status of the case against him?  That no formal charges have been brought against him?  And not only to possibly vindicate Mr. Fitch in the eyes of those who would have normally assumed that he was guilty, but also to possibly diminish the reputation of SABC for accusing him of such a serious crime?

I really don't see any way to justify the removal of the material, however.  To my knowledge, it doesn't become libel until you claim or suggest that SABC was correct.  I also cannot imagine why anyone would not agree to the middle-ground approach, which is to add the """"no formal charges"""" comment in order to balance the material.   """,0

 Responses 

I am not in a position where I will be able to correspond extensively on this matter, but I thought I owed it to everyone to try and put together a few general responses.
Yes, I should not have used the """"are you now or have you ever been?"""" sort of construction, and I've modified it per MONGO's suggestion.  While I've seen Malleus' behavior over time neglect basic civility, it was incorrect for me to assume that it's always been that way.
No, the statement was not a personal attack.  The reactions alleging that I've been attempting to """"unperson"""" Malleus are hyperbolic and simply not true.  Malleus does not conform to the fourth pillar.  One must conform to all five pillars to be a Wikipedian; that is the social conract.  While my earlier thoughts had been running along the lines of one must endorse all the pillars, that puts an emphasis on belief rather than conduct. 
One can be banned after making many valuable contributions to Wikipedia.  The various persons who are banned: Jack Merridew/Bre'r Rabbit/Gold Hat/etc. is not an unperson.  Betacommand is not an unperson.  Will Beback is not an unperson.  I would argue that my statement could be equally applied to any of them or other banned users for a similar reason: each of them failed to uphold the fourth pillar, although in a variety of ways and intensities, and was banned for that.  Malleus has the distinction of being the most prolific content creator being up for a ban in my memory.  The content he has created has is not in question, and he has had an admirable pattern of contribution to the encyclopedia... but that's not sufficient.  Much like Betacommand, Malleus has been shown repeatedly that his style of interaction is insufficient, and he has chosen to continue it. No one has proposed that Malleus' contributions be erased, that his name be stricken from anywhere or anything.  Bans don't do that, and the proposed ban would not have been any different than any other ban.   """,0

Addressing:

Second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit. I'd put right up front that Johnson did the executive order but Congress never acted on it, then go on about how the tribe didn't accept it anyway?  Keep the chronology clearer.   (Interesting that the Coeur d'Alene article says nothing about this period, maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too... hmmm) 
From a VERY cursory review of the decision, it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and Idaho's statehood becomes significant in this case, so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact, but it's something that's going to matter.  
The section fails to draw out the significance of the info on the state park and mining, maybe add a wee bit to hint at why this will matter in the SCOTUS case.""",0

"Helder, I agree with you on one point, and it may surprise you which point it is: the loosers of the Cold War were indeed 'the people'. Now that the communist threat is gone, it's no longer necessary to accommodate basic decency in dealing with employees, for example. I have worked on the bottom of the food chain long enough to know how many liberties some employers take with their employees. The irony is, of course, that out of fear of Communism, working conditions in the West were much better than in Communist countries. I still think the masses are cowardly, nasty, stupid, and disgusting in general. But, that's regardless of who they are made up of. Any assembly of people that exceed about a hundred people tends to take on disgusting behaviour. Just watch frat parties at 'elite' universities. Yuck. You don't even need 100 people for that. Humanity as such is vile, it's only redeeming feature is the occasional decent human being. My support for democracy is not based on any kind of sympathy with 'the masses', but it's simply based on the realization that there are no better alternatives. I am a Popperian democrat  democracy as a necessity, not moral imperative. The losing side of any revolution is always humanity (Menschlichkeit, not Menschheit; I trust you know enough German to get the difference). 

The famines inflicted on India, Ireland, and post-WWI Germany are just one of the few examples of how humans in general are simply disgusting. By the way, according to new findings in archeology, genocide was the method of choice in dealing with enemies for most of human history. Whether the 'noble savages', the carriers of 'white man's burden', the 'Ubermenschen', or the 'Avantgarde of the Proletariat', humans have not gotten better or worse throughout history, but have simply found new excuses for their native instincts.

T-Man, I hate to revert you, especially given that we are apparently going to arbitration and all, but your addition is contrary to the consensus that tooks many weeks to build on this area, and which you left alone until now.  You still seem to be trying to prove that Batman is not gay... we all know this.  Here is your addition:
 However, quotes from the creators of the characters would be missing yet, and Batman had previous romantic interests prior to this point 
Firstly, the comment is not too encyclopedic.  Secondly, no one said that there are quotes from the creators; what was said was that """"it has been suggested that"""" the creators did this in response to the Wertham allegations. This is logical to conclude.  As well, your web citation is not very useful in addressing this issue, although it does seem useful to show the dates the various characters were first introduced, and can be put into Batgirl and other sites (in fact, is already there).
I am going to be very civil with you from now on.  But that doesn't mean I don't have great concerns about these edits, particularly when they address the same issue month anfter month with no flexibility.  """,0
"MSU Interview 

Dear Dabomb87,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, were it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar",0

Purrum, look in the mirror mate because you're full of self-righteous opinions, views, hypotheticals, allegations, accusations, hearsay and fabricated information on Ronald Ryan. And, you have the ordacity to express them on Wikipedia! 
Tell us Purrum, why don't you also request deletion of every published """"hateful"""" opinions by Hodson, that have appeared in various media articles over the decades, for everybody to read? Common sense suggests that if Hodson demands her opinions on Ryan be published on the media, then it becomes relevant referenced material for Wikipedia. If Hodson doesn't want her opinions to be made public information, then she should keep her vile mouth shut. Therefore, I will continue to add every referenced article regarding Ryan on Wikipedia, for the purposes of fully informing and educating the public.
It's obvious that Purrum passes judgement on what referenced articles should be banned, deleted, sensored and replaced with lies - nothing but lies!

 The issue originally was the word change, which I imagined would be entirely uncontroversial.

The issue here is still the word change.  The other issue, you can discuss elsewhere if you like.  On the word change, it still seems very simple to me.  Slavishly adopting the wording of the source is wrong.  The word """"said"""" is entirely neutral, while the word """"explained"""" carries connotations that the article should not be carrying.  It doesn't matter at all if the source said """"explained"""".  Insisting that a word must be used because it appears in the original source makes a complete mockery of the concept of writing an encyclopaedia. The aim here is a bit higher than a massive copy and paste exercise, is it not?

 Yet my last sentence in my foregoing post is perfectly veridical. Even now Jeffro77 (and you) are unaware of the illiterate nature of his edit even though I reproduced it for him (from the """"Existence of God"""" Talk page): """"The Deutsch citation is entirely correct, and the quoted text is available at the linked article in the citation. Failing to use the exact citation supplied by you is immaterial."""" But as anyone who is literate can see, his citation is incorrect: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""".

 """"Chapter 14"""" of what book? By whom?

 Nor did I ever call anyone at Wikipedia a bully. That's a false claim by you. You therein protest too much (cf. Hamlet, Act III, Scene II, line 240).

 As well, I don't merely make charges, I prove what I state. Jeffro77 and Ilkali both repeatedly made false claims regarding the subject for which there is no excuse due to the information being readily at hand within either the subsection under question itself or in the hyperlinked Wikipedia articles. Neither of them knew the slightest thing about the Omega Point Theory other than that they knew that its author maintains that it physically proves God's existence, which was all it took to rile them up. While lacking knowledge about a subject is not itself an error, what is completely uncalled for is to have vociferous opinions on an issue while remaining in that state of ignorance.

 That's the current state of this matter. Those who have repeatedly shown a willingness to make factually false statements on the matter, and whose ignorance regarding the subject is nearly complete, now have their illiterate and clownishly censorial, and indeed illogical, edit showing.

 Regarding the illogic of the edit, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he deleted mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

 So by Jeffro77's own words, he must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted mention of this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

 Jeffro77's edit is so ridiculously biased and illogical that it's a sick joke.74.4.222.208  """,0

"Hello
Hi Hertz.... I want to introduce myself. My name is Nate. I noticed that you are an active editor and participant to the article on Radio. Let me say congrats on the great work that you do. The reason why I am writing to you is to give a fair warning. A few days ago I made an edit or two to the article on the Marconi vs. U.S. case that essentially gave the radio patent to Tesla in 1943. The references I gave as you probably saw, were reliable and verifiable.  however as you also probably saw, I think I may have stirred the pot. Anything pinning Tesla to the underlying principles of radio is never acceptable to another editor on that article, Magnagr. So I wanted to warn you. I have fought him tooth and nail for over a year over this agonizing subject. I've reverted several of his unsourced edits, but he will not rest until he fulfills his agenda. His current user name is not even his first as he has several registered accounts on Wikipedia. I have a feeling that nationaliatic pride is also playing at hand here with him as I think he told me once that he was Italian. Hence, that is why he would want to only accredit Marconi as the sole contributor to radio. So it is just a warning. You and the others should be prepared to fight this with him as he will never stop. I gave up a long time ago. I have radio on my watch list so I will be following along and keeping my eyes open to the edits he makes. But you should as well pay very very  close attention what he does.

First Use of the Word

The English-language term """"Scientology"""" originated neither with Hubbard nor Nordenholz, but with philologist Allen Upward, who coined the term in 1907 in his book The New Word.  

This reference is cited to be a use of the word to ridicule pseudoscientific theories by Jon Atack, a COS critic.Atack, Jon. A Piece of Blue Sky, p. 127. Lyle Stuart, 1990. ISBN 081840499X This would not be a problem if the critic were actually accurate in his understanding of the text.

However, examination of the original text shows that in Upward's book The New Word the word 'scientology' is used to describe """"science elevated to unquestioning doctrine"""", and does not have sense implied by Atack. 

""""...unhappily scientology is as often mistaken for science as theology is for worship.""""The New Word, p. 149

Reassessing those articles would be in accordance with content policy, and I wasn't actually threatening to do so anyway; I was threatening not to do so.

"WP:WEB

I don't know what you mean by jumping to conclusions, but noted nonetheless. To address your example directly, Dominic Deegan was actually printed, published, and released, which gives it a  bit of a foothold in the webcomic world. It has tens of thousands of Google hits, the first several hundred of which are unique and relevant, and several hundred unique sites also link to it. It also gets a couple million views per month according to Alexa.com. The three methods on their own are not always the best for rating the notability of a subject, but when combined, they give a clearer picture

Some articles are marked for deletion soon after creation, and others aren't marked until several months (or years) after their first edit. However, in the end, they will eventually receive the same scrutiny all other articles must undergo- an unencyclopedic article will not be allowed to exist on the premise that other unencyclopedic articles already exist; they will, in all likelihood, be deleted eventually as well.

As for WP:WEB itself: It's a guideline used to help determine the notability of the site. While the majority of sites that do not meet the criteria are deleted, all of those that do meet the criteria are kept. This criteria is an extension of the following policies:

 Wikipedia:Verifiability
 Wikipedia:Neutral point of view
 Wikipedia:No original research

The following guidelines:

 Wikipedia:Cite sources
 Wikipedia:Reliable sources

And the following tests:

 Wikipedia:Search engine test

Basically, if the site has independent material published about it, receives an award, or is distributed through a notable publisher, information about it can be verified and, most importantly, neutral. This avoids original research. This also allows us to cite reliable sources; Wikipedia is not a primary source or publisher of original research/information. WP:WEB is basically the condensed version of several other policies and guidelines aimed specficially towards websites.",0

I cannot believe that people are so deluded to think that this guy Richard Kastle deserves a damn wikipedia page. 

Why not give every single person who plays piano a page of their own... HELL, why not let anyone just put up a page about themselves. Not only was he previously featured in a video DAMNING deceased pianists about their playing (accusing them of simplifying the ending octave section of Liszts 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody), but hasn't done anything to deserve any special credit. Apart from his compositions which truly aren't anything brilliant - in fact, they're almost bland and boring (from a compositional point of view), he seems to ride on the credit of having played two compositions brilliant (which seems to be the deluded, sick, biased opinion of a guy called MikeCaffey on YouTube) when in fact his playing is sloppy and usually completely drowned in pedal, completely disturbing the balance of sound in the music. 

Now this deluded, sick individual on YouTube (MikeCaffey) seems to go about praising Dick (short for Richard, and far more funny to refer him to that, than Richard) for his compositions, deleting valid posts by real pianists and piano players alike, possibly in an effort to sweeten the image of Dick to others. As a pianist myself, I can safely say that playing the end of Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in c sharp minor brilliantly does not alleviate ones status to piano-god, and even if it did Dick STILL wouldn't be a piano God since he seems intent on drowning the ending with pedal, completely destroying the cleanliness of the parading octaves. 

Letting this slanderous leech of the musical world have a wikipedia page seems insulting to other pianists who truly have talent. Although they may not care whether they have a page or not, I find it insulting to the profession of pianism that Dick has a page of his own. 

Hey - I can play Hungarian Rhapsody... can I have a page???",1

 Preferred use of Virginia-geo-stub? 

Grutness, please help a clueless newbie...  I've got questions about your recent edits to the stub templates that I added to several stub articles I wrote (part of a personal effort to add all historic districts in Arlington County, Virginia, USA to Wikipedia).  See, e.g., your edit to Prospect Hill (Arlington, Virginia).

I understand why you replaced my use of struct-sub with the more specific U.S.-struct-sub (thanks!).  

However, you also eliminated the Virginia-geo-stub I used.  Is this because the geo-stub and its subcategories are only for geographic features, and sites of historic houses (even when those houses no longer stand on site) don't qualify?  If that's the reason, how are geographic features defined?  Clearly they must include natural features (e.g. rivers, mountains).  Do they include political geography (e.g. towns, counties)?  What about properties that may include structures but are also comprised of natural or man-made geography (e.g. ranches, canals)?

I'm happy to conform with preferred usage.  (Indeed, I've got some similar uses of the Virginia-geo-stub on Fort Ethan Allen (Arlington, Virginia) and Fort Albany (Arlington, Virginia) that I'm prepared to remove if necessary.)  I only added the Virginia-geo-stub because I thought my stub articles were more likely to attract the help of Wikipedians who cared about Virginia than from Wikipedians who care about U.S. structures.

Thanks in advance for filling me in.

 

Thanks for the help, Grutness (at User_talk:JohnPomeranz)

 

 Politician-stubs monitoring 

Hi Grutness. As you know, I've been trying to create some kind of order in the politician-stub categories, so I've created a new subpage tracking them for potential splits. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any really good lists carving up Africa into smaller segments, so my list is basically a ripoff from one of your old lists regarding the geo-stubs (I've modified the text and the European and Caucasus categories). I really hope that you don't mind, but I figured that my time was better spent counting stubs than designing something clever. I haven't done the counts for all the subcategories yet, but I have done most of them. Besides, I figured that if we one day start splitting up Africa into smaller fragments, it would be nice with consistency between the politician-stubs and the geo-stubs. I still don't know if it will be necessary, but it's always nice to have the option. Again, I hope you don't mind the ripoff, if you do, I'll redesign the page or kill it asap. Best regards.  (talk) 

Thanks for the reply. I'm not sure it is a good idea at all to split the African continent into segments (yet) but I'd like to keep the possibility open. It is a lot easier doing counts of 200 stubs from 6 countries than 700 from 40 nations. My main motivation is to see a consistent system for both the geo-stubs, the politician-stubs, and any other type of stub. So if the ge",0

Information needing to be inserted into the article

As the Transnistrian referendum deadline approaches, to the support for the separatists from Tiraspol comes disinformation not only from press agencies, but also campaigns in the purest KGB style. This years June month, several publications from Russia and Transdniester made a big deal about the conclusions of a certain report “made by prestigious western experts”, a report which plead for the independence of the separatist region from eastern Moldova. The study was attributed to some institutions with pompous names: """"International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS; where Mauco leads) and """"Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group"""". Among the signatures were quoted several well-known Oxford, Standford or Harvard: Stefan Talmon, Christopher Goebel, Nancy Furman, Paul Williams, Stephen Krasner, Andrew Lorenz, Michael Scharf, William Wookd. These were said to have participated in April 2006, at a conference at the Bacon Hotel in Washington, together with several other experts in international law, among which a high ranking official of the US State Department. They all concluded that “Transdniester has all the required criteria for it to be declared an independent state”, thus flagrantly contradicting the official position of all western governments. The Ziua reporters contacted the quoted professors. Astounded, they declared that they do not have any connection with the report mediatised in the Russian press. Stephen Krasner, professor of international relations at Stanford University declared that he didn`t even wrote about Transdniester ever. Michael Scharf, professor at Case Western University, transmitted to us that the authors of the so called report had done nothing else than to copy and adapt an older study of his and of Paul Williams, written over a decade ago, not about Transdniester, but about Nagorno Karabah. Stefan Talmon, professor an Oxford University declared: “I want to make it clear that I was not involved in the writing of this report. I suspect that the implication of the mentioned names was used to give a certain credibility to that report, and to deceive the public”. Ziuas investigation was taken over and continued by the The Economist. After studing the text of the report, the bitish journalist concluded that despite it`s academic language, certain expressions betrayed the fact that English was not the maternal language of the authors. For example, the use of the expression """"telephone centrals"""" instead of """"exchanges"""" is a very common error found in Russian to English translations.The surprises continued. The british journalists found that at the Bacon Hotel in Washington had not taken place any such conference. None of the mentioned personalities had passed through there. About the two organizations which created the study, the journalists came to the conclusion that they are very strange. From the so called Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group it appears that there is nothing except the organizations label, informs the Economist in its 3rd August edition, in an article called """"Propaganda Wars Returns"""".

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.

Your Uncivil Friends Refuted

Or were you saying something to the over 300 people who've downloaded this refutation of you're lies?:

And so that everyone can see part of it here:

JoshuaZ said:

""""Starfire, as I tried to explain to you Wikipedia cares about reliable sources and verifiability, not truth. Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.""""

Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, """"Now"""" is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?

JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.

Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, """"Now"""" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?

Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:

Joshua also said:

""""In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.""""

Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?

Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:

""""ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using """"Darwinist"""" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?

""""if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!

""""I suggest you calm down""""

I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?

I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:

""""Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."""" - Ephesians 4:26-27

Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's. 

""""and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.""""

Oh the old """"you need to read it but I don't"""" and """"you sit and think while your grounded young man"""" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.

I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.

I'll enhance the list for you:

Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.

Never trust spell-checkers, it's better to guess, and your's was better than that of the Japanese gentleman who, prey to a phonological difficulty in pronouncing 'l', wrote 'interrectual', which is, judging by the historical record, an occupational hazard of that class. It's a medicinal necessity for me to pick on people, as it stops me from picking my nose, which can lead to major haemorrhaging (sp.?)at my age, and I dislike the idea of an obituary writing that down as the cause of my death.  

sorry nishidani I removed your bit on league of nation mandate as it is already mentioned further up the article..  
No need to apologize. We all make errors, and I more than most. I can never get any work done, trying to reason on talk pages. I see now Shiruberstein, an editor I like, is taking me to task for never having writing any article of quality, but only edit-warred (? a strange interpretation of a 3 year attempt to reason through fundamental problems to get some lineaments of consensus) so I guess I must rethink everything here. It really is a waste of time. Cheers   

I love the chuckleheads. I've always just got on with thing, I don't so much lead with the chin as charge in full steam ahead. I had a great laugh at cool making out that I had done the """"large make over"""" when it was one of them, I just added bits to his make over. They don't seem to appreciate quotes from books that can't be found in JVL...bye the bye, nice bit on Lebanon not invading Israel. greatly appreciated..The tripe tripe that Israelophiles trot out has been found to be false many years ago and still they try to shovel manure...  
Don't use the word 'Israelophiles' within my hearing. There are a lot of people who love that country, within and beyond, and yet are as deeply distressed by its military and political history as they are of their own. (Many virulent critics of America are infused with a deep patriotism, idem elsewhere). Always distinguish, cultivate an ear for nuance, particularly in what you say or think, otherwise you needlessly offend decent people. (Asto the rest, of course)  

I'm sorry if the word offends...I don't know of any other word that can be used to describe someone who is in love with Israel...Its use is the same as Anglophile or francophile...I have come to the conclusion that nationalism is a destructive force with very few redeeming qualities....  
You're right in logical terms, since it has analogies with the terms with which you compared it. But language is not logical (it is one of the flaws in I/P articles that no attention is paid to this, despite academic literature on the issue), but full of queered exceptions, where tone and use subvert comparisons rooted in a sense of parity. For example, just the fact that in standard usage, -phile is suffixed to a disyllabic term for a country ('Anglo'/'Franco'/'Sino'/'Russo'), whereas Israelo-, having three syllables, differs and creates a slight jarring difference from the norm, counts. There's an informal rule that ethnic disyllable are neutral, a pejorative connotations elicit monosyllables ('spik, wog, yid, chink, gook, hun','nip'/'jap', 'frog' etc., though exceptions exist, 'Polack') and this plays round the other terms, to nuance them in various ways. Language is a minefield, and what to one ear sounds okay, to others may resonate differently.
To illustrate on a different level, Wiki as I said is full of incoherencies over pages, and hidden traps, and most efforts, as the present one on 'Judea and Samaria' to get clarity and conceptual coherence into the encyclopedia fail because most people are tone-deaf to these things. One I noted long ago was that in articles like that on Avraham Stern,Lehi, orGush Enumin you'll often note native Israeli editors insisting on the word 'underground' to describe them, these ultra-Zionist terrorist movements, and, I don't think this word is used of comparable Arab movements i",0

YOU PEOPLE ARE AT IT AGAIN.

He first started achieving major public notoriety in early 2007, when he made complaints of harassment at Columbia University, against students who allegedly called him a """"baby killer"""" for being in the military

No, he first made his complaints in early 2006. This gained him attention at Columbia. Then he wrote articles for a student newspaper, a military newspaper and on some right-wing blogs. That got him noticed by national right-wing media, i.e., Fox News. In late 2006, left-wing students publicized his pornography background. It was largely ignored.

Then he got the CPAC award on the same day that Ann Coulter made her comment about John Edwards. That caused the gay blogs to dig up what had been reported in late '06. The story of CPAC applauding Coulter while honoring a gay porn star and hooked spread to non-gay liberal blogs, and then to MSNBC's Countdown. That's how it became a national story.

In the ensuing controversy, it became public knowledge that Sanchez himself had been a performer in homosexual/bisexual[4] adult films in the early 1990s. The story became popular in the blogosphere, especially among homosexual bloggers who insinuated rumors about the details of Sanchez's past.

Sanchez appears in 38 gay porn movies. About 15 of them are originals, the rest re-compilations. Of the 38 videos, one is titled """"Bi Conflict,"""" but in that video Sanchez performs homosexual acts. Sanchez has never had anything other than gay sex on film. These are not """"homosexual/bisexual films."""" He is a gay porn actor who appeared in gay porn films for gay viewers.

There has been no """"insinuation"""" of """"rumors."""" Rather, there has been reporting of solid evidence. Sanchez prostituted under the name Excellent Top between 1999 and 2002, and operated the No Regrets Massage service, a front for prostitution, in 2004. He directly admitted prostitution in an appearance on the Alan Colmes show on March 8, 2007, and in an article published the same day on Salon.com

Sanchez revealed that Countdown never bothered to contact him before running the television report. Countdown sourced several gay blogs to complete the report, as well as committed left-wing ideologue Max Blumenthal who claimed that Sanchez was apart of a greater """"an underground railroad"""" for fallen gay right-wingers.

Calling Bluemental """"a committed left-wing ideologue"""" is straight out of an O'Reilly Factor script. It is an outrageous violation of Wikipedia's purported neutrality. So is saying that Sanchez """"revealed"""" that Countdown """"never bothered"""" to contact him.

Critics charge that Sanchez has given conflicting statements about rumors from anonymous bloggers.

The use of the phrase """"rumors from anonymous bloggers"""" is straight out of an O'Reilly Factor, an is an outraegous violation of Wikipedia's purported neutrality. First off, they are not rumors. Remember, the so-called """"rumors"""" have proven true. Secondly, most bloggers are anonymous. This does not by itself indict them or the information they provide, any more than a newspaper story without a byline indicts the newspaper that prints it.

In an op-ed piece in Salon.com, Sanchez likened porn to prostitution, he subsequently said he wanted to draw that same analogy on his first appearances on Colmes Radio show.""""[24]

First off, whatever he claimed that he had """"wanted"""" to do on Colmes is immaterial. The Colmes interview stands on its own. Secondly, he made the claim about what he """"wanted"""" to do on a blog. But this time, it was on a right-wing """"ex-gay"""" blog. Since when does Wikipedia elevation right-wing ex-gay blogs to a superior status? Some """"neutrality"""" you people show!

A later report by the same writer appeared on April 1, 2007, indicating that Sanchez was also being investigated by the Marine Corps for fraudulently soliciting funds from two organizations, the United War Veteran's Council and U-Haul, in order to fund a deployment to Iraq which he never actually made. Sanchez has denied the charges; saying that he never collected money from either organization.[25]

Excuse me, but Sanchez's denial of fraudulent solicitation is a non-denial. In fact, Sanchez admitted soliciting the money. Whether or not he collected it has no bearing on whether or not he solicited it. Those are two separate issues. Extortion doesn't have to succeed to be extortion.

There is a larger point to be made here, which is that Sanchez's various explataions have been a circus of multi-contradictions. It is not """"neutral"""" to split the difference. Facts are neutral. So report the facts. How hard is it to report the facts?""",0

I created this article because Robyn E. Kenealy is a notable member of the New Zealand comics community. I agree, a lot of the subsequent edits since my original ones are puffery, and look like they are by the same anonymous person. The article I wrote was fairly minimal in detail (see Robyn_E._Kenealy&oldid;=191510307), but my original edits were well sourced. I am particularly concerned that Cameron Scott does  not recognise New Zealand Comics - Comics.org.nz as an authoritative source because it is an open source wiki. This website is the authoritative resource for information about New Zealand comics. While individual contributors can add their information to this wiki, content is stringently moderated by Funtime Comics's sysops Darren Schroeder, Ruth Boyask and Isaac Freeman. The website has also won awards for its content. This is an important issue because if you set the precendent in this article of saying comics.org.nz website is not authoritative you are undermining comics culture in New Zealand.",0

"A Diversion?
============

Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.'

The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.

The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.

The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you.'

The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response.

Annoyed by what he perceived to be the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said impatiently, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Do not ignore us this way! Take us to your leader or I will fire!' 

The older alien again warned his comrade saying, 'You probably don't want to do that! I really don't think you should make him mad.'

'Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon at the pump and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards them and blew the younger alien off his feet and deposited him a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.

Half an hour passed until he finally regained consciousness. Refocusing his three eyes, he straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.

'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?'

The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you don't want to mess with a guy who can loop his penis over his shoulder and stick it in his ear.'

"per physical appearance 

In regards to your question about adding more pictures, one of the main concerns of editors on the MJ page is that the pictures are cluttering up the text and making it more difficult to read. I would have to agree with this concern: as nice as pictures are, wikipedia is about information and this is conveyed through text and to-the-point pictures. I think that putting pictures documenting the change in Michael's appearance would draw undue attention to that facet of his life. Sure, a few pictures are good, but these show him in some important light, whether in a record-breaking video, or on the cover of one of his record-breaking albums, or during a popular performance. That leads me on to your other query, about using images from live, recent events. The only problem there is that, IMO, the picture quality decreases and that brings recentism to the article. Basically, it's focussing too much on the present, whereas wikipedia is meant to equally document MJ's entire life. Finally, regards the 80s picture, I was actually against it a while back, and tried to replace it with a then-recent picture of his acceptance of a 'Legend Award' in Japan. I didn't manage this successfully, but then I realized that the current picture is probably the best one to be there. It is the perfect representation of MJ, in the prime of his career, epitomizing the success that he was, and IMO still is. To put a 2007 picture would bring recentism to the article, and most editors don't like that. Anyway, I hope that I've answered some of the queries you have. If you need to know anything else just contact me on my talk page. Thanks.",0

The things are quite complicated and there is another possibility for the origin of the latinized version Carolus and I do not think it directly comes from *Kar(i)laz, because Carolus was borrowed from Germanic, when Common Germanic had already disappeared for a long time, that is quite hypothetic, and there is another possible etymology.

Thanks.  I'm not really that into the crises.  Bishonen and I approach Wikipedia very differently, and we can never understand why the other one doesn't get involved in Crisis X or Y that is so clearly all-important.  I care about policy.  I figure that the principle of the thing is extremely important, and if we get good policies and stick to them until it hurts (and then change them when enough people feel the pain, but only with consideration of the pains we feel and the ones we want to avoid), all will be well.  I think Bishonen cares about people, and particularly people getting stomped on by the bullies of the site.  She helps people.  Anyway, it kind of explains why I'll just drop anchor on some prinicple or another and stay there, no matter what (like listening to what AfD says and not unilaterally undeleting, like rejecting the notion that there are """"expert"""" editors).

Since I want to be more of an expert on the culture and politics of 1700-1750, I'm on a groove to get a bio of every one of the dunces in, and I was shocked to find that my employer's library has a 2004 DNB.

So we're back at the point we were before - is there something special about the relationship between Hagos and Biasutti that allows this transfer of expertise just by citation? My point is that it takes years of training, experience and recognition by others in the field to be considered an expert in that field. You seem to be saying Hagos got it just by citing Biasutti. If David Attenborough cited Niels Bohr would he become an expert in Physics? No he wouldn't, he'd just be an expert in biology who happened to cite an expert in physics once - we wouldn't be able to accept anything he said about quantum mechanics or block holes as fact until we checked it with a genuine expert in the field. So what makes you think Hagos has become an expert in human skin colour just by citing Biasutti? And remember that the policy doesn't just state """"expert"""",  it states """"established expert in the topic whose previous work in the field has been published by reliable third-party publications"""" - unless you are you going to argue that Hagos got Biasutti's reputation and previous publications as well I think this is a dead end argument. You should accept that Hagos doesn't meet the criteria laid down by the WP policy for the creators of self-published sources.
If you don't think that Hagos chose the colours for each country then who do you think did it? They didn't just magically change due to """"migration trends"""" - somebody made a decision that colour X goes in country Y. From the evidence we have it would appear that Hagos was the one who made that decision - it certainly wasn't made by Biasutti or the writers of the national census data that he cites as his sources.
It makes no difference to the situation so I won't argue it, but for the record I don't accept that Hagos is a recognised expert on migration.

 A Third Way 

Ok, I'm starting to see what you guys are saying. However, to be honest I don't think this article is really about the brand. The first sentence of the article is about the brand, but most of the article is about the product(s). I mean, the section on """"connectivity"""" is clearly about the connectivity of the various iPod products themselves, and not the brand. So here is what I propose: zero article in the lead (and anywhere else where we are talking about the brand), but normal usage throughout the rest of the article, where appropriate. So """"The iPod is associated with one host computer,"""" would remain the same since it's talking about the product and not the brand. This way we can maintain a grammatically euphonious format throughout, and not have to awkwardly restructure sentences to stay in line with Apple-speak. Basically my fear was that this page would end up sounding like the iPod manual, which, to anyone who has read it, is clearly super-weird.
And for the record, I am writing this on a MacBook, I have two iPods, and I love Steve Jobs. But I love the English language more.

Looking forward to your thoughts.  """,0

For instance, if you were to look at """"edit this page"""" you could see a sentence here: .   This is occasionally done in articles for a variety of reasons:
Put in a notice about vandalism (such as is done on Chuck Norris, which is also, at present, semi-protected), or when the same mistake is made by many users,
Automated bots sometimes also """"remove"""" an image by enclosing it in comments, when the image may be added incorrectly.
In rare cases, text additions are put in comments so that other editors can see them, before the material is added to the article properly.  This is usually a bad use of the comments, since it makes things confusing to edit.
They often appear at the end of semi-automated template messages, to indicate which message was used (that is where the """"Template:Unsigned"""").  So, for instance, I wrote {{subst:unsigned|00 tux}}, and the unsigned template was added.

My pleasure. I think I have to apologize for subjecting you to the diatribe it engendered but, as I think you might agree, it tends to prove the point in an ironic way. I just looked at your talk page and decided that the minor whining *I* get from new page patrol is relatively polite compared to what you seem to have attracted  hence the *. Accounting4Taste:talk  
NalinWiki, you deleted my article while I was still writing it on the basis that it contained """"no references whatsoever"""" but allow your own article to stand even though it contains """"no references whatsoever"""". Please, please explain how your point been proven in """"an ironic way"""". Go ahead. Explain it. All I have seen so far from you is reckless deletion of other people`s work followed by pathetic back-slapping from like-minded wreckers. If you are going to have a dig at me, why not do it on my own talk page? You weren`t shy to destroy four hours of my work, so why be shy now? Kont Dracula (talk) 

I think you've confused the two of us; I must take credit for some statements that have apparently offended you, having signed them, so feel free to express yourself here about them. If you want the contents of an article that was deleted, in order to work on adding citations in a """"sandbox"""" page, you can either ask me or another administrator for assistance. If you have any other questions about Wikipedia policies, I'll be happy to direct you to the relevant pages. And if you'd like to work on contributing to Wikipedia in a worthwhile way, in accordance with our policies, I think everyone here will try to assist you. Accounting4Taste:talk  
No, I haven`t confused anything. There is not very much to confuse between you two drones anyway. I see that you are not very good at answering specific questions about specific articles. Evidently, you feel much safer describing deleted articles that you have not even read as """"steaming crap"""" than you are actually discussing the actual merits of said articles. A really positive, worthwhile contribution there. Is that the kind of """"contribution"""" you want me to make? Hardly surprising that you prefer the classic politburo repsonse of """"directing me to the relevant"""" regulations rather than discuss the merits of the case in question. Yet you have the arch hypocrisy to highlight the """"assume good faith"""" legend on your page.

Well I do have some questions about wikipedia policy, as you mention it:

1) Is it an acceptable practice for a wikipedia adminstrator to delete articles which are in the very process of being written without consultation or clarification on the basis that they do not contain references when the very same administrator has himself posted less relevant articles which do not contain references himself?

2) If the answer to the above is yes (and I have to conclude that it is, as that is precisely what has happened) would it be fair to conclude that wikipedia administrators feel themselves above and not subject to the same criteria for notability and verification as non-administrators? After all, my article contained no references and was deleted. NawlinWiki`s contained no references and was amended when I pointed it out. Please refer me to the relevant pages. Kont Dracula (talk) 

1. Yes, to the first part of the question; administrators can delete articles without consultation or clarification. Articles that are being considered for deletion are assessed entirely on their own terms, and not with reference to any other article, so comparison of your article (which I have read) with any article created or edited by anyone else is not a relevant consideration. You can read the relevant policy at WP:WAX. 
Well I didn`t expect you to be so candid about it. So you believe that it is entirely acceptable for an administrator to completely ignore the very regulations that he is so dogmatically enforcing onto others. You still haven`t referred me to the """"relevant"""" page on that one.

But no, you have not """"read"""" my article because it was in the very process of being written when it was deleted. I am sure that there was a great deal of improvement that it required. There were some slightly whimiscial and humourous details which were possibly not appropriate for a wikipedia entry. It wasn`t perfect. You see, that is why I was editing it and indeed still writing it.

Of course, in reality we know that you have not actually expressed your own opinion. You were pretty forward with your opinion the other day though, weren`t you? You described other people`s articles as """"steaming shit"""". Now though, you are not quite so forward with your opinion. Instead, you try to retreat behind """"guidelines"""" """"r",0

Thank you for the responses. Obviously I made a couple of mistakes. The version immediately before yours did have some gaps and problems that I overlooked. I guess the sentences, """"The social implication of viewing ageing as a disease could be profound, though this classical is not yet widespread."""" and """" Lepers were a group of afflicted individuals who historically shunned and the term """"leper"""" still evokes social sigma. Fear of disease can still be a widespread social phenomena. Yet not all disease evoke extreme social stigma.""""  made me think you were not a native english speaker because of the multitude of simple number and agreement errors as well as the awkward structure and unusual word use.

I was trying to get rid of the false distinction between disease and syndrome and linkage of symptom to syndrome. A syndrome is simply a combination of problems (not just symptoms in the accurate sense of subjective complaints) often observed together and presumably related. Whether a condition is called Smith disease or Smith syndrome is more a matter of historical contingency than any meaningful denotative distinction. It looked like you were reasserting that and I was trying to get rid of it.

 I understand your point. I will have to agree with you on renaming as well. From what I understand, it would be similar to what Current main Luftwaffe article has. A sub section representing Combat history in WWII. One might even add the other article of Organization of Luftwaffe in WWII as another section. 

   So How are we to go about getting this done ? As it is, all 3 articles have sufficient referenced information on their own. All we need is to put it together in a coherent fashion. 

P.S. I am sorry I was not able to see Archive section. I could only see the Page history.

  
>Hi.

>At the moment it would take a considerable effort. I think that reaching GA status would require the article to be split up, with a brief description >under each section then the main article as a sub article. I also think the History of the Luftwaffe of WWII should be something different. Meaning, that >it should perhaps cover the entire histroy of the air force, and this particular article should be renamed the """"Combat history of the Luftwaffe During >World War Two"""". I had checked this out before (check out the first archive section). I think renaming the article is in order. Dapi89 (talk) 18:52, 11 >September 2008 (UTC)""",0

Ok, here's the God's honest truth:

It was however pretty rude. Did you really not notice?

Nope. I thought it was a generally polite critique

Btw, as it says on the FAC page, new nominations go at the top. 

I can't say I read that bit too closely

Don't you see anything wrong with bouncing yours up to upstage newer noms, with extra attention as the top post and extra time on FAC before your article """"rolls off""""? 

I didn't think about it thqat much

1) What was your purpose in moving the nomination to the top?  

So that it hot more attention and constructive critisism.

did you notice Worldtraveller moved your nomination back down with a rather tight-lipped edit summary?

No. I never ventured to read the history page

Johnleemk also warned you that he considered your """"playful jibe"""" a personal attack. 

I would like to point out that I was quick to correct him

C'mon, the place for """"playful jibes"""" like that is in interchange with friends who're used to your tone and will (I presume) enjoy it! It's just foolish to hurl them at strangers, and even more foolish to keep it up when they show they've taken umbrage.

 Neutrality tag 

OK... Uku has tagged the article as not being neutral... so, what is not neutral about it?   

Respond to the points that I brought up, which continue to accumulate for each instance of bullshit that you post on here.   
I am responding to your points ... you just don't like what I have to say.  (I get the idea that you equate """"agree with me"""" as a valid response, and """"don't agree with me"""" as """"bullshit"""".) And once again you are attempting to avoid the question... what is not neutral about the article?   
WP:CIVIL refers to this as """"feigned incomprehension."""" Learn how to scroll up.   
Nothing feigned about it... I think this article is excrutiatingly neutral in tone, so I really do not see how you can think otherwise.  In any case... since you don't seem to want to discuss your concerns point by point... I have responded to them all below.   
You have not proven that this article is """"excruciatingly neutral."""" You are simply reacting defensively and irrationally. You may have invested a lot into it already, and that may be distorting your perspective. As someone looking in from the outside, it appears, on no uncertain terms, that this article is biased. In addition, you have demonstrated a lack of self-control, compassion and objectivity, which are all needed to make unbiased statements.   
I wish I had more time to take part in the discussions these days, but best guess is that 'current version' =! 'his version', therefore 'current version' =! neutral.
I would suggest that the current version is as close as an article of this kind is going to get - it reports simple facts (per WP:V) without taking a bias as far as possible (per WP:NPOV). This is not saying that todays version can't be improved though, but 's changes were not an improvement.
Off course, if we were apply WP:UNDUE and WP:FRINGE heavoly to this article we might as well delete the whole thing - but thats beside the point. I would argue that the neutrailty tag is misused on this article.
  
You don't have enough time to engage in discussion, yet you are certain that the neutrality tag is misused and you apparently have enough time to click """"undo."""" Your sincerity is questionnable.   
Nice ad hominen there, but perhaps you had something more usefull to add to the discusson?   
Flamebait. Sock puppeting.   

 responding to Uku's points 

Let's try again... since you don't seem to want to discuss them point by point, fine... I will deal with them all together:

The article uses the phrase """"in the broadest terms"""" which clearly shows intent to diminish or otherwise misrepresent the subject matter.
The exact sentence is: Masonic conspiracy theories are a subset of conspiracy theories involving Freemasonry. In broadest terms, these theories claim that Masonic conspiracy theories are a subset of conspiracy theories involving Freemasonry. This is a statement that summarizes a broad concept that is common to most of the theories. Wikipedia's style guidelines say we are supposed to summarize the article in broad scope in the intro... that is what we do (even a quick look at the list shows that most of the theories claim this in some way. How is it not neutral?
It insinuates that the subject matter does not warrant serious consideration. Besides, that phrase is not only false, but exaggerated   
False? It's a very accurate description, but the meaning don't change much if we rewrite it to """"''Masonic conspiracy theories are a subset of conspiracy theories involving Freemasonry. These theories claim that Masonic conspiracy theories are a subset of conspiracy theories involving Freemasonry. - it just turns the last sentence into a fragment and a repeat of the first.

"Hal Siemer and Quest Magazine 

I find your inclusion of these two articles in Category:Freemasonry and other related Masonic categories to be incorrect.

Oh you dont say!! I think you will find it very clear from everything I have contributed towards on wikipedia that concerns this subject, that I am the one who has clarrified that it was a Muslim-Christian conflict. And no, once again, you are very biased, and lack alot of knowledge about your own faith. Yes, there were Europeans, the 'west', what were they then,?? Africans, Asians?? that part of the world is called Europe. The crusaders came from all over Europe, so get that right for starters. And let me tell you this, these muslims who were 'invading' Byazantinian lands, were the people of the middle east who were conquered by the byzantinians. These 'pleaing' byzantinians, along with the ROMAN catholics were all trinitarian christians, and remenat of the pagan Roman Religeon (due to the inevitable spread of true jesuit unitarian christianity, the roman empire found itself in a critical position and had to adopt the christian faith and embed it in their previous pagan beliefs, hence the celebration of sunday- rather than the jesuit saturday- sunday was tthe holy day for pagan romans. The cross, a pagan roman sign-never adopted by jesus. the fish, a pagan Egyptian sign adopted by the romans, the trinity, the whole tihing about the vatican in rome etc etc.)were massacring the indigenous people of the levant which they occupied, who were mostly unitarian sects of christianity, and the followers of the more accurate versions of the gospel (which weree written fairly shortly after Jesus's ascent-not the centuries old, heavily altered versions you follow). These Unitarians had prophecies in their gospels of  the coming of a final prophet, and the signs and times pointed to Mohammad and most of them adopted Islam, because they knew Mohammad was their prophet, as prophesized by Jesus. The byzantinians (romans) were killing them and there familys, and they were deemed by the church at the councils of nicea as heretics, so the mass population who were invaded by romans, were indeed monotheistic Unitarians. The Muslims liberated these people of the land from the tyrant byzantinians. Even under Islamic rule, the roman minority citizens were left to live in peace amongst the Muslims, and a testimony to this is the fact that these same roman minorities still live on in  the middle east.
Jerusalem was sacked ny the romans, and its people liberated by the Muslims.
And were YOU aware that the inquisition (which by the way you put it acted independantly from the church-stop lying, the church was the ultimate ruler as everyone knows, which murdered science and scientists and had complete control over everyone-as seen by the call to the crusades. You are an apologetic, not muslims, everything was done in the name of the church, why, even colonialists came into countries and plundered them with priests accompanying them)You claim it has nothing to do with the church-and I never said that the inquisition was called for by the pope, where did you get that rubbish from?? dont put words in my mouth-however, up until the 18th /19th century, the bodies and skeletons of muslims and 'heretics' killed by the inquisition were still hangig from the ceilings of churches!! The church is the one who deems people as heretics, and is the one who approved of the killings full stop. Please dont try to correct me before you yourself go and do some academic unbiased research like I did, most of my sources were non muslim sources that were ballanced. (obviously unlike you)
And about the pope issuing edicts against the killing of muslims or Jews, well what do you mean THE pope, dont you mean, A pope (there were many you know). And this is about the inquisittion and not the pope, perhaps a pope at a different time to the inquisition said that they (logically) shouldnt kill other people like barbarians, Im not doubting, you, but it would be helpful if you could mention the name. Again, dont go off the topic, this was about hte inquisition.
And yes, I bloomin love life under Islam, as a woman I feel liberated and free, and as an environmentallist and a concerned person for childrens rights i feel supported, and as a lover of logic and equality I feel I found the truth (there was a debate in the church at one point and they were discussing whether or not women were humans!!!!) If it wasnt for Islam the motor wouldnt have been invented (the crank shaft) tall buildings (dur to architectural techniques) education including higher education for all sexes classes and colours, merit was becasue of knowledge, and not wealth, and there is so much more that is owed to them, basically, we would have stil been living in huts right now if it wasnt for them, and dont forget that the romans forcibly converted us to roman 'christianity' when they invaded us.

 Locations 
Thailand.
While Phuket is a more popular and well known general tourist location in Thailand that includes sex tourism.  Pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism.  I dont know Phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more non-sex tourists so if I were going to identify a place in Thailand if not the world I would mention Pattaya instead and I am tempted to edit.  I hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more """"sex for money"""" going on in Pattaya than Phuket. But for someone considering the phrase """"sex tourism"""" as not necessarily pejorative I have to qualify this conclusion.  
Note that """"bar girls"""" in Thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general Thai population also.  Although I beleive that there are words in Thai for prostitute they mostly (at least the girls) prefer to call themselves """"rented wifes"""" albeit for """"short time"""" rather then """"long time"""".  I therefore need to be qualify my Pattaya versus Phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and  rented wifes particularly of the """"long-term"""" married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the """"wifes"""" direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both.  There is no such thing as a free lunch and """"everybody pays for it"""". 
[Note that I neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist (note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing) and moreover consider them culturally aware (particurlay Thailand wise).  The fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones! One must be aware that labels, concepts, ideas such as """"sex tourism"""" carry suggestions associated with Religion particularly Judeo-Christiam-Islamic (JDI) pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the (Religious) worlds worldviews outside of some tribal, village, usually Buddhist and what I like to call """"Giesha cultures"""": e.g. Japan, Thailand etc, versus """"Virgin cultures"""" typically (JDI) that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage. (Note that Thai Society is strangely contradictory in this regard  aren't we all!  but then Thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west.)  Perhaps some historio-religious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also.  I hate value laden western (and Religious) labels that dress themselves up psuedo-scientificly as culturally universal. Exploitation of the child aside their is vastly more """"exploitation"""" going on outside of the sex busniess in the third world under global capitalism like Chinese factories where labourers - girls included - work excruciating long hours for a few Yuan or RMB.]

"""==WARNING: MEMBER THE WIKIPEDIAN GREEK NATIONALISTIC JUNTA. By User:Balkan ==

Too many death peaople: Alexander Litvinenko, Sergej Juschenkow and Wladimir Golowljow, and Anna Politkovskaja.

 http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicherheitsrat_der_Russischen_Föderation

Secretary of the federation is: 2001 - 2004 Wladimir Ruschailo, he has to be asked as well towards the topics, because his period ended as well with the beginning of putin.

Ivan Rybkin was the security-secretary of the russian federation and as well special-secretary for the Tschetschenien-war. He was called """"Mr. Consens"""" so he made peace with them in a mute way - the opposite of Putin: a loud war. And this was as well the topic of Anna Politkovskaya and Alexander Litvinenko: the war against Tschetschenien, which should be strategic product of """"burning the house down""""-Putin, in their eyes.

So the real focus is the nowerdays work of Ivan Rybkin.

The categorization is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Yes, members of the Church are often known as """"Mormons,"""" but that is the nickname that a lot of people call them by. The Church says that the official term for these members is """"members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.""""

Of course some people think that's rather long to say, so the church acknowledges that people will often call the members just """"Mormons."""" Nevertheless, that remains as only a nickname for the church and part of the official name of one of the books of scripture, The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, because of the prophet named Mormon who abridged the original writings. The only other official names with """"Mormon"""" in them are the book Mormon Doctrine and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. As for members themselves, reference to them as """"Mormons"""" remains only a nickname.

So you say that the official info box text is to leave it without nickname quotes. So what? Why shouldn't we ammend that official policy so that it makes room for that type of labeling? And so what if there is """"no need"""" (<- those are the """"you're saying it, not me; and not that I believe you"""" quotes right there) to change it? That doesn't mean there would be anything """"wrong"""" (as you'd probably say) with adding them, does it? They are not errant. They are not like adding an apostrophe to a word where none belongs, in an attempt to form a plural! They are good to show outsiders the difference between the official church name and the nickname. What's so """"sinister"""" about that? I say we change WP:Mormon's rule about it. Why not? Well, of course that would require a concensus, but why would people have to be so opposed to it?

What about the intro. of Donny Osmond?

 Newly created/added cat is POV/OR 

Adding new cat Category:LGBT rights opposition is not appropriate here for reasons stated on the cat's Talk page section entitled, """"Cat violates Wiki policy?""""

Further, as illustrated on Concerned Women for America, the cat may be controversial, and cats are not used for controversial material.  The existence of controversy evidences the cat is inappropriate for the page.  In particular, WP:CAT says:

Particular considerations for categorizing articles:
It should be clear from verifiable information in the article why it was placed in each of its categories. Use the  template if you find an article in a category that is not shown by sources to be appropriate, or the  template if the article gives no clear indication for inclusion in a category.

Obviously, it is not """"clear from verifiable information in the article"""" if the wiki community keeps removing it.

I urge and support removal of the cat, else I urge the addition of either or both cat templates shown above from WP:CAT.

 For Richard 20Feb07
Unfortunately Haar 2005 – reviewed the book this is not about explsion 1944-1948(1950) it is about ethnic cleanings before 1945 done by Germans and scientists who supported this ideas.
Overmans book 2000, “Deutsche militärische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg.” Is strictly about German military losses nothing more – nothing there about expulsion?

I confess that I don't know what Nitschke has to say on this subject.

She says: “Of around 12.4 million Germans within the lands of post-war Poland in 1944, six million fled or were evacuated, 3.6 million were expelled, one million were verified as Poles, 300,000 remained in Poland as a German minority, and up to 1.1 million died (p. 280).”
Thus that means TOTAL: 1.1 millions deaths.

She also says: “Though estimates of the dead range widely, as many as ‘’’a million Germans’’’ perished during flight and expulsion from Poland in 1944-45.”

It means in years 1946 - 1950? 100.000. Take for consideration that so call wild expulsion started on May 1945 and the 1944 and first part of 1945 was actually the flight.

Next she says: “In the long fourth chapter, Nitschke turns to the expulsions, which came in three waves. During a period of """"wild expulsions"""" from May to July 1945, the Polish military drove up to 400,000 Germans across Poland's new western border.”

“The second wave of expulsions came after the Potsdam conference, but before the """"organized transfer"""" of remaining Germans began in early 1946. From August to December, 1945, Poles expelled close to 600,000 more Germans in poorly organized transports.”

“The final phase involved the transfer of 2.25 million Germans in a process coordinated with British and Soviet authorities in occupied Germany in 1946 and 1947.” """,0

Against merge
The Uvs Nuur has already been confused by making the article about the lake instead of the basin. Much of the relevant information has been removed or confused in the merge or copy/paste or whatever an editor did. The hollow, although lumped in with the World Heritage site is really about a different set of issues including nomadic peoples, archeology sites, enormous variation in terrain, endangered animals etc. The current article on Uvs Nuur seems to have missed all the relevant points on the geological aspects, plus the name of the article is different from the name given on World Heritage Site. Further, the editors have disregarded that almost all citations are about the basin; there is hardly anything in the article about the lake. 

If you refuse to allow editors to write articles that they are interested in, and insist on an instant mindless merge, we can have an RFC, which I will abide by, unless you consent to a rewrite of the current article so it is accurate and not confusing. Why do you have such an investment in preventing other editors from writing articles about what they are interested in. It is against policy to #REDIRECT without a discussion which is what was done before. Please consider this, rather than instinctively merge everything. Many articles have been ruined by mindless merging.   """,0

"In defence of China! 

Hey Koreans, who the fuck do you think you're dealing with. Guess what, Gaogouli was a Chinese vassal you stupid fucks. After the fall of the Tang Dynasty, close to 700,000 were incorporated into Tang history, a little less than half migrated to the Central Plains, 100,000 to the Chinese state of Bohai and only 100,000 into Xinluo (Silla). Most Gaogouli descendants are Chinese.

With the sole exception of Ansi fort itself, Tang troops destroyed Gaogouli soldiers on the battlefield, despite being a significantly smaller force. If anything, Gaogouli only DEFENDED itself from assaults from Sui and Tang. Gaogouli was a mere Chinese vassal, nothing more. The greatest threat came from the TuBo, TuJue and HuiHe from the west.

There is another source for Tavernor on his derivation of """"plus or minus"""" 
and why he chose """"Smoot's Ear"""" for his title:
http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N43/smoot.html
This is an account by Marie Y. Thibault of Tavernor's speech at MIT 
about his book, with Smoot in attendance.

Both his Preface and his speech have similar structures concerning 
Smoot's Ear and """"plus or minus"""".
Both appear to be explanations of his choice of title.
Both open with """"+ 1 ear"""".
It's presented by Tavernor as the historical basis, i.e., the 
historical measurement as shown by the 1987 plaque, and the 
decades of paint on the bridge.
Both derive """"plus or minus"""" from """"+ 1 ear"""".
Neither states that the historical measurement was """"plus or minus"""". 
Thibault gives a direct quote from Tavernor 'The significance of
Smoot’s Ear is that is stands for an approximation, a “plus or
minus”'.
""""Smoot's Ear"""" is a component of the historical measurement,
""""+ 1 ear"""".
""""stands for"""" is clearly not an historical recounting,
but a reference to Tavernor's interpretation.
He's distinguishing the earlier """"Ear"""" from his contribution,
""""plus or minus"""".

If """"plus or minus"""" were already part of the historical record, it
wouldn't be necessary or desirable to begin with """"+ 1 ear"""".

""""Plus or minus"""" was not part of the historical record, it was
introduced (for purposes of this discussion) by Tavernor as
his interpretation, not part of the historical record.   
Tavernor's account in the Thibault article is clearer on some of 
these points than the Preface, but both seem to achieve the same 
basic end, explaining how the """"ear"""" in """"+ 1 ear"""" from the
measurement on the bridge leads to the ideas in the book, beginning
with """"plus or minus"""", i.e., uncertainty.

Tavernor isn't trying to say that his treatment was on the bridge,
nor measured on the bridge,
quite the contrary, that he took this human measurement, with a
component obviously intended to provoke, inter alia, the notion
of uncertainty, and related it to the whole history of
measurement and made a book of it.

It doesn't matter how many times Tavernor says
the bridge measures 364.4 Smoots plus/minus an Ear.
He could say it 300 times.
He might even say the length of the bridge is 360
Smoots plus or minus an ear.
That has its own truth.
These are only a couple of simple derivative forms 
out of a host of possible derivative forms.
From what are they derived?
Tavernor tells us.
He begins his Preface and book and speech on this subject with
the historical measurement, 364.4 smoots + 1 ear.

Tavernor's first reference citation within his book, for the 
Preface, which certainly seems to be the one he considers most
important, is to what he calls a corroborating interview 
http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5043041
That's the one I quoted earlier 
[ 2005-12-07 ]
""""Now how long is the Harvard Bridge if it's measured in smoots?""""
Mr. SMOOT [himself]: 
""""Three hundred and sixty-four point four, plus one ear.""""
It'd be pretty incongruous to argue that he found """"plus or minus""""
there.
Also, he repeatedly cites WP, which at the time, didn't have
""""plus or minus"""".
Contrary to my initial thoughts when his Preface was being
put forward to re-write history, that he was 
not well situated to know about this, he does make it clear 
that he carefully checked into the bridge.
He is a distinguished scholar and an architect who
happens to be in a Dept. of Sociology, who wrote a book that 
seems to be a good read.

Tavernor's Preface was cited on the 
morning of New Year's Day, 2008, as support for the edit of 
Smoot to add ±, but the Preface actually refutes the 
edit by its reference to + 1 ear.
± didn't arise on the bridge; it showed up in Tavernor's
Preface.
Tavernor quotes the 1987 plaque to that effect.

If no one can say what from Tavernor's Preface seems to a) conform 
to WP:NOR and b) support the current language of the 5 
articles, then, yes, this would be an excellent time to revert to 
something only a minor copy-edit different than the language which",0

Hi Rockero! I just wanted to give you a big brotherly hug. You made me proud by paticipating on the May 1 march, the Great American March.

Due to things off my hands, (appointments, car broken, my neighbor is not legal so she chose not to go because Arpaio allegedly threatened to arrest illegals, only small groups gathered here) and just plain bad luck I wasn;'t able to march but I protested too, wearing White that day and resisting my ever attacking urges to shop and shop, which are like the munchies to me. Today Im already looking forward to what Im gonna buy tonight..lol!!

Anyways, banderas arriba!! We gotta peacefully fight the racists, show them we are here to stay.

The article should be about the man and his views, not about why some environmentalists disagree with him. Much of the latter part of the article has the tone of putting up Moore for criticism and then criticising him. The section """"Criticism by other environmentalist"""" does not belong at all, certainly not as a seperate section. The article should not be a """"for"""" and """"against"""" debate.

It is petty politics when some environmentalists object against describing him as an """"environmentalist"""" simply because he has alternate views on method and tactics (albeit critical views).

Example of bias:
Under the heading """"Views"""", we do not get an insight into Moore's views, (vision, ideology, tactics, philosophy etc), what we get is only Moore's views in opposition to the environmental movement.

An example of subtle bias:

""""Moore is supported by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), a national organization of pro-nuclear industries which hopes to enlist Moore's help in bringing about a nuclear renaissance.[22]""""

(Note that the link [22] is broken).
The fact that an organisation supports Moore, and """"hope"""" to enlist him, does not establish any alliance between Moore and them.
This is clearly an attempt to establish guilt by association, by those who are against nuclear as a green option. 
The factual information is as follows (from Wikipedia):
""""NEI founded the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition (CASEnergy) to help build local support around the country for new nuclear build. The co-chairs of the coalition are Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore..""""

The statement in this article should be replaced by stating Moore's proper association and the relevant context i.e. why he supports them or what they stand for, e.g. Clean and Safe Energy.""",0
"Let's take the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as an example. I'm going to use somewhat non-technical terms.

This is very simplified but, generally speaking, the auditor examines the taxpayer's records (or other records) to determine the correct amounts of income, deductions, tax, etc. The auditor generally is not involved in trying to obtain the actual tax payment. At the IRS, the top people who work as auditors (or examiners) are called Revenue Agents.

The tax collector comes into the picture much later  after the amount of the tax has been determined. The collector isn't trying to determine the correct amount of tax; the collector is trying to obtain payment of the tax, or to seize assets to sell to satisfy the tax that the IRS claims is owed. At the IRS, the top people who work as tax collectors are called Revenue Officers.

If you compare Revenue Agents and Revenue Officers, a Revenue Agent (auditor) is likely to know more than a Revenue Officer (collector) knows about substantive federal tax law: what items are income, what items are not income, what expenses or other items are deductible, what items are not deductible, what credits are allowed, how the tax is properly computed, etc.

The Revenue Officer is likely to know more than a Revenue Agent knows about procedural federal tax law: how a federal tax lien arises; what things the IRS has to do to perfect the tax lien as against the taxpayer's other creditors, what rights the taxpayer to a hearing prior to seizure of assets, how to legally seize assets, what kinds of assets may be legally seized without a court order, what kinds of seizures require a court order, and so on.",0

Neutral point of view

 Third Party Review, WikiProject New York Posting 
Transferred from User Page:
Hi Cmagha! I never saw the original AfD discussion, but I think the article looks like the start of something fantastic! My only concern would be that the majority of your references seem to come from """"Cornell specific"""" sources (i.e. Cornell Daily Sun, Cornell Era, Cornell Register, etc...). College/ university published sources are a bit of a grey area within WP:N when dealing with a campus organization, as some may not consider these to be """"independent of the subject."""" That being said, we aren't dealing with a fly by night college band that played at Moonshadows and had a writeup in the Ithacan, this is a literary society almost as old as Cornell University itself and has had significance well beyond East Hill. Despite the large number of CU oriented sources (which I personally believe are independent), you have enough that would be unambiguously independent to survive another AfD if need be. I'd post what you have now and keep looking for more! ' says you, says two  
 Wow, great work.  Sorry I've been out of the loop.  Double smiley face from the Syracuse Orangemen brought in to ensure neutrality.  Think the critics need to read the article from a distance  this is hardly promotional, when you think about it.  It is basically saying that Cornell University had a chance to excell in an intellectual activity, and tanked.  We obviously would not have done that at SU.  I do think there is a Sumner cite out there to, that Cmagha missed.  Will look for it.

Copied from Spartaz User page:
The Irving article has been noticed on the WikiProject New York page; some helpful comments sent back.  Did not receive notice on your G4 decision; we will be asking to move the article back to mainspace shortly.  Thanks for the aid.   
 No. Unless you have addressed the significant issues concerning allegations of misrepresenting sources and the contention that all of the sources are tangential or trivial then this isn't going back into mainspace.  Humbug!

What you were up to, you mean. From the beginning you're personally attacking me and harassing me, and this is the only way you found to try to claim ownership of articles.
And yes, it's highly suspicious that you seem to monitor everything that happens between the IP and me. At worst, it shows that you're actually tracking down my edits, ie harassing me, at best, it proves you are the IP because without any communication with me or the IP, there is no way you can be aware of anything in so much details(unless you're harassing me). And no, that you happen to hear about this matter right after it occured, while nothing suggested you were active here for 2 days, cannot be coincidence.
And finally, please, Buspar, stop playing on words. This is what the admin that took in charge your SSP case stated, and nothing else: """"Looking at contribs, User:Buspar and User:Xuanwu are very probably the same user. Technically, they cannot be socks, as one username was created after the other stopped editing"""". 
This statement is based on the technical definition of sockpuppetry, meaning that a person is using different identities at the same time. The admin only noted that the 2 accounts were not used simultaneously, but nonetheless acknowledged that Buspar and Xuanwu were the same person (""""Looking at contribs, User:Buspar and User:Xuanwu are very probably the same user."""")
The admin, however, never confirmed that you were not the IPs Onethirtyeightdot suspected you to be. If you've seen the line """"No, Buspar is not 130.49.157.75"""", then please source it correctly.

So, what do we have ? An admin confirming you're likely to use several identities, an anonymous IP acting in exactly the same way as you do, having the same personal issues with me, editing the very same articles as you do, reverting back into articles the very same contribs that you made, and it also seems both you and the IP seem to have a telepathic link allowing to know every issue occuring with the IP without you being contacted by it beforehand.

As I've said, I'm offering to peacefully resolve this problem. 
I am sincerely convinced that Buspar is the IP, because I've noticed the very same edit pattern, because both users contribute to the same articles, and both users seem to have a personal issue against me and both seem to systematically revert my contributions as soon as they concern article about illegal downloading.
Thus, this is not randmon bad faithed accusation. This is only what I sincerely believe.

However, if it is absolutely proved that Buspar and the Ip are not the same and that Buspar and the IP don't behave in similar ways, then I'm ready to make excuses to both users and to stop identifying the Ip as Buspar. 

But if someone has any doubts about the IP identity, or if someone clearly acknowledge that Buspar and the Ip have the very same behavior and edit pattern, then that's all I need. I won't continue to call the IP Buspar, on the condition that an admin clearly acknowledges the IP¨as being Buspar, and that Buspar in his future edits, only revert edits of mine and talk to me under his Buspar username.

 Your Comments on Davien Crow 
Delete. NN. having a poem published does not make you a poet, let alone a notable one. getting a picture on the wall at school does not make you an artist, let alone a notable one. but since the musicianship seems to be whats really at issue, i say Delete until the 2006 album is released, then if (and only if) that album meets the music test recreate. Nateji77  

I would like to point out that WP:MUSIC only has to be met by 1 requirement. So even if you do not view the CDs released on Kidatrium and Mushroomcloud Records as """"Albums"""", the fact still remains that they (his band Sin Star) has been on 2 national tours. The remarks you made about the picture on the wall at school is churlish btw, VCU's center for the arts is very reputable for it's art galleries if you read the page on them here at wikipedia you'd know. Those tidibits you took cheap shots at were simply part of the biography, not claims to notability. The Music and the Web Design Company should be the deciding factors, and they DO meet the rules... So please reconsider. By all means message me back if you wish to discuss this.

Look the point summarized is I am willing to work with you guys on why these were deleted but until now noone has given us any feedback and has even lied about stuff trying to get it deleted. All 3 of them meet the sufficient amount of requirements for WP:MUSIC, the guidelines in WP:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies, Wikipedia:Importance, Wikipedia:Notability (the fact that suicide girls, gidget gein, and marilyn manson are involved and can be verified in those links should proove that) , Wikipedia:Fame_and_importance mainly the part stating """"There is clear proof that a reasonable number of people are or were concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community)"""" If you can't tell the community of Myspace.com and Livejournal.com alone are enough to meet this criterea you are blind. If you do google searches, go to forums and search their names, or visit internet archives you can find un-disputable information on the band from reputable sources, first hand accounts that are years older than these discussions, and intangible archives kept by internet archives. IF you want more detail read my above rant, your right I do sound mad about this, because I can't see how you can say they do not meet criterea or that this is a vanity page. Please accept my apologies for anything you have taken to be rude and please re-consider changing your vote. What Harm could it do ? BTW I am not trying to bully anyone, I can show you the location of the people threatening to come here and vandalize the hell out of Wikipedia. But I do not want that to be part of your decision at all. (please reference the large rebuttle on the discussion page itself)

I have posted this, I hope that some of you will consider looking for my information and reconsider your vote for now. A lot of people are simply responding to the rudeness of user:sin-thetik and some things I said are being misconstrude as threats. I am simply upset because of all the time it took to write these 3 articles, knowing they fit the guidelines, only to have somone delete them with the proof and verifiable facts right in front of them .. just their un-willingness to read them.

LOL. votes in support of my position from people who know the material are """"unhelpful commentary??  LOL you people are a piece of work.  And yes """"you people"""" applies.  As for the supposed """"personal attack"""", I pointed out a direct falsehood in one or the nom's posts; and it is a falsehood.  Perhaps, given AGF, a mistake from not actually looking at or understanding the categories in those listings (perhaps BHG thought Alaska was part of Canada?? - a common mistake, in fact), but still *FALSE*.  Claims of OR about well known regions and completely citable mountain ranges (which have fixed boundaries and are not subject to change) are mere hand-waving without evidence; the use of NPA to """"go after"""" people who point out mistakes/distortions and """"bad actions"""" is not what that guideline is intended for; """"contrary to the spirit of the guidelines"""".  And Ottawahitech is quite right, and I've said the same thing in the ANI myself - that NPAs and outright AGFs - including the premise of this CfD - are committed against me all the time; touting Wikiquette while flouting it openly.  Stalking me in the wake of her peremptory block is not just AGF, and as noted by someone in the ANI, shoudl be grounds for an interaction ban.

It's not me who won't collaborate; it's people who don't do their research but still want to have not just an opinion not based in facts, but wave in the direction of conventions that don't formally exist.  

BHG has waved her hand at guidelines like SOURCES (in one of """"hostile"""" RM closures, which they so clearly are given they go against the grain of similar closures and both existing and emergent consensus), claiming they say things they don't actually say; her statement here that you claim is a """"personal attack"""" is what it is; not researched, not acccurate, and like so much else of her nomination completely misleading and without any knowledge of the places in question.  

The adminship protects its own from examination, and does nothing when they violate the very rules they invoke; persecution of contributing editors and dicking around challenging titles and the like, by people who have no knowledge of the subject matter, THAT is what's driving them from Wikipedia.  That includes many BC Wikipedians who were around when these categories were created and took part in what debates there were; to a British Columbian, they're obvious.  But to someone from WikiLandia, armed with guidelines they don't accurately cite or, I think, even really understand, they're """"original research""""......and yet they have nothing viable to replace them with, and sure as shootin' aren't the types who will undertake to apply whatever other system they come up with; and doing so would involve original research.

"Explanation 

My revdeleted comment was a bad-tempered response to a deliberately needling statement from someone who has a bit of history when it comes to doling out such statements. I explained this when contacted by  on Sunday, in my message to him at 10:32 UTC. I emphasised that my words were figurative and in the context of what had been said by the other contributor. I also asked Philippe to reassure that contributor of various things, including that I know nothing about them, that I neither have nor have access to any weapons beyond the sort of thing usually found in a UK home, and that there was no intent to do anything in particular except leave in utter frustration of the bad faith etc flying around. I assume that message had been passed on by around 19:55 UTC latest, which is when Philippe replied to me.

I haven't looked at Wikipedia since that bad-tempered retort and would not have looked at it now if it were not for someone asking me to post some sort of comment. I'm not reading through the stuff above, nor looking at the ANI thread that I'm told was opened.

Until certain things happen, some on-wiki and some involving an issue that the WMF are looking at off-wiki, I'm gone from here. I'm pretty sure that those certain things will happen but I doubt that they will do so soon, and it may be that I decide not to return anyway. Frankly - and I know this will seem arrogant - that would be Wikipedia's loss, not mine. 

If/when I do return, I'll be notifying quite a few people that I would rather they stayed away from my talk page, which is something I've always been reluctant to do in the past. I'm fed up of lynch mobs and gangs here, so anything that helps to reduce the baiting is A Good Thing. As a rule of thumb, if you've baited  in the past, you can assume that you'll be on the list because, although often I do not publicly support him, that seems to be the common denominator among those who bait me. The gang can go elsewhere, while I hope that Eric and myself will continue to agree/agree to differ as and when appropriate and in an adult manner. We can get on with improving content; the baiters can carry on doing whatever it is they want to do elsewhere.

My thanks to everyone who has contacted me. It was just a bad-tempered response: I'm perfectly happy in life, if slightly miffed at the increased distances I'm having to travel due to some unfortunate Wiki-related events. -",0

  The Anti-Vandalism Barnstar You've beat me to reverting vandals several times tonight, and when I took a look, I couldn't help but notice the sheer volume of vandalism patrol you've been doing. I think all your hard work deserves a barnstar!   

 David Bielkheden 

Why did you revert the last few changes to David Bielkheden article?
Seemed right to me.   
My mistake, I've rectified it and left a note on the IP's talk.   

 Emile Durkheim 

Why have you removed the edit to the suicide section in Emile Durkheim's page which mentioned that egoistic suicide is also known as egotistical suicide?  This is a productive edit, as many editions/translations refer to only one term and not the other.  Readers should be aware of the relation between the terms.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 192.246.234.74   
It's redundant. Egotistic- and egotistical-suicide are the same thing.   
That is the point to stating that it is """"also known as"""" the other term.  The words are not the same: egoistic refers more to a general self-centered nature while egotistical refers more to a self-centered way of thinking and speaking.  Look up the terms and you will see that they are not perfect synonyms.  The implications of both terms on the semantics and the basic message of Durkheim's theory is significant.  This information - a matter of 5 words - should be included in Wikipedia's article.  Both are valid terms with different implications.  It would not be the first time a Wikipedia article lists multiple terms for the same thing.
According Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary they're the same words. 'He performed an egotistic suicide for egotistical reasons', same thing.   
Unless that was a typo, you just used exactly the same word twice.  The difference is between EGOISTIC (one 'T') and EGOTISTICAL (two 'T's).  Look up the two words in Merriam-Webster.  —Preceding [[Wik",0

I'm in twothree minds over this proposal. As regards redlinks, on the one hand, over the last two years of monitoring the topic, I've seen it used as a catalyst and incubator for new articles; on the other hand, it is arguable that a death reported in a WP:RS is of a person of some note, if not necessarily within our standards. On the third hand, we do get some no-hopers on the face of it, which is why we tend to allow a month for an interested editor to create an article, and then delete undeveloped entries as non-notable. In the second case, we perhaps should not interpret lack of interest as lack of notability, because it may be that interested editors are lacking; that's why the month moratorium seems to exist, as far as I can tell. andemu """,0

Aryan Anarchism
My dear   I was wondering if you could explain your behaviour. First you remove the section on Aryan Anarchism with the comment """"(xenophobic marxism etc - not notably anarchist sorry deletinh 'aryan anarchism' more advert for far-right)"""",. The section was restored with an addition to the section discussing Aryan Anarchism on the talk page inviting you to explain your somewhat bizarre comment. Bearing in mind Lala Hardayal's prominent position as an academic philosopher and Stanford University, involvement with the IWW and eventual departure from the USA following his arrest for his anarchist activities, your suggestion that the piece is not notably anarchist is hard to understand. This is compounded by your final quip """"'aryan anarchism' more advert for far-right"""". Perhaps you could explain why you regard the self-organisation of migrants against repressive immigration control? For that is certainly a feature of tehir involvement with the voyage of the Komagata Maru. Is it odd that this movement, as with every other anarchist movement, throws up contradictions. I think not! Did not Peter Kropotkin throw in his lot with Tzar and encourage Russians fight Germans as a war against the state. Was not Pierre-Joseph Proudhon a patriotic anti-communist noted for his sexist attitude to women. His anti-semitism is matched by that of the pan slavic nationalist, Bakunin.

As for whitewashing, well - I do trust documents, not opinions.

Also you should note, that this books is 12 years out of a print and does not say a word about most recent research (This also leads to assumption, that information is more than 12 years old, since a book is not written in a day).

There is no need to threaten - I feel that we have been able to disagree very amicably up till now and are working well to come to a resolution which meets wikipedia's policies and procedures. I'm not putting WP:OR into an article, nor am I doing any. (Okay, I suppose calling it an urban legend was my own term and is WP:OR, but I was doing that conversationally and would never dream of putting it in the article). I simply said that this fact, if included, had to have a WP:RS. I have presented about a dozen or so sources, none of which include this. You have found one source, which is far less reliable than any of the ones I have brought, which mentions it as something rarely done today. I'm simply asking that this fact be sourced properly and that that be reflected in the article - something which you seem to be open to as well. If we use the BBC source, then we should probably also mention that none of the three major rabbinic organizations include this rule. (Citing their rules which I included links to in my previous comment). To clarify I'm not suggesting we use use the phrase """"urban legend"""" in the article at all - I'm just saying that we need a better source than the original one and that the scope of the source be reflected.
Frankly I understand your somewhat visceral reaction. This idea is so pervasive that it has almost become a reality in and of itself in that perception frequently affects reality. I was taught that it was true, and took it as fact until recently when I had a conversation with a rabbi who does conversions for the RCA and helped draft their policies. Only afterwards did I start digging and realized it had no source. It is impossible to prove a negative so I can't prove to you that it doesn't exist """"somewhere"""". However I can insist that we use a WP:RS. If you can find a reliable Jewish source, either classical or contemporary, for this then by all means include it with that source, but so far none has been located.   
As a side note here's another article on Marc Angel's group's website which would probably count as a RS - it's not in the description there either.   """,0

Edit war

Some notes for those who fear the truth:
A book by fr. Gino Conti was wiped out for the second time.
Another censorship (fr. Pezzi dismissed by Comboni missionaries). Pezzi admitted it in a public interview, whose reference was already in the article. Fr. Pezzi, with Kiko and Carmen, is in the main equipe of the Way; with Kiko and Carmen signs letters to the Pope (cfr. letter of 17 Jan 2006), etc.
The Statute is not an approval. The Statute is a temporary (up to June 2007) guideline. The Statute is an incomplete guideline because it often refers to an unpublished Catechetical Directory (cf. Statute articles 11, 19, 28§2, etc).
The most famous papal pronouncement about the Way is on a letter to mgr. Cordes on August 1990 (letter addressed to Cordes, not to Kiko), where he says """"I acknowledge the Way"""" but these words are preceded by """"having seen the documentation you sent me, welcoming the request address to me"""".
The Statute was given by Pontifical Council for the Laity, not by John Paul II. Also, in the days following publication of the Statute, John Paul II did not mention in his Angelus and speeches. His first mention will come months after. Popes can change their mind about the Way.
Popes can change their mind, if the Way doesn't obey to the Pope. Most recent documents show liturgy issues up to end of 2005.
There are some serious concerns. Discussions about the Way are about heresies, obedience, liturgy... Only Roman Catholic hierarchy has the right to correct and guide the Way.
""""Factoid"""" about st. Pius from Pietrelcina is actually documented by fr. Enrico Zoffoli, in a book and public letters to some Italian Cardinals and Bishops. In the worst case, it's realistic that st. Pius, who was confessor for people from lots of countries (including U.S. people from nearest NATO base), knew something about Kiko movement in Madrid between 1964 and 1967.
The temporary Statute was artificially elevated to highest """"We're Approved"""" Neocatechumenal propaganda.
Gennarini, the chief of the Way in the U.S., did actually give a """"Neocatechumenal spin"""" interpretation, documented also by Jimmi Akin.
Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi were thanking for """"granting a period of two years"""", but Benedict XVI decisions about that """"widespread manner"""" were timed «not exceeding two years». That is: Benedict XVI wants to solve quickly the problem, but Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi do not.
""""Note: the echoes were never put in place of the homily, or meant to sound like one"""": this valuable sentence tries to """"explain"""" in Neocatechumenalspeak the """"decision of the Holy Father"""" to require homily only from deacons and priests.
On the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue «giving peace as done in the Early Church» - everyone can verify that the original text of Arinze's letter does not contain such words. Why do Neocatechumenals need a distort and falsified citation? Correct text was: «on the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue using the indult already granted, pending further instructions» (please note: indult - that is: special permission - and pending further instructions - that is: the indult is temporary).
The """"NPOV"""" tag was the last resort of some Neocatechumenal people fearing the truth.
Please stop this ugly """"edit war"""". Wiping out documented sources won't change the facts.

Childhood Section - NPOV?
I feel that the childhood section of this article is biased in favour of Phelps.  It is littered with unsourced statements that were obviously added by either Phelps himself or someone else who knows him well such as his family/cult members.  The information on how his mother used to play piano for the pleasure of the neighbours or how he played cornet in the school band but later switched to bass horn is completely unnecessary and colours the section to sound more like a memoir than a biography.  I think this section should be stripped down to include only relevant details about his early life to ensure that the article maintains a neural point-of-view.  

This article is becoming a joke

It's my opinion that Phelps is simply TOO controversial a subject on whom to do an exhaustive encyclopedic biography of a living person.  I believe that 99% of Wikipedians have their hearts in the right places, but I'm very dismayed at the constant changes in this piece.  Nobody knows for sure the motivations of Fred Phelps, yet everyone continues to guess at them.  This in turn makes the entire article riddled with POV.  I propose stripping this article down to the bare minimum.  When Phelps has passed on, historians will be more likely to ascertain his impact on world culture; specifically in the United States.  As it stands now, nobody knows whether he is a religious zealot, grandstander, nut-case, or any combination thereof.  But people keep on guessing, and I simply don't believe that makes for a very good encyclopedia article.  

Disagree with stripping this article down to bare minimum.  He is one of the most controversial figures around today and deserves more detailed coverage.   

Detailed coverage does not mean the same thing as posting opinions.  Documented information or peer-reviewed critique are the key to preventing POV. See Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view - 

 I have to agree with Alex. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a news service or a celebrity gossip page. The article should be stripped down to basic facts which meet the standards of encyclopediac sources. This will make it easier to maintain a non point of view perspective. There are hundreds (at least) of other sites only a Google away which can provide juicier bits.  

Aging Fred
Would it be worth mentioning that most of the administration of the church has been taken over by Fred's daughter Shirley? In Louis Theroux's BBC2 documentary just screened, Fred did nothing but read out prewritten diatribe and seemed to have trouble answering how many children he had when asked. http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo/noise/?id=louis_theroux  
Only if you can find a reliable source which says that Shirley has taken over day-to-day management of the church. If you have a source for that statement, go for it. '''''' (talk) 

Upon watching the documentary, I felt that Fred did not have trouble answering how many children he had, but was merely expressing irritation at the question, indicating that anyone who had done basic research would know not only how many children he had, but how many were still in regular contact with Fred. Whether that irritation was justified can only be answered by those who were present during Louis Theroux's stays in Topeka. John Warburton 
I think (OR/POV) Theroux was trying to establish whether Phelps counted the 4 dissenting children as his, and Phelps saw this and tried to avoid answering either way.  In any case, I don't consider that the documentary presented any credible evidence loss of faculties (though that doesn't mean that he's mentally stable). 08:42, 3 October""",0

PeeJay I have to disagree with some of your statements, “Seems pretty categorical that the name the club gives itself in English should be the one we use here”.  If Pele calls himself Pele all over the world in Spanish, German, Italian etc but wants to give himself the name “Frogman” in English – it doesn’t mean that everyone has to agree with him or call him this.  Especially if every English speaking person knows of Pele as Pele.  To be listed as anything else in a reference encyclopedia like this one is just problematic.  So in this case it should be listed as what it is known as  and used widespreadly which is Inter Milan.
Also you mention “you can clearly see you've reached the right page from the opening sentence” but lots of people will be confused – which shouldn’t happen.  The page is also difficult to find and an example of this is from a Google search for the words “Inter Milan” – you would expect for a Wikipedia article to appear on the search results but the Wikipedia article  does not appear ANYWHERE on Google because of the current naming convention. []
You say people will “learn something in the process”, but this is irrelevant as the primary things to do, the BASIC thing that has to be done on an encyclopedia is to “reference information” that “can be quickly found when needed” and not appearing in Google search results because of a badly named article is not helping people quickly access information.
Kauffner suggests that if the club calls itself Inter then that is another reason to include it in the (full) title ie Inter Milan (NOT to name the article Inter)
Also the club DOES refer to itself as Inter Milan and here is the evidence to back this up:  the Google search result text for “InterMilan” displays the official English title of their website given from Inter Milan’s HTML = (Top Google result + 3rd Sentence down) [].

At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

 Northern Cyprus edits 

I will complement you on doing a great job updating and expanding many Northern Cyprus-related articles.

I oppose, however, to your sneaky removal of links to Cyprus / Island of Cyprus / Republic of Cyprus, usually replacing them with links to Northern Cyprus, sometimes even making double or triple links to NC to avoid linking to the island of / Republic of Cyprus. I also notice that all your newly created articles about places in NC do not have any mentions at all about  RoC, not even the de jure/de facto distinction. That is definitely POV editing.

I oppose also to your consistent removal of any mention of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, replacing any mention with """"the events of 1974"""" or your new favorite """"the hostilities of 1974"""". These euphemisms do not give any information to the user of Wikipedia, they only create questions: """"Which events?"""", """"Which hostilities?"""". You have also been removing many sourced descriptions of the local effects of the 1974 ínvasion. These edits are definitely disruptive POV edits.

In your edit summaries you never mention the removals and changes you do to the article content, you only mention additions of mayors, population figures etc., which are obviously good additions. The disruptive edits I have mentioned above are never mentioned (which is why I used the word """"sneaky""""). To make it even worse, you are using false edit summaries. When you remove a category you do not like with an edit summary """"syntax"""", it is not only disruptive, it is plain dishonest.

In a week's time I will again be able to edit regularly in Wikipedia, and I will then begin to revert your POV edits. In the meantime you could help, by reverting your worst POV edits. If not, the least you can do is to refrain from any more POV edits with dishonest edit summaries.

I really think that it would be possible for us to work together to create a neutral (WP:NPOV) presentation of places in NC, but that would require that you are willing to accept that your personal POV is not necessarily the only way to describe the world. Regards!   """,0

 Message to you, Mr Wales 

There are people I unequivocally despise. They lack morals, character, and honesty. They crush the remaining vestiges of democracy throughout the world. In case you can't tell, I'm talking about Mr. Jimbo Wales here. Let me cut to the chase: Wales says that everyone would be a lot safer if he were to monitor all of our personal communications and financial transactions—even our library records. Why on Earth does Wales need to monitor our library records? In classic sophist fashion, I ask another question in reply: Will Wales's shots to the heart of all that is wholesome buy him his long-sought victory for feckless charlatanism with its showy irreverence and glorification of all that is temeritous? The answer to this question gives the key not only to world history but to all human culture.

The next time someone says that Wales's analects enhance performance standards, productivity, and competitiveness, look that person right in the eye and reply, """"Wales is profoundly hostile to religious tolerance, democracy, and the notion of a secular civil society."""" I plan to hone in on his faults with laser-like precision. This is a choice I have made; your choice is up to you. But let me remind you that when Wales says that he has a fearless dedication to reason and truth, that's just a load of spucatum tauri. It is our responsibility to ensure that he doesn't lock all the exits from our present state to the world of constructive reason. I state these facts only to give a bit of personal background as to why I fully intend to stop the Huns at the gate. That's the path that I have chosen. It's definitely not an easy path, but then again, Wales somehow manages to get away with spreading lies (society is supposed to be lenient towards impudent blackguards), distortions (his randy coalition is a respected civil-rights organization), and misplaced idealism (our elected officials should be available for purchase by special-interest groups). However, when I try to respond in kind, I get censored faster than you can say """"predisadvantageously"""".

Carnaptious primates are born, not made. That dictum is as unimpeachable as the """"poeta nascitur, non fit"""" that it echoes and as irreproachable as the brocard that when I hear Wales say that doing the fashionable thing is more important than life or liberty, I have to wonder about him. Is he entirely bitter? Is he simply being mawkish? Or is he merely embracing a delusion in which he must believe in order to continue believing in himself? If you were to ask that of Wales, he'd certainly fling a large barrage of insults in your direction instead of actually addressing the question. He has spent untold hours trying to make empty promises. During that time, did it ever once occur to him that his strictures are a mockery of all that is fair and equitable? Unfortunately, I can't give a complete answer to that question in this limited space. But I can tell you that his tracts are not our only concern. To state the matter in a few words, unlike everyone else in the world, he seriously believes that ethical responsibility is merely a trammel of earthbound mortals and should not be required of a demigod like him. Woo woooo! Here comes the clue train. Last stop: Wales. And that's it. Mr. Jimbo Wales is doing the very thing for which he criticizes others.   """,0

Biased?
I am curious as to why it would seem that the U.S was singled out for a complete page on national racism? - I have yet to find a page dedicated to racism in other countries such as Africa, Britain, Mexico, Brazil, Iran, etc etc. 

Why is it that a whole page is dedicated to racism in the U.S as if it is/was the only country to marginalize persons by race?

I believe that this page should be merged into a general page of world racism, or just be deleted altogether, it's a little more than """"biased"""" in my opinion.  

See Racism by country. We deal with the """"bias"""" of missing articles on Wikipedia by writing new articles. See WP:CSB if you want to help provide a more global view. By the way, people who say Africa is a country might raise a few hackles among other editors writing about racism. 

The situation in the United States is unique in terms of its special brand of racism, the completeness of the...the campaign against Native Americans, the special circumstances surrounding the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the particularities of this version of slavery, the premises and outcome of the Civil War, and especially the complex time period following emancipation. This period is fairly unique in many ways, including but not limited to the fact that a bifurcated society developed with the former slave class developing in parallel alongside the former slave-owning class with visible distinctions in terms of melanin and linguistic distinctions resulting from the circumstances of the previous centuries, the long process of segregation, Jim Crow, the rise of African-American influence on mainstream American culture, KKK, White Citizens Councils and lynchings, and the long drive for the abolition of Jim Crow and the securing of the right to vote not only on paper but in practice, and the fact that many of the goals have been achieved, though how thorough this achievement has been is still a topic of debate. Most historical precedents result in one race wiping out the other, either by killing or displacement. To merge this article would be like merging an article on the Second world War into a general article on War, or merging the article on Homo Sapiens into an article on mammals. It makes no sense.
The truth hurts, but it's still the truth. This is a website for facts.

I see where you hesitated with the ellipsis.  The American campaign against the Natives involved such things as biological warfare, enslavement, mass rape, forced migration, and ordinary massacres. It was nothing less then genocide.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.132.84.67   """,0

"Regular disclaimer on vandal User:Rovoam 

Dear fellow Wikipedians,

This IP is just one of a whole army of anon IPs used by a well-known vandal User:Rovoam, who without exagerration deserves to be included in the history of Wikipedia as THE most persistent and obsessed vandal that has appeared in Wikipedia so far.

This person has been extremely persistent and obsessive in vandalizing numerous Azerbaijan and Turkey-related entries, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, Arran (Azerbaijan), Urartu, Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan (disambiguation), Turkey, Kura-Araxes culture, Nakhichevan, Safavids, Karabakh, Khojaly, Khojaly massacre, Stepanakert, Khankendi, Ganja (city), Baku Demographics of Azerbaijan, History of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani language, Azeri, Caucasus, History of Turkey, Oghuz Turks, Ottoman Empire, Turks, Turkic languages, Turkic peoples, Mannaeans and even Template:Europe (removing Azerbaijan and Turkey from the list).

He also vandalized user pages and talkpages, including User:Tabib, User:Tony Sidaways, (user page and talkpages), User talk:Rdsmith4, User talk:CryptoDerk  (talkpages), User:Weyes, User:Dante Alighieri, User:Chanting Fox.

Since the person uses wide range of IPs, it is virtually impossible to stop him by blocking. In the past he's been blocked numerous times but each time returned with a new IP. That's why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages (some of them more than once).

Rovoam started his actions in Wikipedia from introducing nationalistic POV edits in Nagorno-Karabakh yet back in February 2005. His aggressive discussion behaviour, unilateral un-agreed changes to the entry, and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors, with myself being his major opponent. 

The conflict was formally decided after Arbitration committee placed him under one-year revert limitation and personal attack parole . However, this decision made Rovoam even more radical and obsessive, as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt Wikipedia, perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me (?for exposing him and proving him wrong?..). 

This person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. He is not the usual sort of vandal, but is rather knowledgeable in what he's dealing with. He could have been very valuable for Wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms. Rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means. His edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious. 

As I have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to User:Tony Sidaway, User:Codex Sinaiticus, User:Isomorphic, User:Who, User:Dbachmann, the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms. Only then will he understand the whole senselessness of his actions.

Thanks.  ayanosh

 From user Jshapely 

Dear reviewer,

thank you very much for your suggestions on the article I wrote on Alessandro Liberati. To address your concerns about his notability:

he is especially known as one of the founders of the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of over 28,000 volunteers in more than 100 countries formed to organize research information about health care interventions in a systematic way, to aid well informed health care decisions (see also the description available in Wikipedia about the Collaboration). To date, more than 5000 “systematic reviews” on specific topics have been published in the Cochrane Library. Due to its relevance, widely acknowledged by clinicians, health care researchers and policymakers, the Cochrane Collaboration has a seat on the World Health Assembly to provide inputs on resolutions of the World Health Organization. The founder role of Liberati has been acknowledged by Sir Iain Chalmers Chalmers I. Alessandro Liberati: a personal appreciation. Epidemiologia & Prevenzione 2012;36:3. Available at http://www.epiprev.it/attualit%C3%A0/alessandro-liberati-un-ricordo-personale, who is himself acknowledged as one of the founders of the Collaboration in 1993 (see his profile in Wikipedia). The Italian Cochrane Centre was one of the first to be established (in 1994). Other people have their profile on Wikipedia mainly because of their role in the Collaboration (aside from Iain Chalmers, see also Dave Sackett and Chris Silagy). The relevant role of Liberati in the Collaboration can be also better understood by reading the countless acknowledgements in the farewell page http://www.cochrane.org/features/farewell-professor-alessandro-liberati  and in the memory book http://www.cochrane.org/alessandro-memory-book posted on the Cochrane website.
As for his published work (one of the relevant features indicated in the Wikipedia notability guidelines for academics) he is author of more than 200 papers published in peer reviewed and indexed journals, as it can be easily verified in Pubmed or in Google Scholar; some of these papers represent highly cited academic work, especially on how to report results of meta analyses and systematic reviews. 
As for other characteristics which can be worth highlighting (also according to the Wikipedia guidelines), he was on editorial boards of prestigious and selective academic journals, such as the Annals of Internal Medicine (house organ of the American College of Physicians) and the British Medical Journal (of the British Medical Association).
Last but not the least, several obituary articles followed his death on specialized medical journals; among these, I would like to highlight the one on The Lancet Watts G. Alessandro Liberati. Lancet 2012;379:214 (which is, according to the Journal Citation Index, the second general medical journal for number of citations) and the one on the British Medical Journal Magrini N, Smith R. Alessandro Liberati. Campaigned for high quality evidence relevant to patients. BMJ 2012;344:e1101
All these things I tried to make explicit in my article, supporting them with several citations for verifiability (a few of which also available online). I understand your point that my article may appear as a tribute to a recently dead person. As for neutral point of view, I didn’t find testimonies contrary to the good reputation I reported for Liberati. To limit the “tribute feeling” that the article may transmit, I cut the last two paragraphs (on his work in Italy and on his networking role).

Hoping that this may help support the new submission, I send you my best regards  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

"Some faecal matter 

Hi, Mathonius. I am no expert on human faeces like yourself but I was wondering why content like this is allowed on Toilet paper but not in the Anal cleansing section of Human feces: Elsewhere, wealthy people wiped themselves with wool, lace or hemp, while less wealthy people used their hand when defecating into rivers, or cleaned themselves with various materials such as rags, wood shavings, leaves, grass, hay, stone, sand, moss, water, snow, maize, ferns, may apple plant husks, fruit skins, or seashells, and corncobs, depending upon the country and weather conditions or social customs. In Ancient Rome, a sponge on a stick was commonly used, and, after usage, placed back in a bucket of saltwater. Several talmudic sources indicating ancient Jewish practice refer to the use of small pebbles, often carried in a special bag, and also to the use of dry grass and of the smooth edges of broken pottery jugs (e.g., Shabbat 81a, 82a, Yevamot 59b). These are all cited in the classic Biblical and Talmudic Medicine by the German physician Julius Preuss (Eng. trans. Sanhedrin Press, 1978).

 Main page appearance: Henry Cornelius Burnett 

This is a note to let the main editors of Henry Cornelius Burnett know that the article will be appearing as today's featured article on January 20, 2012. You can view the TFA blurb at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/January 20, 2012. If you prefer that the article appear as TFA on a different date, or not at all, please ask featured article director  or his delegate , or start a discussion at Wikipedia talk:Today's featured article/requests. If the previous blurb needs tweaking, you might change it—following the instructions at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/instructions. If this article needs any attention or maintenance, it would be preferable if that could be done before its appearance on the Main Page. The blurb as it stands now is below:

Henry Cornelius Burnett (1825–1866) was a U.S. Representative from the state of Kentucky and a Confederate States Senator. He represented Kentucky's 1st congressional district during the lead-up to the Civil War. This district contained the entire Jackson Purchase region of the state, which was more sympathetic to the Confederate cause than any other area of Kentucky. Burnett promised the voters of his district that he would have President Abraham Lincoln arraigned for treason. Besides championing the Southern cause in Congress, Burnett also worked within Kentucky to bolster the state's support of the Confederacy. He presided over a sovereignty convention in Russellville in 1861 that formed a Confederate government for the state. The delegates to this convention chose Burnett to travel to Richmond, Virginia to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. Burnett also raised a Confederate regiment at Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and briefly served in the Confederate States Army. Burnett's actions were deemed treasonable by his colleagues in Congress, and he was expelled from the House in 1861. After the war, he was indicted for treason, but was never tried. He returned to the practice of law, but died of cholera in 1866 at the age of 40. (more...)

"In addition, you may want to read this as it is explained by author Mike Campbell:

The TIGHAR-Nikumaroro Fiasco
Two years of speculation and hype came to a numbing climax on
March 16, 1992, at the National Press Club in Washington,
D.C. At a crowded news conference receiving national TV
coverage, Richard Gillespie, executive director of The International
Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery [TIGHAR], unabashedly
announced that the Amelia Earhart mystery “is solved.”
Since early 1990, following the group’s first excursion to Nikumaroro,
a 3.5-mile long coral atoll in the Phoenix Islands, about 2,100 miles
southwest of Hawaii and three hundred miles south of Howland Island,
the national media had touted TIGHAR’s theory that Nikumaroro could
be the final resting place of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan.
The “evidence” Gillespie presented included a battered piece of aluminum,
a weathered size 9 shoe sole labeled “Cat’s Paw Rubber Co.,
USA,” a small brass eyelet, and another unlabeled heel the group found
on Nikumaroro during TIGHAR’s highly publicized return there in
October 1991. These items, elaborately displayed and labeled in a glass
case, all came from Earhart or her Electra, according to Gillespie.
“There may be conflicting opinions, but there is no conflicting evidence,”
Gillespie said. “I submit that the case is solved.” Gillespie then
bit his lip and looked down at the floor — a curious yet revealing display
of body language for someone claiming to have solved one of the
20th century’s greatest mysteries.
Gillespie and Patricia R. Thrasher, TIGHAR’s husband-and-wife
team, theorize that through a navigational error, Earhart and Noonan
overflew Howland Island and landed on a reef on Nikumaroro during
low tide. There they died of dehydration a short time later. The plane,
they said, was washed over the reef when the tide came in and now lies
under 2,000 feet of ocean.
The April 1992 Life magazine featured a six-page spread penned by
Gillespie, who cites Navy pilot John Lambrecht’s July 9, 1937 report:
“Signs of recent human habitation were clearly visible [on
Nikumaroro], but “repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any
answering wave from possible inhabitants.” Gillespie called this report
“hugely significant” and “tragically inadequate. What had not been
done in 1937 had to be done now. We would have to search
Nikumaroro.”
Gillespie credited two retired military aviators, Tom Gannon and
Tom Willi, of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, for the theory’s origin.
“Using celestial tables, Gannon pointed out that on the morning of July
2, 1937, the rising sun would have provided the precise line of position
Earhart said she was running,” Gillespie wrote in Life. “By flying
southeast along that line, Noonan could be sure that, even if he missed
Howland, he would reach an island in the Phoenix group in about two
hours. Clearly it was the safest, sanest course to follow. I traced the line
on the chart and read the name of the island: Nikumaroro.”
This supposition was convincing to some, but Devine wasn’t
impressed. “There is considerable information in Gillespie’s rendition that
can be faulted,” Devine writes. “One example is his attempt to foster a line
between Howland Island and Nikumaroro. He presents Earhart’s last message
as ‘We are on line 157/337 ... We are running on line.’
Earhart never reached Howland Island. Earhart never
saw Howland Island, therefore Howland Island is not a reference
point for a landing on Nikumaroro. Earhart’s authentic
last message received by Coast Guard personnel on board
the Itasca, and recorded by Commander Thompson, related
no reference point: ‘We are on line of position 157-337 ...
We are running north and south.’ Earhart was not flying east
toward Howland Island or Hawaii. She was on a course, a
compass course or line of position 157-337, which terminates
on the island of Saipan.1
With Our Own Eyes
– 163 –
– 164 –
Earhart was not adept at navigation, and may have stated
her reading from a pocket compass she carried on her person.
She was probably and almost certainly stressed by ensuing
events, especially if Noonan had been rendered unconscious
during the almost disastrous takeoff of the overladen plane.
If Noonan had not been incapacitated, I assure you that he,
one of the best air-and-sea navigators of that period, would
have been communicating. He would have guided their
plane on a pre-arranged course, and calculated for accuracy
during intervals of the flight.2

"Dougweller, you lied in this edit summary and you had clearly seen the discussion here, with Aoid insisting on the need for consensus before changing Aesop's Fables from the status quo to Mzilikazi's hijacked version. Therefore your edit was entirely inappropriate and for that reason I'm going to revert it. The block that you refer to was for using a 1-month-old consensus as the basis to protect an article from a gang of edit warriors. Whilst it's already fallacious due to the fact that it's entirely an ad hominem argument, it's even more dubious because you yourself are trying to use the discussion on this talk page as the basis to support Mzilikazi's illegal edits. If one reads the June 2012 discussion here, they'll see a 1.5-year-old unresolved issue. How is a 1.5-year-old unresolved issue justification for Mzilikazi's latest edit war when a 1-month-old consensus is apparently so worthless that I deserved to be blocked for implementing it?

Besides, this talk page certainly wasn't the entire discussion; you're cherry-picking and you know it full well. In reality, Mzilikazi conceded defeat in the first edit war here, hence both Aesop and Aesop's Fables returned to their BC/AD state after 1.5 years of Mzilikazi bullying anyone who tried to undo his illegal changes. The status quo was protected for many months until Mzilikazi used his sock puppet Afkun to start a 2nd edit war 7 months later. Mzilikazi was the original and main trouble-maker on your side of the first edit war, Dougweller, so by completely ignoring his concession of defeat and cherry-picking evidence in an attempt to claim you won is outrageous and shows just how little value one should place on your thoughts here.

On the other hand, some predators do use the chat services to anonymously groom children. This situation, while I doubt it would happen in such an incovenient environment, might deserve a policy.

..so, does this policy solve anything, as it stands? No - it doesn't prevent children from stating their age. Instead, it focuses on irrelevant information, like their street address and real name, which the predator can acquire privately once he has located the child's online contact information. Since many people use the same username across all the interwebs, this probably wouldn't be difficult.

The only solution, so far as I can see, is to police kids who mention their age. Any other policy is, to say the least, completely useless. Out,

...which is confusing, since I'm not even close to 3RR. But, anyway, I thought I'd drop by and explain my reasons for pulling the cite from the first sentence of the article. Per WP:LEDECITE: 
Leads are usually written at a greater level of generality than the body, and information in the lead section of non-controversial subjects is less likely to be challenged and less likely to require a source.... 
Pedantic semantic squabbling aside, I don't think there's anyone who contests the validity of the characterization of MM as """"progressive."""" Given that the same assertion is sourced exactly one paragraph later, I think the citation should be cut from the lede. 

All that said, I'm not sold on MM being a reliable source for characterizations about itself. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that MM described itself as """"impartial"""" (it doesn't, btw). Would it be alright, then, for Wikipedia to describe MM as an """"impartial media watchdog,"""" replete with cite to their web site? IMO, MM can't be a WP:RS for information about MM; they're biased, and anything they say about themselves is inherently POV. What's more, if we're not taking MM at their word, but, instead, only citing them for claims that Wikipedia editors find credible, that's differently problematic for being WP:OR. It's not our place to weigh the veracity of primary sources; we shouldn't even be using them.

Iranian V Persian
I see you asked about this on the Wiki Project Iran talkpage. Iranian, originally meant the Iranian peoples, which are a number of ethnic groups including the Persian people. The Iranian sate was named after the Iranian people and many dynasty's that ruled Iran historicly were not ethnically Persinal at all. Despite being known as Iran internally, for it's entire history, the Greeks refered to the country as Persia, in reference to the country's most important ethnic group at the time and this name was later adopted by the Roman's and then used throughotu the West until 1936 when Reza Shah got the Western states to officially recognise the country's name as Iran. Now although, in today's world """"Iranian"""" most commonly refers to citizen of Iran and """"Persian"""" to the ethnic group Persian people (not all of which are from Iran, since there are milions of ethnic Presians in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan), with the term """"Iranic"""" being commonly used to refer to the """"Iranian Peoples"""" in the sense of all these different ethnic groups (Persians, Pashtuns, Kurds, Baluchis, ect.), however, due to wikipedia policies of English being Wikipedia's language here, Iran historicly is being refered to as the """"Persian Empire"""" or """"Persia"""" (which is infact a region in Iran), it's citizens as """"Persians"""" (although many of the notable Iranian citizens of the past weren't ethnic Persians and infact none of the kings of the """"Persian"""" empire from 1501 (re-establishment of Iranian state) until 1979 (abolishment of monarchy) were ethnic Persians) and so on wikipedia Iranian individuals prior to 1936 are refered to as Persians and Iran is refered to as Persia in articles concerning pre-1936 history.

Talk:Female genital mutilation; please stop
Hi Elvey. I noticed you on Johnuniq's page, which I watch, and was moved to check out the discussion at Talk:Female genital mutilation. Your part of it worried me. While I have no opinion of my own on the statistics, as FGM is not a field I've studied, I see two principles in play on that talkpage, that are true for all articles, and that you seem to pay scant attention to: 

1) Use reliable secondary sources. It's important (for all articles, but more especially for a sensitive subject such as FGM) to be based on reliable secondary sources. Synthesising sources in order to argue, in Wikipedia's voice, with a UNICEF report from 2013 isn't on, unless you have a reliable source (as opposed to having your own synthesis and conclusions from sources) that offers the same argument. 
2) Consensus. Nobody (except partly Vetrisimino0) agrees with you about how the stats should be represented in the article. There is consensus against your section tags, described here as """"overly aggressive"""". I hope the issue of the tags has blown over, but a few days ago you kept restoring them, and defend them aggressively; the fact that the article is being prepped for WP:FAC seems to anger you further, and makes you accuse SlimVirgin of WP:OWN: a serious accusation, which shouldn't be made without good evidence, and which you have taken to SV's user talkpage as well.

Combative and unresponsive discussion sours the editing experience for other users. Everybody else is speaking respectfully to you, as far as I can see; you're the one that has been upping the temperature with posts like this, where you call Zad's comment """"blatantly untrue, not to mention insulting"""" — based, as far as I can see on a mistaken notion that he was impugning some arithmetic you had done (he wasn't). That kind of response reminds me of the old adage about the internet being populated by sensitive and angry people, """"eggshells armed with hammers"""" (Google tells me it was originally said of heavily armed but lightly protected battleships). Please don't jump so quickly to the conclusion that people are insulting you. Worse, your header here is a noxious bad-faith-assuming personal attack, something to be scrupulously avoided in section headers. And you put it as the header to a post by SlimVirgin, which you had moved there from your own talkpage. That is truly awful behaviour, seemingly designed to discourage others and chase them off. (Charming edit summary at your own page, btw.) If you can't stop yourself from getting angrier and angrier whenever you're contradicted (this post, aggressively attacking Johnuniq, is a charming recent example), I advise you to take a break from the article. That's advice. What I tell you, as an uninvolved admin, is that you must stop filling the talkpage with rehashing of arguments that have not carried conviction before, and you must stop attacking people. Your accusation against SlimVirgin that she is """"abusing her position as an administrator to gain advantage in a content dispute"""", currently at the bottom of the page, is made up out of whole cloth as far as I can see. Has she mentioned or hinted at being an admin, or warned you in any way? If I've missed where SV is playing the admin card, tell me where. The word """"disrupt"""", which she used and which looks to be the basis of your accusation, is by no means _ the prerogative of admins.  | talk .

""":In an interpreted language your source code is read in command by command by a software tool, which is called the Interpreter and executed.

What ? Command-by-command ? No interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays. Taw

 From Interpreted Language/Talk 
 
some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime

Could you elaborate ? Taw

Every time a perl script is run, Perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code. At least, this is the usual way of using perl, although it's not the only way. Zundark, 2001 Dec 15

You mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code ? Taw

 I believe it's compiled to bytecode, much like Java. As of perl 5.6 (version?), it's possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step. I think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well, but I'm not as sure about that. Indigo Perl (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don't necessarily have the Perl interpreter installed.  They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms.  Wesley

 Old Interpreted Language article 

An interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required.

It is often a mistake to refer to a language as either """"interpreted"""" or """"compiled"""", because
most languages can be implemented in either way, and some languages
(like Perl) are compiled at
runtime but behave as if they were interpreted.
Other languages, like Java, may be partially compiled into an
intermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled).
Some languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation.

An example of an interpreted language is JavaScript.

Is Java interpreted, or what? 

The Java programming language article says:

""""The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.""""

The Java language is compiled, always.  It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language.  It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine).  I think the Java language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better.  LDC

Yes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is IMHO incorrect; every language that has an """"eval"""" statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code. AxelBoldt

Way too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of """"compiling"""".
It is used in two distinct meanings, as in:
 compiled to machine code (or assembly)
 compiled to byte code/parse tree/some other internal representation

I think it's wrong to call languages that use the second way """"compiled"""". In such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use - no language uses line-by-line parsing nowadays, all """"compile"""" source to some form of internal representation.

Quote from FOLDOC:
     Compiler

     A program that converts another program
     from some {source language} (or {programming language}) to
     {machine language} (object code).  Some compilers output
     {assembly language} which is then converted to {machine
     language} by a separate {assembler}.

As I said, initially when I began to look into this I thought that IHTS might have violated the IBAN by visiting a page that MaxBrowne had edited. I went back to check whether the IBAN might restrict editors from editing the same page (some IBANs do have such a provision) but I saw there was no such provision. Furthermore, IHTS was pretty good about not addressing MaxBrowne either directly or indirectly on that page. That's why my follow-up comment was to declare that there was no violation and that I felt that IHTS didn't go there just because of MaxBrowne, and did so only because of his interest in chess matters. And if I'd concluded there was stalking I would definitely have noted that both at ANI and on IHTS's user talk page. Look again at my comment at ANI where I told MaxBrowne:

I'm including the complete, unedited (and certainly not paraphrased) discussion in a new section on this talk page  From the Village pump (policy)  for all to view.  

 From the Village pump (policy) 

Is it okay under IAR to create a Wikipedia article which is a verbatim copy of an identical article appearing on a U.S. government website, i.e., a website in the public domain?

A recently added (May 5, 2007) Wikipedia article is a Wikified, word for word copy — both text and photos — of a 14-page article which appears on the FBI’s website at http://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/spyring/spyring.htm, titled Federal Bureau of Investigation, Famous Cases: 33 Members of the Duquesne Spy Ring.  The recent Wikipedia article that was copied from that FBI website is Duquesne Spy Ring.  The Wikipedia article originally carried the {USGovernment} template, but did not cite the current FBI article as the article’’s source.

The word for word copying of the entire text and photos of a 14-page article in the public domain and inserting that copied article in Wikipedia seems to me (technically and ethically if not in fact) to be plagiarism, even though the work copied is in the public domain.  If it is considered to be plagiarism, what can be done about effectively flagging readers that the copied article is a direct copy from another source?  I think the text of the {USGovernment} template isn't adequate for this situation.   
It's not plagarism, so long as it's indicated that the text came from somewhere, and was not just originally written. It's best not to do verbatim copies for NPOV reasons, but so long as the source is given, it's not terrible. - moo! 
I agree that the standard text of the {USGovernment} template isn't adequate for this situation.  Rather than say """"This article incorporates text from ..."""", it would be much more accurate to state something along the lines of """"The original version of this article was copied from ..."""" so that readers are clearly informed of the extent of the copying.  To list the FBI website as a """"source"""" clearly understates the copying.  In the context of an article or paper, this would be akin to copying passages without showing them in quotes and merely listing the source in the bibliography.  Almost everyone would consider that plagiarism.   talk 

This bothers me... even if it is not plagiarism (ie even if we give credit to the cite where it is copied from) wikipedia should not simply copy another site.  We should write original articles based on the information obtained in reliable secondary sources.  I could understand basing the bulk of this article's information on the FBI site, but we should at least paraphrase it instead of copying it.  I would love to flag it for improvement in some way, but I am not sure if there are any tags that apply.  

To be clear, the article always referenced the FBI as the source of substantial content and no claim to the contrary was ever made  in the original document a URL was provided and the reference was: """"Much of this article comes from FBI documents and photos released in 1985 under the freedom of information act and in the public domain.""""

What does seem to be controversial is the quantity of public information re-used in this Wikipedia article.  However, it is not illegal, unethical, and even uncommon for a private entity to re-issue and re-sell public information, sometimes adding value and sometimes not (e.g., [[Natio",0

The primary motivation for that distinction appears to be the U.S.A.'s usage of the """"Imperial System"""" of measurement, as opposed to everywhere else. Insofar as I could tell, the IFPS seems to have stronger origination ties to several European nations than to the U.S.A.

Railway stations of Budapest
Hi,

I've just seen that a few days ago you moved Eastern Railway Station (Budapest) to Budapest keleti pályaudvar (and did the same with the other two railway stations of the city). I don't think this was a good idea, for several reasons:
 English Wikipedia has a policy of using the English names whenever it's possible (Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English). An average reader, when looking at the article title, won't know what's this article about, unless they open it and read it. The word pályaudvar will be totally unintelligible for the majority of them.
 You wrote (in the edi summary of the Keleti station) that this was to keep in line with a convention of using original names, but glancing at a few randomly chosen railway station article from non-English-speaking countries it seems that this is not a convention, some of them use English names, some of them don't. (Also, you don't seem consistent since you didn't move the articles of the other Hungarian stations.)
 """"Budapest keleti pályaudvar"""" is incorrect in Hungarian. The city name itself is never a part of the name of railway stations, unless it's the only station of the city. (It's incorrect grammatically too.)

Can we please move back these three articles to their previous names?

Oh I have gone ahead and done this. I think that page can be deleted now. There wasn't much on it. I hope you are happy with the way things are set out now. 

About the structure of the article generally, I have a few points:

I think that there should be a section for each daughter section, and that this should pretty much just be a quick rundown of that page, of the important parts in that page.
The 'research into health benefits' should be moved to the third party page, and only one study mentioned briefly on the main pagethe one that appeared in a journal, the other maybe should not be mentioned. Does not warrant a section to itself, at any rate. (will just go ahead and do this now)
Take out epoch times section. It is related to Falun Gong, but it is not of the same nature as the other sections, like beliefs and teachings, falun gong overseas, persecution etc.. There can be some 'related pages' mention of it, I think that would be appropriate, but basically it is not specifically a part of the Falun Gong cycle of articles, though related to them.

Since this seems to have blown up spectacularly in my face, I might as well explain my edit. /

I came across this BLP, which hadn't been edited since last year, and noticed that the paragraph about her signing that creationism petition seemed a disjointed and tangential - her signing the petition is unquestionably notable, but it seemed jarring to go straight from discussion of her research to """"In February 2006, the New York Times reported... The petition, a two-sentence statement,"""" without stating why she signed the petition or anything. We have an essay about these sorts of articles and the problems with them - WP:COATRACK. I checked out her personal webpage, noticed she was quite open about her religion, googled """"Rosalind Picard christian"""" and found an Atlantic Monthly article that discussed at length why she was a creationist. So I added a sentence about that, making the article flow more smoothly into the signing of the petition. I also removed the second sentence explaining the petition, as I thought it was straying too off-topic.

I discussed this with Raul and can now see the merits of leaving that last sentence in - I think the article as it now stands is acceptable. What's greatly troubling to me is that instead of discussing this and working out a compromise, certain folks refused my invitation to discuss it and instantly jumped on me and started canvassing for a revert war when a few minutes of discussion would have cheerfully resolved the situation instead.

 """"motorcycling advocacy"""" is a meaningLESS phrase.

""""motorcycling advocacy"""" is a meaningLESS phrase.  Google results (10/18/09): 347

""""motorcyclists' rights"""" is a meaningFUL phrase.  Google results (10/18/09): 30,700

""""bikers' rights"""" is a meaningFUL phrase.  Google results (10/18/09): 101,000 

Even """"motorcycle rights"""" (ugh) is a meaningFUL phrase.  Google results (10/18/09): 204,000 

But """"motorcycling advocacy"""" IS A MEANINGLESS PHRASE!

Who has the substantial authoritative support here, Teddy-Poo?  A real biker corroborated by Google search results?  Or a geek poser with delete privileges?

I don't expect you to embarrass yourself and Wikipedia further by leaving this definition on line for very long, geek boy.  I just hope somebody with some common horse sense at Wikipedia realizes that defining """"non-terms"""" deprecates the value (all meanings) of Wikipedia.

I very much enjoy and appreciate Wikipedia but it's nothing more than something I occasionally pop-in to edit or create an article occasionally. After reviewing your link, it appears my only contribution to this issue was a poorly thought-out side remark to an editor in an unrelated ANI a few months back. I never pursued the matter beyond that, nor did I file a complaint regarding the emails, nor did I even remember it occurred until I logged back on after a few months away to edit an article I'd previously written and found your many messages to me.

 The """"song and dance"""" is not a creature of my conjuring.

However, as I said, I am committed to doing my absolute best to accommodate your interest in this matter (in point of clarification to your above comment, I have to admit I am unaware of other third-party editors who expressed similar passion to you and seem to recall the others involved (IIRC User:NE Ent, User:Dennis Brown, User:TParis) were differently expressive, but if I am wrong then kindly accept that I should have said I am also trying to accommodate their interest as well). As far as I know, it is your interest in pursuing this I am accommodating and the characterization of a """"song and dance"""" is not one I feel is appropriate to describe my total ambivalence to your inquiry (please understand - the preceding is not intended to be trite, I simply want to unambiguously communicate that the entire matter is one of no interest to me, so as to assuage any concerns of a """"song and dance""""). 
 I would like to personally apologize to you for not responding to your interrogatories """"forthwith."""" I can only give you my personal assurance that I did not leave Wikipedia for two months as part of a scheme to evade your investigation. I know you've said you're incredulous to that notion, but I will offer you this personal assurance anyway. 
 Kindly accept this post in the spirit in which it was intended - as a frank and direct response to concerns you are expressing - and not as a slight in any way. If I have failed to communicate something here with appropriate finesse, understand it is only because of serious IRL issues I currently face that limit the time I can commit to pursuing online intrigue, and absolutely not because I am trying to scandalize you. 
If there is anything else I can help you with, please do not hesitate to let me know, however, in interests of wrapping this up in a succinct manner, I would like to suggest we terminate this back-and-forth and allow ArbCom to do whatever it is their role in this is supposed to be. Best -

 Re: Arbitrary Conclusion 

Hi. 
I think that it is one thing to """"believe in God""""  and another """"being religious"""". Someone may be a """"believer"""" - believe in """"God"""" (any """"God"""" or a specific """"God"""")- without being """"religious"""" - adhere to """"religion"""". 
Just because most Greeks said they """"believe in God"""", it does not mean that they adhere to """"religion"""", nor that this perecentage considers themselves """"religious"""", nor that they are the """"most religious"""" people after Cyprus and Malta. Also, in the context it was put, """"most religious"""" may imply fervent belief (even relatively). However, the Eurobarometer did not measure how strongly people in these countries feel about the statement """"I believe in God"""".""",0

 Official Notice 

I am posting this here, per WP:ADMINABUSE, as evidence that I have taken the step of attempting to resolve the situation by talking directly with the administrator in question. I have been here just under 2 months. I have made well over 1000 good contributions to this project, and until this incident, enjoyed my time here very much. This has been a nightmare, and I very much wish to put it behind me. However, as a matter of principle, I feel I must continue to do what I feel is right, even though it would be much easier to just drop this, and even though I have very little chance of ultimate success. I realize that to err is human. I'm not looking for your head on a platter. I'm not even looking for an apology. I too, am human, and far from perfect. In the time since the incident, I have not conducted myself in the most appropriate manner. The fact is, that while I may very well owe an explanation, and/or apology for some of it, it has nothing to do with the original block. You mentioned the fact that several other administrators declined to unblock me. Without veering off into another topic, as far as why that is only partly true, the fact is that this is not about what any other administrator has or hasn't done. You were the one who blocked me, and it is only you from whom I can request accountability. In earlier comments, you've made it quite clear that you are willing to be held accountable before your fellow administrators. I however, am asking that hold yourself accountable for your actions to me; the common user, who was affected by a decision that you made. It remains my position, as I have said before, that I did not deserve to be blocked. You blocked me for violating WP:3RR. 3RR clearly states that the removal of BLP violations is an exception to the rule. Furthermore, you stated on my talk page, that I """"should have stopped reverting, and attempted to gain consensus"""" on the talk page. WP:BLP states that violations """"should be removed immediately, without waiting for discussion."""" My actions were in line with WP:BLP, and did not violate WP:3RR. Therefore, I am formally, and respectfully, asking that you acknoweledge that although acting in good faith, you erred in judgement when you blocked me. I thank you for your time, and await your response.   """,0

In regards with the article factual sense, there is nothing to argue about. There is no evidence proving that nomads fight tested the dogs versus fighting them """"just for money"""". Same applies to modern times. Not to mention that nomads did NOT develop the breed initially, because the breed was originally established by whoever was raising sheep or goats, while nomads were traveling, so they helped to spread it. As per fighting dogs of this breed in some countries, there is already a clear outline in this article already.   

However, there are factual materials that some of so-called """"fight test"""" aimed to measure the aggression towards strange unfriendly dogs or other large predators entering  protected premises. This applies to dogs of either gender. As well, there are several cases of successful re-introduction of dogs from kennels that run so-called """"fighting tests"""" to livestock guardians duties, in different countries. As well, the free range farming is on the rise in Russia, and the livestock guardian dogs are in demand. The pit-like dogs, pit mixes and commercial fights is one thing; the necessity to maintain aggression towards predators to protect the herd from strays is a totally different issue.

""": Yeah, well I enjoy ranting but have gotten to do ever-so-little of it thus far on Wikepedia because of the whole infernal """"Wikiquette"""" thing. I couldn't resist the opportunity to indulge a little. ) Here's the dilly (or part of it) on dopamine, melanin and Parkinson's. Dopamine and melanin have very similar structures, and dopamine metabolism produces a form of melanin called """"neuromelanin,"""" which is different from eumelanin, pheomelanin, et cetera, but still certainly a melanin. Neuromelanin gradually accumulates in the neurons of the substantia nigra throughout a person's life. Kids have very little, elderly people have lots. When people get Parkinson's they start losing their neuromelanin, and their SN goes pale. The fairly recently-published histology and pathology books I'm using just take it for granted that the loss of neuromelanin is basically a side-effect of dopamine depletion. But I may have been a little too confident in assuming that that's the final word. I just checked the National Library of Medicine website and a bunch of new research is turning up more immediate connections between neuromelanin and Parkinson's than had been suspected. Also, it looks like they're also getting promising results in studies on therapies that involve endocrine manipulation of neuromelanin. Still, all of this specifically involves neuromelanin in the dopaminergic neurons of the SN, and I haven't personally learned, heard or run across anything stating that there is any connection whatsoever between skin melanin and Parkinson's. But I guess the take home message for me is that there is more going on here than I realized, so I can't write off the possibility that there is alsothough I can't imagine howsome emerging connection between neuromelanin/Parkinson's and a person's skin melanin levels. Anyway, as you say, this article is about melanin generally, not just skin melanin in humans, so regardless the Parkinson's link is legit.  19:57, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

"Uncle Max
Over the last month there's been a few edits (and reverts) by others regarding Uncle Max as a CBBC programme. It's a fact that it was originally commissioned and transmitted by CITV Channel in 2006 (repeated December 2007). However, since January 2008, it is now being broadcast on BBC One, presumably after the BBC picked up the rights.
Just curious, but what are the reasons for its removal from the CBBC Programmes list?",0

"Ikke noget at tale om!  There will probably be more discussions about this in the future, but let's leave it there for now.
 However, I find this discussion interesting as (according to my personal experience) Stockholm with its 'isolated' location in the middle of Sweden rarely relates itself to Denmark or Copenhagen (we don't hear more from Denmark than do people in, say, London, Paris, or Berlin).  In contrast, Danes (always near Sweden) tend to bother much more about its northern neighbour.  Of historical reasons, Finns tend to behave similarly (regarding Sweden).  It might be interesting for the article (maybe the culture section?) to explain this - after all, Stockholm's only official raison d'être is to be the capital of Sweden, but, locally, there is sort of a subculture trying to develop an identity independent from this.  For example, Stockholm tend to be obsessed by its own local history (sv:Stockholmiana) and one of the most striking thing that occur to tourists must be the historical pretensions of the city, notwithstanding most façades (with their beige plaster) are in fact much younger than buildings in an average European city.  Its symptomatic the new Moderna Museet was well-received in Stockholm because it merged with the neighbourhood whilst a new museum in Copenhagen is celebrated if it gets international attention (i.e. Arken).
 Maybe just some spaced-out thoughts of mine.

In 1982, he joined Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle as the Director of Marketing. After a business trip to Milan, Italy, he tried to get ownership (including Gerry Baldwin) to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas and spices they had long offered. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, the owners refused to roll it out company-wide and Howard Schultz started his own coffee shop named Il Giornale in 1985. Two years later, the original Starbucks management were forced to focus on Peet's Coffee & Tea because of bullying and harrassment and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale. The former owners do not speak favorably of Schultz in interviews to this day.

Schultz renamed Il Giornale with the Starbucks name and aggressively expanded Starbucks' reach across the United States. It can be said that Starbucks popularized espresso drinks such as the cafe latte to many Americans who had previously only ever tasted freeze dried coffee.They later acquired HEAR music and formed Concord Management Group in an attempt at music management and distribution using Starbucks stores. Schultz also became a board member on Dreamworks, trying to establish film output.He began his obsession with Angelina Jolie when she was at a very young age and saw to it that she rose to the celebrity status in her career. It is rumored that the success of the Ray Charles cd fueled Schultz' ambition to murder Charles in an attempt to secure the success of the film. Over the years, he is linked to the deaths of other actors such as Heath Ledger, Anna Nicole Smith, Tupac Shakur, and Notorious BIG. Unfortunately, he is affiliated with a secret group called *Velvet Mafia* in Hollywood. They are rumored to be gay, be responsible for removing Michael Ovitz from his CAA post with a huge power move and stalks young women and men for years to get ideas for their projects. Other members includes David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenburg, Calvin Klein, Tom Ford, and Michael Eisner amongst some others. This has earned him a bad reputation within the Hollywood community. His latest effort to bring his company back on track, he has unaffiliated himself from Concord Management and Dreamworks. However, Starbucks employees have been neglected, mistreated, stalked, harrassed, smeared and defamed under Schultz's management and have repeatedly plagued the company with multi million dollar lawsuits and won. The latest smear attempt came when a 16 year old barista was sexually harrassed by Starbucks management in Irvine, California. In his recent Portfolio magazine in July 2008, he responded to his employees calling him a *psychopath* by suggesting that they should just listen to what the leader of their company tells them. Schultz didn't believe in franchising. Because of this Starbucks owns every domestic outlet with one exception. Schultz went 50-50 with Magic Johnson on stores in minority communities. Others believe the reason why he doesn't franchise I'd because he would like to have access to the video recordings of his employees for private use.

Schultz co-authored a book called Pour Your Heart into It that expounds on his life journey with Starbucks. In his book Schultz admits that he was afraid that """"Starbucks may become another souless big chain."""" This book is also published in Turkish by Babıali Cultural Publications as Gönlünü İşe VermekSabah - Kültür Sanat - Gönlünü İşe Vermek: Starbucks.

Schultz is also the former owner of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. On July 17,2006, it was announced that Schultz sold the team to a group of businessmen from Oklahoma City for $350 million. It was speculated that the new owners would move the team to Oklahoma City some time after the 2006-2007 NBA season.seattletimes.nwsource.com. URL last accessed July 18, 2006.

 The creator of the """"Blade Element Theory"""" is Stefan Drzewiecki and not the Wright Brothers. 

Tom Crouch, a pro Wright brother historian, claims the two US inventors realized that a propeller was in fact a rotating wing and that they discovered a method to design propellers (see 1).

(1) """"The design of effective propellers presented a far greater challenge. The Wrights, who had initially hoped to learn from experience with ship propellers, discovered that little thought had been given to basic theory in this area. In another of their brilliant flashes of insight, the brothers reasoned that a propeller could be regarded as a rotary wing in which the lift being generated becomes the thrust that moves the aircraft forward. Knowing the number of revolutions per minute at which the propeller would be turning, they calculated the speed at which the blade would be moving at any point along its length and selected an appropriate airfoil from the tables developed during their wind tunnel tests. It sounds simple enough, but as Orville explained, """"on further consideration it is hard to find even a point from which to make a start, for nothing about a propeller, or the medium in which it acts, stands still for a moment."""""""", Tom Crouch, """"First Flight: The Wright Brothers and the Invention of the Airplane"""", pag. 57, 2002, https://archive.org/stream/firstflightwrigh00crou#page/56/mode/2up 

However, the letter of Wilbur Wright to Octave Chanute (see 2) shows the two brothers had already been informed about the theory of Stefan Drzewiecki, before their alleged powered flight in Dec. 1903.

(2) Letter of Wilbur Wright to Octave Chanute
Dayton, July 2, 1903,

""""My delay in writing you was chiefly due to a desire to first obtain a clear understanding of the Drzewiecki article on screws. [2] This author's methods of thought and expression are so different from my own that it has been no easy matter to master his paper. It shows a very clear understanding of some features of the question, but as the author seems unacquainted with negative tangential, and with the effect which weight of water acted upon by each part of the screw has in fixing the angle of incidence, the paper leaves much to be desired as a complete discussion of the subject. I am quite certain that his method of constructing a screw of uniform angle of incidence will not give the result intended. The speed imparted to the water by suction before the screw actually has a chance to strike it is also ignored; and no method of calculating the loss from this source is given. Some of his conclusions seem to Orville and me to be rank heresy, but of course we are like the theologians and judge the """"soundness"""" or """"unsoundness"""" of others by the closeness of their agreement with ourselves."""", Source: http://invention.psychology.msstate.edu/inventors/i/Wrights/library/Chanute_Wright_correspond/1903/Jul2-1903.html

(3) """"[2] Stefan Drzewiecki, born in 1844, was the originator of the blade element theory of screws, which considers the blades of a screw as being composed of an infinite number of aerofoil sections. The blade element theory, together with the momentum theory of Froude and Rankine, is almost universally used today to explain the action of aerial screws. In 1900, Drzewiecki presented a paper, """"Des Helices propulsives,"""" to the Congres d'Architecture et de Constructions Navales in Paris. In 1901, a second paper by him, """"Du Choix des elements determinant les helices propulsives permettant leur facile comparaison entre elles,"""" was published in the Bulletin de l'Association Technique Maritime (no. 12, 1901).

These two brothers were ignorant people, they made fun of Drzewiecki in front of Chanute, and finally, in 1908 when they flew in France and US in front of witnesses, started to claim the theory of this Polish scientist as their own. Historians, like Tom Crouch, who do not have any technical background, simply believed the two brothers and propagated this false information around the world.""",0

Ok, first off, let me clarify that reverting is when you undo someone else's edit (yes, it does include the re-addition of material that has been removed by another user). Your use of the word """"vandalism"""" is incorrect in this case, because everything that you have been involved in so far is classified as a """"content dispute"""", since you and your opponents have been disputing whether certain text should be included. This is not a case of vandalism (this is, for example). Secondly, many of the users that you have been reverting or the ones that have been reverting you are on the same restrictions, so IMO now everyone is equal, and no one is """"winning"""" or """"losing"""". What I've tried to explain to you is that edit wars get nothing accomplished. You keep reverting and reverting, and then someone reverts you, and the cycle continues. Wikipedia articles aren't meant to go back-and-forth like that. The only real way you get something accomplished is by discussing it with other users, in the hopes that you can form a compromise, or consensus. To answer your numbered questions:
After we last spoke you continued to revert (, , , ). On Sason, you reverted 3 times in the last 24 hours. Even though you came close to breaking the three-revert rule (which you were blocked for on May 31), three reverts is not some sort of magic barrier that prevents you from being blocked. An admin could have easily blocked you for simply edit warring. This is the type of stuff that occurred on Armenian-Azeri pages for example before the arbitration case. After that many users were placed on editing restrictions, a lot of the problems were solved. Aggressive editing can be characterized as constant edit warring, and basically a method of getting your version of the article by constant reverting as opposed to discussion. Is is the exact opposite of what is outlined at WP:1RR. Even if you believe the information you are adding is NPOV, if it is contested by several users, the best thing is to discuss it with them, and once you have come to an agreement, to implement that version. 
I'm sure you've tried to be civil, but here I notice you referring to your opponents as """"vandals"""", this is inappropriate because as I explained above, you're involved in a content dispute here. If other users have personally attacked you, please show me links of this and I will warn them. It is never acceptable to do so.
Yes, it is possible. You can get mentored at Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User. Wiki-adoption was created back in 2006 as a program designed to help new and inexperienced users.
Although you may disagree with him, it is within Namsos' right to nominate an article for deletion if he believes it is non-notable. However, as you can see from the discussion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erich Feigl, it appears that many users there are deciding to keep the article, so I'm not sure that it matters anyways. Everything that you mention (awards, documentaries, books, Google hits, etc.) can be mentioned at the AfD (articles for deletion page). I have noticed that you've already made a comment there already. Make sure to keep an eye on that page, the discussion is typically open for five days.
I don't know the specifics about why your sources were removed, but if you feel like you're not getting anywhere with these disputes, you might try posting something at the Reliable Sources noticeboard if there is a dispute on whether your sources are valid or not. Another option is the new Ethnic and cultural conflicts noticeboard. Finally, after you have made all attempts at resolving the conflict (including those two links I gave you), and you still feel like nothing has been accomplished, you can check out formal mediation. There, a mediator will get involved and act as a third party.

Thank you very much for trying, Oda Mari, I really appreciate it! What would really help, I think, is if I could find Japanese adult industry awards... Once in a while I find that some performer has won some adult award (for example, Yua Aida won the """"Japanese adult grand prix actress award for the year of 2005"""", and Sora Aoi won an award at this ceremony in 2003) but then I can't find anything about the history of the award, who won in other years?

"User 
Hi Tony, as far as I know, once you are a user in one Wikipedia, somehow you become a user in all/most of the others (including for example, Commons). I may be wrong in this, however I don't remember having created a user id and password in the Spanish Wikipedia yet I have an account there.

In any event, part of the “secret” has something to do with something called “unified logins” and you can find which wikipedias you are “attached” to by going to >>>>  My Preferences > Basic Information > Global Account status > Manage your global account

I don’t know how it decides which wikis to attach you to and which ones not (for example, I am not attached to Wikitravel), but what the heck? it works for the Spanish, English, and Commons which is where I spend 99% of my wiki time.

I have been editing the Spanish Wikipedia and will probably do so even more in the future: it allows me to reach the other 50% of Puerto Ricans that don’t read English fluently. (Check out my article in teh Spanish wiki for Millito Navarro – I started by translating it from the English Wiki and now the Spanish version is not only more complete than the English counterpart, but also has 3x the references, is more current and, probably most importantly, it has an accurracy that can be backed up 100%. You know, I can't be contect with incomplete articles if the rest of teh info is readily available.) 

I will be more than happy to fulfill you request for the move; and have already sone so.  I had read negative comments about the Spanish Wikipedia related to how much more problematic it was to edit, how editors there didn’t know what they where doing, and how there seem to be not a fully developed system for dealing with conflicts etc. Some (a little?) of that may be true; the rest may be perception only. I am learning the ropes there and stay out of trouble by creating/editing article most people don’t care about for now (read: Ponce – haha), but once interest develops I know I have the truth well “under my belt” to deal with the sporadic drive-by editor that wants to make changes based on unacceptable motives (personal, political, etc – you know what I am talking about) rather than verifiable truth.   

Also, its very easy to jump (to appear logged in and all) from one wiki to the other: just take an article in the English wiki which you know also exists in Spanish wiki and hit the link on the left that says “Spanish” and bingo!!!! you are there! I use “Cerro de Punta” because it exists in both wikis AND because it is short and, thus, I don’t have to scroll down to see the “Spanish” link.

Edits by Keraunos

Hi, Keraunos. I see you added to, and rearranged, some of this article. I ameliorated some of your additions for accuracy. Below are listed my ameliorations of your edits and my reasons for them:

 You added the edit """"because the temperature of the cosmos rising toward infinity as the final singularity of the big crunch is approached will provide a potentially infinite amount of energy to power the cosmic supercomputer.""""

I take it that what you tried to explain here is the energy resource. But actually, that isn't physically accurate. The universal heat diverging to infinity doesn't provide usable energy. Where the usable energy comes from is the gravitational shear (i.e., the universe's Taublike collapses along different axes with each cycle, called Mixmaster oscillations), which provides a temperature differential across the universe whereby usable energy can be obtained. Hence, I went ahead and cut this edit of yours.

If people read further into the body of the article, under the section """"Outline of the physics of the Omega Point Theory,"""" some of this is already explained, with references provided for further research (with a number of the references available online for free).

 You added a bit into here: """"the Omega Point represents the resurrection of the dead followed by an infinite-duration afterlife as an avatar in cyberspace, which could take any imaginable form within the metaverse of the cosmic supercomputer due to its virtual nature.""""

I kept the ressurection link. I understand from reading your user page that you're into science fiction and transhumanism, but one should avoid loading up this article with needless science fiction terminology and transhumanist terminology, as well as computer terminology which isn't that accurate (such as """"avatar""""). The term preceding your edits, """"simulated reality,"""" already expresses the ideas you're getting at, and people can follow that hyperlinked text if they're not sure what that means.

 You added most of this: """"engulfed by artificially intelligent life as it approaches the point of maximum expansion, which, according to Tipler, will occur 'between 5 X 10^16 and 5 X 10^18 years from now (in proper time)'.""""

One should be more accurate in their terminology, as most people think of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as meaning intelligence via artifically created programs. Yet if uploaded human consciousnesses become a reality, then the programs of their minds would be natural, but on an artificial substrate. Hence, I'm changing this to """"From that point on, the entire visible universe would be engulfed by these 'mind children' as it approaches the point of maximum expansion,"""" with """"mind children"""" referring to the previously defined mention of the term.

I also removed your quote of Tipler's estimation as to when the universe will be engulfed, as that is from his 1994 book The Physics of Immortality, yet later cosmological observations have been able to define the Hubble shift more accurately, which is what that estimation is based on. So Tipler's current estimation is different now. For more on that, see:

F. J. Tipler, """"The structure of the world from pure numbers,"""" Reports on Progress in Physics, Vol. 68, No. 4 (April 2005), pp. 897-964. See also here. Also released as """"Feynman-Weinberg Quantum Gravity and the Extended Standard Model as a Theory of Everything,"""" arXiv:0704.3276, April 24, 2007.

 You added the section """"Criticism from string theory.""""

I kept pretty much all of this, while editing it slightly to improve the style and formatting. I changed the section title to """"Implications from string theory,"""" since Brian Greene doesn't actually offer any criticism of, or even refer to, Tipler's Omega Point Theory in Greene's book that you referenced.

This section, as it stands now, might have to go entirely, as it appears to fall under Wikipedia's rule concerning original research. As it's written, it's a valid deduction that the Omega Point singularity would be obviated if string theory disallows singularities and if string theory is true, but it's an original deduction.

 You moved the """"See also"""" section to underneath the references. You also added a number of links therein.

Based upon Wikipedia's """"Featured articles,"""" it appears that the preferred location of the """"See also"""" section is where it was previously, before the references. Hence, I moved it back. I removed the link """"metaverse,"""" because it's a science fiction term that's perfectly explainable with more acce",0

What would really help would be a degree in paleontology with taphonomy.

The article says this:  """"Sometimes, creationists will claim that fossilization can only take place when the matter is buried quickly so that the matter does not decompose.[26]""""

The reference is this:  """"Isaak 2007 p 137 Creationist claim CC363""""  At Talk.Origins.

This is what Talk.Origins says:

Claim CC363:

""""Fossilization requires rapid burial, or the organism will decay.  This suggest that a catastrophe is responsible for the fossil.""""

Source:

This is what W & M actually say: 

""""The only way they [organic remains] can be preserved long enough from the usual processes of decay, scavenging and disintegration is by means of quick burial in aqueous sediments.""""

There is a big difference between an organism being saved from total destruction so that it might become a fossil and the fossilization processes of permineralization or carbonization, etc., which preserve the organism after it has been buried.  Talk.Origins conflates the two.  If you don't know the difference, you don't have enough knowledge to judge what W & M said and probably don't understand how Talk.Origins blatantly lied.

The above misrepresentation of W & M must be expunged from the article and a sentence reflecting what they actually say with a reliable source.  Talk.Origins has no reliability, as anyone can see, especially in this case.    """,0

@ Tiamut: if you read my post, I invite people who have concerns about edits I didn't explain in my initial post in this thread to please to tell me what they are, and why. @ Kasaalan. 1) If you could relax a bit, that would help. Shouty, accusatory posts just raise the temperature here. 2) There are many, many facts about RC's life we could put here. And many of them would be quite touching, I'm sure. But are they relevant? RC's life is not notable, only her death is. I'm not saying that to be callous, it's just a fact. Background on how she came to be in front of an Israeli bulldozer is essential, hagiographic text dumps about her 5th grade interests are not. As to the point about the wells, I don't deny that's what Corrie thought she was doing. What I'd need to see is proof that the IDF was actually doing that before we put it as a fact in the narrative voice. Also, I don't see where I used the word """"tiniest"""" in regard to theoretical violins. I meant that the presentation of her life was lachrymose, maudlin, and saccharine.

At some point in the article's history, the idea expressed by this passage was followed by some discussion of airflow on both sides of the wing and the point made that some explanations only involve air being deflected by the bottom of the wing.

This was accompanied by a graph showing the pressure distribution along the top and bottom of a wing where the pressure difference along the top was substantially larger than along the bottom.  At some point this was excised, whether by accident or not.

Which is to say that your interpretation of the intent is correct.  I can see where what is actually written may be interpreted differently than what was meant.

"""==GA Review==
:This review is transcluded from Talk:Land value tax/GA1. The edit link for this section can be used to add comments to the review.

GA review (see here for criteria)

It is reasonably well written.
a (prose):  b (MoS): 
 Some comments:
The lead needs to be considerably longer, at least three times the current length. More at WP:LEAD.
The hyphen (-) is for connecting words, while the emdash (—) is used as punctuation.
Though the economic effects of land value tax are very important, and definitively require their own section, I am somewhat concerned with it being the first section. I would have preferred to see the first section looking at it from a political/implementational aspect, rather than it as part of a highly abstract framework.
As unfortunately is common on many Wikipedia articles on economics, this article uses a too complex language. Economic theory is very abstract, and even myself, with a MSc in the field soon in my pocket, finds it difficult to understand the matters at hand. The use of an unnecessary complex prose makes things even worse. The art of writing an encyclopædia is not to get other economists to undestand the matter at hand, but to explain it to a lay person at high school level. For instance, the phrase """"Most taxes distort economic decisions"""" means abosultely nothing to most people. The next sentence uses a lot of complex words, and introduces many technical terms in the sentance; for instance, i doubt most people know what 'dissuaded', 'correlation', 'levy', 'fallacious' and 'marginal' means. Rememerb, economists can go elsewhere for an academic description of the topic, while our purpose here is to provide information to the masses. I would recommend completely rewriting the section. Do not be concerned if it becomes significantly longer; it is much better that more words are used if they can help explain.
In what country is Harrisburg, Pennsylvania? This is not the US Wikipedia, it is the English-language version, and is used by very many people from outside the US, who do not have the slighest idea where neigher Harrisburg nor Pennsylvania is. Always indicate the country, unless evident from context.
'Alegded' should be avoided; if there is disagreement, state the disagreement.
Terms like 'deadweight' need to be wikilinked. Even if 'excess burden of taxation' has been linked before, when a synonym is used, it needs wikilinking, since most people associate deadweight with shipping tonnage.
'Surplus' links to a disambiguation page.
The history section mixes past and present tense.
I find most of the quotes very pereferial to the topic. It would be a lot better just paraphrasing their meaning in the text.
Never repeat the name of the article in a section header.
I find that there is a blur between the 'implementation' and the 'land value tax systems' sections; they should probably be merged.
'Land value tax' is never to appear all-capitalized (except for the 'l' if at the beginning of a sentence). It is not a proper noun. Of course, the acrony LVT is capitalized.
It is factually accurate and verifiable.
a (references):  b (citations to reliable sources):  c (OR): 
 
Entire paragraphs are unreferenced. There are  tags.
References are references, not quotes. State where the information was found, and if available provide a link. Do not quote the text, even if it is in the public domain.
Some of the references are incomplete. All references must have an author (or reliable publisher), and a link to the top of a web site is insufficient.
Some sources, such as 'New Jersey Land Value Tax Project', 'Denmark' are not reliable.
It is broad in its coverage.
a (major aspects):  b (focused): 
 
There are expansion tags on the 'pre-modern' and 'other countries' section.

Strawman. Try again  talk 

Read Jeremiah 25:12. It gives an order of events. 1) 70 years ends. 2) Babylon's king is called to account. Babylon's king was called to account in 539. Ergo, 70 years ended in 539. Ergo, 70 years of nations serving Babylon began in 609. Babylon replaced the Assyrian world power in 609.  
As I keep telling you, your exegesis is fatuous for it obviates the context of 2 Chronicles 36:20,21; Jeremiah 25:12; Zechariah 1:12; Daniel 9:2; Zechariah 7:5 and Jeremiah 29:10, among others. Try again.  talk 

 Fringe Views? 

Please desist from changing articles to match the fringe views of Jehovah's Witnesses. You might like to start a section at articles' Talk pages, however it is unlikely that you will be able to indicate any widespread support for the alternative views taught by your religion. Thanks.  

How is it fringe when they're based on accurate and reliable sources? Wikipedia is a place for truth not your noetical bigotry.   
Reliable sources indicate the widely accepted chronology of the period. They do not support the JW chronology. And you didn't even provide any sources. You will need to discuss at the article's Talk pages to reach a concensus, however there are no mainstream sources in support of your views.  

Agreed. I've reverted you again.   
You are both misinformed. According to the Cyrus Cylinder, Cyrus conquered Babylon in October 539 B.C.E. Cyrus’ first regal year began in the spring of 538 B.C.E. This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E. or “the seventh month (Tishri)” as Ezra 3:1 says.

It is a simple matter of counting back 70 years which brings us to 607 BCE for Jerusalem’s destruction. Dates other than 607 BCE ignore the statements in Scripture that the land would be desolate for 70 years. (Daniel 9:1,2)    

Looking at your other edits I'm concerned that you don't have any grasp yet of WP:NPOV. I've raised them at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Bible#Editor changes biblical dates, etc where I hope you will explain your edits. You are also failing to use WP:Edit summaries, which is sufficient reason for many people to revert you.   

Thank you for the reminder concerning the """"edit summaries"""" field.   

You said: This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E.. That is wrong. The JW conclusion that the Jews 'must' have returned the following year is entirely speculative. Josephus explicitly states that the temple foundations were laid in Cyrus second year, which means the Jews were back in his first year, which means Cyrus decree was made at the beginning of hist first year, and the Jews then had 6 months to make the 4-month journey back to Jerusalem.

Further edits have persisted adding """"citation needed"""" tags to the lede: . Since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article (which should be sourced), WP:CITELEAD does require editors to add redundant citations i.e. if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead. The first two sections of the article detail transcripts (in which Hitler proclaims himself to be vegetarian), diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from 1942 onwards. Sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent, indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life. Instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so; if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it. Please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence, it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes. Tags only alert editors to a potential problem, but if we do not understand what the problem is we cannot address it.   """,0

...

Thanks for the quick response Khoikhoi. I was quite impressed with how level headed your second reply to me was (you didn't immediately go into a defensive ego trip like some others I've bumped into. Very much appreciated. A rare quality ). I will take your advice and will refrain from doing such edits temporarily. If possible though I still would like a little more clarification on the matter before I make any final decision on the matter. 

While there are occasional exceptions, a visit to virtually any article on any city in the world (new or old) doesn't show the pattern of a long list of multiple old not in use historically insignificant foreign names on the first line. For instance FYROM/Republic of Macedonia's title  lists Macedonian: Скопје, pronounced [ˈskopje], Albanian: Shkup, or Shkupi)[1] (their two largest demographics). There is no mention of older Turkish and ancient Greek pronouncement for Skopje).  So it seems very fishy to me that obscure Greek islands are seemingly being prioritized with old Turkish occupation names over major cities.

Also I would like to note the Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names) specifically states 

""""The title can be followed in the first line by a list of alternative names""""  (i.e. not """"must"""" be) 

It further clarifies the point (with regards to use  of older historical foreign names on the first line)...

Relevant foreign language names (one used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or is used by a group of people which used to inhabit this geographical place) are permitted and should be listed in alphabetic order of their respective languages, i.e., (Armenian name1, Belarusian name2, Czech name3). or (ar: name1, be: name2, cs: name3).

Unless you can demonstrate that these obscure alternate foreign language name qualify as """"Relevant foreign language names used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or used by a group of people which used to inhabit the geographic place""""... I don't believe an obscure set of Greek islands remotely qualifies for this rule of prominent display. And this point of sensitivity to names is further clarified at the head of the geographic naming convention article where it explicitly states...

Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.

Notice the words """"and should be used in articles with caution"""". I think it's pretty clear that the Balkans are an extremely sensitive area with regards to names. (it stirs the pot for old ethnic conflicts)

I think perhaps you've misunderstood my motivations here a bit. The issue for me wasn't whether the names could be mentioned (they obviously always should be in there somewhere)... but exactly where in the article they are mentioned. Unless it is historically important (e.g. Constantinople) any mention of older historical Turkish or Greek occupation names should only be added later in the article in a historical or etymological context.... not be given equal airplay upfront with current names or historically unimportant names.  Doing so is both bulky and highly provocative to sensitive political regions. (and incidentally the same rule should apply for inappropriately using historically insignificant Greek names for Turkish cities)
  
I'm sticking to my guns that my edits were kosher according to existing Wikipedia geographic naming conventions and current widely observable conventions. I'd even go further and suggest leaving those old historically insignificant foreign names prominently displayed is far more disruptive than removing them (both in a Wikipedia sense and in a human toll sense) I therefore would like to once again remove those old names from the first paragraph but will delay pending your response to me (to confirm I have (or have not) convinced you of the accuracy of my assertions)

Thanks in advance for all your help. """,0

"""guidelines. """"Like it says at the top of [my talk] page, 'If you're not already familiar with Wikipedia policies, particularly those regarding verifiability, neutral point of view and no original research, please consider carefully studying those policies before commenting here.'"""" As I wrote in the edit summary in response to one of your past edits, """"you'll need a WP:RS from a reliable third party (newspaper, etc) for this (court papers and Youtube are insufficient)).""""  One more time: court papers (without comment provided by some third party like a newspaper) and Youtube video are insufficient to include this material. Your obvious conflict of interest, use of Wikipedia articles to promote yourself and your agenda, and insistence on writing about yourself in Wikipedia articles is also noted.   

 Please see my comments at Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard#Joel_Osteen. Beyond this,  along with everything else. Please stop now, Adamkey.   

 Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard#Adamkey.   

I've read and reread the WP:RS which you continually cite as requiring a third party that is not a federal court's recognition of fact. I find no such requirement of a newspaper. The filing referenced was filed by Regent University, not by me, so there's your third party independently commenting on it. Moreover, the fact that a federal court recognized this as being fact is a second third party. Please demonstrate how Regent University and the federal courts(Southern District of Texas, East District of Virginia) do not meet standards of WP:RS.

WP:COI does not exist as I am using the talk page as requested by the policy.

WP:SOAP is not violated either. """"Propaganda, advocacy, or recruitment of any kind, commercial, political, religious, or otherwise. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view."""" Even if you view what I did outside Osteen's church as self promoting, it is reported in an objective manner. Further, this account is not the original author of the update.

This is not in any way WP:OR either. The events referenced are recorded in third party published sources and the references are not unique to Wikipedia.

Again, I ask that you cite the specific portions of policies you believe this post to violate, as citing them generally seems to be unfruitful.   

I'm no fan of Osteen, by any stretch of the imagination, but your entry doesn't seem all that encyclopedic, nor is it all that notable to an entry about Osteen or his church, nor does it appear to fit with the Biographies of Living Persons policy.  If Wikipedia listed every crackpot (not necessarily saying that you are one) that protested outside a church building, or wrote a book critical of a church/pastor, there'd be little room for anything else.  It also seems you're using this article as a coat-rack to promote your book.  If this event is all that notable, it will be widely covered by the media and have a broader impact than what currently appears to exist.  I cannot stand Osteen and the prosperity gospel he espouses, and I might likely agree with your book (though I doubt I'd ever buy it), but your information is tangentially related to him and doesn't belong here...  

Hm. I see your point. Accepted. I'll now yield. Thanks for the civility, you're a credit to Wikipedia.   """,0

"The paragraph is still misleading, in that it infers that Noel Stanton was the Baptist pastor rather than being within the Baptist laity at Bugbrooke at the time. 
There are a number of references to Pastor / Elder / Senior Elder Noel Stanton around, these are commonly references to his position within the Jesus Fellowship Church, rather than his position within the Baptist church. Rather than suggest citations which refer to Mr Stanton as the 'pastor' back then are inaccurately researched, after re-reading them with this in mind and knowing he was the pastor of his jesus fellowship at the time that they where written should clarify matters.
There are significant differences between being a lay person / lay leader / lay preacher / lay pastor, and being a 'pastor' within the Baptist church. The article should reflect the difference accurately by describing Mr Stanton as being amongst the laity. The use of 'lay pastor' as cited above (factually), or 'lay preacher' would accurately describe this.

Lloyd was born in Burchard, Nebraska, to James Darsie Lloyd (1865–1947) and Elizabeth Fraser (1869–1941); Harold's paternal great-grandparents were all from Wales. Young Harold was named for his paternal grandfather. Harold had an older brother, Gaylord (1888-1943), five years his senior. Like his younger brother, Gaylord acted in motion pictures, but his career was nowhere near as renowned as Harold's. Among other roles, he acted in 1921's """"Disraeli"""" starring the famous George Arliss.  With Harold's help, there were even efforts to turn him into a comedy star.  He eventually went on to become a film executive.  When Harold was a child, his parents divorced and Lloyd chose to stay with his father.  Despite this, he and his brother always remained close to their mother.  Harold's father was always dreaming up grand get-rich-quick schemes that ended in disasters. They eventually ended up in Omaha where Lloyd had his first acting experience in a local stock company. He attended East High School and San Diego High School and received his stage training at the School of Dramatic Art (San Diego). In 1912, his father J. Darsie """"Foxy"""" Lloyd was awarded the then-massive sum of $6,000 in a personal injury judgment (although this was split evenly between Lloyd and his lawyer) after being run over by an Omaha beer truck. Reportedly, on the toss of a coin (""""Heads is New York or Nashville or where I decide!, tails is San Diego""""), he and Lloyd moved west.

Lloyd had acted in various Vaudeville acts in theaters since boyhood, and started acting in one-reel film comedies shortly after moving to California. He soon began working with Thomas Edison's motion picture company, and eventually formed a partnership with fellow struggling actor and director Hal Roach, who had formed his own studio in 1913. The hard-working Lloyd became the most successful of Roach's comic actors between 1915 and 1919.

Davis retired from acting in 1923, the year she and Lloyd were married, and Jobyna Ralston became Lloyd's co-star.

From 1915 to 1917, Lloyd and Roach created more than 60 one-reel comedies.

"With respect, A2Kafir is misunderstanding the problem with Ruy Lopez's edits.

The reality was that the communist Khmer Rouge leadership ran the whole operation, as they showed at once when they came to power.

On the term Azeri

See that section of my full article on this.  Overall, the formation of Azerbaijani-Turkish ethnic group is from the 13th-16th century.  But the USSR usage of Azerbaijani was not clear.  The ethnonym """"Azerbaijani"""" though is very recently and dates back to the early 20th or late 19th century.  In some sources, """"Azerbaijani"""" is used to refef to any modern inhabitant of the republic while """"Azeri"""" is the ethnic term meaning Azeri-Turk  

As noted by Oliver Roy:
“The concept of Azeri identity barely appears at all before 1920.  Up until that point Azerbaijan had been a purely geographical area.  Before 1924, the Russians called Azeri Tatars """"Turk"""" or """"Muslims"""".(Roy, Oliver. “The new Central Asia: The Creation of Nations”). 

According to Prof. Tadeusz Swietochovski: """"Azerbaijani"""" was coined in the 1930s to refer to the inhabitants of the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.(Azerbaijan Seven Years of Conflict Nagorno-Karabagh – Human Rights Watch / Helsinki– December 1994 by Human Rights Watch).

So a historical article should not have anachronistic terms.

According to the multi-volume book “History of the East” (“Transcaucasia in XI-XV centuries” in Rostislav Borisovich Rybakov (editor), History of the East. 6 volumes.  v. 2. “East during the Middle Ages: Chapter V., 2002. – ISBN 5-02-017711-3.  http://gumilevica.kulichki.com/HE2/he2510.htm )

What did the USSR mean by Azerbaijani?

Since the ethnonym Azerbaijani for an ethnic group was new, the USSR era did not provide a clear definition.  For example some considered Azerbaijanis to be Medes, others as Turks and others as Caucasian Albanians.  Then there was theories combining some or all of these.  This is another reason why calling Nezami Ganjavi as “Azerbaijani” in the politicized USSR sources lacks clarity.  Do they mean Medes(and the descendant of Iranic Medes like Talysh, Kurds?), or Caucasian Albanians or Turks and etc.

For  example  Bolukbashi mentions(Susha Bolukbashi,  ‘Nation building in Azerbaijan: The Soviet Legacy and the Impact of the Karabakh Conflict’ in Van Schendel, Willem(Editor) . Identity Politics in Central Asia and the Muslim World: Nationalism, Ethnicity and Labour in the Twentieth Century. London , GBR: I. B. Tauris & Company, Limited, 2001.):

"I think this needs a subsection called 'community'

One of the things that residents of Inala think is really important is the community organisations.  Inala has a number of  organisations that have helped the suburb develop.  There is also a very strong sense of 'community' in the suburb.  Any talk about Inala, which does not recognise 'community' fails to recognise the character of Inala.

Perhaps this could be included in Suburb amenities, facilities and services.

 Additional Information on recent Cocaine use in the United States 

I would like to add an additional statement to the following area of this article. The article states that Cocaine, """"...is also popular amongst college students, as a party drug."""" This statement is to vague and could use a recent study that could provide additional information and make this sentence more credible. 

I am proposing the following sentences: """"A study throughout the entire United States has reported that around 48 percent of people who graduated high school in 1979 have used Cocaine recreationally during some point in their lifetime, compared to approximately 20 percent of students who graduated between the years of 1980 and 1995.""""

-Chess forces personal views, not supported by science

Wikipedia user -Chess participates in vandalism the following way:

Over and over again the Wikipedia user -Chess has been asked on this discussion page to present a known historian or another acceptable source, quote or reference to back up his claims, for instance about his """"16th century"""" Finnish migration theory to Northern Norway, etc.

-Chess has refused to respond to any of these pleas for sources.  Now, that Mr. Chess has changed the Kven text to reflect his personal theories - which are not supported by science - he is attempting to lock and protect the site from reverts and/or further edits.

The Wikipedia user -Chess is forcing his personal views into the Wikipedia Kven text.  Those views are not supported by science.  Not willing to present any sources for the peaces of information inserted by him, the Wikipedia user -Chess is participating in vandalism.

Let it be known, that most parts of the Wikipedia Kven text remaining as of today, which were left standing from earlier contributors, seem accurate.  However, Mr. Chess has attempted to include into the text some of his own ideas, which do not seem to match the opinions of any known historians.  

If Fred Chess disagrees, we once again ask him to provide sources for his claims - even just one source, which could be considered distinguished and reliable.

In his earlier discussion comment above, Fred Chess praises and thanks a respond from user .  However, even that commentator sides against Fred Chess, who - without any scientific foundation, or without any sources presented - tries to present the Northern Norwegian Kvens as a separate and totally non-connected group from the medieval Kvens of Northern Scandinavia.

Wikipedia user  correctly states:  """"Of course, the present Kvens in Northern Norway have a connection with the Finnish-speaking medieval settlers in Northern Sweden and Finland.""""

Vandalism by 

Below are three misquotations by user , from his unsigned message above (his previously used IP address 130.234.75.167 shows that the message is his): 

Claim Number One: """"Tavastians (a group of Southern Finns) were present on the Arctic Ocean alreydy during the Viking Age"""".

Claim Number Two: """"Some believe that the Kvens were the original inhabitants of Northern Norway"""".

Claim Number Three: """" According to Ottar, the Kvens were living in Northern Norway and around the White Sea"""".

When you choose to quote someone, please use the copy and paste technique.  No one has said any of the three sentences above.  You simply changed the wording, to make up goofy sounding sentences, which you claim some one actually wrote.  

Please, explain:  When and where were those sentences written ?  You are simply participating in vandalism, aren't you.  

You've also changed the content of a comment written by another Wikipedia user to this discussion page (and we do not mean you placing your responses between the lines, although for that too you ought to ask a permission from the writer of the comment).

At 13:45, 19 March 2006, using the IP address 130.234.5.136 you added the following sentence to the text which another Wikipedia user had written under the headline Lack of public funding a major cause for lack of information:

"First, I did not change the name of an AFD. I changed the name of the article. Articles are open for editing during AFD, and people objected to the name. I improved the article by changing the name, which no one seemed to like. Obviously, one should then change the name of the AFD to correspond to the article. For you to call that disruptive demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of the process.  If I had changed it to something silly, that would be different, but I doubt there's an editor here who disputes that was an improvement.
Second, I did not attack Aaron in it, I described his actions. I factually said he did not do a, b, & c. I also described it as a preposterous attempt to circumvent standard procedure. It was.

The article states at Iranian calendar#Modern era from 1925 that in 1976, the Shah decreed that Solar Hejri year 1355 became the imperial year 2535. Thus the first imperial year was the year that Cyrus the Great acceded to the throne in 559 BC (not his birth year many years earlier). This would mean that during Gregorian year 2010 the imperial year 2569 would have begun if the Solar Hejri year had not been reinstated in 1978. Your year 2549 would imply a first imperial year 20 years after Cyrus began his reign, after he had conquered many nations, inducing their kings to bring him gifts. This would be even more arbitrary then the beginning of his reign, which is a well known year. His birth year is assigned to be two different years, either 600–599 BC or 576–575 BC. 

Regarding Nowruz, in Achaemenid times the official year began at Nowruz at the vernal equinox, but popular usage placed Nowruz at the summer solstice.

I think that this list is always going to be subjective, and only open discussion is going to provide the best result.   I think Wildhartlivie makes a very valid point in addressing the limitations and """"key audience"""" of this project, which is the English speaking world.   Going back to the definition/criteria for inclusion  Core topics about actors and filmmakers. """"Generally, these are people who are extremely notable to the common person. This category should stay limited to approximately 100 members"""".  I think 100 is just an arbitrary number, and I think we should agree that it should be viewed as a guide rather than a rule.   The most important point is """"extremely notable to the common person"""" and in this project the """"common"""" person is someone who predominently speaks English, and it would follow that the interests and backgrounds of the great majority of these people would be related to the culture of English-speaking countries in whatever field they happen to be looking, whether it's music, literature or cinema.   I would expect that the average Chinese cinema-goer would be unfamiliar with almost every name on the current list, but if you were to go to Chinese Wikipedia you would rightly see that their articles are skewed with a Chinese perspective.   I don't think that adding names that are best known within their own non-English language industries would balance this list.   I think it would actually """"unbalance"""" it by adding a number of names that are unfamiliar to the people who most often use these pages, and whose culture is supposed to be reflected in the ratings given.   Someone such as Sharukh Khan, to choose one name at random, is undeniably a significant figure but from the point of view of English language Wikipedia, and the English language experience of most of its readers, would have much less relevance.  I agree that this requires further discussion, and certainly individual names should be discussed, but I think to provide a completely balanced world-view would be beyond the scope of this project.  I would also like to echo another of Wildhartlivie's comments  one of the main results of tagging these articles should be that they are spotlighted by the community at large, as articles that merit elevation to good or featured standard.  It's saying """"these articles need to be fixed first"""" rather than """"these individuals made more startling contributions to world cinema than anyone else"""", although notability and influence are crucial to identifying the subjects.

"Judicial aspects of felony conviction 

The article does not make it clear that the termination of Sloan's custody rights did not just toss Shamema into some arbitrarily-chosen foster home as if Sloan was some sort of unfit parent. Sloan was never found to be an unfit parent or a danger to his daughter.  The essential ingredient in the termination of Sloan's parental righs was U.S. dollars.

Shemema was returned to the USA because the couple (who were private US citizens) had the money to pay and agent to get Shemema back. That US couple wanted to raise Shamema as a Christian, which Sloan did not want.  No gov't agencies of any sort were involved in that action. Sloan's wife as the time had been coerced by the paid agents. The coersion by their agent included implied threats against the health and safety of that woman's own children, but those threats occurred outside of US territory.

During Sloan's time as a fugitive, the gov't of the USA had custody of him multiple times and chose not to extradict him back to Virginia simply because of the expense involved.  Sloan was a fugitive in name only and only because one Viriginia judge was annoyed at him and he the authority to make him a fugitive rather than just let Shemama's natural parent raise her as he saw fit.

I am asking for balance in the presentation of this story. It is not as simple as the text currently suggests and the implications, as the the text currently stands, that Sloan was simply just another irresponsible, unfit parent.

"DrPrinceton

GITHUB is the top place where new computer projects are created and discussed by computer programmers. Anything that isn't right gets corrected pretty fast. For over two years the PyPrimes speed test which is open source has had not one person question the results and since it is open source anyone can download the core of Python a major new computer language and run PyPrimes and test all the various prime algorithms. Every algorithm lost to the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, every one but Prime Spirals.

Now, outside of that real world test, the average mathematician or computer programmer is pretty much clueless as to primes and how they really interact in the modern world today (ie. Cryptology).

Now I could have used a ton of links to NPOV and alternative sites where for 20 years you have various groups arguing what this new algorithm means for the world. In fact much of the original argument was erased from Usenet in the 1990's, and the only group that could have done that was the NSA. 

Since the original algorithm was released when the NSA still controlled encryption related publishing (original paper was 1995) NO PUBLISHING COMPANY would have touched anything claiming to be how this algorithm made all encryption OBSOLETE, that was the original paper, saying to the world in 1995, here world, here is where every prime number above 5 MUST BE, there are only 8 Prime Spirals, now your whole concept of encryption has been DESTROYED by this work.

So, this prime algorthm was tied to national security issues in 1995, and in 1995 the NSA had a headlock on all academic publishing and guess what they still do today, who funds the AMS and the top journals? THE NSA

Now my original article didn't go this deep into why in 1995, this work could not be published in academia due to the NSA chokehold on academic publishing for anything that could possibly be used to create new encryption or damage old encryption.

Now 99.99% of the world is clueless that PRIMES are a big deal in crypto.

A HUGE DEAL

So understanding where they all exist and on what spirals they exist, you can now do neat tricks, like create huge seed keys for ECC crypto that gives the person that creates such a seed key a backdoor to that crypto, oh no, now we're talking about the heart of the issue WIKI LEAKS is all about crypto and how the NSA has a special skeleton key to the seed keys released by NSA projects like NIST and ENISA (europes equivalent).

Now in 1995 to 1999 or so this was discussed in many thousands of pages all over usenet, try to find them now, most are gone, now I actually participated in that era in some usenet discussions about the ENNISA paper, you cannot find one thread now mentioning ENNISA from the 1990's.

So erased all the discussion in math and physics groups about ENNISA?

Yet, if you really know where to look, you can find some references to the work, not ENNISA but the person's name and some of the the actual math still exists.

Now, the math is in books, who published the books, the guy that released it has his own publishing company and it was done via ebooks.

So I have a copy of the ebook. I know it's real.

Now today you have academics taking credit for bits and pieces of his work, and they are 100% controlled sock puppets of the NSA.

So the NSA is now controlling what the public learns about this discovery 20 years after the fact it was released via usenet.

One of the new algorithms is the Atkin sieve, look who published it with Atkin, the guy that sued the US Government in the 1990's to allow software to be published without interference of the NSA.

Look at the guys wiki page, he was tutored by the guy that actually created ECC, the stuff the NSA is using to backdoor all encryption today.

So 1995, the guy is suing the US Gov and 10 years later he is at AMS as the co-author of one of the 3 prime algorithms discussed in ENNISA in 1995.

Just google NSA and AMS, see all the NSA funding.

Just like when academics rebelled in the 1980's against the stranglehold the NSA had on crypto, guess what the NSA did, they bought out all of academia with grants.

Now I'm not a tin foil hat guy/girl, I'm retired, I was in academia and I can actually discuss stuff about math and how academia works and how various topics were taboo in the 1970's through the 1990's.

So AMS MAA AMA, etc, all are now in bed with grants and funding from the NSA.

You look at sieve of Atkin and who is on the paper the kid that sued the government over crypto software in the 1990's, who was groomed by the daddy of ECC now the top crypto used",0

Can you please explain your edits to Biff Rose? They appear to express a negative POV towards the person. - 06:55, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

 For willmcw 

I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!

Why do you delete the number of """"Carson"""" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. - 20:21, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

I've copied this discussion to the talk:Biff Rose page. - 23:29, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

 Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time  magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, """"Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade."""" Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman's uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose's irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly  had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. Willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion.

 Please reconsider taking a break 

It's not just because of Sapphic's loss of temper that I'm suggesting a break, although it certainly plays a part.  I really think more progress would be made (in arriving at a community decision supported — and enforced — by ArbCom, as well as in getting the injunction lifted) if the named parties all removed themselves from the situation.

As for my comments about your son, I did NOT mean to imply that his trying out to be a SEAL was important to you and nobody else.  If I'd meant that, I'd have written it that way.  I don't like sarcasm or veiled insults, and prefer the more direct variety.  If I'm not writing mean things to you, then you can be sure I'm not thinking mean thoughts about you when I write whatever I do write.  I think in at least that one aspect of things, we have pretty similar views, and I definitely respect you for being able to shrug off insults.

I'm not posting anything to any of the dates-related pages for at least a week, I'm fairly sure I'll be able to convince Sapphic to do the same, and hopefully Locke Cole will follow suit.  You can choose to keep posting, but I don't think you're actually helping your cause by doing so at this point, and you may in fact be hurting it.

 Do not restore Wenner quote in Bob Marley article 

The quote is erroneous. It is egotistical and serves Wenner not Marley. Reggae is not mystic music it may be called spiritual - mystic may seem to have the same meaning as spiritual but its loaded with ideas of magic and other such mystic rubbish - palm reading crap.

He did not have anything in common with John Lennon especially the nonsense lyrics that Lennon engaged in to insult his sycophantic fans (something Marley never did). And Marley would not say we are bigger than God and that religion will end as Lennon did. Let alone write a song about his mother as Lennon did which sounds like Lennon has issues.

Bob Dylan is nothing to do with Bob Marley - if you added him to the Hendrix article then yes because Hendrix was a fan.

The quote is typical of magazine publishers. It is designed to serve them. A good example is the recent Rupert Murdoch quote: """"This is the humblest day of my life"""" that led to him receiving a custard pie in the face. It was not his humblest day and he was at the inquiry because there had been a serious breach of civilized behavior from the editors of his publications. 

Pack it in. If Wenner wants to promote this magazine then let him take a full ad out in the New York Times.

Do not restore the erroneous quote.

 """"Right to be forgotten"""" 

I think that the present conflict between Google and the Spanish Data Protection Agency bears watching.  The Spanish are seeking input from the EU, and could in the worst case become a model for EU countries.  Many of the 90 people who the Spanish want censored from the Google results would not be affected the same way by Wikipedia - hopefully people would add information about a lawsuit's dismissal, and a principal known only for public urination wouldn't be notable.  But Wikipedians might believe that someone who murders but gets off on temporary insanity is notable, and shouldn't be allowed to move on with his life until the victim moves on with his.

Wikipedia might be a natural ally for Google, since balanced articles here, appearing high in the rankings, can offset the impact of raw hits on news headlines.  And Google's deletions, if forced, would hinder our research.  In the end, the way to deal with petty prejudice by human resources functionaries is to fight for equal and widespread access to employment, rather than to impose censorship.  The latter approach only helps those who have actually done things wrong, not those who simply have an appearance that bigots don't like.   """,0

 To uphold the quality of Wikipedia:Good articles, all articles listed as Good articles are being reviewed against the GA criteria as part of the GA project quality task force. While all the hard work that has gone into this article is appreciated, unfortunately, as of August 17, 2009, this article fails to satisfy the criteria, as detailed below. For that reason, the article has been delisted from WP:GA. However, if improvements are made bringing the article up to standards, the article may be nominated at WP:GAN. If you feel this decision has been made in error, you may seek remediation at WP:GAR. 

There are at least 5 broken links.

I'm concerned that some sections of this article look like a personal essay. For instance, from Student accommodation: """"Most students in college or university accommodation are first-year undergraduates. The majority of second and third-year students and postgraduates find their own accommodation in the private sector. This is partly due to the fact that accommodation in and around Central London is often cheaper than university accommodation when shared with friends or flat-mates."""" Thay may well be true, but personal reminiscences are not suitable material for an encyclopedia article. Whose opinion is this? It needs to be either cited or removed.

I'm also concerned that almost the entire Alumni and academics section is uncited, and neither are sources provided in the main article to which this one links.

The present order of sections makes no sense, starting as it does with Academic reputation. Take a look at other university GAs such as University College, Durham or University of Bristol to get some ideas for a more logical presentation sequence.

The Notable buildings section needs to be converted to prose, and to focus on the notable buildings, not just list every building. It ought to be telling us something about these notable buildings, not just listing them.

The Student accommodation section is similarly largely just a list. This article is not supposed to be a brochure for University College.

The relevant pictures from the Gallery ought to be incorporated into the text at the appropriate places and the rest transferred to Commons with a link from this article.

The last three sections—Ethical investment policy, Filming at UCL, and University crest—do not contain enough material to warrant standalone sections.

I am so sorry, I just thought whatever their highest score is matters, but apparently isu doesn't care. they should include non isu eventys as personal bests, I wish. hopefully they will do that for the future, I will not make any more edits, because I feel like they wont be adequate or right to the isu standings. thx for letting me know.

 Hakan Mild 

Hi Johan. Why do you keep deleting the link to video featuring Hakan Mild?? You write, """"it's irrelevant to the article"""". Great, if the article was about Nuclear Power Plant, I'd say too, the video about great Swedish football player Hakan Mild, showing his AMAZING skills with the ball, is irrelevant to the topic. But the article about Mild... so what's wrong with the video about the very guy the article is written about, Johan?? ) Seriously, I wonder why do you delete it. Please, think again, let's put a link to the video so all the people who visit this Wikipedia page (and Wikipedia's pages are first to be found in all search engines, so everyone who likes to know more about Hakan Mild, would visit this page first) would see an amazing skills of the guy. If I could, I'd add more videos to that section, videos that feature his goals, for example, that great goal he scored when Sweden beat Bulgaria 4-0 in 1994 (over the 3rd place, I bet you remember). Other pages DO HAVE this link section with the link to videos. So why wouldn't we??

 No offense taken, but I see no need to moderate my tone.

I speak here the same way I'd speak in an academic forum, in front of a work committee, or in front of Joe Schmoe on the street.

And the issue at hand here is why we SHOULD move it, as that is the proposal, and many reasons have been given.  It is not necessary to prove that she """"does not want her name to be capitalized"""".  

Or are you trying to say that such a finding would supersede all other arguments and be grounds upon which to make the move?  If so, then you are being contrary and absurd.  My burden, and those who support the move, was to provide reasons for the move, and it is then up to the opposition to cite reasons against it, which they have not done.  Some have even changed their vote from oppose to support.  Even , for all of his wordiness, seems to be in support of the move, but is just playing his role as administrator, and being cautious before he commits to the move.  I'd say overly so, but that is my opinion.  Even if the lack of """"proof"""" you're looking for was the only reason against the move, the overwhelming reasons for the move supersede it.

Paul talks about the war because that is what the liberal media types want to talk about, but I have seen several reports that the average """"conservative voter"""" is not primarily concerned with the war and wants to hear much more about real border security, stopping abortion on demand and protecting second amendment rights; in this specific order.

I just think that we should consider making the order that which is the priority of our primary audience for this page.

"""One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

 Solar intensity due to proximity  
Ratio between Aphelion and Perihelion: Axial tilt comparison still needed

Request confirmation of math

There is some effect of the distance between the sun and the earth on the radiant energy reaching the earth. There is some measure of heating northern latitudes up in their winter, up to a maximum at Jan 3, and heating southern latitudes up in their summer. Thus, the winters in northern latitudes (all other variables such as warming by ocean currents, etc, removed from consideration), are relatively more mild, and the summers in southern latitudes (variables removed), relatively more extreme. However, the ratio of the aphelion (furthest distance) to the perihelion (nearest) is only 1.033988391 . So, a difference of 3.4%.

Then to calculate what that does to the total radiant energy: Inverse-square law says, """"the radiation passing through any unit area is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point source"""" Received light quadruples as the distance halves.

So 

E sun energy stays the same so is 1, solving for intensity I, d is distance, using perihelion distance as 1, d (aphelion) = 1.033988391 and d2 = 1.069131994.

Multiply both sides of the equation by 1.069131994, so that I is both multiplied and divided by the same number; this cancels out, and E is now 1.069131994. E is now equal to I, as I is no longer divided by anything. I =  1.069131994.

1.069 times (aphelion intensity) = perihelion intensity. 

1 / 1.069131994 = 0.935338204, 

.935 times (perihelion intensity) = aphelion intensity.

Axial tilt total radiant energy and/or comparison with the above remains to be found

I looked at the wiki mediation but it is all a waste of energy against anyone that is willing to spend the hours he has done putting together an entirely erroneous and dishonest RfC against Canaen.

But I think I will write to the foundation and find out who their legal counsel because what he has written against Canaen is pure indelible libel. Whereas mediation is a waste of time, the foundation will jump if they start receiving legal letters requesting user contact details. They have to be law.

I approached both of them, him and Skinwaker very reasonably in the first place and straight off received the same modus operandi. he is what he shows himself to be. BTW, I have absolutely no connection with Canaen or anyone else but I recognise decency and indeceny when I see it.

"""Welcome to Wikipedia:
Remember the five pillars of Wikipedia. 

  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia incorporating elements of general and specialized encyclopedias, almanacs, and gazetteers. All articles must strive for verifiable accuracy: unreferenced material may be removed, so please provide references. Wikipedia is not the place to insert personal opinions, experiences, or arguments. Original ideas, interpretations, or research cannot be verified, and are thus inappropriate. Wikipedia is not a soapbox; an advertising platform; a vanity press; an experiment in anarchy or democracy; an indiscriminate collection of information; or a web directory. It is not a newspaper or a collection of source documents; these kinds of content should be contributed to the Wikimedia sister projects.   Wikipedia has a neutral point of view, which means we strive for articles that advocate no single point of view. Sometimes this requires representing multiple points of view, presenting each point of view accurately, providing context for any given point of view, and presenting no one point of view as """"the truth"""" or """"the best view"""". It means citing verifiable, authoritative sources whenever possible, especially on controversial topics. When a conflict arises regarding neutrality, declare a cool-down period and tag the article as disputed, hammer out details on the talk page, and follow dispute resolution.  Wikipedia is free content that anyone may edit.

Do not infringe on copyright or submit work licensed in a way incompatible with Wikipedia's licensing.  Wikipedia has a code of conduct: Respect your fellow Wikipedians even when you may not agree with them. Be civil. Avoid conflicts of interest, personal attacks and sweeping generalizations. Find consensus, avoid edit wars, follow the three-revert rule, and remember that there are  articles on the English Wikipedia to work on and discuss. Act in good faith, never disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point, and assume good faith on the part of others. Be open and welcoming.   Wikipedia does not have firm rules besides the five general principles presented here. Be bold in editing, moving, and modifying articles. Although it should be the aim, perfection is not required. Do not worry about making mistakes. In most cases, all prior versions of articles are kept, so there is no way that you can accidentally damage Wikipedia or irretrievably destroy content.

fuck u communist bastards!!!! if u lik the sunflkower on this page go blow urself.  It has all the sections clearly labeled and it is easy to read.  One small thing would maybe be to have less sections, although I do think that for showing so many different aspects of the sunflower you do a good job of keeping it focused.  Overall well done, probably one of the best I have read.  I would say try to simplify it a little bit, and are all the pictures relevant to the article?

I'd like to propose this image for the sunflower article.

Wow that's nice. Go ahead and add it to the gallery, if that's where you'd like it. Bold text

 Unneccessary reference 
Is Samurai Champloo important enough to be included in this article? It doesn't seem to add much to the article. Why's every article I look at have some reference to anime?

Why does every other article I read have reference to some American Sitcom or other live-action medium? It's a part of popular culture, that's why. The Sunflower Samurai as well as Sunflowers themselves are a HUGE central plot point that dominates almost every single episode.

So post it in the Samurai Champloo article. Anime is not central nor even moderately relevant to actual sunflowers.

If it is at the end, labeled, and sufficiently known information, why not have it?  

 why do sunflowers """"want"""" to follow the sun? 

what do they get out of it? is this known? guessed by relevant public work? I myself would even take a clue, here. (thats I really wanna get info on this) Bye and thanks.  

Heliotropic flowers are more prevalent among plants in alpine areas. The absorbed light makes the flowers warmer, which attracts more pollinating insects. http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1998.00336.x?cookieSet=1   May be the sunflower's heliotropism is a rudimentary feature from an alpine past?  

 Pizarro? 

It says that he cultivated them around 1000 B.C.... but this is impossible because Pizarro didn't even go to the Americas until the 16th century A.D.

Although the text did not say Pizarro cultivated sunflowers, the sentence has been rephrased.  """,1

Once again, User:EconProfessor has insisted on wholesale removal of sourced content because it apparently conflicts with her opinion of Donna Hughes. EconProf summarizes the edit as follows:

A zoning battle over the CSPH immediately followed, and the zoning issues may or may not have had their own merits.

This was cut and pasted here since it applies to this article.  

Could someone please tell me where to post the information I have put in the Japanese alias article?  That wording for the notice about Wikibooks: """"Please help improve this article by removing or rewriting the how-to content, which may qualify for a move to Wikibooks."""" is confusing.  If I remove the how-to nature of this article, I can move it to Wikibooks?  I want to leave the how-to nature, and post this somewhere.  My apologies for inappropriately posting it there.  

Hi. Can you tell us which article you want to edit, and what kind of thing you want to add?  ►  

Thanks for your reply.  Sorry, I should have internal linked that.  I want to edit the article Japanese alias.  I have posted the need for sources myself.  However, the other two warnings at the top of the page, in addition to a """"This article or section is written like a personal reflection or essay and may require cleanup."""" warning appear to have come-up automatically.  I would like to resolve these issues.Cheers.  
Rewrite the article to have a more neutral tone. Phrases like """"The best way to determine an alias is to take several months..."""" read more like a how-to than an article. See WP:BETTER for more information as well.  and his otters • (Broken clamshells•Otter chirps) 

(my own opinion on this) - I hope you don't decide to take it elsewhere; it has the beginnings of a good wiki article. Don't be dismayed by the boxes at the top. Most people here want to make the encyclopedia better, and are posting their thoughts on that basis. Ok, there will always be a few that disparage anything, but...ride with it.

I am now going to read the article more fully, and post further comments when I have. I sincerely hope that will help you develop the article. I will post them in about 10 mins from now.  ►  

Thanks for your help and your encouragement.  Are those warnings appearing automatically, or is that someone's judgment?  If the latter, I would be glad to consult them for advice too.  If that is possible, please let me know how. Wiki on!  

Re. warnings, who - I'll check into them and get back to you shortly. In the meantime, here's some hastily-written scribbles;

Lead - that is, the first bit, before the 'purpose' section starts: Explain what is meant by an alias, use synonymns for 'alias', don't repeat it. Remember the 'lead' should not contain any info that is not in the body of the article - it's a summary. Which is why I suggest leaving it until last - write the whole thing, THEN make the lead to summarise the content.

The wikihelp says to use the article title in the first bit, but I have edited it some.  Thanks.  

Re. Alien ID - from a quick search, I can't find an article about alien registration cards - I'm very suprised. Maybe there is one. There should be. You shouldn't need an external link;

I think the key words here are """"claim to have been molested.""""

Rookiee's article was fact-based and properly sourced.  That Justin didn't like it when the facts weren't spun from a victimologist perspective is immaterial.

Wikipedia pretends that it's run by consensus as long as volunteers are happily creating multiple millions of dollars in free intellectual property for Jimbo.

Repeating a false claim thousands of times does not make it correct, but Debian just uses copies of their false claims to """"proove"""" their claims. So what remains?

As near as I can tell, wikipedia has no article on """"cycle structure"""". The cycle structure of an element g of a permutation group is the multi-set of sizes of orbits of the cyclic group generated by g. This is related to the cycle decomposition of g when g only has finite orbits, which takes orbit representatives a1, a2, ... and specifies g by (a1, a1^g, a1^(g^2), ... )(a2, a2^g, ...) where each tuple has no duplicate entries.

Indeed numerous Iranian media pointed that out right away.  That is why I support the idea of including """"Jewish"""" at the beginning of that sub-section of the article.  It is not to """"single out"""" Pilz because he is jewish per se, it is because both Iranian media as well as officials from Foreign Ministry have called it a part of the on-going Zionst smear campaign against Iran.   Pilz' """"early anouncements"""",  had claimed that both final candidates of the Iranian presidency were mentioned in his """"extraordinarily reliable Agent D"""" report.  So no matter which candidate won, he would have smeared the winner.   He had anticipiated that Rajsanjani wins (like most people expected) so he had initially put the focus more on Rafsanjani.  As an Iranian, I also feel this is coordinated. It is indeed hard to explain how the major Western media would be so quick to report all those allegatoins (which so far have turned out to be false) without even a cursory investigation. How could for example, AP, Reuters and AFP all three make the same mistake at the same time? And it wasn't even on just one allegation, it was on multiple.  So multiple News Agencies, making multiple mistakes that a pro would hardly ever do, all at the same time?  And I have seen a pattern like this for years on numerous other anti-Iran smear reports.  Also, you might notice how so many people involved in this very article are Jews or at least their edit history clearly shows their pro-Zionist stance.  I don't think that is accidental either, they are voluntary """"contributors"""" to the same  smear campaign because they view Islamic Iran as a threat to Zionism.

The rotation axis is passing through the system’s center of the mass. The system is considered in equilibrium, so the centrifugal force equalizes the attraction one;
-TABthe two material points HAVE THE IMPULSE VARIABLE, even though the movement can continue non stop due to the conservation of the kinetic moment of the system, so due to the inertness; 
-TABThe same, we can imagine a system made from two parts „bound” through something that allows them to have THE KINETIC MOMENT VARIABLE, but the volumic impulse constant. SUCH A SYSTEM IS THE EARTH! It is formed from two parts (the earth shell and its nucleus) „bound” through a field (magnetically)!

"Sinhalese Nagas 
It is very much founding fact that Sinhalese were unification of hela groups and sinha. Also it is very much famous fact that there were 4 hela groups in the island. Origins of the Hela Race. Hela was combination of Raksha, Yaksha, Deva, Naga. 

Raksha were extreamly powerful in the history but may be lost power due to battles,.. At the time of start writing the history, Raksha and Deva wasn't powerful. Naga was the most powerful authorities. That time only they had kingdoms. It is evident that they ruled two kingdoms Kelaniya and Jaffna. Others lived as small groups ( kuveni's story). 

Rajarata area was ruled by Yakshas before Vijaya. After 2,3 generations from Pandukabhaya, kings tend to suffix 'Tissa' and 'Naga' to their names. Tissa name is comes from Sinha tribe. There is no reason they added Naga to their names other than representing Naga tribe. This says later Naga royal families in one of the 2 kingdoms ( most probably Nagadeepa) made connections to the royal family in Rajarata. Nagas came to Anuradhapura and joined the Sinhas and Yakshas and actually able to dominate over others. So kingdom of Nagadeepa was lost from the history and Rajarata was trying to gain Naga/Sinha identity in which there had been a Yaksha rule. But kelaniya was there and ruled as maya rata.  

It is also very much evident Naga were the dominant tribe withing the core of the kingdom to protect their king. Those days without having clear power king can't survive. Yaksha's had clear control of Rajarata during the period of Pandukabhaya. But later Naga influence of the kingdom started to growth due to connection between royal families. Since conflicts between tribes hasn't been ended, Naga/Sinha king wasn't be a fool to rule middle of Yaksha on those days. Also we can see there is a clear discrimination against yakshas and had introduced a superiority on Nagas defining solosmasthana. Also some Yakshas leave the Rajarata and come other areas. Ritigal Jayasena was one of them.

So Nagas dominated over Rajarata and Maya rata but still others may had the control in Malaya rata and Ruhuna. SL was unified on tribe basis. After SL was converted to buddhism it wasn't required to unify tribes which based on religion. Since Ruhuna also accepted Buddhism (due to fear for Asoka) Rajarata king could made his brother ( MahaNaga) as the king of Ruhuna without considerable resistance. So it is very much evident that Sinhalese mainly consist of Nagas.",0

"""==Why I don't edit often anymore==

Back in the day I used to edit wikipedia on a fairly regular basis. One of the pages I edited was the eXile. One detractor of the eXile, Peter Ekman, was so pathologically obsessed with discrediting the periodical, that he would devote weeks at a time to blanking and otherwise vandalizing the eXile article while launching reckless accusations at everyone who """"defended"""" the eXile. Although many editors did our best to contain Mr. Ekman, eventually he wore me down. It just wasn't worth it spending my free time containing the vendetta of some aggrieved middle-aged jerk.

As a parting bow in my too-long Ekman drama, I wanted to post here a summary about Mr. Ekman's character and the original wiki text that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade.

About Peter Ekman

Peter Ekman is the aforementioned hack journalist who crusaded against the eXile. But once upon a time Ekman actually had an impressive sounding job working as an editor for the Moscow Times and dispensing right-wing platitudes in the heart of the former communist empire. Moscow in the 90s was a place where failures didn't fail. And for a long time Ekman didn't fail, despite his total lack of social graces and limited intelligence. Eventually his columns attracted the ire of the fellow Moscow publication, the eXile.

Originally the eXile was planning only on criticizing Ekman's written work, but Ekman's response was righteous, menacing, and hinted at violence. So the eXile's added a personal detail: they included the account of a female employee who had been subjected to unwelcome sexual advances by Mr. Ekman. Mr. Ekman had groped the employee while inviting her to a weekend get-away while his Russian Bride was out of town. Ekman responded with the same witless ape-shit animosity that I have since personally witnessed many times on wikipedia. Ekman attempted to get the eXile banned from Johnson's Reading List by declaring the eXile was a fascist, neo-nazi periodical. Ekman's evidence for such nazi sympathies was a spoof fashion piece entitled """"The eXile's Third Reich Uniform of the Week,"""" in which a fictional gay fashion designer breathlessly reviewed the 1938 version of the Nazi Field Bishop uniform.

Eventually Ekman lost his position at the Moscow Times. Since then he's occasionally surfaced as a professor of finance at various 3rd rate universities and, of course, here on Wikipedia.

The following is an excerpt from the Wikipedia Article on the eXile that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade:

Peter Ekman, Johnson's Russia List, and an Unsubtantiated Groping Allegation
In November 2000, in Issue #23 of The eXile, Matt Taibbi published a press review entitled Peter Ekman Groped Me.  The article ridiculed Ekman, then newly appointed editor of The Moscow Times, for his approach to the economic and political development of Russia.  Taibbi characterized this approach as high-handed, condescending, and arrogant, and went on to mock Ekman personally as a pompous hypocrite: """"Ekman has only one idea (""""Russia has a lot to learn from America""""), which he tries endlessly to sell and resell as a varied package of ribald wit and insight.""""  The article also ridiculed Ekman for describing himself as a """"financial educator,"""" and described him as having """"a head seemingly worn bald from improper use.""""  As a finishing touch, Taibbi recounted an as-yet unverified account of sexual advances made by Ekman to an eXile employee, made at late at night at the Garazh nightclub in Moscow during a visit from Ekman's mother-in-law.

Ekman responded by writing in to Johnson's Russia List to claim that """"the eXile is fascist and racist,""""  that """"every eXile issue contains unverifiable stories that smear someone's reputation,"""" that The eXile """"is associated with the fascist party of Eduard Limonov."""" The accusations of fascism were discounted by many in part because of the eXile's Jewish roots - Ames, along with the eXile's publisher, deputy editor and several contributors are all Jews - and because of the paper's satirical editorial bent. It remains unclear as to whether Ekman did in fact make advances toward an eXile employee, or who that employee may have been.

I'm not proposing a total rewrite, just to condense the main points so you don't have to remove that one paragraph in its entirety. I'm proposing Ling.Nut-Lite. I just don't think removing that whole paragraph is the best solution. I want to condense it to just the main points, leaving certain details for further discussion in the body. Here's what I propose so far:

The Six Day War or June War..., also known as the 1967 Arab-Israeli war or the Third Arab-Israeli War, was fought between 5 June and 10 June, 1967 by Israel and the neighboring states of Egypt [then the United Arab Republic, UAR], Jordan, and Syria. At the war's end, Israel had seized the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.

After the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egypt agreed to the stationing of a United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) in the Sinai to ensure compliance with the armistice agreement and prevent raids across the border . On 4 November 1966, Syria signed a mutual defense agreement with Egypt. Nine days later, Israel attacked the city of as-Samu in the Jordanian occupied West Bank in response to raids from the fedayeen group Fatah. King Hussein of Jordan criticized President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt for failing to come to Jordan's aid and """"hiding behind UNEF skirts"""" [I checked Oren p. 135 and there's no mention of this on that page; please help double check source and find reference - possible later printing is different, I have 2003 first edition].

On 14 May 1967, Nasser began sending Egyptian forces into the Sinai Peninsula. Two days later he requested and obtained the withdrawal of UNEF from Egyptian territory. Israel rejected a proposal to restation UNEF on its side of the border. Egyptian forces replaced UNEF positions at Sharm el-Sheikh in the southern Sinai overlooking the Straits of Tiran. Between 18 and 20 May Israel reiterated declarations made in 1957 that any closure of the Straits would be considered as a cassus belli, or justification for war. Nasser declared the Straits closed to Israeli shipping on 22-23 May. On 1 June, Israel formed a National Unity Government by widening its cabinet, and on 4 June the decision was made to go to war. The next morning, Israel launched Operation Focus, a large-scale surprise air strike that was the opening of the Six Day War.

I think following this, since the lede really only mentions the war between Israel and Egypt, there should be a brief discussion of the Jordan and Syria fronts, as well. With this slimmer version, it should be possible to fit that in, at least briefly. Let me know what you think.   """,0

Better to continue the discussion here, I think.

The ANI, in which we both participated, was closed out in June or so with no action, based on her assurances that she understood the nature of the problems she'd occasioned, and a promise to try to stop.  You'll recall that she had been removing references from articles to non-Christian religions and thought, sexual orientation, and sex generally, among other things; and while I was the one to raise this initially at ANI, it is certainly fair to say that I was not the only one to be troubled by these edits.

As the matter wrapped up, I was skeptical that she appreciated the problem (she described it along the lines of """"offending one or two users"""") or that she'd actually quit the problematic editing, but after being characterized as """"overzealous"""" on the point, I withdrew.

She has slowed, but certainly not quit, her POV editing.  A partial list of such edits since then includes:

July 9
At Christianity, without explanation, she recast the “Criticism and apologetics” section as “Arguments and apologetics”, and removed sourced critical commentary by Nietzsche, Bertrand Russell and current Jewish and Muslim theologians, as well as a (sourced) observation by an atheist that some Bible stories may be based on myth.

July 30
At Trois-Rivières, removed without explanation the identification of a (Canadian) Liberal Party politician as “liberal”, as well as a reference to another person’s being the first Jew elected to public office in the British Empire

August 15
She erased, without comment, mention of Hugh Hefner’s attendance at the Art Institute of Chicago.

August 18
She removed proper and wikilinked mention of a notable alum who is best known (and described as) an LGBT activist.

October 15
At Ted Turner, she removed a reliably-sourced quote from Turner declaring himself to be agnostic, claiming it was “contradicted” by info elsewhere in article, when the excised information was more recent than the “contradictory” text and, indeed, nicely illustrated the point (in the source itself), which is that Turner has waffled on the issue over the years.

Here too I am not the only editor to remain concerned - see this Talk page entry from September.

I agree that the """"party school"""" edit to the University of Wisconsin is, in the larger picture, kind of a silly thing; but between her registered account and the IP she sometimes edits from, she has made the same edit at least four times now - see May 15, June 13, October 3 in addition to today's.  And to be clear, she's not removing the """"party school"""" material but just the (perfectly good) citation to Playboy.  Indeed in her October 3 entry, she updated the """"party school"""" rankings to 2015 and went out and found a different source to insert in Playboy's stead.

So I take your point, that maybe this particular edit is a trivial thing to template her on; but she has continued her practice (albeit slowed) of idiosyncratic, unexplained or deceptively described removal of content for reasons that can only be explained as in furtherance of a personal point of view.  I don't think that such editing should pass without at least occasional comment, and that's what I did.    """,0

 This is often problematic. I've read these guidelines carefully several times, and there is a specific reference to the name """"Williams"""" in the second one, but it's not a hard-and-fast rule, just a description of customary usage.

Basic rule (singular nouns)

Singular nouns ending with an """"s"""" or """"z"""" sound. See the second paragraph after the two bulleted items for specific discussion of the name Williams. Would you say """"Williams' wife"""" or """"Williams's wife"""", with the second one pronounced """"Williamses wife""""? I don't know which one I would say; I've never known anyone with that last name. There is a small consideration: that """"Williams' wife"""" sounds the same as """"William's wife"""", with the second example being a man whose first name is William, but I don't know if that's a problem, especially in an article where it is clear that it is the man's last name. With """"Williams's wife"""", it is clear beyond a doubt that his last name is """"Williams"""". What do you think?   """,0

Edit that Sparked Controversy

There is no consensus for a reverted edit that I made in this article (hereafter the “reverted edit”).  Therefore, I have not changed this article unilaterally back to my previous version, because that would be against consensus.

This reverted edit was reverted by KillerChihuahua (KC) who not only disagreed with it, but also said (in her edit summary) that the edit was disruptive.  I disagree with KC that the edit should have been reverted, for reasons already explained above.  I also disagree with KC that this edit was disruptive, and I will now fully and carefully explain why, for the record. This edit that KC reverted was clearly not redundant to any previous edits made anywhere else at Wikipedia, and thus this edit was not made by me in bad faith as part of any disruptive “edit war”.

This discussion of RCOG’s position on “choice” started at the article on fetal pain, and I moved it here for valid reasons.  At the fetal pain article, KC wrote: """"Please provide a source that this government institution is 'pro-choice' - abortion is legal in the UK, and that the official govt. chartered college are to make that safe is NOT pro choice.""""   I therefore investigated and learned that RCOG is not a government institution, that most of their members live outside the UK, that its governing documents do not specifically limit its activities, that many of its members do not have medical degrees, et cetera.  So, I concluded that the best place to deal with all of this would be here at the article on the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  Here at the RCOG article, I added quite a bit of info,    in addition to RCOG’s abortion stance. When I was at the fetal pain article and decided to move to this RCOG article, I repeatedly said so in the fetal pain discussion.   I did not sneak over here to try to avoid objections at the fetal pain article.

KC has elsewhere cited five diffs that she says prove this controversial edit was virtually the same as several contested assertions I had made previously. Here are KC’s five diffs: (1) in the fetal pain article, (2) in the fetal pain article, (3) in this RCOG article, (4) in this RCOG article, and (5) in this RCOG article.

None of these five previous edits cited by KC is the same (or virtually the same) as the reverted edit that sparked this controversy.  Both KC’s diff (1) and diff (2) show where I inserted a cite to support another editor’s assertion that RCOG is a “pro-choice group”.  KC pointed out very clearly at the fetal pain article that she did not think RCOG was a “pro-choice group” even though she thought RCOG could have a “pro-choice position” on particular issues:

There is no uncertainty or ambiguity that KC argued RCOG may have a pro-choice",0
"PROBLEMS ON KURDISH ARTICLES

First of all the Kurdish flag is allowed in Iran, but is not sanctioned publicly. Kurds have it in their homes and are allowed to have them. It is certainly not criminal in Iran for Kurds to have the Kurdish flag or symbol as many of my friends do. So edit your statement about it being criminal in Iran. Need I remind you all, that Kurds are ethnic Iranians and have historically enjoyed the greatest liberties in Iran as opposed to the mainstream discrimination Kurds face in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey?  
It is usually Israeli sources, with increasing American and British help and aid, that intentionally falsely claim that the Kurdish flag (which fly the Pan-Iranian colours as does the unofficial flag of the Azerbaijani people and the flag of Tajikistan) is prohibited in Iran. FLYING THE KURDISH FLAG IN IRAN IS NOT CRIMINAL AS MENTION IN ISRAELI SOURCES. 

Furthermore, I go on to read that there was research done that basically proves Kurds and Jews are genetically the same. It seems to me that certain individuals who I can see are Israeli are following the Israeli states policy of editing articles in lines with current events in the Middle East. Kurds are Iranians just as how Russians, Serbs, Poles, and Bulgarians are all Slavic peoples. Israel, the USA, and Britain are trying to create conflict in Iran as was done in the former Yugoslavia by creating problems along ethnic lines. This is called ‘balkanisation.’ The Israelis are doing this covertly through operations in Iraqi Kurdistan.

Propaganda for dividing and conquering people starts with definitions then the manipulation of history. I am an academic in the fields of anthropology and history and an Iranian from a minority group that is neither Persian nor Kurdish. I can tell you that Kurds are definitely ethnic Iranians in all senses from tradition to language, history, culture, identity, and genetics. I am alarmed by the current purging of internet articles that have hidden agendas trying to separate the Iranian identity of Kurds. 

As I was told by a Kurdish professor, Mr. Eskandari in Tehran: “Kurds are Iranian and the entity of Iran as a state and nation was founded by the [main] ancestors of the Kurds, the Mede who established Iran as an empire. One problem that has compounded the issue is that people misuse the term Persian and Iranian. Persians are Iranian, but all Iranians, like the Kurds and Ossetians, are not Persians.”

The Mede and other similar Iranian groups are the ancestors of the Kurds, but not the only just like the ancient Persians are the main ancestors of the modern Persians, but not the only ancestors. 

I ask all the honest people on this site who wish to enhance knowledge not to take part in this fabrication of fact. There was a time when the Turkish government tried to convince Kurds that they were “Mountain Turks” and now there are powers at play that are either trying to disassociate the Kurds from their Iranian identity and origins or make whole generations of proud young Kurds forget or be unaware of their Iranian ethnicity. This is due to geo-strategic schemes. These forces are trying to victimize a whole group of people from knowing their own proud history and culture which is genuinely Iranian.

Speedy deletion of Dorado Asset Management
 A tag has been placed on Dorado Asset Management, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

Albania Veneta

Dear Jimbo, 

I appreciate very much what you are doing with your Wikipedia. It is a great gift to all of us. But there are some """"points"""" that need to be improved, as you know. 

One is the presence of nationalistic groups that in a coordinate way want to impose their points of view without regard of what write serious historians. They usually proceed to ask for help from """"friendly to them"""" administrators and so obtain what they want. In Eastern Europe there are many of these groups (mainly ex-communists) and often are associated with hackers. 

What do we have to do with these nationalistic groups? In my case I can pinpoint what is going on with the articles """"Albania Veneta"""", """"Zadar"""", """"Istrian exodus"""", etc., where a group of known nationalistic fanatics (like one nicknamed in the english wikipedia as """"Direktor"""") are erasing and damaging what write others with serious and proven references. They use the typical misinformation with """"political pressure"""" of the Soviets in Eastern Europe. 

May be you have a serious and impartial administrator, who can help? 
Regards. 

This seems to be a dispute about naming conventions and reliable sources. Naming convention disputes should be solved by determining the names most often used by English speakers and using them without regard to ethnic sympathies. Disputes concerning reliable sources should be raised on WP:RSN. When different reliable sources disagree, they should both be represented in the article with a description of the differences in order to satisfy WP:NPOV. It seems likely that both sides of this dispute have relatively equally reliably sources which conflict.  Welcome to the Balkans. ←BenB4 """,0
"Kyiv 

Dear Mr McLaughlin,

With regards to your persistent efforts of keeping the old spelling of the capital of Ukraine. For your information:

 It is spelled as Kyiv in English language because:
 1) Ukrainian government insists on Kyiv spelling
 2) The State Department of the U.S. issued a directive to write Kyiv
 3) The Prime Minister of the U.K. calls the city Kyiv - http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20199
 4) United Nations Multilingual Terminology Database (the ultimate body on geographical names) approved it as Kyiv - http://unterm.un.org/dgaacs/unterm.nsf/WebView/B57BF6AB5F06749B85256DC700440AAD?OpenDocument
 5) Major English speaking governments worldwide switched to Kyiv spelling
 6) CIA refers to the city as Kyiv - https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/up.html
 7) The name of the famous football club is Dynamo Kyiv (recognised worldwide)
 8) Many papers, e.g., British The Guardian, are already writing Kyiv
 9) All major Canadian media already use the spelling of Kyiv
 10) and many more reasons and references on http://kyiv.of-cour.se/

If we only listen to your arguments, we would be also correcting Almaty to Alma-Ata. However, it is Almaty and Kyiv it is of course. Above you have had enough of proofs and strong arguments of usage of the name Kyiv in the modern English language, so it is time to catch up and finally fix the name to Kyiv.

Thank you. (  )",0

"THere you go again.  Posting my name and personal info even after buckets suggested you stop.  It's not weird or strange. Please stop your slander and harrassment and your insistence on defaming me my project and my intent on wiki, 

btw. I was out of town and just noticed yesterday your comments while I was away, and am now responding to your posts.

Here's the full version:
Stop whining, get the fuck out of my life, my business and my art!
I don't have time for your shit, your games and your harrassment.  I have asked you nicely several time to stop fucking with me, and now it is to the point of really pissing me off.
 
I have repeatedly asked this guy to stop referring to my name, project name in any regard, and have yet again edited his comments that refer specifically to me. I have the right create on my user page in a form of computer/new media art, to comment in whatever language or form I feel free to express in. I have done nothing to the above but request that he not mention my personal info. in his posts, but he insists on continuing this bullshit. I am not editing anonymously as there is no secret as to who I am. Yes, I attempted to expunge my earlier username and still prefer to, but this fucker keeps harassing me and insists on mentioning my name, project and username , all of which refer to personal and private info., and ultimately have turned to slander and libel, after repeated requests for him to stop. My use of language is free speech, I am an atheist, though spiritual I think god is the santa of adults, I don't think fuck is a bad word, nor nigger or white nigger dependent upon use ( see chris rock or george carlin) I was a white nigger for the 6 years that I traveled and painted my way across asia, and it was good. I don't give a shit what a conservative little twat thinks of me or my work, my use or words, symbols and expressions. I have no issue over a few teenagers blacklisting one of my works of art from wikipedia. I do have an issue with the manner by which it was done, the red-neck good 'ol boy behavior of their klan, the hypocrisy of their actions and continued actions. There is no reason for you to delete my use of combined words and symbols, and no reason not to expunge as requested. btw...on the advice of buckets, see comments, I attempted to drop first username and logged in a new one, but these gays kept referring to and using earlier name...so I am responding to discussions that refer to both until this is resolved. As posted by buckets, this is the principle upon which my requests to expunge and remain anonymouys are supported.

Wikipedia operates on the principle that every contributor has a right if they wish to remain completely anonymous. Wikipedia policy on that issue is strictly enforced. Posting private information about a user, specifically their (alleged) name and/or personal details, is strictly prohibited as harassment, and users who do that are often immediately blocked from editing Wikipedia.

Such posting can cause offence or embarrassment to the victim of the posting, not least because it means that their name, and any personal criticism or allegations made against them can then appear on web searches. If you have posted such information, please remove it immediately. Please then follow the link to this page and inform people there that the information was posted (but crucially, do not repost it on that page). An admin or developer can then remove the information from the archives of Wikipedia.

If you do not ensure that personal information you posted is removed from this site you may be blocked from editing this site. REMEMBER: Wikipedia's privacy policy is there to protect the privacy of every user, including you.

Wow, you're hopeless.  Lets start with the trifles; you spelled """"necessarily"""" wrong.  That doesn't give you much credibility.  The answer to your first question is no, whites from Liverpool speak Scouse, and they don't speak the same as whites from South London, of course, but I don't see what that has to do with White South African English.  However, the answer to your second question is mostly yes.  Most blacks from Boston do sound pretty much the same as blacks from New Orleans.  Most blacks from both areas speak what's called African American Vernacular English (of you're into political correctness, which you seem to be), which is an ethnolect and a sociolect that is becoming more and more different from the speech of whites in America.  I'm not exactly sure what you mean by """"Mother Tongue English speakers"""".  Do you mean L1 varieties?  
I don't think my final statement is a violation of WP:OWN because I never said I own this article, nor did I ever think that.  I simply temporarily """"took it over"""", if you will, to make it a better description of White South African English.  Those just happened to be the words I decided to use.  It says at the top of this article that the article was in need of attention by an expert on this subject, and while I am no expert, I certainly seem to be the closest thing to it that this article has ever seen (with the notable exception of JackLumber).  I think you knew what I meant by that expression, but it's certainly possible that you didn't.
Finally, I will respond to your earlier comment that """"White South African English"""" as a title for this article is """"simply racist"""".  You really haven't explained to me how that would be a racist title.  I'm going to assume that you meant either: 1.) That title would suggest that only whites in South Africa speak English and absolutely no one else does. 2.) That title would suggest that whites are the most important group in South Africa, they're are better than everyone else, and they are thus the only group in South Africa deserving an article on the type of English they speak.  Both of these choices seem rather absurd to me.  If you thought 1.), then I already proposed a solution for that.  We could give each Indian South African English, Black South African English, and White South African English its own article to show that there are indeed other dialects of English spoken in South Africa besides WSAfE.  If you thought 2.), then you are racist.  Let me explain.  For that title to be racist I would have to be white.  If I were a racist white person I would want that to be the title of the article to show that whites are better and that the way they speak is better.  Since we are both anonymous, however, there is no way you could possibly know my race.  You would have to rely on conjecture.  In this case, your guess was that I was white.  After all, if I were black and I proposed that, I would have to somehow be racist against myself.  What I don't understand for sure is why you assumed I was white.  That's quite a racist assumption.  Anyone in the world can edit Wikipedia; people from all races.  Yet you assumed I was white.  Unless you had statistics to back that assumption up, which you didn't, then that's """"simply racist"""".  Even if you did have statistics to back it up, it still could be racist.  To me, what you're saying is that only white people edit Wikipedia, and that people of other races aren't intelligent enough.  Of course, I don't for sure, but that's my conjecture.   """,0

 Help sought! 

Hi there, been going through some rough phase of a wiki career. So a bit of guidance from you, on the following would be of help. I have a lingering doubt, and I wish to be clear before I resume editing in case to avoid further disputes. Is it acceptable to cite references of a different language into En.Wiki? (I find it hard to get them;the reliable references in English for some articles)

Also when can we have videos into an article? And does it matter from which site we take them from? For instance, I intended to add these youtube links as means of external links(directing to the respective speeches), but in the end I figure I had done something I had not supposed to. It would help if you could clarify regarding both. I find Referencing kind of not uniform across wikipedia, almost 70-80% of the BLPs are poorly sourced, but yet I find it amusing to get involved in such disputes.  (talk . contr . mail) """,0

Sci-fi
Where are Star Wars Episodes IV and V and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, both are much better films than E.T.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.68.124.228   

Which had the biggest budget?  Which spent the most on advertising?  Which generated the most box office receipts?  Of course, all of these variables are interrelated, and there is no practical way of isolating one variable without compromising the others.   If we ignored technological differences, Robinson Crusoe on Mars, Fantastic Planet, Forbidden Planet, The Time Machine (1960 film), and When Worlds Collide are all up in the running.     

King Kong?
Why was King Kong remove on the list? It had a sorce and everything! 71.178.250.89  
I removed it because it did not have a citation specifically mentioning it as being """"the best"""" of the genre.  Being one of 100 films on Time's list is only a citation for being """"one of the the 100 best films according to Time"""", nothing more.  It seems unreasonable to imply that because there is only one film of a particular genre on a """"best film"""" list, the mention equals a citation for being the best of the genre.  That would be original research because the film may have been selected for reasons that have nothing to do with being the best of the genre.  ☑ uelWantman 

Request to delete this page.
While I don't disagree with the fact that you can at least narrow down several films which many consider great, this page is misleading. What purpose does it serve? The movies it lists are extremely inconsistent, and this page changes all the time. People will like what they like, and I think it is unfair that wikipedia, a generally factual resource, includes such a subjective topic as this and other polls. I also think that we should delete links to reviews for films and music. What other refutable encyclopedia does this? You cannot systematically grade personal taste.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 66.159.181.59   

The point of the page is to list those films that have been previously recognized by a variety of critics and organization.  The opinions of these films are not of Wikipedia users, but of a variety of organizations.   

Regardless of the notoriety of the sources, they don't constitute an article.  The citations are to sources of opinion which should, in my opinion, be added to the articles of their respective films. 'Talktome 

I believe that the page should be deleted, Its very opinionated (yes i know its all sourced from other people) but still who has the deciding line on what the greatest film, there are many variants. This sort of page is suited to someones' blog, not a Wikipedia article. Its a fine line to what should be on Wikipedia but this i think should be deleted.   

Although this page somewhat irks me, I believe it would most likely make it through a deletion proposal with a Keep decision.  The article is technically 100% factual in that it is stating, """"so and so thinks this movie is the greatest.""""  Personally, I think that this sort of information on critic and audience opinions should be reserved for the individual entries for the films, and that an attempt to build a list such as this is inherently flawed.  Specifically, my problem is that the personal opinions of Wikipedians are bound to show up in this article in that, in many cases, I believe that with enough searching you could find somebody's'' list that has your favorite movie on top.  Of course, the failsafe against this is that editors must decide whether or not that """"somebody"""" is a notable c",0

That doesn't make his claims true, but the claims themselves are plausible as claims, and as claims they are reported in legitimate secondary sources. I think it is clear that Mr Langan is, as you put it succinctly, frickin' smart. That is the real point of the IQ claims, and it is the basis of the interest in Mr Langan, since people are interested in the limits of how frickin' smart people can be.

"""== 11 September attacks ==
 Please stop. If you continue to delete or edit legitimate talk page comments, as you did at Talk:September 11, 2001 attacks, you will be blocked for vandalism.  You may change your own comments, but stop removing the comments of others. Thanks!  

Hello,

What comment are you refering to?

Well... a bunch of them. For instance:

You do understand that Wikipedia has thousands of articles about highly controversial topics? That's not a sufficient reason for deletion. (talk) 

That one is removed, 

(edit conflict, but pretty much agrees with above) The fourth reference is known as a secondary source, which is the kind of sources that wikipedia tries to cite. We take as little as possible from primary sources, and instead use secondary sources, verifiable secondary sources in fact. Google video is not a secondary source, nor is it a verifiable source, so any evidence gleaned from people's postings there is not permissible as evidence. Unless you can find any verifiable evidence that supports your reasoning, I'm gonna call on Occam's razor and say that the more simple explanation that fits the facts is true. Please stop trolling this page unless you have cold, hard, verifiable facts that support your thesis, as any further rants will be removed as trolling. Thank you.  

That one is modified,

This is trolling. Can we please close this, since it is obvious that Gaby de wilde is either unintrested in accepting that the majority don't buy his/her conspiricy theory, or he/she is trolling. Either way, this is pointless. If he/she thinks this page has any hope of being deleted... I must provide a phone number to a local mental hospital.  

That one is removed, and there are a bunch of others. So when you compress your own comments, please don't remove or change other people's, ok?  

And how is this a valid reason to delete my post? 

I honestly ask you: Did you even read it before you hit delete?  I removed some postings that contained only accusations of trolling. Everything I wrote so far in wikipedia has been deleted!

THANK YOU EVERYONE!

So far I have not figured out what to do about this. If you read the post you  deleted then you would know there is no link between Osama and 911.

Which means Officially there are no Muslim terrorists.

I'm not going to edit one more letter you see. I've been reverted into nothing more then enough now. All I want to know now is why you insist upon having lies like that on the wikipedia page.

You like the news media quoted as an authority over the FBI right?

At least share me your thoughts on the topic.

That's all I asked.

As you've deleted the option for everyone else to comment on my words you should at least answer the question yourself?

Or explain why it's unreasonable to ask?

Thanks.....( )

Hope the picture is clearer: This page (currently) focuses primarily on slave practices in Africa prior to the Islamic and Atlantic slave trades and then with a brief section on how those practices in Africa were transformed by the slave trades.  Connected to this page are Arab slave trade, Atlantic slave trade both of which are pretty good (although I prefer Islamic slave trade).  Less good are African slave trade and Slavery in modern Africa.  The first is an invention, there's no books about the """"African slave trade"""" (Davidson's book of that title is about the """"Atlantic Slave Trade"""") and probably a POV title. This is not to deny an """"indigenous"""" practice or trade in slaves for much of history; but simply that the focus on """"African slave trade"""" is prominent on wikipedia but not in the major books on the topic. Much of its content has long standing tags, some very problematic sources, and POV writing style.  The page could persist but only as a short exploration of the participation of Africans on inland trade of slaves and slave raiding.  The Slavery in modern Africa seems to have a good structure and some good portions, but needs some heft and a title change.  In terms of content overlap, there is some significant content overlap between """"African slave trade"""" with both """"Slavery in Africa"""" and """"Atlantic slave trade"""" (largely because African slave trade is a problematic title and because it analytically wandered).  Most of the other pages refer to each other, but content does not appear to overlap. Idea for reorganization (I'll expand this to more editors, but want to see if anyone has any ideas here first): 1. African slave trade page gets merged into """"Slavery in Africa"""" or other pages as appropriate. 2. Slavery in modern Africa gets changed name to Slavery in contemporary Africa, as more appropriate. 3. Slavery in Africa page largely eludes to slave trades without devoting significant section to the topic, that stays with the slave trade pages themselves. 4. A new article on """"Emancipation movements in Africa"""" or something needs to be created. It is a major topic which is covered as much as the slave trades were ended, but then glossed over entirely by other pages. Any thoughts on this organization?   """,0

 Hi Nabeelsahab, thanks for the note. There are a number of problems with your edit on Zad al-Ma'ad. Firstly, the content you added seems to have been copied and pasted from http://www.kalamullah.com/zaad-al-maad.html. The text is therefore copyrighted material and should be removed. Please see Wikipedia:Copy-paste.

Secondly, Wikipedia articles are required to present a neutral point of view based on reliable secondary sources. Websites such as kalamullah.com are not considered reliable due to there polemic and sectarian nature. Neutral sources include media agencies such as the BBC or academic sources. Please read WP:RS. There are a number of academic sources on Ibn Qayyim such as the works of Livnat Holtzman and Jon Hoover which you should consider looking into that might provide reliable and accurate information about Zad al-Ma'ad.

Thirdly, the language of the article needs to be Encyclopedic. Claims such as """"This book is one of the important resources of knowledge for those who seek to know the Seerah.."""" seems to be an example of puffery. Please read  WP:PUFF.

Fourthly, adding statements such as """"Available from Australian Islamic Library website"""" seems to be a clear case of WP:PROMOTION. Zad al-Ma'ad is available in a whole series of websites such as http://d1.islamhouse.com/data/en/ih_books/single/en_Complete_Zaad_al_Maad.pdf, http://idci.co.uk/Provisions-For-The-Hereafter-Mukhtasar-Zad-Al-maad-699-d etc.... so there is no need to specify the Australian Islamic Library in particular.

 Background section 

At the present time, the """"background"""" section cites unspecified interviews with the media, according to which, Ahmed claimed to """"take apart a clock and rebuild it inside a pencil case.""""

The sentence is taken verbatim from the NPR article. However, it links to a Dallas News article, which says no such thing, to a Dallas News interview, which also does not contain this statement, and mentions a WFAA interview, which I've been unable to find. I've checked four different interviews with Ahmed and he does not explicitly describe it as a rebuilt clock in any of them.

If such an interview exists and the statement was not an interpolation by NPR, it would be nice to have a direct link, a quote and a date.

The problem with the statement is that it provides inadequate background for the rest of the article. When the story broke on 9/15, the device was consistently described by the media as """"a homemade clock"""" or """"an invention"""".  The fact that it was a reassembled commercial clock was mentioned in passing by a WFAA article (which quoted Irving police) on 9/16 but otherwise mostly ignored. It only went """"viral"""", so to speak, when Dawkins waded into the controversy on 9/20 and his comments got picked up by the conservative media.

Much of the immediate reaction, from Obama's tweet and Zuckerberg's invitation to Dawkins' lashing out, seems inexplicable if the device in question was acknowledged to be a rebuilt commercial clock from day 1, but makes sense if the device was initially assumed by everyone to be a genuine homemade clock.

"""==Some tips to help you out!==
Hi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o)

First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, starting with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to be written.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.

Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: user:/Sandbox, that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.

For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along; I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of our best teachers ().

Here's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted inline citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work.

Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.

One last thing to keep as a motto: """"It's better to write one good, well-referenced, nicely-presented article than it is to create fifty unreferenced one-line stubs!""""  (talk …stalk!) 
How references work

 Simple references 

These require two parts;

a)
Chzz is 98 years old. """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 

He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website] 

b) A section called """"References"""" with the special code """"{{reflist}}"""";
== References ==
{{reflist}}

(an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections)

To see the result of that, please look at user:chzz/demo/simpleref. Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as user:/reftest and try it out.

 Named references 

Chzz was born in 1837. 
""""The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 
 

Chzz lives in Footown.

Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see user:chzz/demo/namedref to see the result.

 Citation templates 

You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look;

Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation
 | last = Smith
 | first = John
 | title = Olympic medal winners of the 20th century
 | publication-date = 2001
 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]
 | page = 125
 | isbn = 0-521-37169-4
}}


Please see user:chzz/demo/citeref to see the result.

To be more interesting, the article should leave out the 

accusations and stay with the facts. Here’s my suggestion for 

an outline of the article:

Sarah Palin moved to Alaska with her family in 1964, when her 

parents came to teach school.

She has lived in Skagway, Eagle River and Wasilla. She 

graduated from Wasilla High School in 1982. 

She attended the University of Idaho where she received in 1987 

a bachelor of science degree in communications-journalism. 

In 1988, she married Todd Palin who she met in high school. 

They have five children – Track, Bristol, Willow, Piper and 

Trig. Track is in the Army.

Mrs. Palin was active as a sports team mom, coaching basketball 

and volunteering on the PTA to help make her kids' public 

education better.  

She served served two terms on the Wasilla City Council and two 

terms as the Mayor of Wasilla.

She served as chair of the Alaska Conservation Commission.

On December 4, 2006, she become Alaska's first woman governor.

She came to the office of Governor promising landmark ethics 

reform.

Under her leadership, Alaska implemented the Senior Benefits 

Program to provide support for low-income older Alaskans. 

Governor Palin began a $40 billion natural gas pipeline. 

She sent a large share of oil and gasoline tax revenue directly 

back to the people of Alaska and suspended the state's fuel 

tax. 

She used her veto pen to eliminate nearly a half a billion 

dollars in """"wasteful"""" spending such as the """"Bridge to Nowhere."""" 

She sold the state's luxury jet and fired the Governor's 

personal chef and driver. 

As Governor, Palin is chair of the Interstate Oil and Gas 

Compact Commission.

She also serves as chair of the Natural Resources Committee of 

the National Governors Association.

Mrs. Palin became the Republican candidate for Vice President 

of the United States in September of 2008.

This is getting really tiresome. As I have already said many times before, no, it is frankly NOT TRUE that """"If you dedicated the amount of time to articles that you do to sniping at other editors, and based on the knowledge you claim to have, there would be some greatly improved articles."""". I estimate it would take at least 20 hours to write an article on a large operator like London Northern, using all the proper issue numbers and ISBN numbers. By contrast, I've expended at most 2 hours criticising the actions of all the people who wish to see articles like NIBS and Nu-Venture deleted because they personally don't know anything about the companies, and don't know where to look for the issue numbers/ISBN numbers. In that light, instead of whining and bitching to me, why don't you demonstrate in some way that it would actually be worth my while doing anything for Wikipedia, where articles can be deleted on a whim by people like Dave, simply because they can't find any information about them in a 5 second Google search, and don't know where to look for sources in the print media. Do you want to tell me why I, or anyone else for that matter, should be putting in several hours work into Wikipedia to write articles, when all Dave has to do is type a few words to get the very same articles deleted, and nobody will spend even a second figuring out if he's in any position to be judging them at all?

 Thanks for the snack... 

...I like to chip in sometimes with a helpful comment, but please don't take that as meaning that I totally agree with your recent stance on Wikipedia matters. Sure, there are some trigger-happy people about, and new editors should be treated with every consideration; but to me this doesn't mean we accept any self-publicity, trivia or opinionated diatribes they care to post. This is meant to be an encyclopedia, not like social media websites where they eagerly accept any & all user-generated content. So it may appear """"hostile"""" to those whose expectations are formed in using those other websites. To reduce the chances that a new user will have a bad experience, it would be better to argue for measures to let them know, before they post their contributions, that we do in fact have limits to what we accept and do demand scads of references. That, and educating new page patrollers and restricting new or clueless users from doing patrolling. Sorry, yes, limits and restrictions, and not because we're loveless police but because restrictions and limits are necessary to maintain our project as a usable, credible and valuable resource for the world's readers.

I'm archiving this section because the pettiness simply is non-productive.  Let's try to figure out something that we can do constructively with these articles.  An A7 CSD was clearly wrong, but let's face it, most of these articles deserve to die.  The question is how to handle this constructively, which is what is going on above.  Let's stop quibbling over the rules and work towards getting something constructive done.-' NO! I'm Spartacus! 

Steve, I can tell you one way which will not work for the articlesand that is to do as you have done, and deleted some of them as G4, as if the AfD had closed the way you wanted it, not as keep. And the many you deleted (as did Orderinchaos) as dg-a7, non-notable person, in total defiance of WP:CSDA7.    The closer told you the right waynominate for deletion the ones you want to, individually.   I've asked you both on your talk page to restore them.  Sarah, can you explain to them about the inadvisability of outright   defiance of Wikipedia policy?  After we get this cleanup up, I'll talk a little about proper merging/redirect. As you may guess, I shall almost certainly to revert any redirects or merges except with consensus for each article. That does not mean I might not agree to some , most, or even all of them if procedure is followed properly. '  
I would suggest that threatening the community to edit war against it when it is trying to find a solution to a problem and work through differing and even opposing points of view to mutual satisfaction, is neither a wise nor an advisable course of action. Your behaviour at the past AfD is already under scrutiny - you openly defied policy in ways I have never actually seen from an admin who managed to keep his bit thereafter. VirtualSteve and myself closed articles which had been recreated against consensus, the recent AfD offered no opinion on any individual article and was a reaction to the mass nom (which, while I supported, I did not initiate nor did I think it was the absolute best way to resolve the situation - though as it has gotten the right people talking to each other, may yet result in progress). A bit of cooperation rather than snarky threats to disrupt and offline abuse of contributors would go a long way from you, DGG. Orderinchaos 
No, but I can explain to you about the inadvisability of outright defiance of Wikipedia's policy on wheel and edit warring. The edit war policy states """"Edit warring is the confrontational, combative, non-productive use of editing and reverting to try to win, manipulate, or stall a content dispute."""" Strangely enough that sounds an awful lot like what you're threatening to do. You've certainly got a check on the """"confrontational"""", """"combative"""" and """"non-productive"""" criteria. Redirecting and merging are editorial decisions which can be performed in the usual manner and the threat to revert attempts to do so is truly stunning. As is the arrogance implicit in the statement that you'll return to lecture us poor shmoes on how to do merges and redirects the """"proper"""" way. 8| You don't have any more authority here than any one of us and your behaviour regarding this subject has been outrageous and disruptive. I haven't had anything to do with you before this so I don't know if this is an aberration or if it is how you usually behave and approach dealing with other editors and fellow admins but if it is, as emails I've received since my email to the mailing list would suggest, there are serious concerns about your behaviour that will need to be addressed. As a co- (by 5?!) Vice President of the Wikimedia NY sub-chapter you really ought to be setting a far better example and not acting like an arrogant bully-boy, standing over people who are discussing ways to resolve this, and threatening to revert good faith attempts to clean up a mess, which even you yourself have said needs to be cleaned up. You really should know better and I'm appalled by your behaviour. Sarah 
I've also received some interesting info in recent days about unrelated disputes, and have made the relevant authorities aware. The odd bit is that there isn't even a dispute here as such between the different active, editing parties here - merely differing positions on notability which can actually be negotiated. The editors who come to this as fans have said they are - 1. willing to work with us; 2. willing to help with content. In return, we as the editors who come to this from the policy issues side have said we are - 1. willing to work with them; 2. willing to help with content. Everyone acknowledges there's a problem",0

It would be difficult to classify tools based on both their intended and unintended purpose, but at the same time screw drivers are very frequently misused to pry open containers of paint.
I haven't found any source classifying (or even defining well enough to make a category) tools either. I think we might be best off creating our own definitionnot in the sense of original research, but purely for the purpose of better organizing the encyclopedia. Here's a thought (just a rudimentary idea): let's say there are passive and active tools. Passive tools create no tangible effectthese are measuring devices, ladders, flashlights, stools, clamps (unless they are used for crushing), jacks, beakers, tape recorders(?). Active tools have a tangible effect: drills, pencils, hammers, nail clippers, spatulas, shovels. In general tools act on a material (although not necessarily a specific material, like a flashlight will act on most things): pencils act on paper, egg beaters act on eggs, saws on wood or metal, caulk guns on caulk, paint brushes on paint, beakers on chemicals. So consider a container of correction fluid: the little brush on the inside of the lid is the active tool, the container is the passive tool and the whiteout is the material. These are just some philosophical thoughts I worked and might give us somewhere to start.   01:14, 8",0

""""I think we probably share the view that the 'energy comparison' section is poorly written and sourced."""" - we can agree on that, but i would make the point that we should make the best of what we have until better information/models become available.

""""my problem with the AGA document is that it's very misleading and should not be included for that reason""""  - my answer is that the document does not really contain errors but contains some spin as you would expect from the manufacture however the spin is obvious and most people would be able to extract useful information from it despite its flaws. I would argue that reference 3 is also misleading as the data models presented there are to simplistic and will mislead people so using you own argument if you exclude reference 5 then you should also exclude reference 3. Energy models are inherently complex beasts and very simple representations such as 3 contribute nothing but confusion to the debate.

""""Your complaint about a supposed 'Green rant' indicates that you do not have a neutral view"""" - you are reading to much into that comment. Its a response to the fact that the media that I read seems to be full of half baked green ideas which don't add up either from a technical or a mathematical point of view. As a trained engineer I am only interested in arguments that make sense from a technical view not fantasy land arguments that seem to require 1+1 to = something other than 2!

If you read the comment is fee website where Monobiot writes you will see something like 5 to 7 pages of comment on his article almost all critical about his article. The most common one was that he was not comparing like with like. Monobiot makes a lot of interesting points ( I have just read his book HEAT) but when it comes to technical details he is out of his depth and frequently gets things wrong. Read the site for more detail.  

""""But do you not see the difference between marketing spin by AGA, and reliable, referenced data?"""" - yes of course - so provide some - I dont think this article cirrently contain any. It contains information but i dont think is very good information. 

""""For example, you have plucked a figure of 30 years out of somewhere"""" its either in that article or another one on the AGA or Rayburn web sites. When considering some of the costs you have to remember that AGA last a very long time 
so costs and gains have to be considered over a longer time scale than you would for a cheap chinese electric oven which would have to be replaced 3-4 times over the same period.

""""conventional ovens is worse than dismal"""" - I don't agree that that has been proven, the indications are that it is not very good in some circumstances but i think that dismal is to hard a term and yet to be proven. You cant consider thenal devices such as a AGA without considering how they are used. For instance consider 2 AGA , a 2 oven model in a single person household and a 4 Oven model in a nursing home. The first would be a disaster preparing maby only one hot meal a day, while the other would be on the go 24x7x365. Both are AGA, the first setup would be crazy, the second is a market that actually buys large numbers of AGA and they are commercial institutions for the most part, they are run by hard nosed managers and yet they buy tons of AGA why is that if they are as bad as you say? What do you know that all these hard nosed money pinchers don't? I suspect that answering the question for the AGA is very much more than straight KwH

BYW I dont have an AGA or expect to ever own one - I am interested in engineering soultions to global warming ( real solutions not 10:10 stuff) but i dont understand why this whole """"lets bash teh AGA"""" thing that seems to be going on at the moment is coming from?

 Assyrian propaganda on Wikipedia 
Is this the way how you handle problems on Wikipedia by simply closing the case without finding a compromise? What happens, if I put Aramean continuity related topics to the """"Assyrian people"""" article and everything will be deleted or distorted by Assyrian fascists again, because they think they are the owner of this article? They even have a WikiProject called Assyria and don't care about neutrality and support Assyrianism. We are fed up that all our contributions on Wikpedia even with references are getting removed  without a valid reason. Are you there to check it and undo it? This is why I was in favour for a neutral common page called Assyrian/Syriac people, Syriac people or whatever focused only on our Christian heritage, where we all agree on. What's wrong with the idea to create articles within a common page to express each groups views?

"The reasons I dont contribute to Wikipedia anymore 
Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology. I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance.

 Third sentence of the lead 

Hello, I was just perusing this article randomly and I have a suggestion for the third sentence of the lead paragraph. It reads """"Anatomical similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor through a long series of these divergent events, stretching back in a tree of life that has grown over the 3,500 million years of life on Earth."""" I have two comments on this sentence.

1) First, it seems to me that the purpose of the sentence is to lay out, at the highest level, the independent lines of evidence in support of evolution. As such, I think that DNA (or genetic) similarities is a fourth line of independent evidence of the same level of importance as the three lines already listed in the sentence. Certainly, those three lines of evidence are the ones Darwin primarily relied upon when he laid out the theory (actually, he more apologized for the fossil record than relied upon it as an independent source of supporting evidence), but I think the incorporation of genetic evidence into the theory of evolution is at least as important a source of independent evidence and should be included in this sentence.

2) Secondly, for both anatomical similarities and genetic similarities, it's not so much the similarities per se that are crucial, it's the pattern of those similarities. The article states later that it's the fact that these similarities can be classified into a hierarchy of nested groups that is key to their support of the theory of evolution. I understand the lead isn't supposed to go into all the detail that is laid out later in the article, but I still feel it's crucial to say something about how it's the nature of the similarities that's important.

I might suggest: """"A nested hierarchy of anatomical and genetic similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor through a long series of these divergent events, stretching back in a tree of life that has grown over the 3,500 million years of life on Earth."""" for that sentence.

'What happened to the imperial soldiers after the cataclysm remains a mistery, but it is assumed that most of them pledged allegience to Kefka and decided to become his honorguards and worshipers for the sake of their own survival and would otherwise be killed.'

Why exactly is it 'assumed' that most Imperial soldiers pledged allegiance to Kefka, and by whom is this assumed? Wouldn't make more sense to assume that most Imperial soldiers simply stopped soldiering and moved on with their lives after the Empire was wiped off the face of the world?

Granted, the player will encounter a variation of prototype MagiTek armor in Kefka's tower, but it seems just as likely that these are prototypes that Kefka's own minions scavanged from the remains of the MagiTek Factory, or even perhaps these units belong to a small faction of Imperial fanatics trying to infiltrate the Tower and overthrow Kefka themselves.

New Additions and Changes
After a long time away from this article waiting for the peer review to be finalized, I've returned to work on this article. Just wanted to list some of the additions and changes.

The biggest one (IMHO) is the change citations from parenthetical to footnote/bibliography style. Also, the footnotes and bibliography are in a reduced font, done in a style that can be seen in Hugo Chavez. Given that the Chavez article won featured article status, I'm going to take the """"if you can't beat'em, join'em"""" approach. 
I got ahold of a decent biography of Suharto that really illuminates Suharto's pre-presidential years. It's R.E. Elson's Suharto: A Political Biography. I plan on making some further additions using this book as a reference.
In tandem with the Elson book, I managed to find some halfway decent pictures of him that I believe should be public domain, if not fair use. So now we have a lead photo again! They're from the Department of Information and State Secretariat of Indonesia. If anyone has a halfway decent knowledge of Indonesian intellectual property law (besides the lack of any enforcement), it'd be very appreciated.

For the future, I am looking to fatten up the portion on Suharto's military career, but eventually it will be exported to its own article (e.g. Military career of Suharto), much in the same way the Civil War and New Order sections got fattened up, exported, then trimmed.

After that is done, I hope to do another round of peer review, and then based on that nominating this to Wikipedia:Featured article candidates  """,0

Hello, about your comments. First off, please don't post under anon IPs on other people's pages while you're blocked. You can use this page for whatever communication you need during this time. About the issue, I appreciate your efforts in vandal fighting, but I do have the impression you have been mixing in your own definition of """"vandalism"""" with your own content ideas about what the Panathinaikos article should look like.

"""


Of course, absolutely true, as I said above. I could also construct a family of reasons for each of these. More and more elaborate explanations, increasingly detailed and complicated and byzantine. Rube Goldbergian mechanisms. However, science has other requirements as well, such as:
Parsimony
predictive success
And of course, most of those alternative explanations will fail those and other requirements. 
It certainly can be amusing to try to construct alternative theories to explain this evidence. And amusing to try to come up with more evidence. It is all good mental exercise I would commend to anyone. How many scientific facts/observations/pieces of evidence can one come up with to """"prove"""" the earth is round ? (I use prove loosely here, since there is no proof in science only in mathematics and logic). 

One caution I have, is that some of these explanations are clever. Some are just silly, like saying the earth is not warmer now than it was 100 years ago. However, the measurements are the measurements. And even when all kinds of corrections are taken acount of, the temperatures now are warmer than they were 100 years ago. Done using thousands of instruments of different types in different locations by different people who got consistent results. Incorrect theories are bad enough, but bad data is fatal. 

As to your other questions, it is easy to measure the earth's free oscillations with a weight on a spring. It is done all the time and has been done for decades. And they have very characteristic temporal and spatial frequencies corresponding to oscillations of a rotating sphere. A bit hard to wave your hands to make those observations go away. You might be able to do it if you were really an excellent applied mathematician and willing to spend a few months in crazy speculative inverse theory computations. Currents of course are possible, but these are very special kinds of currents that have special kinds of characteristics that match what one would expect from a fluid on a rotating spherical earth. I have personally seen the curve of the earth when standing on a very high point. Now of course it could be an optical illusion, but it is a very compelling one if it is. However you can put it down to refraction or some other optical effect. In fact, you could even put photographs of the earth from space down to those. As I said above (and you nicely demonstrated my point), you can explain almost ANYTHING away and maintain some pre-conceived notion if you are willing to throw away parsimony and the demands of prediction, etc. """,0

 I totally agree with you that it is nonsense to classify heterogenous nomadic confederations in Asia as """"one particular ethnic group"""". The Huns, the Hephthalites, the Rouran, and even the Turks and Mongols were coalitions of a bunch of different nomadic tribes of all kinds of origins - from Indo-Iranian Scythians to Siberian proto-Altaics. Yet, we have to have SOME standard in here. And the best way to do that is to stick to authoritative sources. 
 The EI and EIr are collections of major sources and quotes; both Ei and EIr make clear that neather the Chionites nor the Hephthalites (or Gök-Turks) were homogenous. As for the Hephthalites, the usage of Mongolian and Turkic titles (such as Khaqan) is attested in the scripts of Bactria. Yet, the ruling elite was most probable of Eastern Iranian origin. That's why Chinese sources, such as the """"Pey-Shi"""" considered them members of the """"Yüe-Chi"""", who were Indo-European Tocharians. We can't just assume certain origins because of some royal titles. Not everyone who used the title """"Khaqan"""" was automatically a Turk or Mongol. The best example for this is the Indo-European title """"Yabghu"""" (probably from Tocharian or Iranian) whi was almost exclusively used by Non-Indo-European Turks. Now, we can assume that - at some point in history - the early Turks were ruled by an Indo-European-speaking elite (probably Tocharian or Iranian Scythian), but this is not enough to call the early Turks a """"mix of Indo-European and Altaic peoples"""" (see Turkic peoples).

""""Contrary to popular belief, Cael was not undefeated throughout college. He redshirted the 1997–98 season, losing only one match to Iowa's Paul Jenn in the finals of the University of Northern Iowa Open in November 1997 by a score of 6-4. He then wrestled Jenn again twice the next year beating him 19-4 and 10-2 and one more time the following year winning 22-7 when Jenn was disqualified""""

First of all, that loss is not a part of his official college record. If a wrestler is redshirting, their matches don't count. But, if they are wrestling a college wrestler not redshirting, (when they are redshirting) then the match counts for that opposing wrestler. Cael Sanderson never lost an official college match. If you want to mention that loss, feel free after providing a reliable source. The additional times he wrestled Jenn are not notable events.   """,0

Aaahhh ... the Wiki word of 'majick:' consensus. 'N then inspiring usages as: '... balanced discussions moving towards consensus.' With respect, KieferSkunk, you're indulging in some smoke with mirrors 'n handwaving. Since, whenever, has 'consensus' been some sort of guarantee of guidance towards ... what IS? (True/just ... etc. etc.) I'd bet that, on history's scale, 'consensus' is a miserable failure. The 'Triangle Trade' was a matter of 'community consensus' among those who participated, as was the Holocaust. But, anyway, that it is a comforting fiction of human understanding is neither here nor there. It's, well, what can I say, sooo subjective ... and thus by Wiki's own 'standards' unencyclopaedic. Grudging acceptance maybe ;-)

The idea of 'consensus' as being an aspect of 'mediocrity,' a kind of 'dumbing down' is featured in a recent R4 docu. on Wiki:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/radio4choice.shtml

Download 'n it should play for ya.

I, too, have been away, and apologize for my delay in getting back. Be sure, that I will respond to your later contribution.

N.B. There are parallels in this argumentation between 'consensus' in Wiki and 'democracy' as it plays in the West. Particularly how the 'poor/weak' plebs are 'allowed' to manifest their reasoning in the face of the 'rich/strong' equestrians/aristos.  10:14, 30",0

"This page is dedicated to the Gnome Owl.
MEASUREMENTS: The Northern Pygmy-Owl has a body length of 7 - 8 inches, a wingspan of 15 - 16 inches, and weighs about 2 - 2 1/2 ounces.  
HABITAT: This owl can be found at forest edges near meadows, lakes, coastline, and forest clearings in deciduous and coniferous forests of western North and Central America.  
DIET: The main diet of the Northern Pygmy-Owl is small birds and rodents, and large insects. Occasionally, they will eat reptiles and amphibians. Pygmy-owls are diurnal(active during the day) and crepuscular (active at dusk and dawn) hunters. This owl will search for prey from a perch, pouncing upon it from a close distance when prey is found. 
REPRODUCTION: The Northern Pygmy-Owl nests in tree cavities. The female usually lays 3 - 5 eggs. Unlike most owls, which start incubating the eggs soon after the first eggs are laid, the pygmy-owl does not start incubation until all the eggs have been laid. In about 29 days all the chicks hatch within a short time of each other. The young owlets fledge at 30 days and are independent of parental care 20 - 30 days later. The young owls become sexually mature in less than a year.  
NAME DERIVATION: The scientific name comes from the Greek words glaux, indicating a little owl; glaukidion, meaning to gleam or glare, and may refer to the eyes of the owl; and gnoma, referring to knowledge, reasoning, or an opinion. The common name indicates the size of the bird and its northern range. This owl has also been called a Gnome Owl. 
INTERESTING FACTS: 
Unlike hawks, falcons, and eagles, owls do not have an expandable part of the esophagus, called a crop, to store extra food. Therefore owls, like pygmy-owls, will cache the remainder of their food in a hiding place and eat it later. This is especially important for small, high-energy species that must eat frequently.

Since pygmy-owls are active during daylight, they rely on their sense of sight to hunt. Consequently, this owl did not develop a good sense of hearing, silent flight, nor exceptional night vision, like nocturnal owls.",0

"While I am not the one to question your 'protecting' a page or article whether or not it is an FA category, I want to point out at least one inaccuracy in the Western Chalukya page.... I pointed out to user Dinesh Kannambadi about one portion of text mentioned in the article on the Western Chalukyas. The said portion is copied in here for your information and consideration as an admin:

The overall effort by Somesvara IV to rebuild the Chalukya empire failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Somesvara IV into exile in Banavasi 1189. After the fall of the Chalukyas, the Seunas and Hoysalas continued warring over the Krishna River region in 1191, each inflicting a defeat on the other at various points in time.[44] This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.[45]

In the above passage, while it may be ok for giving info on kingdoms in western deccan or deccan whose mutual antagonisms filled history annals.... I feel that mentioning the demise of the Cholas (who did so in 1279/1285 AD) in the Chalukya page who got eclipsed in 1190 WHICH IS ALMOST 90 YEARS PRIOR TO THAT OF THE CHALUKYAS, is quite inappropriate.

Mr.Kannambadi also mentions that the Chalukyas convincingly eclipsed the Cholas after the Cholas lost Vengi is quite untrue. This is because Vengi was lost by the Chalukyas to the Cholas themselves under Vikrama Chola for after winning Vengi in 1119 or 1118, Vikramaditya expired in 1125 or so and was followed by very weak successors and the Chalukya capital itself was lost for around 30 years from 1136-1140 (courtesy, Ancient India by K.A.N.Sastri, 1956 edition). So what does he mean there, by winning Vengi and keeping it for 6-8 years the Cholas were convincingly eclipsed by the Chalukyas... Does it mean that we are to believe that sustaining a victory for 6-8 years enables an empire to claim glory or feeling that their opponents were convincingly eclipsed.  I know Kannambadi will also speak about jingoism and that Hoysalas too won Gangavadi from Cholas, but pls. remind him that the same was prior to the Chalukyas conquering Vengi.  I am sure you will be very well acquainted with these facts in case you have in-depth knoweldge of Indian History especially that of South India.

I will await for your (hopefully) impartial decision so that these pages are reopened and their quality further improved through placing of proper facts supported by evidences.",0

 Letters on the Masonic Institution 

By President John Quincy Adams 

Originally Published: 
1847 T. R. Marvin 
BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS 

PREFACE 

IT is now twenty years since there sprung up in the United States an earnest and at times a vehement discussion, of the nature and effect of the bond entered into by those citizens who join the society of Free and Accepted Masons. The excitement which arose in consequence of the disclosures then made, had the effect, at least for a time, if not permanently, to check the farther spread of that association. The legislative power of some of the States was invoked, and at last actually interposed, to prevent the administration of extra-judicial oaths, including of course all such as were constantly taken in the Masonic Order. This was the furthest point which the opposition ever reached. It did not succeed in procuring the dissolution of the organization of the Order, or even the repeal of the charters under which it had a recognized existence in the social system. From the moment of the adoption of a penal law, deemed strong enough to meet the most serious of the evils complained of, the apprehension of further danger from Masonry began to subside. At this day, the subject has ceased to be talked of. The attention of men has been gradually diverted to other things, until at last it may be said, that few persons are aware of the fact, provided it be not especially forced upon their notice, that not only Freemasonry continues to exist, but also that other associations partaking of its secret nature, if not of its unjustifiable obligations, not merely live, but greatly flourish in the midst of them. 

Fully aware of this state of things, a few private citizens who deeply interested themselves in the investigation of the subject when first agitated, yet feel as if their duty was not entirely performed so long as they shall have left undone any act which in their estimation may have the effect of keeping up among their countrymen a vigilant observation of the nature and tendency of secret associations. Without cherishing the remotest desire, even if they could be supposed to entertain the expectation, of reviving an old excitement, they are nevertheless most anxious to put in a permanently accessible shape, some clear and strong exposition of the evil attending similar ties, as that evil was illustrated years ago in an examination of the Freemason's Oath. Such an exposition they knew could be found in the writings of the Honorable John Quincy Adams. But although the various papers in which it was first issued to the public enjoyed an extensive circulation at the period when it was written, and without doubt contributed much to the establishment of an improved state of popular opinion, they are believed never to have been collected together in any one form readily open to the public examination. This great deficiency, it seemed to the gentlemen who have been already alluded to, a desirable object to supply. They accordingly undertook the task of publishing the present volume, not as a matter of sale, but solely with the intention of gratuitous distribution. And first of all, they deemed",0

 Aha! So, it is not about Bessarabia, it is about Soviet demands over Bessarabia. I think this is the core issue of numerous misunderstandings. If we start from analyzing what the Soviets demanded and see that Romania and the west did not made sufficient steps to apease it, we observe insuficient action from the side of Romania (did not organize a referendum), as well as from the west (did not succeed in overthrowing the Reds - to try is not enough). But also we run into Англия, Франция, Италия, Япония и Румыния подписали в Париже т. н. Бессарабский протокол, согласно которому они признали суверенитет Румынии над Бессарабией, и установили, что этот суверенитет """"не может быть поставлен на обсуждение"""", which obviously ties the hands of Romania: whatever you say, it was much more important for Romania to have normal relations with the rest of the world than with Russia.
 But I said from early on, that Bessarabia, not Russia is the center of the issue. It is Bessarabians that chose this or that, not Romania or Russia. Russia had intervened only in 1940, without being invited by a local body or by MPs from Bessarabia, without even a mock support from inside Bessarabia. Why should Russia's demand be treated supperior to Bessarabia's choice (good or bad, it was a choice made in full awareness). The (military) treaty you mention was signed in February, i.e. before 27 March 1918 between two neighboring to Bessarabia countries. It can not possibly tie the hands of Bessarabia itself, by then an independent country.
 About autonomy, as far as I know, after the 27 November, resp. 1 December 1918 union of Bukovina, resp. Transylvania, a government was set for the entire united Romania, led by a Transylvanian politician (Alexandru Vaida-Voevod). He was too liberal for the phanariot-minded politicians that used to govern in Bucharest before. They tolerated """"new Romanians"""" in government only becuse the circumstances made that necessary. Among other things, Vaida started a large campain of land reform, widely supported also by Bukovinians and Bessarabians, but very feared by the old ruling elite in Bucharest (recall the 1907 peasant uprising, still very fresh in mind). They tollerated Vaida's governments (there were 2 or 3 I think) for ca. 1 year, and in early 1920, a """"black coalition"""" was formed, and General Averescu became prime-minister (similar to the one formed in Romania in early 2006 against Basescu, which lamenably failed within 1 month, but dragged the country more into politicianist discourse until last autumn). Land reform was limited and only went as far as to finish what was started. The new Constitution of 1923 was written by these people, who put the word """"unitary"""" everywhere they could fit it into. Thus the autonomy of all three new provinces was not enshrined in the new Constitution. In return that led to a bitter division of the politics: on one side National-Liberal party of Bucharest old politicians, on the other the Transylvanian-dominated National-Ţărănist party. In 1928-1930, the latter started to gain momentum, and to sealed it they brought in Carol II from forced exile. But Carol II turned to be even worse, so they actually shut themselves into leg, so to say. That led some of them to more nationalistic discurse (for example Vaida himself - Dahn even calls him fascist, which is not true, but I don't want to argue with Dahn), others managed to escape this trap (for example Maniu). You see, you have to take into consideration the entire going ons. Bessarabia was left without regional autonomy because no other province got it, which in turn was because the old phanariot-mineded people carried the day in early 1920s. These people lost the grip on power, but it took time. Even in modern Romania you still have the continuation of the same disputes. On one side you have many politicians asking for setting up regions and more local autonomy (again, surprisingly many Transylvanians among them), on the other side you have the command-system-minded partly-communist-foprmed bureaucracy, who fear regionalization (again, surprizingly many Oltenians and other likes of them among). But unlike the interbelic period, it seem that now the movement is strictly oriented in one direction. Regionalization and greater local autonomy is inevitable, whether you bring the EU-standard pretext or not. So, my second part of the answer is: if it were not for the Soviet occupation, the rise of fascism, and WWII, we would have had autonomy for Bessarabia (with a powerful local legislative body) by 1950s. Communism only created a pause, things continue to roll today. \talk """,0

 Stillman inference 

a paragraph in the article, citing pp 14-16 of Stillman's 1979 work, reads as follows:

According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself and avoid being accused of double standards given the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir. Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.

however, the only relevant discussion i found was this (p.15):

When all hope was gone they [i.e. Qurayza] sought to surrender on the same terms as had the Naḍīr. This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā c at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery. Muhammad then declared that this was none other than Allah's decision. Actually, it is clear from the Muslim sources that the Qurayza's fate had been decided even before their surrender. One of Muhammad's emissaries, Abū Lubāba, who had advised the Qurayẓa to give up, had to perform penance for hinting to the Jews what their real fate would be.

Stillman doesn't state or imply that Muhammad deferred judgement to Sa'd in order to avoid accusations of double standards (especially when he openly endorsed the decision), so i believe this is original research. what seems more apparent is that, because of the Awsites protesting, it was Sa'd (Aws chieftain) who was chosen to pronounce the judgement, as they may have been more accepting of the decree if it came from their tribal leader.again, with the second sentence in the article, i do not see how the solitary sentence discussing Abu Lubaba substantiates what has been written, or where Stillman is making any """"infer[ences]"""" that Banu Qurayza's fate had already been decided by Muhammad before their surrender.  
This is clear from the last two sentences of the excerpt. The first sentence states the conclusion; the second contains the premise.  Or 
could you also address the first point?  
This is clear from the following setences:This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza.

"I'm Back!!!!

Well at last I'm back to being able to use Wikipedia, and this time I ain't going NOWHERE D Now for my first action I will address many of the fighter pages that I created that were deleted within the two weeks I was away. Now there were only really four pages that I was really shocked about seeing deleted, which were Tim Newman, Reagan Penn, Jamaine Facey and Jake Bostwick, as they all match Wikipedia's MMA notability criteria. 
Tim Newman has already fought for BAMMA to two occasions, which were BAMMA 4 and BAMMA 5, and he is scheduled to fight on the BAMMA 8 card, all of which have links supporting this. So even thought he has only technically fought for BAMMA twice, because he is clearly a true member of the BAMMA roster, and unless something happens to him which means he cannot compete at BAMMA 8, I find that deleting his Wikipedia page was a massive error for everyone who participated in that debate. 
With Reagan Penn, he doesn't necessary need the sympathy factor for being BJ Penn, as he is currently competing for ProElite, which as we know is a second tier MMA organisation, as they were the same people who have created EliteXC, and everyone agrees that with the attention ProElite are getting now that they are a second tier organisation, so that means that the only thing Penn is missing is a thrid fight under them, and telling by how excited ProElite are having a Penn fighting for them I'd imagine that he will get another fight for them, possibly for the next card, so that means that deleting his Wikipedia card can be seen as being premature, as if he decided to retire after his second bout then fair enough, but he hasn't so far so once again another blunder for those who participated in that debate. 
Finally we have Jamaine Facey and Jake Bostwick. Now these two guys have competed for Cage Rage and Cage Rage UK, both second tier organisations. They both fought on the main cards of Cage Rage on one or two occasions, and competed for the contender cards at least three times each, which means they were already deserving of their positions on here. They are always competing on the main cards of Cage Rage UK which, again, means that the still deserve their spots on here. So for another blunder I would like to see all FOUR men have their pages reinstated as soon as possible, as I'm beginning to suspect that something is not right with the legitimacy of the user/s (who I will keep anonymous so I don't get accused of personal attacks again) who are calling for many pages of mine to be deleted, which also includes the deleting of the Cage Rage UK/UCMMA Wikipedia page, as this orgainisation is one of the big three in the United Kingdom, along side BAMMA and Cage Warriors.

 Eastern Orthodox Church and other Eastern Churches 

I am not a writer or an editor, so I am not sure how to approach the correction of the page, nor am I a genealogist or a theologian, so I'm not really schooled in the subject matter, so I could be wrong about this.
  In the article under the heading of Eastern Orthodox Church and other Eastern Churches, it says """"However, in the Eastern Orthodox Church, marriages of affinity that produce children who are closer genetic relatives than legal are also not permitted (unless the genetic relationship does allow marriage between those children).  For example, two siblings may not marry two other siblings because legally their children will be cousins, but genetically they'll be half siblings.  On the other hand, two siblings may marry two cousins.""""
  Although I am not sure what the laws are in the EOC regarding marriage of first cousins, I believe the example given is in error.  Half siblings are children who share one parent, either the father or the mother.  I believe that their children would in fact be cousins in two lines.  However, according to the Wikipedia page on siblings, two of the siblings in the scenario were identical twins, this would in fact make their children genetically equivalent to half siblings, as well as cousins.
  As for the second example, of two siblings marrying two cousins, their children would be first cousins in one line, and second cousins in the other line.
  Again, I have never formally studied genealogy, and have no references, so don't take this as an affront, but I think I am correct.

 Made in the USA? http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Oh, what a mess. Multiple formats bedevil the writing of a logically-structured encyclopedia! I can see valid arguments for maintaining (although how much that needs to be done is moot) different chronologies for UK and US releases, because of the various Columbia chop-ups that were released in the early years, but trying to keep them in step is an arduous task. Most Beatles albums tend to be listed in order of their UK release (which usually preceded other locations), and that, per WP:ENGVAR, should IMHO be the norm as regards principal chronology. There's no issue with listing colonial releases in the main article, but little to be gained in having separate articles. As regards this one, as far as the UK is concerned, it was a double EP, and I see no problem in describing that initial release as an """"album"""", for simplicity's sake, and all variations should follow from that. However, this article is but an outpost of WP:Beatles and perhaps some wider input would be useful. andemu """,0

Fanboy is a term used to describe an individual (usually male; the feminine version fangirl may be used for females) who is utterly devoted to a single fannish subject, or to a single point of view within that subject, often to the point where it is considered an obsession. Fanboys remain loyal to their particular obsession, disregarding any factors (often including logic) that differ from their point of view. 

 Background 
Stereotypical fanboys are attributed with a sycophantic devotion to the creators and principles behind a work with which they are currently enthralled. Fanboys are noted for a very emotional attachment to their chosen subject, often taking negative remarks about it as a personal attack. They will readily engage in debates, but will fall back on emotional responses when challenged on facts. For example, a fanboy may go out of his way to point out negative and often untrue statements about their obsession's rivals. Fanboys are often hostile towards critical review of their chosen subject. The stereotypical image of the fanboy is as an unkempt, socially awkward young man who may be perceived as a loud mouthed pseudo-intellectual. Fanboys  are also typically aggressive and hateful towards the opposing brand or competition of their obsession regardless of its merits or achievements. 

As electronic entertainment gained popularity, the term became increasingly applied to video game and television addicts. As a result, a subculture emerged which readily labeled itself as """"fanboys."""" Within this group, more effort is taken to fit in with a perceived standard, resulting in a more outgoing attitude, even among those with insecurities. This outgoing stance is often felt to be abrasive by those not involved in the culture as deeply. The term originated in comic book circles, to describe someone who immersed himself in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom.  The term is often used in a derogatory manner by other less obsessed fans. The term is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex.

The term fangirl, while similar, often carries slightly different connotations. The term fangirl is often applied to any enthusiastic female fan, regardless of obsessive qualities or not, and is often used with overtones of """"teenybopper"""".

History of fanboys and the term
The term """"fanboy"""" is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex. It is often used in a derogatory manner by other, less obsessed fans. The term originated in comic book circles to describe someone immersed in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom. Common subjects of reverence by fanboys are specific: TV shows; movies; music; anime; comic books; cars; video game consoles, video games and MMORPGs; and computer operating systems, hardware and software.
 
Popular depictions of Fanboy stereotypes include the Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons and columnist Larry Groznic from the satirical newspaper The Onion.  In the songs of the fannish parody musician Luke Ski, many characters proudly consider themselves fanboys.

The earliest published uses of the word """"fanboy"""" have been dated to 1982.  One reference is to the cover of the """"Official Underground and Newave Comix Price Guide"""".  On this cover page are sketched overweight, overzealous comic book collectors wearing T-shirts that state """"Fanboys of America,"""" who are describing the extreme measures they would go to, including moving to San Francisco, to preserve their comics.

Also published in 1982, a comic strip appeared in Jim Engel and Chuck Fiala's """"Fandom Confidential"""" comic.  In the strip, Jim and Chuck met comic artist/writer John Byrne and collapsed into """"mindless paroxysms of adoration.""""  The John Byrne character responded that they were """"a couple of fanboys in bondage"""" (a play on words referring to a Monty Python sketch in which an Elizabethan era character reads what she claims to be a new Shakespeare work called """"Gay Boys in Bondage"""". http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1;=Miscellaneous+Questions#154 Another early use is in a smart-alec editorial reply by """"Ambush Bug"""" to a letter in his comic in 1985.

 Not Good for Straight Forward Understanding of Advances 

Without clear categorization of advances tracked through time, how can one get any meaning out of the article?

For example, tracking the maximum number of quantum bits in a single entanglement according to date would be much more meaningful than the current listing of ad hoc, haphazard, and arbitrary """"achievements"""". 

Also comparing the number of quantum bits needed for various types of tasks such as breaking encryption would be very informative in comparison to current accomplishments, because it would expose how little progress we have really made.

A great example of this would be to show how many quantum bits the D-Wave machines achieve in individual entanglements.  This would expose the misguided impressions generated when D-Wave talks about the number of quantum bits on a single board as that has almost nothing to do with the number of quantum bits achieved in a individual entanglements. 50.0.36.35  """,0

While this is inappropriate, it's technically different from vandalism.  For example, if no reliable, published source explicitly says Matt the Knife is, as he put it in an earlier edit, """"facing scrutiny,"""" or that his records have been challenged, then the article shouldn't say those things either.

First I have to ask you if you have any connection to the subject in the article, because that will limit the ways in which can mitigate the problem.

Friedmans words are clearly quoted and clearly cited via the article linked to. A source you have removed for some reason. Do you have something to contribute from """"Blitzers side""""? Please, by all means include it. Is lack of something from """"Blitzers side"""" a reason to exclude citicism and delete a large chunk of the article? I dont think so. Unless you can actually defend your changes citing policy you will need to revert them. 

To clarify, yes, Near East Report is an AIPAC publication, as I said four days ago. Whether it was published by AIPAC in the 70s, I don't know, although it is likely. What we do know is that Blitzer started working for the JPost in 1973. He may very well have edited a version of """"Myths & Facts"""" in 1976, by the way, en edition of that book was published every two years. Plenty of journalists do outside work. Keep in mind that we are an encyclopedia. You need a reliable source thats says who he worked for and the dates. Pulling this information together from different primary sources is original research. You cannot quote somebody as calling Near East Report a """"propaganda sheet"""" any more than another editor can say """"Belfast is inhabited by """"drunken and violent"""" Irish people with the quote cited to Thomas Nast. You also can't cite three people attacking Blitzer's scholarship in Territory of Lies without any response from Blitzer or his supporters.  

Firstly, I wont respond to your silly example referring to where I live. Your racism is disgusting and reflects only on you but thats your problem.

Secondly, please dont further insult the intelligence of editors by implying that Near East Report was *possibly* published by someone else in 1970s. Blitzer edited the book ergo he worked for AIPAC, likewise he was editor of the weekly publication Near East Report into 1978. Source? The directoy listing showing his name listed as the responsible party at the weekly. He worked for them in 1976,77,78 regardless of whether you seek to portray that as """"outside work"""" or anything else. His name is on the front cover of the book as editor right? His name is listed in the weekly publication as editor right? Are those facts in dispute by you? 

Friedmans words are his own, you removed not only the quote whos inclusion you disagree with but all the other details. Fine, remove the quote, but removing everything else? Criticism of Blitzer does belong in the section detailing criticism. An automatic rebuttal isnt necessarily required if its a minority view and/or it cant be located.

 Potsdam Declaration 

Here some quotation from the """"Official Gazette of the control council for Germany"""" (Documents relating to the establishment of the Allied Control Authority) - published by the """"Allied Secretariat"""" in Berlin, Elssholzstrase 32.

Under item VI (Statement by the Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic and the Provisional Government of the French Republic on the zones of occupation in Germany) they write:

""""1. Germany, within her frontiers as they were on 31st December, 1937, will, for purposes of occupation, be divided into four zones, one to be alloted to each Power as follows ...""""

Under item  VIII (Report on the Tripartite Conference of Berlin) and there Article IX concerning the western frontier of Poland they write:

""""The three Heads of Government reaffirm their opinion that the final delimitation of the western frontier of Poland should await the peace settlement.""""

Until this peace conference the disputed territories """"shall be under the administration of the Polish State and for such purposes should not be considered as part of the Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany.""""

So keeping in mind this facts sincerely it´s obvious that the (West-) Allies didn´t order any transfer of Germans out of their ancestral homelands because by doing this they would have created a fait accompli. 

Actually Russia and Poland created such accomplished facts by expelling most of that Germans - even quite long before the Potsdam Declaration. 

(Comment: Any forced transfer of population is a crime against humanity; and this it was already at times of 1945 - Nazi-Germany was trialed exactly for such crimes, too.)

NPOV, Plagiarism, etc.

Sophie Calle is a disturbing character. Artist known as """"unclassable"""", its autobiographical works cause polemic. It is a photographer but almost never its photographs itself takes, it makes its life a work of art by using the others, and spaces it few days becomes a character of novel. Its most known series of photographs is that of the """"Blind men"""". By always combining the text and the image, it photographs blind men of birth and their request to express their vision of the beauty.  With the limit of the indiscretion, Sophie Calle often takes risks to work out her settings in scene. She follows people in the street to photograph them, she posed as a maid in a Venetian hotel to inspect and photograph the personal effects of customers. Works of Sophie Calle are diverse. The context in which the texts and photographs fit makes it possible to often qualify them """"artistic performance"""". The public is often shocked by Calle's works. Along with primary shock and disapproval, morals are often mandated to be discarded in appreciating the innovating works of Sophie Calle.

Judging from its terrible grammar, syntax and diction (and use of """"its"""" where """"her"""" should be, for example), this seems to be a machine translation from an unreferenced French source.

 Dark Energy, Dark Matter, MOND and still more """"Critique of the Universe"""" 

This goes to the whole question of the exclusive use of a single model of the universe that depends on the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. The consensus interpretation of the Lambda/cold dark matter model must clearly be flawed if it leads to the conclusion that the scientific method must be scrapped in order to save the model (ref). Dark Matter and Dark Energy are ad hoc """"add-ons"""" that are trying to find theoretical justification. Dark Enegy, in particular, is being called a supernatural or """"unfalsifiable"""" hypothesis because no experiment can possibly directly challenge it (ref), just like the existence of God hypothesis.

Heretofore, all hypotheses must adhere to the scientific method (ref), """"the SM"""". Now, in order to admit Dark Energy, cosmologists insist that SM must be tinkered with and an unfalsifiable hypothesis allowed for the first time in history. If we do this, the Pope can re-ascend to the Throne.

All of the indirect """"overwhelming evidence"""" for expansion rate acceleration and Dark Energy can be just as well applied to the concept that our inventory of matter and energy in our local universe is inadequate and that the mass of the global universe is at least 22.2 times as large as has been supposed (100%/4.5% = 22.2). The total mass of the universe has been and still is open to question. The Matter/Energy that we can inventory accounts for only 4.5% of the total needed to """"flatten"""" the anisotropy pattern that is seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation or """"CMB"""" (ref). This proposed revision in the """"total mass"""" and the General Relativity (GR) concept of the black hole hyperbolic field will save not only SM, but the Friedmann Equations and the FLRW metric themselves too! 

The """"inflaton particle"""" from which the universe may have sprung was the mother of all black-holes (MOAB). As such, it must have possessed an hyperbolic gravitational field that existed timelessly according to Alan Guth's quantum principles (ref). During the instant of inception of the differentiated universe that we can now detect, this hyperbolic field must have begun to degenerate. Space with time came into existence during this instant. The implication here of the prior existence of a sort of meta-universe is not explicitly acknowledged in any of the scenarios we read, but it is nonetheless an unstated assumption. 

This space-time bubble's surface traveled up the MOAB's hyperbolic field gradient at a velocity hundreds or thousands of times the speed of light. This is Allan Guth's """"Inflation"""". Matter/Light could keep pace with the inflation of space-time only as long as its temperature was several exponential decades of degrees Kelvin. As soon as Matter/Light began to condense and the fundamental forces began to differentiate, the inflation era ended (ref). The collapse of the infinite density hyperbolic field began. This hyperbolic field has been collapsing by means of a time-dependent process ever since. It is this ongoing transition from a hyperbolic black hole gravitational field to a parabolic Newtonian gravitational field underlying the global universe that is being mistaken for acceleration and Dark Energy (ref).

This is not speculation. This is not my personal idea. This is but one example of a different logical meaning of Allan Guth's inflation theory (ref)and General Relativity according to Schwartzchild (ref) and many others. When guided by correct meta-logic, mathematical physicists will be able to validate this or some other theoretical interpretation of GR, the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. Then, with the demise of Dark Energy and Dark Matter, the scientific method will be saved (ref).

Cosmologists are always wrong, but never in doubt. - Lev Landau (ref)""",0

So his task was clear to us. Since he is the point man, the go-to guy. It's very easy to get information from him. He has the two """"tool"""" talk pages, his newsletters and holds """"office hours on IRC chat. And email, plus he responds readily and to the point on his talk page. There's no confusion.

He is really clear about what he can do and what is out of his hands (up to the developers or WMF or technically not feasible etc.). 
I appreciate that you and Ldavis (WMF) are community liaison people, but I only learned about you recently and I'm not sure what sorts of things you cover or what it would be appropriate to contact  you or Ldavis (WMF) about.

My big beef (which I've gotten over) was a problem with an Online Ambassador. And I kept being told, every time I asked that """"it was being handled"""" by the Steering Committee.

Scientific investigation is intentionally designed with a very restrictive set of legitimate forms of observation, and takes a conservative stance that makes no claims which cannot be demonstrated from inside that set.  there are people on both sides of the fence who abuse that process (non-scientists who make positive claims that cannot be justified within the conservative limitations of science, and skeptics who make negative claims that cannot be justified within the conservative limitations of science). Science is good at what it does, but very easy to abuse for other purposes.  Ludwigs2 """,0

"Some personal observations here: 
Put a summary of it into the Roots of Christianity; perhaps a whole subsection thereof.  If the Zoroastrianism part is included, then so must the Egyptian especially since the Hebrews were long associated with Egypt back to the Hyksos invasion.  It would be POV to disclude this factor, considering the trail of monotheism left by Akhenaten and adopted by the Hebrews.  I myself don't know much about Zoroaster, but I certainly recognise much of the Egyptian issue and I'm more of a casual researcher.  It seems to me that Zoroastrian elements are tied to the Persian background, but it would be prejudiced to say that the Egyptians have no basis when they long dominated Palestine.  The Greek Pharaoh himself patroned the Septuagint in Alexandria.  I find the bigotry towards an Egyptian root of Christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of Egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards.  Perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race; that the Hamites of Africa have not contributed anything and that the Persians supposedly were/are White or considered Japhethic as opposed to the Semites.  Seriously, this Noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these Afro-Asiatic people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less White than the Greeks and Romans.  I consider Persians to be Semites because they are Asian, in this context.  Give it as much credence as the Persian foundations and you will make this NPOV.  I seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of Christianity and also delineating the Greek root which provided Roman impetus for adoption and proliferation.  For instance, if the Greeks hadn't patroned that religious culture as their relation to Philistines, Rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with Greece.  Rome even rebuilt Greek Philistia as Palestine and during the Catholic Crusades, it became the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  Christianity has so many dimensions, that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from Europe and Buddhist ties in Southwest Asia.  

I myself used to be atheist or Odinist not wanting to deal with what I percieved to be other peoples' culture and now I look in wonder at the historical background of the Sea Peoples and the subsequent Graeco-Roman expansion in the Mediterranean Sea.  There are European roots throughout the region now considered Islamic or Arab, but if we don't provide the means for people to see it we will forget it as much as the terrible destruction of the Library of Alexandria.  Just think of the term Indo-European and you will understand Alexander the Great's empire.  See the connection between the European fylfot and Indian swastika or the Cross and the Ankh?  Please don't demolish this magnificent research, for it has been a great boon in my life to know these things.  I am only stating things as I commonly have studied and heard of them.  I do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue, therefore I am not endorsing POV.  The various sources I have seen via Google search appear legitimate and/or sometimes biased(as anything!), but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic.  We are not to cast a POV on the issue in favour or against, just to deliver as any messenger does.  The existing article on the History of Christianity provides the Persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the Egyptian or Hellenic origins, which are quite prominent.  After all, Christianity had most of its evolution in non-Persian areas of the Mediterranean Sea.  Tell me, how many Persian people are prominent in the Christian world throughout its history?  What fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of Persian elements in Christianity, compared to the vast amount of Greek specialty(as written, verified and generally known amongst the entire Christian populace) and the nursery of Christianity itself in Egypt via the Old Testament(even Jesus's infancy was spent in Egypt, in safety from Herod!)?  Please, where is the background of Christianity in Persia besides 19th century racial studies?  Like I've said, the Noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for Indo-Aryan racist theories.   23:43, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)",0

RJ, I can see why you'd like a legitimate source like that for a photo for the same reason that we require information be verified by RSs in the text. However, the problem I'm seeing is that it strikes me as simply not feasible. If a photo appears from a reliable source, that photo is going to be copyrighted by that reliable source. There's no way we could claim fair use in that situation. In my experience, almost all non-fair use images are either user-generated, taken from a Flickr (or something similar), or have had their copyright expire. If we limit images to those from reliable sources, we pretty much limit ourselves to only fair use images and images of historical subjects. I think that is simply unreasonable. User-generated images and images released under a free license have a role to play on Wikipedia. I think it is up to us as editors to determine that role. In the examples I gave above, do you find it inappropriate that the articles use images with unclear provenance and/or that are not reliably sourced? If not, why not? My point here is that the question """"Says who?"""" could be asked of pretty much any user-generated image or image taken from Flickr, and I don't see why this article is being held to a different standard.
And I haven't tried very hard to argue for its inclusion because I don't think it's that great of a picture. I just disagree with the grounds on which it is being excluded, namely that we need some form of legitimization for the image. I agree that we should have some method to determine whether or not this photo (or any) accurately represents the subject. I don't think we need to get the photo from an RS to do that because I think that places far too high a burden. I think it is up to us, the editors, to determine whether an image adequately represents the subject. Do I think relying on someone else to say, """"Hey this is me being a hipster"""" is sufficient? Of course not. I, personally, judge the photo based on my own knowledge of hipster aesthetic, and the ironic mustache and flannel shirt are enough for me. While neither of those elements is mentioned in the article, I don't think it should be too hard to find an RS or two that mentions them in connection with hipsters.    """,0

You, a writer, must know the basic of vocabulary in order to write. Talk by definition is seen in the following example: I go on your article under edit write Oh! this is a great article you must read it, Blah, Blah, Blah, ect. Vandalism is malicious, willfully destruction of public, or personal property, such as windows of a building, or a historical document, not an article. But, if you want to stretch the word to cover your criminal article(an article whose intent is to past along only half the story, which is half the truth, which is a lie, which is given to deceive and to harm individuals reading the article hoping to be FULLY informed, Not half informed, this is seen by you trying to hide the truth that stays in the framework (intent and purpose) of the article, and completes the article. This is a criminal act of fraud, and the damage done to people's personal property, i.e. their computers, is the criminal act of vandalism. All is done through, and by, your article by hiding the truth, and giving only half the story that does not stay in the intent and purpose of the article, i.e. to fully inform the public of the versions of Firefox)this then would be the example I write in your article that it is crap, bogus. that people should not read it.

Some the people that you are are hurting are low income, especially the elderly, whose only escape from drudgery and pain of their life is either the TV or computer. These people cannot afford computer tech to service their computers, they have to """"rely on the kindness of strangers"""", such as volunteers such as myself. Some do not have a network of tech volunteers, so your article causes them suffering by hiding the truth from them (by removal of any information that shows the serious flaws of those versions so that it is never seen and the people are not informed), and by not having the money, or the means to correct it, and taking what little pleasure and escape from them. For this act the courts should pass the harshest and heaviest sentence possible on you, and others like you. I hope in the near future that not only that you are arrested, tried, and imprisoned, but you are sued and lose everything you have, everything you have striven for, and everything you have dreamed about.

 From Norway; Denmark; Iceland; Scotland; England(Bristol etc.); Wales; Ireland; Basques & Others(""""again"""",more data) 

by Gunnar Thompson

""""On DeVirga's map, the northwestern continent is called """"Norveca.""""  This title, appearing under the symbol of a crown, identifies the huge land as a province under the sovereignty of Norway.  Other maps also show a huge land attached to northern Norway.  On the 14th-century Andreas Walsperger map, the region is called """"Regnii Norwegie"""" (the realm of Norway); maps by Sebastian Munster (1532) and Joachim Von Watt (1534) call the region """"Septentrio;"""" a circular map by Battista Agnese 1543 shows """"Terra Nova"""" extending from Norway to the North Pole.  

Maps that portray a huge northern territory reflect the 1261 proclamation of King Haakon IV extending Norse sovereignty over all the lands from Norway to the North Pole.  The """"North Pole"""" he had in mind was the magneticnot the geographic pole.  A 14th-century writer, Philippe de Mezieres, reported that Norway's overseas realm was so extensive that it took three years for the king's tax collectors to complete their rounds and return to Bergen.  

One of the territories that Haakon annexed in a 1262 treaty along with Greenland and Iceland was an otherwise obscure place called landanu or """"New Land.""""  The Kongfriget Norges historie (1778) identified an Icelander named Rolf as the discoverer of this New Landalso known as Nyalandin 1258.  It was also identified as part of the North American mainland.  Bishop Gissur Einarsson noted that the direction of sailing to Nyaland from Iceland was southwest.  In that direction lies Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  

The region had many names that changed over the years as successive waves of Europeans landed on its shores.  As late as 1347, Icelanders referred to Newfoundland as """"Markland""""which was an ongoing source of lumber.  Sailors from Bristol called the coastal isles """"the Icelands.""""  Circa 1350, a Spanish Franciscan reported an isle called """"Ibernia"""" in the northwest Atlantic that was under Norse sovereignty.  After that date, Bubonic Plague swept through European cities devastating maritime centers.  Norway was particularly hard hitforcing the abandonment of overseas colonies.  English, Portuguese, French, German, and Danish merchants fought over the western isles.  After 1380, Denmark took control of Greenland, Iceland, and mainland in eastern Canada.  The """"new"""" Danish mainland appears on the Claudius Clavus map of 1424 as """"Gronlandia Provincia.""""  Thus, the name """"Norveca"""" was already archaic by the early 15th century when it found its way onto DeVirga's map.  Portuguese maps of the early 16th century feature the names of Joao Fernandes (The Labrador) and the Corte-Real family along the East Coast of North America...""""  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 212.113.163.75   
Gunnar Thompson has also published on Marco Polo’s secret missions to Canada and the ancient Egyptian colonization of Mexico. He has compiled an """"Extensive collection of evidence (maps, artifacts, and cultural similarities) of voyages to North America before Columbus, by Phoenicians, Norse, Celts, Britons, Jews, Greeks, Irish, Romans, Japanese, Hindus, Indo-Sumerians, and Chinese. Native Americans are the first discoverers, occupying the Americas for at least 300,000 years."""" (from the Laura Lee radio show website) He is as reliable a source as Gavin Menzies. He has told me that the word hurricane comes from the ancient Greek.   

Well, the dear Dougweller can claim quite rightly in many cases that the relate of Marco Polo could be speculation, however Gunnar Thompson cites the words of his own reporting and book, book attributed to him, Marco Polo, as a documental source for these claims in the American Pacific coast, as well as indirect sources more speculative on the several centuries later(and even from his time) world maps, wich indicate where the lands designated by the Chinese and by the Venetian-Dalmatian Explorer were.

Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. I won't egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English. I am fully aware of how the terms """"vandlism"""" are used and misused here, and most of the rest of the wikijargon. Nothing new under the sun here. If you read the edits I made carefully, and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user, you will see I'm not off the mark here at all. I know what's going on.

 Articles for creation/Northwest Car Owners Club (NWCOC) 
Thank you for writing the following message to me:  
Thank you for your message regarding my recent submission for Northwest Car Owners Club (NWCOC). You declined it on the fact that there were not enough references in the article. There is a reference to the main website which backs up what the article is about. What other references would you suggest? There has been no books on the subject, as of yet no media coverage, although that will be coming in the next show season. I am now at a loss as to what other reference apart from the website can be used.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Please review the  guidelines for notability of websites help page.  You will note that your article, unfortunately, could have been declined for more than one reason - I chose to refer to the lack of independent references which also means the subject is not """"notable"""" as that term is defined by Wikipedia.  I have no doubt the webcite is helpful to its users but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a web directory.  At the help page you will read that if, as you have indicated, there has been no significant media or other independent coverage related to the cite then the cite is not """"notable"""" as defined by Wikipedia and cannot be the subject of a Wikipedia article.  

The guideline reads (in part): 

In the dictionary, notable means """"worthy of being noted"""" or """"attracting notice."""" Wikipedia bases its decision about whether web content is notable enough to justify a separate article on the verifiable evidence that the web content has attracted the notice of reliable sources unrelated to the web content, its authors, or its owners. Notability requires only that these necessary sources exist, not that the sources have already been named in the article.

""""Notable"""" is not synonymous with """"fame"""" or """"importance,"""" and even web content that editors personally believe are """"important"""" or """"famous"""" are only accepted as notable if they can be shown to have attracted notice. No web content is exempt from this requirement, no matter what kind of content it is. If the individual web content has received no or very little notice from independent sources, then it is not notable simply because other web content of its type are commonly notable or merely because it exists (see """"If it's not notable"""", below).

I hope, after reviewing this guide, you will understand why I was unable to accept your article. However, if you feel I was wrong and your article meets the criteria for notability of a website, you may wish to access the Dispute Resolution Notice Board to discuss the issue or seek a  Third Party Opinion from another experienced reviewer who may well take a different view.

 LOL! I am not sure anybody wants to get involved in that one. The topic banned editor [User:Andreasgde] came up with a temp. solution of avoiding the usage of """"The/the Beatles"""" midsentence and that apparently resolved most of the issue since 2011, until I stumbled into it and asked too many questions before somebody gave me some links and kicks. It would seem the hundreds of articles concerning The Beatles group, the Beatles members, albums, and compositions, use the syntax I just used.  [User:GabeMC] wants to  start changing all ocurrences to """"the Beatles"""" mid sentence with his Straw Poll. When editors disagree he gets nasty with ridicule, argumentative and posts snipes on user talk pages. His argument is that each article can ignore WP:MOSTM on it's own consensus and only war in two or three articles, so far, on this issue. Trouble is there is no consistency in trademark usage, old documents, WP:MOS vs. WP:MOSTM, English grammar, or editor ideas that prevails with capitals or not. My concept appears to prevail in a few dozen articlesI have read. The issue has never been resolved due to behavioural issues induced into every discussion and a lack of Arbitated Policy continues the randon edits. Even it my mentioned method succeeds think of the rogue editor seeing this, """"When all the Beatles played together The Beatles made good music.""""

I would have no objection to using one or more of the readings you mention for external links.  This article cannot be a place to debate Speer back and forth, to say he was lying about this or not lying about the other thing, that would take far more than the 60K or so that an article should not exceed.  I've looked at the German article; they've tsken rather a different route, which is their privilege.  Notably, it is not a FA on the German Wikipedia, or, by my poor reading of German, even close (they've plainly borrowed from this article, by the way).  We set forth Speer's life in a comprehensive and engaging fashion, draw no conclusions, leave the reader to make up his mind and show him a few resources where he can go if he wants to learn  more beyond the summary style we are forced to use.  To get into """"well, this historian says one thing, another says something else"""" would diminish this article, not add to it.

Hurricane Expert Reconsiders Global Warming Link

Prominent MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel has publicly reversed his view regarding global warming's alleged impact on hurricanes.

“The [computer] models are telling us something quite different from what nature seems to be telling us,"""" said Emanuel, whose views on hurricanes and global warming have been prominently cited by Al Gore and other promoters of climate change fear.

He told the New York Times. """"There are various interpretations possible: The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming, or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing. Hard to know which to believe yet.”

In 2005, a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming.

His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate, said Marc Morano, a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.

""""First, 2007 turned out to be the ‘tipping point’ for global warming fears, and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views, more and more skeptical scientists speak out, and new data debunks man-made climate fears.

“Now another major scientist reconsiders his views on a significant aspect of man-made climate fears.”

Wow. a pre-emptive attack on an article in preperation for an AfD. Unfortunately, quite miseleading. Hope others don't pay it much heed.  
 """"No evidence of notability of this film."""" False. Notability has been asserted and sourced. FURTHER, the statement seems to absolutely ignore the sorces provided, which in toto amount to enough to meet WP:NF and WP:GNG: This Week, Columbus Dispatch, Athens News, and ABC News all qualify as in-depth coverage from reliable sources. 
 """"No reviews by nationally-known reviewers or publications.""""  Misleading as it does not automatically apply. A cult horror satire film by independent filmmakers is unlikely to be reviewed by Siskel and Ebert, much less those publications that cater to only big-name, big-budget, highly touted blockbusters. Wiki's guideline recognizes that sources may be considered for what is being sourced and accepts that an in-depth review of film and filmmakers by Cranked on Cinema is from experts in the field qualified to voice an opinion about the subject.
 """"even the so-called New York Times reference is in fact to All Movie Guide"""". Gee. WHy mislead with that? The New York Times was not used to source notability... neither was the use of Turner Classic Movies. Again, you are misleading a reader who might best be told that these 2 reliable sources were used to WP:Verify some of the article's non-contentious facts... like existance of film or of cast & crew... which is expected and demanded by guideline AND policy...  specially since notability has already been established by """"significant coverage in reliable sources independent of the subject"""" (but thanks for the hint about AMG...

Announcement
I have compared Helga's original version and Helga's condensed version to each other as promised.  To be fair, Helga only claimed to have condensed, and not re-written the article.  in this, she is completely correct.  The problem, however, is that this condensation in no way makes the article less of a copyright violation.  As written, there is no way that this should be included on the site, IMO.  I have included the article below, with questions and comments(in bold) that I think must be answered in order to make the article useful and not just another way of trying to prove that Copernicus was Prussian.  That said, I really think that this deserves no more than a couple of lines in the Copernicus article.  Thanks all for bearing with me and helping make this work.  Helga, plese help out by answering the questions   and perhaps even doing a bit more research  so that we can work together to make this a well-written, meaninful, article. 

Copernicus as Ermland Administrator and the Prussian Coin Reform

Nicolaus Copernicus is today world famous as Astronomer, but at home he wore many different hats. Amongst other positions he held, he was Nicolaus Copernicus Thornensis Prussus Mathematicus, the Prussian mathematician from Thorn. 

This really isn't a position, I don't think  he wasn't hired as a city mathemetician.  Also, I think there should at least be some kind of connection for new readers as to how the whole Ermeland/Thorn/Prussia thing works  it is very unhelpful to assume that the reader will know that one is a city, the other a region, the other a principality, etc...

In the Copernicus manustript an entry from December 1603 states in partial ...Nicolai Copernick Canonici Varmiensis, in Borussia Germaniae mathematici...
In what manuscript? this appears to be a random comment, and doesn't make much sense  

Besides being a church canon and administering as physician to his people, Nicolaus Copernicus worked with the other Prussian states on coin reform. 
Again, reference?  What Prussian states?  What does this mean in practical terms?

The situation in Prussia as well as in other parts of Europe in the years before, during and after the Reformation became very insecure and confused. 
Copernicus died in 1543  well before the Peace of Augsburg  Although this statement is correct, I'm not sure how Copernicus the church canon, physician, astronomer, etc., fits in.  

There were cities in Prussia that fought for keeping the government of the Catholic Teutonic Knights and others, who fought to get the Papal domination out and to become Protestant. During this time the crown of Poland, held by the Lithuanian Jagiello’s, married to the imperial Habsburg's had some limited influence in the politics of Prussia. Sigismund I wanted the Prussian cities to give up their right to mint coins. The leading cities of Prussia, Thorn, Danzig and Elbing declared, never would they give up their individual city rights to mint coins. Minting coins was a right given by the emperor and giving up this right would mean loss of sovereignty . 

This helps to explain something about the former, in that it sets up a Catholic-Protestent conflict.  My questions: 

What cities, if any, were ruled by the Teutonic Knights at the time  or was it all of Prussia?  
Does this have something to do with either the Second treaty of Thorn or the abdication of Albrecht of Prussia from his position as Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights?  From the other info on the site, it looks like there may have been some conflict over jurisdiction between Albrecht and his heirs and the TKs, who began to get their Grand Masters by imperial appointment (and from the impreial  read Habsburg  family)
How do the Jagiellos fit in?  Is their involvement because of their distant connection to the Habsburgs, as Helga implies?  or because (as we know from other articles) at one point, residents of the area had appealed to the Polish rulers for help in overthrowing the Teutonic Knights?
'''Could the objections of the cities mentioned not have something to do with their being members of the Hansa  a group notoriously jealous of their independence and privileges?  In answer to the much-anticipated imperial comment, viz., that the objections had  to do with an infringement of imperial right and law, I cry bullshit.  The Hansa cities regularly played off their position between the emperors and other rulers  Emperors could grant them independence from local rule, but the cities fought hard to keep the emperors from having too much control.  They, like rich bankers like the Fuggers and Welsers, used their economic sway as much as possible to influence th",0

Request for Comments on Current events
Hello Fsotrain09 –

I'm trying to get some discussion going on two proposals regarding the current events page, but so far have gotten little to no response. Since you have recently edited the current events page, I'm asking for your input on these two proposals:

One proposal (this is the big one) involves putting the daily events from the current events pages into article-templates, a lá the monthly pages from 2003 to 2005, as well and having a consistent number of recent days on the current events page instead of a monthly archive. This would allow for the current events page and the respective month pages to be updated simultaneously without the monthly archival. For more, see the current events talk page. 
Another proposal involves merging the content of the regional current events pages (such as British and Irish current events and Canadian current events) into fewer continental articles. For more, see the current events WikiProject talk page. 
Your input on one or both of these issues would be appreciated. joturner

Thanks for the suggestion.

I have been wondering how to organize the data.

The DoD, and the Washington Post lists tried to shoehorn the names into the English style first name and last name format. It didn't work very well, because names can have so many different transliterations. And some nations, like Yemen, have areas where people can have a tribal name, that looks like a surname to us. Maybe sorting them by first name, within nationalities, would be better.

I'll work on it.  Geo Swan

Hey  Just a friendly reminder to be sure to use an edit summary that says """"prod"""" when you propose an article for deletion. It's always good to use edit summaries, of course, but it's especially helpful for proposed deletion, because prod tags are not supposed to be re-added once they are removed, and the easiest way to tell if a prod tag was previously placed on an article is to look at the edit history. Also, in this case, I marked the article for speedy deletion; when it applies, speedy deletion is better than prod, because it requires less attention. I left the prod tag there, though, just in case anyone denies the speedy deletion (which I doubt will happen). Anyway, thanks, just letting you know! Mangojuicetalk

 It would be similar to including a sentence in the History section of United States saying that the Bush administration was behind the 9/11 attacks, according to some sources. Or, as you know, there are hundreds of conspiracy theories of """"Spain"""" against Catalonia, of which I could find dozens of """"sources"""", some of which, to many people """"ring very true"""", but they are not included in Wikipedia, and probably should not, as you would probably agree.
But I would be more than happy to ask (an) administrator(s) and other users with good-standing for their opinion and/or mediation, if you like.

"Gaulish language
The answer to your question in Gaulish language is that the so-called Vulgar Latin, which should be called a Latinized Italo-Celtic idiom instead because the spoken language of the Romans (Osco-Umbrian or Sabellic language and not Latin, already essentially a written language) the 'Proto-Italian' was so similar to the Continental Celtic languages that only the lexicon and the pronunciation differed a bit, and could almost be considered a dialect of Gaulish as it contained the same substratum, unlike the Insular Celtic languages. 

So, in reality no one can assert that Gaulish is an extinct language because we don't know enough about it before the Roman conquest and probably many 'Latin' words were already used by the Gauls before their first contact with the conquerers. At the most 'assimilation' could better describe what happened to that language. Both, the Proto-Italics and the Proto-Celts (Veneti) originally come from the Bell-Beaker culture and lived in a dialect continuum for a long time. In fact, Celtic is more a culture (brought by a Thraco-Cimmerian aristocracy) than a language family except for Brythonic and Gaelic languages which are both quite different from each other because of their respective substratum as mentionned above. Moreover, Proto-English (or Proto-Frisian) spoken by the Belgae was already used in Britain as well as in some parts of northern Gaul (Gallia Belgica) by the time of the Roman invasion, then the Belgic tribes just kept speaking the same language during and after the Roman time.",0

A final sidenote: not having to deal with nationalist irrationality every day really makes me much more unwilling to accept as legitimate the doublethink practices that are necessary for nationalist rationale to be used in any context.,0
""", 4 April 2007 (UTC)

I think you misunderstood me; I did not claim your arguments were """"illegitimate"""" as a whole, merely that they were less legitimate than the others. """"Legitimate"""" was probably the wrong word. You made some good points, but the request's supporters made better ones. Your opposing vote contained the following text:
Furthermore, the reason given for moving is in itself offensive. The title is objective, and the objection to it seems to be only that it doesn't adequately conform to Laval's own beliefs about what is motivating the contributors to this article. In the absence of any evidence that we're bigots, I suggest the correct move is for Laval either to demonstrate we're bigots or to apologize for slandering us.
This violates WP:AGF in the first sentence, and continues to be something akin to a personal attack. I am sure that your comments were sincere, but I think both sides allowed themselves to get riled and to speak too rashly. Your point about original research was more significant, but the term """"Anti-Quebec sentiment"""" does seem to be in fairly widespread use (I did check).
A person doesn't have to vote to voice an opinion. The instructions at the top of every poll state """"Please remember that this survey is not a vote"""", so the fact that I've inferred opinions from other parts of the debate is not a problem. It seems that 205.157.110.11 (an IP, but one with a very strong history of contructive edits) would have made an explicit vote were it not for the hot-headed wording of the proposal, and GTBacchus (an editor who I have yet to see make a mistake) also supported a very similar title. Laval, the move's proponent supported his move, of course; tjstrf proposed an alternative title, which garnered little support, and """"Marc Gévry"""" commented more on the debate than the title. This makes 3 """"votes"""" in favour of """"Anti-Quebec sentiment[s]"""", and one (yourself) directly opposed. Characterising votes for alternative titles as either support or opposition for the quoted proposal cannot be accurately done, so I omitted those from the count (but took them into consideration for the decision, of course).
I don't approve of returning to debates once they've been closed, and I really think you should move on. There is plenty of work to be done to the article, at whatever title it may be, and I'm sure you can contribute a great deal to it. Therefore, I don't wish to discuss this matter any further. I reviewed the case in good faith, and I made a decision, which I stick to. I know that this sounds harsh, but I cannot dedicate this amount of time to business which has already been settled.  14:08""",0

Hi, I am Mishae, I would like to know if the indefinite block of user You have no nipples was fair. I'm not an admin, but maybe it would have been better to put him under topic ban instead? Not to mention, your block came after a warning, after which he didn't edit that or any other article. I personally invited him to WikiProject Pornography after seeing his sandbox. Regards,  
Since all that user's edits were obvious vandalism, including the sandbox, and the username further suggests an intention not to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, this was a routine block (the kind that the template  is regularly used to deal with). Regards,   (Edgar181) 
O.K, but don't you need to give a user a last warning before you block him/her? Not to mention, in sandbox a user have a right to write what he wants as long as he is not attacking anyone and it doesn't get out.  
There is no requirement in the blocking policy for a """"last warning"""" before a user can be blocked. And there are other types of inappropriate content in a user's sandbox than just attacks on other users (and it doesn't matter if it """"gets out"""" or not either).    (Edgar181) 
O.K. By last warning I ment this. He wasn't attacking other users just writing nipples and You have no nipples (in the very end). Is it dumb? Yes. Either way, if he will get unblocked feel free to give me a ping, and I will sent him to adoption.  

Ironically, I'm unhappy that  was not indeffed, as they've only ever pushed their POV, and they've had enough warnings (edit-summary based, and one on their talk page), and a prior block, yet haven't contributed anything anywhere else.  (tell Luke off here)

 Article Feedback Tool update 

Hey Edgar181. I'm contacting you because you're involved in the Article Feedback Tool in some way, either as a previous newsletter recipient or as an active user of the system. As you might have heard, a user recently anonymously disabled the feedback tool on 2,000 pages.  We were unable to track or prevent this due to the lack of logging feature in AFT5.  We're deeply sorry for this, as we know that quite a few users found the software very useful, and were using it on their articles.

We've now re-released the software, with the addition of a logging feature and restrictions on the ability to disable. Obviously, we're not going to automatically re-enable it on each article—we don't want to create a situation where it was enabled by users who have now moved on, and feedback would sit there unattended—but if you're interested in enabling it for your articles, it's pretty simple to do. Just go to the article you want to enable it on, click the """"request feedback"""" link in the toolbox in the sidebar, and AFT5 will be enabled for that article.

Again, we're very sorry about this issue; hopefully it'll be smooth sailing after this ). If you have any questions, just drop them at the talkpage. Thanks!

It seems extremely unlikely that the plans ever called for such a comprehensive destruction of buildings from earlier expansion phases of the same plans. The historic urban planing maps also show no sign of an expansion of the airport beyond the current boundaries of its grounds.

"""

Other sources confirm the NE articles on the matter. Olle Engstrand (a professor of phonetics at Stockholm University), """"Fonetikens grunder"""" (""""The basics of phonetics""""), 2004, page 120 (my translation):

All languages have more or less significant regional variations in pronunciation. In Swedish there are differences in the spoken varieties of the standard language (""""Scanian"""", """"Gutnish"""" or """"Dalecarlian"""") as well as variations specific to certain cities [""""stadsmål""""] like """"Stockholmska"""" or """"Göteborska"""". By """"dialect"""" Swedish dialectologists are refering to those local dialects [""""bygdemål"""", """"landsmål""""] that have a straight lineage that can be traced back to Old Norse, a history shared with all other Scandinavian dialects - these form a continuum while the distinct """"national languages"""" like Swedish, Danish and Norweigan are relativly recent constructions.

This is confirmed by Claes-Christian Elert (professor of phonetics at Umeå University 1969-1988) in """"Allmän och svensk fonetik"""" (""""General and Swedish phonetics"""") on pages 34-35. Here are some selected passages (again my translation):

For a long time there has existed speech varieties within the Swedish language area which are used only in certain communities and which have only been slightly influenced by the spoken varieties of central Sweden or by the written language. These are the genuine dialects [the bold font is in the book].

[...]

The variety of language that a visitor to a community encounters most of the time is not the genuine dialect but a reginal speech variety [again Elert's bolding]. Sometimes the standard language is spoken with regional influences. Contrary to the genuine dialects, the regional varieties are almost identical to the central standard language [""""det centrala riksspråket""""] in terms of inflection and syntax. Vocabulary is usually also more or less identical, though some local deviations do exist. It is above all the pronunciation of vowels and consonants as well as prosody of the regional variations that deviate from the standard language. Generally these are similar to the genuine dialects within the same region. The regional standard varieties do not differ as much from one community to another as the genuine dialects.

If you interpret these quotes very generously (that is, not according to what the writers intended), you might be able to support SIL's claims, though not the figures. The claims that Scanian as a regional variety is a seperate language is supported only by Lång and a handful of Scanian regionalists who use completely bogus arguments  and often claim the name should be skåneländska (roughly """"Terra Scanian""""). That it would be a dialect of only Danish is also extremely speculative, and it should at the very least be classified as simply """"East Scandinavian"""". For all practical purposes it is most likely a lot more easily understood by Swedes than Danes.

 the authorities, from the top to the bottom, are replaced with Transnistrian natives, not populated by Russian citizens including OMON thugs who transplanted to Transnistria once their attempts at thwarting true democracy in the Baltics by violent and deadly means failed, and
 Russia (and Ukranian) forces completely vacate the Transnistrian territory, that is all arms, all troops, and raze all arms depots to the ground.

after every Russian in the PMR authorities is out (as in out, and out of the country);
after the foreign troops are all out (as in out of the country, and their arms depots demolished)and I don't mean Russian military retiring to become """"citizens of the PMR,"""" either;
after it is legal for a political party to be pro-Moldovan (that currently being treason); and
after Romanian is once again taught in its proper Latin script, not in some Cyrillic Soviet-era utter bastardization created purely to support the Stalinist fiction that Moldovans are not Romanians.

 Korean articles 
Hi, I noticed you were taking part in the discussion on the Talk:Hwang Seong-gyeong page. I think Bethereds behaviour is ridiculous and something needs to be done to stop his ownership of these pages. He said that he would """"change the pages back until the end of time"""" as he thinks he is right in removing any Japanese reference from """"his"""" Korean pages. There are many reasons why Japanese katakana should be included in these pages (the obvious being that the characters are created by a Japanese company and that every other article includes it bar the few Korean characters). Is there any way to call a moderator or administrator to this debate to stop Bethereds reverts? He seems to have no proper reason as to why he is omitting the information other than he believes Korea is better than Japan (I've read his user page and looked at his previous edits and he seems to be doing anything he can to promote Korea over Japan).

Blu,

I noticed you changed the logo for the Ubuntu Linux User Box.  Why?  The usage policy on Ubuntu's offical site clearly allows for such use. Besides, the logo is just that, a low-resolution image of a logo, which is allowed under fair use.  I am aware that some discussion has been going around about """"fair use"""" images in user boxes. If you changed the logo to Tux because I labeled it as a fair use image and not with some other licensing information, I'm sure I can find an appropriate image copyright tag.  
At the time I had changed it, several ongoing discussions had indicated that copyrighted images and logos available under fair use were not to be used in userspace, per Wikipedia policy.

Why the Prophet Jeremiah should not be censored out of this article 

All the abusive invective in the world doesn't alter the fact that when we consider the Jewish law, the following is relevant:
  
'How can you say, """"We are wise and the law of the LORD is with us when, in fact, the false pen of the scribes has made it into a lie.'      
Jeremiah 8:8, New Revised Standard Version 

It is relevant because:

 Jeremiah is a major Jewish prophet, so his opinion carries weight.
 Jeremiah lived over 2000 years closer to the time when the books of Moses were compiled.

The fact that another contributor is so determined to remove this evidence from the public record demonstrates that the point Jeremiah makes is sensitive. Nevertheless it is also highly relevant to any rational discussion about this aspect of the Jewish law, and for that reason should remain.

If other contributors wish to argue that Jeremiah's comment about scribal ethics is not relevant to Biblical passages about circumcision, they are welcome to demonstrate this. However, censorship is not the way to make this point.""",0

"YES MA'AM 

The Delphic Oracle is one of the earliest stories in classical antiquity of prophetic abilities. The Pythia, the priestess presiding over the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, was believed to be able to deliver prophecies inspired by Apollo during rituals beginning in the 8th century BC.[11] It is often said that the Pythia delivered oracles in a frenzied state induced by vapors rising from the ground, and that she spoke gibberish, believed to be the voice of Apollo, which priests reshaped into the enigmatic prophecies preserved in Greek literature. Other scholars believe records from the time indicate that the Pythia spoke intelligibly, and gave prophecies in her own voice.[12] The Pythia was a position served by a succession of women probably selected from amongst a guild of priestesses of the temple. The last recorded response was given in 393 AD, when the emperor Theodosius I ordered pagan temples to cease operation. Recent geological investigations raise the possibility that ethylene gas caused the Pythia's state of inspiration.[13]

One of the most enduring historical references to what some consider to be psychic ability is the prophecies of Michel de Nostredame (1503 – 1566), often Latinized to Nostradamus, published during the French Renaissance period. Nostradamus was a French apothecary and seer who wrote collections of prophecies that have since become famous worldwide and have rarely been out of print since his death. He is best known for his book Les Propheties, the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Taken together, his written works are known to have contained at least 6,338 quatrains or prophecies,[14] as well as at least eleven annual calendars. Most of the quatrains deal with disasters, such as plagues, earthquakes, wars, floods, invasions, murders, droughts, and battles – all undated.

Nostradamus is a controversial figure. His many enthusiasts, as well as the popular press, credit him with predicting many major world events. Interest in his work is still considerable, especially in the media and in popular culture. By contrast, most academic scholars maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus' quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so tenuous as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power.[15]",0

Most of us adults should know this 'image-fixed' phenomenon quite well from our inevitable dealings with jurists: They keep on clinging to their images too, no matter how crazy they are, measured by real-world standards, just to avoid to have to adapt their procedures to the requirements of the real world (thereby simultaneously keeping up their dominant position within society).",0

"""

Well, first, I reject the whole """"suitable for a general encyclopedia"""" argument, because it's just not relevant.  Wikipedia is MORE than that, because it is not subject to the constraints that have bound traditional encyclopedias.  Size is irrelevant; I've got a half terabyte external USB drive on the Linux server across the room that is smaller and lighter than a paperback (well, Cryptonomicon at least).  Assuming good bitonal TIFF document images, that will hold 5 million scanned pages; assuming moderately compact text files (PalmOS reader format) that jumps to 250 million pages.  Printing costs are also irrelevant, since it's not printed, as are writing costs (monetary and temporal), as the labor force is both free and unbounded in size.  So it's back to first principles...
The definition of """"encyclopedia"""" is a book or set of books containing articles on various topics, usually in alphabetical arrangement, covering all branches of knowledge or, less commonly, all aspects of one subject (Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1)).  Since Wikipedia is unbound by the constraints of other encyclopeidas, then I truly believe that it should cover all branches of knowledge, and cover them far more thoroughly than has heretofore been possible.  As far as sysadmin topics go, Wikipedia failed me this week; if the article on Domain Name System had even so much as a link to resolv.conf, I could have save myself a lot of digging when I set up that Linux system.  In fact, I'll probably do just that, along with showing the file format of resolv.conf to that article, now that I've figured it out.  Why?  Because it's useful information that I needed and failed to find when I looked for it.  It's not quite """"narrating the process"""", but it certainly is within the scope of an article on the DNS process to describe the steps taken by each part, and one of those steps would be """"the client checks the list of DNS servers (see resolv.conf etc.) to determine which name server to consult""""; that's all I would have needed to find the information I needed to solve my problem.
As Jimmy Wales said, Our goal...is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. ...empowering people everywhere to have the information they need to make good decisions.  That's my guiding principle when I work on Wikipedia, and I feel that the accurizing article fits that perfectly.   """,0

Harald88, you are mixing up everything again like an autodidact, and you don't want to listen. You know once again  everything in advance and much better than anybody else. What you are stating here, however, is nonsense again. The classical forerunner of SRT has been  optics of moving bodies, a discipline dealing with the observation of  point source from a moving platform, which is governed by Bradley's law of velocity aberration. A point source emits spherical waves, not plane waves.

In none of the references stated in the nonsensible Wikipedia article on the transverse Doppler effect, to which you have contributed, a proof is delivered, but it is simply asserted there that the transverse Doppler effect has been unknown in classical physics. In dozens of textbooks this nonsense is repeated without proof because authors tend to write off from one another.

'Proofs' of the nonsense are delivered in Chapter 11 of J. D. Jackson's book on clsssical electrodynamics as well as in a German book on SRT by Greiner/Rafelski who probably have copied the 'deduction' offered in Jackson's book (who himself probably got that 'deduction' from somewhere else). These 'deductions' boil down to direct betrayal of naive students, because the students are made to believe that a point source, such as a fixed star, does emit plane waves rather than spherical waves. Nobody tells them that the plane wave approximation is only an approximation and that it is, therefore, completely useless to 'prove' something ia a context of paramount importance. 

The nonsense of the 'non-existing classical Doppler effect' spreads in the literature since Einstein published in 1907 a short note, where he had stated that the transverse Doppler effect, which already Stark wanted to measure (why, if it is unknown in classical optics of moving bodies?), is """"important"""", but not that it is """"unknown"""" in classical physics. It apparently has to do with the hystery which seems to capture most people who get in touch
with the special relativity nonsense.

In reality SRT departs from classical optics of moving bodies solely for the case of longitudinal observation.

This I was going to demonstrate in the article Modern Galilean relativity.

Because of your unprofessional interference with that article I stopped today contributing to it.

Since you have the big mouth and know everything better, I suggest that you finish the article
now. """,0

Hi, thanks for the email. I assume it's the article above to which you refer. I deleted your article because it did not provide independent verifiable sources to enable us to verify the facts or show that it meets the notability guidelines. It is also now wikipedia policy that biographical articles about living people must have independent verifiable references. As a matter of policy, all biographies of living people will be deleted if they do not have references. Although you gave references, one was to a commercial sales site, which is spammy, one was your own site, and the other was an anonymous review by an unknown editor.

Articles must be neutral and encyclopaedic. This seemed to be intended to promote your autobiography. You have an obvious conflict of interest when it comes to editing articles about this subject. Thank you for declaring your interest - your honesty in this matter is appreciated. If, after reading the information about notability linked above, you still believe that you are notable enough for a Wikipedia article (and that there is significant coverage of the centre in reliable, independent secondary sources), you could post a request at Wikipedia:Requested articles for the article to be created. See also Wikipedia:Best practices for editors with conflicts of interest.

I deleted the article about the book too. The article was substantially a copyright violation, taken from Amazon (© 1996-2012, Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates). Copyrighted text is not allowed in Wikipedia, as outlined in this policy. It again did not provide independent verifiable sources to enable us to verify the facts or show that it meets the notability guidelines for books, and the links were to sales or other dubious sites.

 Conflict of Interest 

Pm_shef: This is an attempt to resolve the concerns that relate to your conduct on Wikipedia and the editing of articles that you are personally involved in.   

As you know, the official policy of Wikipedia, according to WP:NOT, is that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and that editors should avoid contributing to articles that they are personally involved in. That doesn't mean that your edits have not been neutral; rather, it means that any editing at all of Vaughan Council-related articles is inappropriate, no matter what is written. 

Here is the fulltext, from WP:NOT: 

Wikipedia is not a soapbox
Wikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not:
Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a """"sympathetic point of view"""" for every article.
Self-promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006 that: """"Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so.""""  Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles, or to articles in which you have a personal stake, is similarly unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography and Wikipedia:Notability.
Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small """"garage"""" companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. See also WP:CORP for a proposal on corporate notability.

I understand that you've written to a user that you will not be involved anymore in Vaughan-related articles. That's a commendable position. I'm sure there are many subjects and articles of interest to you on Wikipedia that do not relate to your father or his opponents. Do I understand your position correctly? And is this approach of abstention one that you permanently take? If so, I again commend that position. I trust, as I'm sure you do, that the administrators and the contributors to Wikipedia will maintain quality articles about worthy and reputable subjects.  """,0

Another worthy editor, with whom I disagree about his recent editing of what I first wrote six months ago actually gives the best evidence that clarification of the word uphold is appropriate (if not in fact needed) in this article.

As you can read above, he states on this discussion page[] that no clarification of the word “uphold” is needed because it is such a simple word (he says “If people are smart enough to access Wikipedia, they should be smart enough to understand the meaning of an incredibly common word. I'm willing to concede all of your other points, but I will continue to revert your changes if you insist on adding the word approved  twice, no less  to clarify the elementary word """"uphold"""" [emphasis added]). 

Yet, even this intelligent and well-expressed editor was confused as to the meaning. When he first edited (by removing “(approved)” as a clarification of the word “upheld”), he did so NOT because it was a commonly understood word that was incapable of being misunderstood, as he now says it is. No, his reason was the complete opposite. He changed it because, at that time, he misunderstood the meaning of the word. In his own explanation of the edit (on the revision history page [] for this article)[] he wrote his reason for removing the word “approved,” stating on December 23 the following “21:20, 23 December 2009  (upholding is different from approving [emphasis added]).”[]

He changed it because he thought the words had different meanings. He understands now, but has [briefly, no doubt, as can we all] forgotten that people, as did he, can misunderstand these terms. He is also correct that I did put that clarification twice. I did so because it seemed appropriate when I sought to present the information in a suitably short, yet accurate, fashion. However, it is rather obvious that even twice isn’t enough clarification for every time that every reader reads something. This is true for us all, even editors who take of their own time in an effort to improve Wikipedia articles.

The other editor says “If people are smart enough to access Wikipedia, they should be smart enough to understand the meaning of an incredibly common word.” I disagree. Respectfully, even intelligent editors can, and this instance, did misunderstand what they thought was an incredibly common and elementary word such as “upheld.” Please understand that this is not a personal attack in any way, and that everyone’s opinion and thoughtful efforts at editing are valuable. It’s just that the circumstances are that the very person who now says that the clarification is so completely inappropriate here that he will continue to remove such clarification every time in the future that it is restored, is the same person who originally took out the explanation - not because it wasn’t needed, but rather, because he didn’t himself understand what the term meant. We are all human. We are all learning.

The other editor is hardly alone in being human. The reason that I could quickly find so many examples of clarification of the same term, coincidently done in the same manner, is that the term (upheld) is worth using (it has a precise meaning, especially to those in the legal field), but it i",0

I notice that we have a Category:European goddesses. It would appear that most European goddesses are individual personas, just like everywhere else. I think what some writers appear to have done is gather evidence that a particular triplet of goddesses associated with fate seems to be attested across Europe (going way back to whenever).
I think a little confusion arises because this reality was expanded upon and popularised by Graves (19th century) and others, leading ultimately to pride of place for the Triple Goddess in neopaganism (20th century), and later popularised again by certain elements within the feminist movement (late 20th century).

 Please! Help with the CNN article 

Hi, I am fairly new to Wikipedia. However, in looking at the CNN article, I noticed that in the beginning (fourth paragraph down) the following statement appears: """"Among the general public, CNN has a more centrist perception.” The source for this proposition is FAIR, FAIR being a “progressive media criticism organization” whose “target invariably is bias on the right” . Needless to say, FAIR is not a reliable source. On the other hand, the academic literature (i.e., peer-reviewed, scholarly journals) is full of articles addressing CNN's bias. They have concluded that the public perceives CNN to have a liberal bias:
>Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, Harvard University, & Project for Excellence in Journalism, “The Invisible Primary – Invisible No Longer: A First Look at Coverage of the 2008 Presidential Campaign,” p. 32  (noting that “The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates—by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral.”) 
>Jeffrey N. Weatherly, et al, “Perceptions of Political Bias in the Headlines of Two Major News Organizations,” Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics (2007) (12), 91 at p. 97 (finding that “Overall, participants . . . rated the headlines from CNN as significantly more liberal than those from FOX News. . . . CNN tilted more to the left than did FOX News. The conclusion that CNN’s headlines were perceived as more liberal than FOX News’, rather than FOX News’ headlines’ being perceived as more conservative than CNN’s, is supported by the finding that overall, the headlines from FOX News were rated slightly on the liberal side of neutral. If FOX News’ headlines had been perceived as biased toward the conservative viewpoint, then the overall ratings should have exceeded 50 percent.”) 

The administrator who semi-protected this article knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that (1) FAIR is a blatently unreliable source, and - equally important - (2) actual,peer-reviewed studies suggest precisely the opposite of the proposition that CNN is perceived as """"centrist."""" Would you please help in removing the unreliably-sourced, and inconsistent-with-real-literature statement concerning CNN's perceived """"centrist"""" position (it's semi-protected)? I would also like some help in getting the aforementioned articles detailing CNN's perceived liberal bias included in the CNN article. Thank you so much for your time.   """,0

I.e. non-believers, for one, will find a link to Luther's Small Catechism odd, especially since that article doesn't mention Bach. Would you be so kind to add a few small clarifications? I.e. something like """"Luther's Small Catechism, the Catechism Bach taught to students at the Thomasschule"""" (assuming it was Thomasschule, as I have no idea) instead of a simple link. Also, Christian symbolism in Bach's works is certainly an interesting topic, and it is already mentioned in the """"Style"""" section. Perhaps one day someone will feel bold enough to create something like Musical style of Johann Sebastian Bach, and then we'd have enough space to elaborate on this aspect of Bach's work.

"Thanks for getting back to me. Like on many pages, a consensus will never form, unless people who have a fairly objective take on affairs decide to leave the page to the POV pushers. This page, like many pages of strong national interest to certain users, will forever be a battleground. I'm sure you've seen it elsewhere as well  there is a cadre of users who post on one topic only, and large numbers of them congregate around a topic of interest. They post a certain perspective on the topic, and basically exert ownership over the topic. People who come in and see what might be considered to be bias, and try to change the page, are quickly overwhelmed. Even when they are not, and achieve some sort of compromise after a long struggle, sooner or later a new account will arrive and undo the consensus.  This is exactly what happened here. (Of course, it's even worse when two interest groups who are hostile to each other try to gain control of a topic of interest  then it's world war III!  I'm sure you've seen that too.)

This is what has happened on this page and others relating to pre-Islamic Iran, a topic of considerable passion to many Iranian emigres in particular.  Many of the users who post regularly on these topics post about Iranian topics, and Iranian topics only.  It is an uphill battle to get some of the evident POV bias removed, and when it is, surely enough, along comes a new account do undo the cease fire.

 That date of """"1957"""" is not a date of publication; it is more likely a date of composition (which the site tends to use more than dates of publicationsee below).  The play was published first in 1958 in a literary magazine (Encore) and subsequently published by various publishers such as Methuen (in the UK) and Grove Press (in the US), in various revised editions.  One needs to do more advanced research to make such distinctions among possible dates of composition and dates of publication accurately.  Pinter's works have a very complex compositional and publishing history.

Also, while I understand your concerns over the article, there are bits of policy that have become standard, and while I mean no offense, it is in fact discouraged that PR firms edit the articles of people or organizations they represent (see WP:AUTO) due to concerns that a potential conflict of interest in one's editing could result in a non-neutral point of view, which is often remedied by the edits of uninvolved, neutral editors without an opinion over a piece.

British Army

Hi Buckshot06

About the British Army: This morning I got back to work and after some hours I finished the 3rd (UK) Mechanised Division, only to than find out, that everything will change again! (see here)

This is maddening! Isn’t there an official document about the reorganisation? When I made the graphics of the Australian and German Army, I based them on the future organization of these Armies (“Hardened and Networked Army” & """"Heer 2010"""") and if I could find a document, which will show, how the British Army will be structured after the “Army Plot” has been abolished, then I would do another attempt to finish the Graphic.

About the Russian Ground Forces- let’s do this -) If you have the information, I will do the graphic. What I need to know before I can begin the work is which units compromise which Brigades/ Divisions, where they are base, what kind of units they are… and so on.
Strike-through text
I.e: i had a look at the Moscow Military District and the infos that are missing are:
2nd Tamanskaya Div: Are the regiments multi- or single battalion units? Is the 147th Guards Artillery Rgt. a self proplled unit?
34th Guards Artillery Div: Which are its units? 
27th Sevastopolskaya Guards Motor Rifle Brig. Which are its units? 
20th Army: Are there any units directly under the Army Command?
4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division: Perfect- with info like this my work becomes pure fun -)
10th Guards Uralsko-Lvovskaya Tank Div: Where are its units based?
22nd Army: same question as with the 20th Army
3rd Vislenskaya Motor Rifle Div: Which are its units? 
Operational Group of Russian Forces in Moldova (Tiraspol)(formerly Fourteenth Army) 
8th Motor Rifle Brigade Which are its units? 
16th Spetsnaz Brigade: Which are its units? 
A division-sized weapons and equipment storage base at Yelnya, the former 144 Guards MRD: A Divison sized *unit? In regards to the amount of men under command or the equipment stored? 
16th Air Army
other formations and units: Which?

As you see there is a lot of work involved in getting all the information together. I did it for all the Armies until now and posted the info also on Wikipedia: i.e: Structure of the French Army, but when this information is here then I make the graphics in no time: i.e: 4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division

(ec)Hi Sheffield, with respect, I don't think consensus yet supports adding """"widely referred to.."""" """"media describe him.."""" into the lead. He's African American, self identifies as such, the overwhelmingly vast majority of RS's identify him as such (not just media, but academia, U.S. Gov't, etc.) We're talking about labels here and the fact of the matter is that the label applied to him 99%+ of the time is African American, including by the RS's that discuss his white mother and black father. There is no controversy or 'increased accuracy' that we need to account for in the lead. Plainly saying that he is the first AA President-elect in the lead, without any weasel words that may suggest otherwise is the most policy (NPOV, RS, BLP) compliant. The details of his parents are succinctly documented in the first paragraph the follows the lead.   | talk 16:49""",0

 Two birds, one stone 
Dear 206.186.8.130... I have been quite content to leave Dyukov described as a historian Novosti, the state news agency, trots out to dispute Baltic lies about history. (One of several of my edits deleted, each replaced by a more strident defense of Dyukov's credentials.) Given Dyukov's command of basic facts is worse than the factual improprieties he alleges in the film, he already commands far too much space devoted to his views. However, since English-speaking viewersto whom this encyclopedia is targetedget to see Dyukov quite often on """"Russia Today"""" (Novosti's version of CNN or the BBC News), I'm supportive of leaving his commentary in (other editors have mass deleted it). Dyukov's spokesmanship as a historian """"specializing"""" in Soviet history and in debunking, in particular, Baltic """"myths"""" (he uses stronger words in his Novosti interviews) is notable whether I like it or not. However, his POV and role in the official Russian (not independent) media must remain in the article for his presence in the article to be understood and defended.
   As for my """"principles"""", they are to representing the parties and their relationships to their establishments accurately. It's obviously simpler to delete undiscussed POV anonymous IP edits as vandalism if they have no reasonable basis in actuality. But whether you register or not, whether you choose to reveal yourself or not, any edit that portrays Dyukov as a reputable historian and ignores his incestuous relationship with the Russian state media agency will continue to be deleted as totally POV.
   Your tone of questions communicates to me a wish to be blunt. I'll be happy to oblige. Writing that Dyukov is a """"professional historian"""" here and that he isn't should be discussed elsewhere amounts to nothing but asking the editors here to ignore facts and to lie under the pretext of """"NPOV."""" —  """,0

Hi there. I hope you find the references regarding the road signage to be adequate. The pictorials are embedded deeply within the refs. The refs are legitimate, although refs are extremely difficult to find on an issue like this. But if you're well familiar with Bergen County roads, you'll know that these four-municipal directional signs are not only ubiquitous but actually very practical in navigating around the county's towns and have been around for decades in conjunction with the county's development. They also are not found anywhere else, to my knowledge. Thus, I believe they warrant mention in the article.

The freedoms we enjoy in the U.S are wonderful but they are also very dangerous. To create an unfavorable impression, it is not necessary that what is said be true.  The damage is done in the mere telling of it.  No one has felt that sting more than I.

black codes, in U.S. history, series of statutes passed by the ex-Confederate states, 1865–66, dealing with the status of the newly freed slaves. They varied greatly from state to state as to their harshness and restrictiveness. Although the codes granted certain basic civil rights to blacks (the right to marry, to own personal property, and to sue in court), they also provided for the segregation of public facilities and placed severe restrictions on the freedman's status as a free laborer, his right to own real estate, and his right to testify in court. Although some Northern states had black codes before the Civil War, this did not prevent many northerners from interpreting the codes as an attempt by the South to reenslave blacks.

A third case is 2c errors concealing 1c errors.  Often real 1c checking can't begin without appropriate citations.  Perhaps this is a subset of the second kind of problem, where citation formatting consistency causes a decline.
Jargon is harder.  Citations are a jargon driven field.  This is mostly where I'll be thinking about it.
In terms of actual line-by-line referencing, the problem is that when I want to say Burdett2009Hateful for Burdett, Example. """"My hateful dreams about ducks."""" In A Compendium of Duck Hatred. Ed. Janice Fowlloather (London: Avianloathe Press, 2009): 209-249. Often the nominator turns up with """"Janice Fowlloather (2009). A Compendium of Duck Hatred. Avian."""" or some other partial attempt made worse through use of the citation templates without understanding the basic concept behind citation for verification.  If I quote it as fn27, it breaks rapidly, if I quote it as Fowlloather2009Compendium, it should actually change.
In paying off verbosity against wordlimits, I suppose I need to shift back towards verbosity, but """"This is an Encyclopedia article you're quoting, that makes it a tertiary source, the only really reliable tertiary sources are ones aimed at an academic public, written by academics. The way we determine this is usually are do the articles contain a specific by-line by an academic specialist in the field acting as an author of that specific article you quote.  Are the articles """"signed"""".  Your citation doesn't indicate this is an academic work, by academics, signed by academics; it is an unsigned tertiary source.

 FISHERQUEEN ( Actually A TRASHY DUSTBIN ) IS BLOCKED IN LIFE FOREVER AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY 

 FISHERQUEEN IS ACTUALLY A TRASHY DUSTBIN WHO IS BLOCKED IN LIFE AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen. You are no where near a queen, but certainly are a huge ,filled with trash, dustbin. Pity you, unfortunate daft-LOSER- DUSTBIN. And the best last closing words to a daft dustbin like you are - FISH OFF""",1

While first reading this article I was slightly overwhelmed with the amount of information. However as the article progressed, I continued to see an increasing amount of methods (both right and wrong) that I recognized from first hand experience. Throughout high school I was continuously asked to tutor children (typically students between first and fourth grade) and so one of the most commonly used methods was the additive method. The children I tutored, especially the younger ones, found it difficult to distinguish when to use the multiplicative method versus the additive method. Originally I found this frustrating but reading this article, and in particular the section on the ‘Mr. Short and Mr. Tall’ experiment, made it clear as to why the kids didn’t understand. 

I am also studying astronomy in which we are studying Newton’s universal law of gravitation and hence this was one of the more interesting and appealing sections of the article for me. That being said, I think the author could have expanded upon this example by describing, for instance, the inverse square law in which tripling the distance between the objects would weaken the force of gravity by 3^2 and explaining so people who haven’t covered the subject would understand.",0

Still no explanation as to why Domer48 has gone from supporting the text on 7th October to rejecting it now. Interestingly, one of the sources used by Domer48 elsewhere uses the term """"Provisional Sinn Féin"""": Brian Feeney (2002) Sinn Féin: A Hundred Turbulent Years O'Brien Press, p. 251 - """"Neither the Provisional IRA nor its political mouthpiece, Provisional Sinn Féin, had much of an existence outside west Belfast.""""  The ''Oxford Companion to Irish History' also records the term """"Provisional Sinn Féin"""" in its entry under """"Sinn Féin"""". The reversion of the 7th October text - as well as removing the reference to the name Provisional Sinn Féin also removes reference to the connection between the party and the Provisional IRA: something that is undoubtedly notable. It would be useful if other editors would engage in discussion about this.

I recommend that you drop this. You have been asked somewhat nicely twice by Admins to either take it to WP:SSP if you had any further suspicions. Now I am giving you pretty much a final warning. Accusing a new editor of being a sockpuppet breaks WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA. There is methods to deal with sockpuppetry on WP. Use them. I also notice several comments aimed at trolling other users and soapboaxing. You are on the edge. Take care not to step over.  
1. I have not made and am not making any accusations of sockpuppetry. (Please don't confuse Domer48's wrongful and hysterical misunderstanding of my actual words with what I actually wrote.) Allegations of Sockpuppetry are WP's equivalent of a Witch hunt - and I refuse to participate in such silly nonsense.
My understanding is that neither Tyrenius nor yourself are acting as admins here unless you specifically state that you are so acting. If that is the case I will, of course, follow your advice - even though it seems perverse.
2. Had you not addressed specific remarks to me, I would have stayed silent - as you both should have done.
3. This is what I have already stated: """"I think it would be very helpful at this early stage for User:Brixton Busters to confirm or deny that he previously edited WP using different user names"""" (to his current """"new"""" user name of Brixton Busters) """" - it's entirely a matter for him whether he chooses to reveal those identities or not....""""

Codex, p. 60
I will give the specific quote from the original text, which appears to be slightly changed []:

Τον ευλογημένον Ζαχαρίαν τον διεδέχθη ο Άγιος Γεννάδιος. Ύτος ήτο Σμυρναίος και αυτός αρχιδιάκονος του Ιωαννίνων, νέος τη ηλικία δεν είχεν ευχαρίστησιν να ακούη χριστιανούς να ομιλούν την αλβανική γλώσσαν. Φιλοδίκαιος όλως πολλά. Αρχιεράτευσε χρόνους είκοσι πέντε. Έπειτα μην υποφέρων την αλβανικήν γλώσσα εις τα χωρία της επαρχίας του ευχαρίστως έκαμε την παραίτησιν και αφήσας...

The text added in the article translates this entry as: In an ecclesiastical entry .... noted that some of the Christian Greek clergy had linguistic difficulties in administrating to their congregation, as Christian villagers living within the region of Delvinë were Albanian speaking.

It's hardly enough from the original text to conclude that the villagers were in general monolinguals, indeed it claims that Albanian speech was present and in significant numbers (it doesn't also conclude that all villages were Albanian speaking). Moreover, the fact that this produced linguistic difficulties in eclessiastical administration is something that only indirectly can be concluded, since the Codex mentions that """"a specific bishop, who came from Smyrna, found it not pleasant to hear his flock speaking Albanian, beacause of the Albanian speaking villages in  his periphery, and resigned after 25 years of local service.""""

 Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Macedonia 2 

This arbitration case has been closed and the final decision is available at the link above.
All editors on Macedonia-related articles are directed to get the advice of neutral parties via means such as outside opinions and Geopolitical ethnic and religious conflicts noticeboard (WP:ECCN), especially since there are significant problems in reaching consensus.
All articles related to Macedonia (defined as any article that could be reasonably construed as being related to Macedonia, Macedonia nationalism, Greece related articles that mention Macedonia, and other articles in which how Macedonia will be referred to is an issue) fall under 1RR whenever the dispute over naming is concerned.  Editors enforcing a case where a binding Stalemate resolution has been found are exempt from 1RR.
The following users have been banned from Wikipedia  one year, one year, and six months .
The following users have been topic-banned from Macedonia-related articles and their talk pages, as defined in All related articles under 1RR: indefinitely, indefinitely, one year and, one year.

Because of this Future Perfect at Sunrise is subject to an editing restriction for one year, and is desysopped for three months as a consequence of poor user conduct and misuse of administrative tools. After three months, his administrator access will be automatically restored.
Single-purpose accounts are strongly advised to edit in accordance with WP:SPA and other Wikipedia policies. Diversifying one's topics of interest is also encouraged.
Abuse filter 119, as currently configured, logs all changes involving the word """"Macedonia"""" but does not block any edits. The community is strongly advised to consider adding a new abuse filter criterion; any instances of changing the word """"Macedonia"""" to """"FYROM"""" (the five-letter acronym, not the full phrase) shall be prevented.

One of the most fundamental groups (sometimes referred to as being part of the """"Plymouth Brethren"""" or the """"Exclusive Brethren"""" although we much prefer something along the lines of, say, """"Christians"""") refers to their buildings as Gospel Halls. This is to eliminate confusion on the word """"church"""", which technically does not mean a building, but the body of true Christians.

 An entire paragraph of paraphrases and out-of-context quotes from a single Village Voice piece.

 Guilt by association in comparing his methods to those of Dr. John Money, which is explicitly forbidden by Wikipedia:BLP#Balance. Dr. Money is not the only representative clinician; it appears he was named due to his famously poor outcome with David Reimer.
 Another guilt by association in discussing a study by Dr. Robert Spitzer (which he only published). Does the World Health Organization's opinion on a study written by someone else really belong in this article? I added context from the Times piece cited.
 Some cherry picking of negative quotes from news and journal articles, which I balanced with positive ones or responses from Zucker.

The article states that only one Libero player is allowed per team.  However, Beginning in 2008 for FIVB competitions, and beginning in the 2011-2012 for USAV competitions, two liberos are allowed per team, although only one may play at a time.  In fact, FIVB rules _require_ two liberos to be designated if a team has more than 12 players on the roster.

FIVB refernce:  http://www.fivb.ch/thegame/TheGame_VolleyballRules.htm
USAV reference: http://usavolleyball.org/news/2011/03/09/usav-rules-commission-meeting-highlights/41322

The article also states that the rule allowing Liberos to serve has trickled down to juniors competitions.  That is not entirely true.  USAV rules do not allow Liberos to serve in any sanctioned event, although AAU Volleyball does allow Liberos to serve.  Many USAV regions allow Liberos to serve in events that do not serve as USAV National qualifiers.

 Making the majority into the minority 
""""Though there has not been a claim of responsibility, previous bombings in Lahore have been blamed on the Pakistani Taliban because of their disagreement with minority interpretations of Islam, such as Sufism.[5]""""

I would like to know when the Barelvis became a minority in Pakistan. It is the largest sect in Pakistan. Even the outdated CIA fact book can verify this. It seems that alJazera does not know what they are talking about. If anyone have a doubt about the connection between Barelvis and sufis, then simply read an article about Barelvis(which is insufficient and at parts incorrect - like many other articles here). They are sufis or they have a sufi master to whom they belong(speaking on the individual level). Personally I can tell you that for a Barelvi, sufis are considered our elderly; our wise sages who we seek for enlightenment and religious knowledge. Barelvi == Sufi more or less(to simplify things for the reader). People need to stop selling their propaganda and belittling the sufis. Barelvis usually call themselves ahle sunnah wal'jamat(this would be the international representative name barelvis refer themselves as - unlike in Pakistan and India due to complexities arising due to impostors). This is the largest sect in the Islamic world(no quotation - simply based on experience and personal research); where sufis are considered as mentioned, our elderly, our sages, our spiritual guides. Hence sufi's are not some sect, but simply our respectable elderly. The sect is called Ahle Sunnah wal'Jamat. An ok translation would be """"The people of the Sunnah"""". Unlike Christianity, the right to claim of the true sect is of utmost importance for muslims due to Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w mentioning of the divide among us and that only one sect would be the truly guided one - which shall happen to be the largest one(from the hadith). Again seek out the source if you are interested. Its in the major Hadith collections. Hence quantity is an important question when it comes to pinpointing any discrepancy in this regard. Strictly speaking from an encyclopedic perspective, how can it be considered acceptable to disregard quantity ? If anyone doubts that most Pakistanis are sufis/barelvis/ahle sunnat wal'jamat. Then simply take a look at Sindh. I don't have the exact number, but its like 90-95 % sufis. Its only in NWFP that the majority are Wahabis. But that corresponds to ca. less than 10%(there are shia as well in NWFP and some other sects) of the total population in Pakistan(census 2010). How difficult is it for people to at least conduct their own research and try to separate truth from fallacy ?""",0

   Thanks for taking the time to explain Tokyogirl79.  I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

(The term constituent country being cited from the UK Government). These being as follows:
Scotland (Gaelic: Alba) is a country that occupies the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares a land border to the south with England. England (Cornish: Pow Sows) is a country that occupies most of the southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares land borders to the north with Scotland and to the west with Wales. 
Wales (;Also spelled """"Gymru"""", """"Nghymru"""" or """"Chymru"""" in certain contexts, as Welsh is a language with initial mutations – see Welsh morphology. pronounced }) is a principality that occupies the largest western peninsula of the island of Great Britain. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares a land border to the east with England. Northern Ireland' (Irish: Tuaisceart Éireann, Ulster Scots: Norlin Airlann'') is a province that occupies the northeast of the island of Ireland.

 needs balanced perspective 

Climate change should be discussed with global warming entry – they are one and the same thing.

This has to be a balanced discussion also discussing the forecasts and uncertainties in forecasting temperature / CO2 increase which are proposed as the causes of the examples of climate change that are presented.

Discuss the politicization (sp?) of the entire issue, the role of IPCC, of Gore etc.  This is very much at the heart of the attention and emphasis being given.  

Discussion of post 1950s warming does not mention the pre 1950s temperature drop that is not explained by the forcings and “predictive” climate models. 

The forecasts / predictions are major part of the actual basis for the attention and emphasis in the carefully planned publicity campaign of the IPCC.  IPCC readily acknowledges that their role is to expand awareness to provide push for policy makers.  The 90 / 95 / etc. probabilities are without merit, are not based on independent scientific fact but Delphi polling of scientists who are doing the scientific modeling.  In fact, IPCC acknowledge that it is not possible to predict the future trajectory which is why they are developing scenarios not forecasts.  Scenarios assume a set of initial values or base starting points for the forcings and forecast how these forcings will play out over time.  This does not adequately take into account technological change that is and will continue to occur.  None of this is identified and discussed in this entry.

In this regard, some analogies with Thomas Malthus """"An Essay on the Principle of Population"""" (1798), [aka """"Malthusian catastrophe, Malthusian crisis, Malthusian dilemma, Malthusian disaster, Malthusian trap, or Malthusian limit (Wikipedia)], Paul Ehrlich """"The Population Bomb"""" (1968), Club of Rome """"Limits to Growth"""" (1972), as well as Orsen Well radio case of H.G. Wells """"War of the Worlds"""" (1936) as an example of how the media can be an  effective force in public opinion.

Both in the US and UK court rulings do not allow presenting / discussing the climate change issues without a balanced view of the issues such as mentioned here.  Wikipedia entries should also be required to be required to meet the same standards in presenting balanced views. 

The need for climate change policy is  based on economic evaluation of the future pattern of costs vs. benefit.  The Stern review – which is discussed – has been strongly criticized in peer reviewed journals because of its assumptions and approaches which very greatly favor support the recommendations, which is neither scientific or intellectually honest.  See e.g., the following references.

Nordhaus, WILLIAM  Q., “A Review of the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change,” Journal of Economic Literature Vol. XLV (September 2007), pp. 686–702

economic-environmental models: Purchasing power parity or market exchange rates?,”  Science Direct: Energy Economics 29 (2007) 349–372  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

You seem to have missed the line at the very beginning: 'for current global climate change see global warming'. Merging them would be like merging the history of the United States with the 2008 presidential election...  

The global warming page in the terminology section states that global warming is an example of climate change, a subset as it were. The way these two articles are broken up is completely wrong. 122.104.2.224  

How so? Global climate change is purely the projected change of the climate. Global warming is an example of climate change - it is the heating of the climate. However, if temperatures drop, which many people believed before, that too would be global climate change. 
I do, however, agree that this page needs to be expanded.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • [[Special:Co",0

Speedy deletion of Sarah Zietlow
 A tag has been placed on Sarah Zietlow requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia.

I cannot see the Holocaust article getting being FA. Simply because it fails to address the Ownership of the Holocaust issues which sees two mutually exclusive positions, both being accepted standpoints in society. The first being the Jewish tragedy relies on motive and the second thematic would be the mechanics argument which points to the systematic killings and the disparate groups that were killed at the numerous camps. As the article sees the Holocaust as a mainly Jewish event, it would be highly unlikely that it would be featured, else to fly in the face of academics and commonly held social views.

It is not a case of also these groups were killed, it is the thematic of groups targetted, groups killed. Lest we forget the first killed at Auschwitz were not Jewish.

 Hi Duxwing,
 Sorry for the very long response time.  The sentence """"a Y such that Z exists for X"""" is much harder to decipher than the other version and because of the nontraditional order of quantifiers; in some cases it may have different meaning as a mathematical statement.  (It is also not noticably more concise.)  For example, the sentence """"An element −v ∈ V for every v ∈ V exists"""" is impossible to parse because of the strange quantifier placement.  I suggest that if you are not familiar enough with higher mathematics to understand the importance of precision in quantifier choice and order then you should tread very carefully when editing technical phrases.  (Some of the other edits you made were unobjectionable or improvements, but they were all mixed in together and I didn't want to risk leaving an incorrect technical phrase.)

A prime example is the Discovery section that actually consist of pointing out unpreparedness and to say in a roundabout way that Scott would be the only one to blame for that, no mention that he wasn't even involved in all aspects of the preparation and that contemporaries like Hugh Robert Mill, librarian of the Royal Geographical Society said Scott""""if anyone, could bring order out of the chaos which had overtaken the plans and preparations"""".. Concealing positive statements like this and only pointing out things diminuishing Scott's achievements is not only embezzling to the reader but greatly contradicts the requirements of neutrality in a encyclopaedic context. The same goes for the embarassingly biased and ashamedly one-sided Controversies article (that deliberately tells not even half of the whole story and intentionally conceals all arguments from the other side of the spectrum...). This article hadn't been linked for ages, and out of some emotional situation, he recently just added it to the Main Scott article, despite its violations of neutrality and biasedness.

Ruhrfisch fought tooth and nails to prevent me from doing this (which once again shows that he's not interested in adding any positive aspects concerning the person Robert Falcon Scott whatsoever and tries with a vengeance to prevent anyone from doing so. It is no accident that from my edits, which included mentioning aspects of misfortune like the extraordinarily base character of some of the ponies, comments about the man-hauling or statements from contemorary explorers, all of these have been removed by this single user!

I don't see how this is to be called either """"fair-minded"""", """"polite"""", correct, neutral or whatsoever.

In addition to a pretermination (Loudermill) hearing, an employee must be afforded a full evidentiary hearing, after the termination takes effect.[2] However, the scope of the pretermination hearing depends upon the scope of the post-termination hearing available to the employee. If a full post-termination hearing is available, the Loudermill pretermination hearing is minimal.

In such situations the employee would have an opportunity to respond in the pretermination hearing as long as she had available a post-termination hearing. Thus, the pre-termination hearing functions as """"an initial check against mistaken decision  essentially a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.""""[3] If a pretermination hearing is """"oral or written notice of the charges against [the employee], an explanation of the employer's evidence [against the employee], and an opportunity [for the employee] to present their side of the story.""""[4]

Dear Mr Freeman

I am writing to thank you for your letter of 21 March and hope to hear future feedback on our tumble dryers.

I wish to express my utter apology for the poor standard of our tumble dryers that you recently have received. I assure you that the fault was not of the manufacturers, but of the transport company that we hire to deliver our products. The tumble dryers left our company in perfect condition, and therefore were not properly packaged into the lorries and were damaged in the journey. As for the colour schemes, we are to believe that the tumble dryers were being delivered along side some cans of paint and must have got mixed up along the way.

We will have a word with the delivery company to sort out the problem and so future deliveries should arrive in the high standard expected of our company.

In the meantime might we interest you in some exclusive discount vouchers on future orders. Find enclosed our brochure.

Your Sincerely

 Good Result 

This is definitely a good result for the Irish Nationalist editors, and the rest of us can learn something fom it.

Well done, HighKing, PurpleArrow and the rest of you. I guess you can go now. It doesn't really matter that it's a daft title, main thing is it doesn't include the words """"British Isles"""", so job done. As for the future, there's some interesting remarks at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Military_history where HighKing et al. have been rightly rebuffed by the people who actually know about these things.

 Nonsense 
The edit on Siberian shamanism was one of my many udoes to your contribs a few days ago before I was banned. That was one of my various diatribes done to give you a taste of your own medicine of subverting, deleting and merging the talks of other editors without any rhyme or reason. I was on the edge of legality because I had never heard of Siberian shamanism (what next ? Catholic fire rituals ? -))) but it would not have taken long for some googling to come up with some insipid reason to validate my edit.

The edit on Paganism is right. Paganism is a CLASS of religions just like helicopter is a CLASS of aircraft, or planet is class of heavenly bodies. Hence your comment that """"Pagans are fewer than Hindus"""" makes little sense, because Hinduism is technically a pagan religion (in fact all Dharmic religions are for that matter). """,0

"""Views about slurs==
Hello, especially Haiduc. The material removed here  was done so partially on the pretext of the claimed existence of a slur.  

Men in pederastic relationships are accused of being necessarily materialistic and manipulative. The claim is that the older partner's interest in the younger is always purely for sexual gratification, and that beneath a guise of caring or loving, and a veneer of acceptability of endowing the younger partner with """"choice"""", these relationships are universally damaging to the youth because they are based on mutual deception. The attention given by the older to the younger is assailed as fundamentally self-interested, and the claim is made that the youths are discarded once past the age of attraction.

 Bewilderland 

The introduction includes the comment:-
""""The story is told in the form of an episodic quest, and most chapters introduce a specific creature, or type of creature, of Tolkien's Wilderland"""".

I edited the last bit to Middle-earth because:-
(1) the introduction to creatures begins with Chapter 1, which introduces Hobbits (and Wizards and Dwarves), and continues with chapter 2 (which introduces Trolls) and chapter 3 (which introduces Elves). These creatures are not limited to """"Tolkien's Wilderland"""", and in fact the individuals introduced (Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin & Co., etc.) do NOT live in Wilderland. Wilderland is properly the region east of the Misty Mountains, and Bilbo does not reach it until chapter 6.
(2) Furthermore, many of the creatures first encountered in Wilderland (e.g. Men and Dragons) are not unique to Wilderland in Tolkien's Middle-earth.
(3) I'm aware that Middle-earth in not named in the book. However most readers of Wikipedia would have heard of Middle-earth, and few would have heard of Wilderland.

"I don't object at all. I came here to bring up Capri Sun being mentioned, myself. It is directly after the mention of Powerade.

When I was skimming over the Powerade bit of the article, I thought what was being conveyed was that they had transitioned some product of there's into an aluminum can, much like energy drinks at packaged, and this was the intended gist of the statement. I didn't really think it over but now that you point it out, yes that is a bit of frivolous information. I'd also agree with you; Powerade isn't an energy drink.

Those are sports drinks, which to my understanding and recollection by common knowledge, are intended to hydrate and provide some salts to athletes. A much different task than the intent of energy drinks.

Capri Sun is just a sugary drink with a fraction of fruit juice; 10% on what I've seen. Though it could different depending on location where it's sold, or what laws dictate toward the content or labeling. The article on Capri Sun has a picture where the product advertises itself as 100% fruit juice. Every capri sun I've every noticed, states it contains 10%.
It may have however amount of juice. It isn't however, an energy drink.
If Capri Sun is an energy drink, then anything containing sugar or corn syrup is an energy drink. The term become basically meaningless. I'm slightly stroking my chin as to who may be placing those products into the article, but I do suppose it could be a mistake in good faith.

I am all for scratching them both entirely. I would need to see a persuasive argument against doing so to move my postion. I believe I'll be so bold as to just strike these two out. Anyone finding disagreement, please do post here.75.201.153.93",0

To be very blunt, I do not believe you. Checkuser data indicates with almost absolute certainty that all of these accounts are unquestionably being operated by the same person. So many questions arise now... I want legitimate answers to these:
How did some of the accounts you claim are completely unrelated to you find out about the WikiCup and sign up for it?
Why did you sign up for the Wikicup with accounts you claim you were only going to use as bots? 
How do your neighbors manage to have absolutely identical hardware and software (not common software either) installed on their computer that you do, and edit with the same mobile devices? The same with your pen pal. Strange...
Why are you letting your older brother access your accounts? 
Why did you lie to me and say that Reborn American was your brother, and that you now have his computer, when I can see clearly from checkuser data that that account has never accessed Wikipedia using anything other than an iPhone?
To be honest, if you had said from the beginning that they were all being operated by you, I would have warned you not to do it in the future, and probably left it at that. Now that I know that you are not securing your accounts from your own brother... Not to mention knowing that you are willing to flat-out lie to me.... Let me just leave it at, my attitude is slightly different now. gabsadds 

I'm not trying to lie (in fact I never lie when it comes to serious matters just like this) but I'm serious about every single detail. I'm afraid I'll just leave it like that. Please don't block me for what my brother did. I can't take anymore criticisms and hatred  because of what I am and what I think.    

Ps. These are my answers. 
1. I told them about this competition and they were very interested so I told them """"Go ahead. Do it.""""
2. I said Runs like a cheeta, stings like a bee and IronMöogol8.0 were going to be my bots and they weren't on the signup list.
3. My father works for a computer company and he built some for my neighbors and for my penpal in Tusla. The mobile devices, however, I'm confused about too.
4. I didn't. He would take my accounts by force.
5. I said my younger brother is Reborn American and I own my older brother's computer. Other than the time he used his account on my iPhone, her forgets that he has an account and edits on mine instead.
6. Everything is true.

Wikipedia's pretty popular nowadays, eh? Penpals, neighbors, and siblings. My pet goldfish is making an account soon, just so you know.  [[User_talk:IMatthew|talk]] at 

Secret Saturdays, I have reviewed J.delanoy's checks, and I concur with him entirely. So, you have a choice now: pick an account and stick to it please. You can just mention here which one you want to keep using.    

Fine, I'm sticking with Secret Saturdays.   

But I still have a question: since this matter is about cleared up, do I re-sign myself to wikicup or do they need to do an assessment?   
You will need to ask whoever is coordinating it what to do. gabsadds

Hello 

I've noticed that you have added info that Čedomir Jovanović is of Roma origin.

If you can provide evidence for your claims I would be more than happy to allow it to stay, but since I am from Serbia and know guy quite well I do not believe it, at least without some proof. I have nothing against Roma people but in a same way you can say that he is a Swede. It is baseless. So, I've removed it from an article. I hope you understand.

You can see discussion page for more details. By the way I would ask you for a favor. Since Wikipedia article you have listed states he is a of Roma origin can you ask that user to provide you a source and if he does that you pass it over to me. Thanks.

The problem with the material is WP:NPOV and WP:UNDUE.  There is also no reliable sourcing to say that this is significant to Palin's biography.

Accusations of bad faith (being a """"Palin supporter"""") and threats to edit war / retaliate are rather disruptive.  This seems to be a WP:SPA editing wikipedia solely on election-related articles.  If the brief description of the AIP is inaccurate please feel free to write a better, succinct identification of the party.  However, an extended description of the platform of a party this person left 12+ years ago is unwarranted - seems like an obvious coatrack.  Again (per my comments above), if the mainstream, reliable sources begin to say this is a serious scandal we can report it as such.  In the meanwhile a reliable source here or there does not mean it is a significant issue to her biography (particularly not considering that there is a separate article about the party, and yet another article about her political positions).  As of this moment there seem to be 36,000 current google news stories about her, and only 13 mention the AIP.

The article states that """"Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive"""", but this is not true. They are exlusive acording to the constitution of Montenegro, the constitutional charter of Serbia and Montenegro, and half a dozen separate censuses since the mid 20th century - all of which allow only one national identity to be declared. These are the raw and unbiased facts (not speculation). On the other hand, it is true that a number of Serbs and Montenegrins may believe that they have both identities - but there is no modern census nor constitutional basis that can support a statement such as """"Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive"""". Many Montenegrins do not feel to be Serb, and never pronounce themselves as such. You can not force national groups to """"be Serb"""" if they do not feel so and never declare as such.

""""However the number of Montenegrins does seem to be in steep decline since the introduction of the category by the Communists on the 1948 census"""" seems to imply that the Communist regime declared the nationality of citizens in polls. This is not true, as citizens declared their nationaility in polls, individually. In fact, the Communists - for the first time allowed citizens to declare their nationality as Montenegrin - by introducing the category, which is more important. If it stands like the previous user wants it to stand, then we must add a sentence stipulating that the """"Serbian ruling dynasties in the pre World War II Yugoslavia banned Montenegrin citizens from declaring their nationality as 'Montenegrin'"""" This is as true as the Communist quirp, as the Montenegrin option was obviously not allowed before World War II.

The article states that MOC was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920. 
The article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. 

The statement """"over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""" is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that """"most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""", but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.

You can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that """"all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918."""" This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in """"its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church"""" it is not balanced. Also, the statement """"its following is small to the point of non-existence"""" needs to be based on fact not fancy. Do you have an official census of followers, or is this based on the fact that you are a believer of the SOC?

The sentence """"The validity of the referendum was not confirmed by international observers as the allegedly free and democratic vote, in fact took place during wartime in the former Yugoslavia."""" is true. So I leave it. Of course, I agree to change """"international"""" into """"OSCE, EU and US"""" - as the referendum may have had international monitoring from Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, Byelorussia, and Russia.

"Gasiorowski co-author Malcolm Byrne edits the NSArchive's Iran documents. This one, dated is directly relevant] to this Wikipedia article. This is Byrne's comments about the linked state department report to Eisenhower, which you have to click to read as Byrne does not summarize it.
Memorandum for the President (discussing behavior of the Shah, Gen. Zahedi and Winston Churchill immediately after the coup), Memorandum from the Department of State, top secret, circa August 1953

Prior to the 1979 hostage-taking episode, the most contentious issue in U.S.-Iran relations was the 1953 coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq, which the CIA and British intelligence helped to instigate. Numerous questions remain about the coup itself, its impact, and the circumstances which brought it about. To what extent was Mossadeq leading his country down the path toward communist subversion? Could the coup have succeeded without substantial Iranian public dissatisfaction with Mossadeq’s policies? Did key Iranian political and religious figures, wittingly or not, receive CIA payments in return for stirring up the population? What effects did the coup have on the future development of internal Iranian politics, including possibly radicalizing anti-Shah and anti-American opposition elements with consequences that would not be foreseen until the revolution itself?

The search for answers will have to wait at least until more of the documentary record is available in both Iran and the United States. Unfortunately, a portion of the record on the American side will never be recovered because CIA operatives, according to former Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey, destroyed them in the 1960s. The surviving files remain locked away from public view on the grounds that their declassification, even 46 years later, would damage the national security. Because of the obvious public interest value and historical significance of these materials, the National Security Archive in May 1999 filed suit against the CIA to demand their release. The suit is still pending.",0

Concerning the following part of your message...These are things I already talked about weeks ago. Obviously you didn't bother reading what I wrote, and you still haven't read any of the Wikipedia documentation for contributors.
WP is a free and open encyclopedia, that anyone can edit at any time. None of its articles are ever finished, they can always be corrected, or deeply reworked. 
It's not my problem if unappropriate edits were made before I decided to modify the article. There has not been any consensus discussion that had approved your section, but anyway I'll note that even  consensus can change. As you can see, WP is based on flexibility.
And I think I have argued enough, I have explained enough why I considered your section had to be replaced. Honestly, I have not mentionned any personal problem against you or any other questionable motivation, I only remarked that rules had been ignored during the writing of that section, and thus it needed to go.
So, to finish with all that, it is not up to you to decide which article can be edited and which cannot be, or which contributor can edit which article. Because these articles do not belong to you. They belong to Wikipedia, and as I'm a part of Wikipedia, I'm also entitled to modify this article.
You've also the right not to agree with certain edits. In that case, to enforce your opinion, then you need to justify it and to explain what aspect of the rules could prevent a certain edit to be made. However, you do not have the right to prevent edits from being made just because you feel the article belongs to you and that you think your contributions are just perfect and don't need improvement.
You have no right to declare an article closed to further modifications just because you like it the way it is.

What really strikes me in your behavior, is that you actually don't give a damn about the content. Not once since you came to this talk page you bothered to argue about the actual content being discussed, nor tried to show if the rules would allow it. No, what mattered for you was only to find ways to assert your domination on articles. You're not fighting to justify or find qualities in the content, you're just fighting for a right to control articles, to maintain your version as the definite and perfect one, and to prevent people you don't like to touch articles.

This is completely anti-wikipedian. So read No ownership of articles and please stop disrupting WP. If I have to go through a dispute resolution process to make you stop, then I will do it next time you revert me again. 
And as I don't see any content discussion here, I consider this debate finished and I won't waste my time answering your claims of ownership.  """,0

External Memory
I believe that the External Memory section should be broken into two separate sections or more firmly defined within the same section. One on """"Self Identity"""" and using external objects to identify one's self, and """"External Memory"""" being stored memories and information. Here are my reasons.

Self Identity:
In """"Stand Alone Complex"""" Episode 25, Batou says to Kusunagi about her watch """"No matter how many prosthetic bodies you went through, this was the one thing that was always ticking away the same time as you, right? In this time that's far too fleeting, people entrust memories to external devices because they want to set down proof that can identify them as a unique individual. For you, isn't that watch the one external mnemonic device that can identify the person you've been up until now?""""

This says that external mnemonic devices are to create a sense of unchanging self in a world where you can switch physical bodies on the fly. As biological humans our forms are fixed and unchanging for the most part and our self identity is tied deeply with that. In the GiTS universe, that is not true and you must tie your self-identity to external objects such as a watch or weight training to distinguish yourself from the rest of the identical mass produced cyborg bodies and create a sense of individuality. There are references in SAC 2ng Gig Episode 8 about cyborg food satisfying the brains cravings and as a reminder of times before becoming a cyborg. In SAC 2nd Gig Episode 11 there is a store that keeps and maintains external mnemonic devices that remind their owners of their own personal memories. All of these """"external mnemonic devices"""" are used to trigger memories in one's self, but can not relay detailed information to a stranger.

External Memory:
External Memory is exactly that, memories and experiences that are stored """"offline"""" onto a hard disk or such. If you posses a cyber brain, there is a definite separation of mind and body since your brain case can be removed and put into a new body. Since there is an electronic separation, the signals received from the senses (touch, taste, etc.) can be recorded and replayed at any given time. Thus, you could record important events such as your wedding day and replay it as if you were actually there anytime you wish. Your external senses turn off, and you’re fed recorded sensory information. Better than any video camera recording, your feeling the heat of the sun, the breeze, your brides’ hand trembling as you slip the ring on her finger, etc. Storing these memories also allows others to play them back and experience them as well. This would be a highly valuable technology for all areas of use; fully immersive gaming and movies, virtual business meetings that feel completely real, instantaneous access to wikipedia anywhere. In SAC 2ng Gig Ep 23, Batou talks about using Kusunagi's external memories to keep Gohda talking in Ep 22. He also talks about peeking at her external memories regarding Kuze. In SAC Ep 10 Ishikawa experiences Batou's memories from the murder scene. SAC Ep 21 the whole team replays Togusa's memories from the Sunflower Society office when he was shot.

Nowhere in the main article and its classifications of FMG types to I find any reference to that. The practice is combined in Type I along with removal of the clitoris.

My second point is that the notion that women are often stronger proponents of FGM than men seems to me to be a dangerous one, because it seems to me that it misses an essential point: that in patriarchal societies, women often, and even systematically, collaborate with the male-dominated power structure.

Hi.  You recently posted the following on my wall:

For the last time, please stop revert warring. Users who persistently revert to their preferred version of the article may be blocked from editing for disruption. In particular, there exists the three revert rule: except in case of vandalism or other purely disruptive edits, a user may not revert the same article more than three times within 24 hours. (You have violated this rule, so I strongly recommend you to stop editing the page altogether and take the issue to the talk page. Otherwise, I am going to report you at the revert warring noticeboard.)

Emphasis mine.  Now, I have to say that I'm rather baffled, because if you've actually read what it is that I've been removing, it is surely completely obvious that the content in question is not encyclopedic material, but rather a highly selective and biased viewpoint - ie that a majority of people in a certain political party favour a certain political point of view.  You will notice that I haven't been touching the section immediately above it which details the actual political parties which have officially come out against AV, since that is a matter of fact and has been presented in a properly factual way.

So what's there to say on the talk page?

 Camille Paglia: sex-positive feminist 

Here are the supporting links you asked for, you stupid twit!

http://www.lotl.com/content/paglia.htm

http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Sex-positive_feminism

If you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then I will just post the relevant sections here:

Camille Paglia: """"On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism."""" 

Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of """"traditional"""" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a """"respectable"""" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.""",1

It's expressly forbidden to listen to it? I think your going off here. This website is about music, I think it is important to actually hear what we are talking about. In fact references to the actual vinyl releases for most statements on this page hold more merit than books or articles. Why? Articles written on Trance are highly suspect and not scholarly sources. Even if they were written from some 'reputable source', half the time it is written by some nerd who has it completely wrong, or interviewed by some DJ who has an adgenda to 'attach himself' as some creator. Much like anything else they are opinions. The actual vinyl records themselves and the dates they were released are more relevant than any book. (I can't remember how to do the line break sorry)",0

I then studied physics at the University of Canterbury, under Prof. Roy Kerr, the rotating black hole theorist. I've kept in touch with a few of those guys over the years, and they've introduced me to certain other """"big names"""" in physics. I bailed out of the academy before gaining a doctorate, preferring a broad interdisciplinary education, and disgusted by the stress, pressure, politics, and the close-minded arrogance of certain professional academics. I had a fun life instead, and followed my curiosity about gravitation, astrophysics and cosmology in a totally relaxed way. Over the past decade or so, I've been privy to hearing about some very exciting developments in theoretical physics, particularly with regards to the unification problem. I can't say too much, because *cough* Nobel *cough*. If, just saying, somebody (hypothetically) had actually nailed the spin-2 boson, but hadn't yet published anything until it's mathematically robust, peer-reviewed, etc, then it's (hypothetically) highly likely that the solution would involve a mathematical toolkit comprising complex dimensional analysis, multi-dimensional special & general relativity, loop quantum gravity, E8 Theory, etc. Just wildly speculating here, but it's the 100th anniversary of Einstein's publication of GR — could be a very big year for physics.

"""== Blood fetish ==
Regarding blood fetish: please don't suggest to people that:
 - a common way of finding out whether a person would be safe to engage in bloodplay with is for them to go to their local blood donation organisation, who check blood if it is safe and contains no diseases before it will be stored.
Using a blood donation organization as a proxy STD test is highly irresponsible; if the testing is not 100% perfect (and in never is), and the person trying this is positive (and presumably anyone who is considering doing this considers this to be entirely possible), they will almost certainly (because of pre-test blood pooling, and the very large blood volumes involved) infect one or more unwitting third parties with a potentially lethal disease.

Instead, they should get tested at their local sexual health clinic.    

People just wanting to make sure are no more likely to have an STD than other first-time blood donors.. I don't see your point: If that kind of carelessness goes on things would happen *anyway*  (Α⇔Ω ¦ ⇒✉) 

It's reasonable to assume that people who take part in high-risk activities are at higher risk than other members of the population. In epidemiology terms, it's assortative mixing among people with high risk tolerance; people who take part in one high-risk activity are more likely to take part in others, including taking part in these activities with multiple partners; and no, you can't trust your partner who tells you """"I've never done anything like this before, either"""". Consider the outbreaks of HIV in the regularly-tested adult movie industry; this in a population that take part in high-risk activities, and yet are all tested monthly.   

Hmm I guess that makes sense, kinda

I would be interested in reading if you feel like creating articles for """"assortative mixing"""" and """"risk tolerance"""" maybe  or   (Α⇔Ω ¦ ⇒✉)

I'm not familiar with the article or the subject of its concern, but I fail to see how saying """"X does Y"""" constitutes an actual endorsement of Y.  If such a method is indeed commonplace then, regardless of the advisability of such method for practitioners of said activity, it should be included as part of the article on that activity.   

Karada, I think you miss the point here.  Just because certain behavior is inadvisable does not mean Wikipedia should not state that people engage in it (if indeed they do) and describe it.  Certainly, the encyclopedia should not ENDORSE it (but then again, neither should it endorse anything elseNPOV and all that), but simply stating that it happens and describing what it is hardly constitutes an endorsement.  If we were to remove all content that describes inadvisable behavior, then we would also have to remove Collectivism, Fascism, Socialism, Christianity, Communism, Totalitarianism, Anarchism, Democracy, New England Patriots, Detroit Pistons, and Houston Astros.   

It's also worth noting that there are some bloodborne diseases that we can't yet test for.  (Prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease comes to mind.)  In addition to spreading these diseases to one's blood play partners, one would then potentially infect one or more innocent bystanders each time one donated blood.  Most jurisdictions also bar donations from individuals who have recently (in the last 12 months) come in contact with another person's blood.  Lying to the nurses when they ask about this stuff could conceivably make you civilly and/or criminally liable for any morbidity or mortality resulting from a tainted blood donation. (talk)

"The article should be unprotected on 25 October . After the article published on Le Monde newspaper , it's been recalled on the French talk page that hiding specific dimensions of a topic is considered WP:POV . The current montage doesn't even show the actual city, only a collection of lifeless landmarks close-ups. For the matter, this has raised enough concerns in France for the story to be also mentioned on a major radio, Europe 1 . This is why, I believe the better way to calm things out is to go for the conservative option which is to use the same image in the English version than the one used in the French version. An image which is a good consensus as it does show the Eiffel Tower, the undisputed symbol of the city, but also its urban surrounding landscape and its full dimension as a metropolis. That's the only way in my humble opinion to reach WP:NPOV in this case.",0

Bus stop, this statement, """"Christian proselytizing shouldn't be pursued on Wikipedia. That is exactly what the inclusion of a Jew in the Christian List of converts to Christianity is all about"""" is proof that you are not yourself approaching this discussion in good faith. On that basis, I very strongly urge you to cease from further comments based on your existing POV, as you are completely and utterly failing to assume good faith on the part of any other editor involved in the discussion and clearly using your own point of view as the only relevant matter, again without any sources cited, yet another rule of wikipedia, that I can honestly say that you have demonstrated a disregard for the rules of wikipedia. This blatant demonstration of your own lack of objectivity is I think sufficient cause for you to recuse yourself from any further discussion of this matter, before you once again cause further action that I believe we would all find regretable.

"Mediation 

Users here should be aware that a mediation on this topic has been opened at Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2010-03-26/Murder of Meredith Kercher. Everyone is welcome to participate, and participating does not place any requirements on you to do anything - Mediation is a way to find a consensus everyone can live with.   
There are a few factual developments due in the next few days—the filing of appeals by all the parties (one of which was filed yesterday). I assume there is no problem in our adding a brief update of these events to the article, to keep it current, while the mediation takes place, is there? Thanks.   

Ooops. I added an edit with responsive info to Bluewave's last edit before I read this notice that mediation had started. I thought it was starting after April 29. I agree with Bluewave that there will be a lot of new info next week, so I think we need to clarify whether that new info can be added, given that the mediation will not be officially starting till after April 29.   

Anyone can edit this article however they want. I don't have magic police powers as the mediator, I have magic powers of not caring about this article and being able to broker an agreement everyone can live with.

"Kosova was NEVER Serbia 

Look, if Kosova was in Serbia, Serbia would have never invaded it, and the west would not have driven them out would they. Noel Malcolm's article is precise that in 1912, Serbia occupied Kosova. It was not a liberattion because the 75% then-Albanian majority never welcomes them. It stayed occupied until it joined Yugoslavia in which it and Serbia were federal counties. This is sourced everywhere, so why do Serbo-nationaliosts continuously revert these edits???",0
"I'd like to try to help. Could you explain your perspective on why you were blocked, and can you think of anything you could do to remedy the concerns that led to the block?   
Thanks for your kindness. I could hardly explain the critical facts/reasons of blocking, since, if you read my rather long discussions above, it appears that, I still have to ask the blocking administrator, the details (terse facts of how, what, when, where, circumstances, from the very short time of about 1 day and a half, I had been warned not to add in my edits, the legal name and age of User:Cma, until the time I was blocked). 
Unfortunately, I cannot find the links of the ANI. I will have to prepare a rather terse but good argument for the appeal. Note that when I posted the template, instead of submitting the reason as mandated by template, I asked for time to submit the reasons or grounds, hence, automatically, the declining administrator denied my 1st appeal. I know the rules, and that resulted to outright dismissal of the first appeal; but I can file another appeal, provided, I will not abuse the rules on multiple appeals. 
If you please, I need to email you in confidence, on how you can help me. There is a process amid your vast experiences as administrator. All I wrote above are true and correct in all honesty amid the incredibility of some of my allegations. I cannot, however, reveal here some sensitive informations, which, might prejudice or affect the non-Wiki or off-Wiki processes that I had contemplated or had begun in utter secrecy to protect the sanctity of the processes, Wiki, wise or otherwise. Hoping you will trust me to convey my messages to you by email (or you can create a new email just for this). A final note for this Sunday - since I was born, my philosophy is just to look at the good aspects of the other person, and to disregard or ignore the negatives. I concentrate on my work, and I do IGNORE all negatives. People fall in the traps or nice works they erect to put down a good worker, editor or personal. Karma is mathematically accurate IN TIME, while curse is supreme and has no boundaries. I desire that you read between the lines. Advance Merry Xmas.",0
"As previously written in discussion, per wikipedia’s own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  “Lessheard vanU”, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.  

Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...

Other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and “Chris Mann”.   We have documented that they say one thing, yet practice another.   We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.   We contributing writers also wonder just how many editors and administrators have a conflict of interest to various articles.   So since you  “Lessheard vanU” have personally chosen to block IP addresses and made false allegations against me and other contributing people, we are requesting clarification.   When did Blackpearl14 become owner, controller and self judge of certain wikipedia articles?  If you believe that Blackpearl14 owns and has absolute control over Pirates of the Caribbean articles, then please state that is the policy.  Why is Blackpearl14 allowed to violate wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose?  Why are other editors and administrators upholding double standards?  For you can’t have double standards, as the wikipedia written policies detail a cooperative community effort for articles and, it’s suppose to be neutral. 

Furthermore, there is no way to discuss nor talk about the reckless actions of Blackpearl14 without saying and describing what they are.  Yet, immediately, Blackpearl14 has wrongly and irresponsibly calls anyone placing anything critical or changes to certain pages she had appointed herself as self controller of, as “vandals” and outright claims that she is being “attacked”, and then goes to her peers with which to delete the talk and discussion,  leaving only the editors and administrators’ comments and self bias online, while blocking IP’s.   What is shocking that you don’t know who I nor other contributing writers are.    Why are Blackpearl14 actions being upheld?    Why is her emotional state, calling herself various names in fantasy as she selfishly promotes her personal cause to glorify and promote a cause for her love for Pirates of the",0

"Please, this is not censorship. In fact, the usage of other languages is mentioned in the main article. If it were censorship, all matter pretaining to the other languages usage in Malaysia would be removed. In fact, in the first paragragh, there are SEVEN ways how to call Malaysia in various languages and scripts.

 The official language box can only have Malay because Malay is the only official language. Unlike India, South Africa, or Canada or Singapore of which their constitutions say there are more than one official language, Malaysian constitution explicitly says only Malay is the official language. Thus - only Malay in the official language box. Wikipedia's job is to spread information, not make new information. See WP:NOR.

 For usual convention, see Template_talk:Infobox_Country. For general rule of thumb on naming, see Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English). In fact, if we were to follow WP's guideline tightly, the first paragragh SHOULDN'T list the other SIX languages/scripts. An implicit compromise was made earlier on this if you cared to check the page history. If you push this, it's likely that, according to WP:UE, all other languages will be removed, undoing the implicit compromise.

 And for precedence from other article, see Portal:Montreal/Discussions/English Names/Draft policy. Also, Wikipedia_talk:Language_policy. See also United States of America - no Spanish despite Spanish is the second most spoken language in the US. How about Indonesia? As for your precedence, could you point to any where the constitution says there's only one official language while there are many other major spoken languages that are included in the box?",0

"Reverting several edits by User:Toddst1 

I have removed the Trinity reference as I believe it falls into the category of potentially libelous material.  It makes claims of possible malpractice that, if true, should be taken up in court, not fought out here on WP.  Also, I disagree with simply repasting the conflict of interest, advertising and other tags.  The puffery and peacock words are gone.  I took them out myself.  I have no connection with Ousterhout.  I haven't even talked to him or anyone on his staff in perhaps 10 years.  Finally, I disagree with removing the sentence describing what he does; the patient accounts make it clear both what he does and that he often does it in a single day of surgery.  I do concede it's worth citing his book in support of the statement that he developed the procedures in the 1990s.",0
