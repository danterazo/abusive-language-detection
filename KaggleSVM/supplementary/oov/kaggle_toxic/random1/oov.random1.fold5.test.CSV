Hmmm. I was actually writing a response as you sent yours. Oh well. For the record, my response was this:

Resurrecting articles is frowned upon, yes. We might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one, however - though of course we both know that there's no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did - there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches. Changing the name would be nice but I'm not sure what we would change to...the game didn't really have a """"name"""" like the Ballet on Ice or any such, and there are limited other ways of naming the article.

Making this subpage was a decent idea, you just got unlucky in that it's something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against. Honestly I can say I've never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so I have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a community-wide shrugging of the shoulders. Certainly there's been no AfD nomination yet, which is a start. I have to say I somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article (i.e. not keeping the subpage) but I don't have strong feelings so I'll run with whatever works. If it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like Category:Football matches (I have no idea if that exists, it was another example) and Category:FA Cup and then probably into a new category for City matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own. That category would then have to be categorised so it wasn't just an orphan. I don't know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but I suspect it's not encouraged, so that idea might be rejected if (whoever did it) couldn't find more like-minded articles to categorise into the same. I don't think it being categorised would really affect anyone's opinion of the article though. The one thing that might affect peoples' judgement right now is that it will (in its present form) show up in categories as """"2003–04 Manchester City F.C. season/Spurs 3-4 City"""" or however the subpage is actually named, given the / in the name.

Yes, I'd say it will currently be located in an overarching """"please categorise these pages"""" category. I don't know how long it would take for it to get sorted, but it would probably be put somewhere generic. Better to do it ourselves, I guess.

Sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but I was answering the points as they came and...well, better English just didn't quite flow from my fingers as I typed. Hopefully I addressed all your points. I'll settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it, though I think that page would be best served by being redone - with as many citations as possible - and expanded upon, so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society, so to speak. Having an article AfD'ed isn't a permanent sign that that article should never exist, it's merely a suggestion that it shouldn't exist in the state it's in. Generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and/or level of detail is substantially improved.

As for the Charity Shield, I always considered it a notable trophy. Yes, it's a single game, but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place (ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play). To this end, I'd consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it. Similarly, would you question the worthiness of the European Super Cup? In fact, because some teams initially didn't enter, City were instrumental in making the Charity Shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice. You could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it, we should be the ones most ardently defending it.  Talk """,0

 Distribution of Obscene Material to Minors 

Dear Anthere-

I am very pleased with this service, and have used it a great deal.

Unfortunately, it occurred to me to check on some of the articles that my children might utilize, and was quite badly shocked.

From what I can tell, this site is not in compliance with the applicable regulations of the State of Florida (or my own state, Virginia) concerning the distribution of pornography to minors.  Obviously, that is a decision to be made by the appropriate legal authorities.  Given that I do not wish to be complicit in what is apparently an illegal activity, I am ending my contributions to this site.  It is my hope that this encyclopedia will be a resource for our children as well as ourselves.

I would very much like to continue to participate, and I certainly recognize the impossibility of immediately censoring any article which breaks a law anywhere.  At the same time, reviewing your policy pages it appears that a very few people are responsible for this behavior, and that no coherent policy is in force.  Additionally, given the size of the effort, it is difficult for me to appreciate that the word """"consensus"""", which appears quite often, is being used appropriately.

While I obviously worry for my children's welfare and upbringing, I am more concerned, at this juncture, in being involved in an activity with appears to be illegal (to whit, a class 3 felony in the state of Florida).

I understand your policies on censorship.  At the same time, most pornography web sites carry disclaimers regarding """"you must be 18 years or older to enter, click here to so state"""".  Given that there is no such disclaimer, and that the inclusion would harm the effectiveness of this site, I am at a loss for how you should proceed.

I have, on my user page, outlined the various agencies to whose attention I would like to bring this matter to, and offer you, as Chairman of the Wikifoundation, the opportunity to discuss this with me before I take these actions.  I am quite sure that the majority of members have no interest in participating in an activity which would appear to be other that what it is:  an encyclopedia.

My best wishes for yourself and your family.

Well, 4twenty42o, I certainly don't put on any show here, but if you find it amusing, please have a laugh. Certainly I don't see any fun in it whatsoever. I sure hope that NeilN would take another approach and not jump the gun as he certainly did this time. Also, yes, I am frustrated, and I most certainly have the best reason in the world for that. Mario Roering is not only lying, violating my copyright, slandering, posting defamation etc. here on Wikipedia harming Genseiryu and myself etc. but he does so with dedicated pages in my name on his own homepage and other sites on the Internet. Keeping up with Mario Roering and posting complaints and requests for removal of content on sites such as YouTube, free webhosting etc. is a full time job. Mario Roering has absolutely no just cause for doing what he does, and his involvement here at Wikipedia is no different from his exploiting every other possible way on the Internet to slander me. On the contrary. That is why I do not need anymore crap from anyone, and perhaps I do tend to sort people a little too fast, even though their actions may not have been ill intended, but perhaps the last situation illustrates quite well exactly why I tend to do that? Another good example is when both Mario Roering and I were blocked a few weeks back, Mario Roering was unblocked just an instant later, but I was not, even though we posted the exact same reasons for requesting the unblock. Ever since 2005, when all this started, Mario Roering's candy-talking, deceits and lies have won him favors here on Wikipedia from the admins and others. The last action from NeilN would in my best opinion constitute yet another one such favor. I have never ever postulated, that these favors were done or initiated on purpose, but I have, and I still do claim, that lack of interest for fairness, facts and true intentions, makes this kind of manipulation by Mario Roering possible. And it should not be possible. EVERYONE should be equal to rules and regulations, but for Mario Roering, on mcuh more than one occasion, that has indeed not been the case. Mario Roering has been able to continue his deceitful and ill intended ways on Wikipedia for almost 5 years now. When will it ever stop? As long as it is this easy for Mario Roering to manipulate everyone he wants to, I cannot see the end of it. Even though I still believe that Mario Roering was using NeilN, and that NeilN did indeed jump the gun here siding with one party, instead of issuing equal consequences for both, I will let this one go and """"reset"""" the system.

This is inaccurate, Tiger Woods never claimed to be Asian, he identifies himself as a mixed race person, not as an Asian.

Constance Cumbey Update on March 5, 2005 at 10:44 p.m., E.S.T.

Squeakbox's allegations about Nazism and editing a Rastafarian page (to the best of my recollection I have never been to such a page  my knowledge about Squeakbox's Rastafarian sympathies came from his own Wikipedia page)are nothing short of libelous and outrageous.  Obviously he has never read my work.  Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same.  Nazism was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself.  Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of """"cleansing actions"""", """"master races"""" and """"aryanism"""" were standard fare in all occult reading  both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists.  As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures.  The Jews were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by Lucis Trust / Lucis Publishing Company.

If you look at the Mugabe you will find the situation is more complex than 'anonymous vandalism'. User:Bakersville is currently under a 24 hour block for 3RR (this is not his first time), and the things he complains of as 'vandalism' are in fact reverts of his repeated additions to the article. Other users have stated that Bakersville's  additions are in fact copyvio, and it is certainly not obvious that they are appropriate to the article, or better than the versions he is reverting.

Hello

Thank you for your report to WP:AIV.  However on this occasion I have had to deny the request.

The user you reported to AIV has only made one edit to Wikipedia and was already warned for that by anti-vandal bot .  I appreciate that the edit was to a BLP and contained profane language but we would not normally block someone after just one edit, doing so would be considered very bitey as can reporting someone after one edit.

In this case the editor hasn't even edited after ClueBot's warning so I'm not altogether sure why another warning was issued.

Finally, when making a report to AIV in the future, please do not quote the vandalism.  Because the vandalism contained profane language part of your report to AIV has had to be removed from the public archives.  Any question please ask me on my talk page.",0

Sigma II-65 was held by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September 1965. The game results predicted that so long as the communists maintained the guerrilla tactic of picking when they wished to fight, and they had safe haven over the borders of Cambodia and Laos, they would not suffer sufficient casualties to end the war. Both bombing campaigns then in progress, Rolling Thunder and Barrel Roll were deemed to have limited effect on communist operations. General William Westmoreland's strategy, as expressed in his 1 September 1965 mission statement was based on attrition. The Sigma II-65 results contradicted that; as a result, Secretary of Defense Robert S. MacNamara began to doubt Westmoreland's expertise.Addington, p. 94.

 Disney Channel Controversy 
On December 23, 2011, a rebroadcast of the episode """"Party It Up"""", where a female character complimented CeCe's brother, Flynn, with the line """"'I could just eat you guys up...well, if I ate"""" aired on the channel that evening. Former Disney Channel star Demi Lovato, who left Sonny with a Chance in the fall of 2010 for counseling because of personal issues, commented on the episode, criticizing the network through Twitter for including a joke about eating disorders when she had struggled through the issue herself, and as one of the reasons for leaving the company's fold. Disney Channel's public relations account responded to Lovato by stating that that episode and an episode of So Random! which had an eating disorder joke would be pulled from the network's airing cycle and reviewed further.https://twitter.com/#!/DisneyChannelPR/status/150418514426081281 Later in 2012, the episode started airing regularly on Disney Channel with the offending joke removed.
Disney Channel did not broadcast """"Quitting Cold Koala"""" on its originally scheduled date of May 17, 2013 and showed a rerun of """"Kids Don't Wanna Be Shunned"""" instead. The episode did, however, appear on the Disney Channel website, """"WATCH Disney Channel"""", and on """"Disney Channel On Demand"""", the channel's video-on-demand service. Disney Channel announced on their Facebook page """"We are removing this particular episode from our regular programming schedule and will re-evaluate its references to gluten restrictions in the character's diet"""". The edited version of """"Quitting Cold Koala"""" aired on July 5, 2013 as part of a 2 episode spectacular. All gluten jokes were removed in the revised version.
On January 28, 2014, Disney Channel announced that a TV episode of Good Luck Charlie will feature two lesbian moms in """"Down a Tree"""". This caused a protest from the conservative group """"One Million Moms"""" who told the Disney Channel company to not include it. Despite the protest, Disney Channel featured it anyway. Other people including actors Miley Cyrus and Evan Rachel Wood praised the episode and supported it.""",0

But, in general, there is also some ambiguity between tensors and pseudotensors (or between even and odd) when it comes to integrands.  An example in one dimension, when  and  is:

The first integral is equal to either of the other two integrals.  In the second integral the integrand transforms like a tensor (or odd tensor) density, but the integration limits are no longer from lower to higher; in a higher-dimensional example they would be no longer right-handed.  In the second integral the integrand transforms like a pseudotensor (or even tensor) density because we have kept the integration limits in proper order, −b < −a; in higher dimensions we would say that we are maintaining right-handedness.

Sarah argues, """"What they are commonly called is what we should reflect here. Any inhabitant of Ireland who assisted with information given to the British was an informer."""" She avoids my earlier point. 'Commonly' has to include, in Ireland, Protestants and Unionists (who were themselves British) and therefore the concept is not common currency unless you regard Protestants as people of no consequence at all in the matter. Can you inform yourself?
And was it in 'common' use in Ireland that you would call someone who had reported a rape or a stray cow an informer? 
Sarah's other point that """"Protestants who openly supported the Republic were never killed. So it wasn't a sectarian matter"""" is risible. As if you execute those who come across to your side? Anyway most Protestant Republicans became Catholics.

 GAC review 

This article is off to a good start, but I see some problems with the sourcing, formatting and prose that concerns me.  At this moment the article does not fulfill the GA criteria, but I'm willing to put the nomination on hold in order to allow contributors to work.  Here are some suggestions/comments for improvement:

The references are a mess.  None of them are formatted properly and several of them (IMDb, scifipedia, hunkymalecelebs) are not from reliable sources.  I suggest using citation templates in order to correctly format the links and look for replacement refs for those from disreputable sources.  (habla conmigo) 
Two fansites are linked to in the external links.  Per WP:EL, there should be none.  Also remove the duplicate IMDb link to the awards and nominations page; this is redundant.
:Image:Han2.jpg does not have a fair use rationale.
The use of """"influential"""" in the lead, although sourced, is open to debate.  I would remove it entirely.
More information needs to be given in order for the lead to adhere to WP:LEAD; there is no mention of his early life, music training, family, or cult following.  Nil by Mouth shouldn't be mentioned by itself and more can be said about his film making, as well.
and can be seen singing and playing piano in the 1988 movie Track 29, and tracing over pre-recorded versions of Beethoven's music in Immortal Beloved: Ref?  Also remember to italicize the film name.
The """"Music"""" section is only one sentence long and no date is given.  The biography should follow a chronological timeline.
After graduating from drama school in 1979, Oldman spent almost eight years in theater, winning various awards: such as...?  Ref?
successfully using an American accent: what does """"successfully"""" refer to?  The accent itself?
In October 2007, movie website TheShiznit.co.uk... how is this a notable website/accolade?
Because of its length, I suggest breaking the """"Filmography"""" list into two columns.
Oldman also directed the music video for """"Red Rover"""", a song from Jewish Rap Group Chutzpah's 2nd CD """"Hip Hop Fantasy,"""": the first comma placement (outside of the quotation marks) is correct, the second isn't; there are several of these that need to be fixed throughout the article.
I did not read the prose too closely, but once these issues have been taken care of, I'm willing to give it a second review.  Until then, I'm going to put the nomination on hold.  Please do let me know if you have any questions or comments.  (habla conmigo) """,0

What you cannot do is pretend that the UN itself favours territorial integrity over self-determination, when the exact opposite is the case. The right to self-determination is enshrined in the UN Charter, but there is no right of annexation to add to the territorial integrity of a state, which is what spain relies on. As you are well aware, Gibraltar, as a colony is not a part of ANY other state, therefore cannot affect the territorial integrity of a state of which it does not form part. The UN itself descibes the right to self-determination as a """"fundamental human right"""", and both the UN and ICJ have repeatedly stated """"in the process of decolonisation there is no alternative to the principle of self-determination"""".

"Double Standards & Issues -  

 

Dear “Lessheard vanU” and to Wikipedia including all editors and administrators & Mr. Wales:   This is a very serious issue.  We contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one.  Yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedia’s own editors and administrators.  As with Blackpearl14, who clearly believes that wikipedias polices don’t apply to her, and with other editors who uphold double standards.   Then when challenged to the double standards, including Blackpearl14's violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control, other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedia’s own written polices.    “Lessheard vanU” had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a “harassing the editor”, outright agreeing with Blackpearl14.  Then in addition to IP address being blocked, all “talk & discussion” are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers.  Even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors & administrators, all of this has been recorded, including that Blackpearl14 having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page (copies have been secure)  that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her.  These statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose.  Yet you have ignored that.

As previously written in discussion, per wikipedia’s own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  “Lessheard vanU”, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.  

Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...

Other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and “Chris Mann”.   We have documented that they say one thing, yet practice another.   We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.   We contributing writers also wonder",0

"Records of Awesome Editors Who Truly Want To Help==

As this is not a study of people's hesitancy, it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for people's hesitancy. It would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves, not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. If this study is the reason for people's hesitancy, then we should be pointing to a reliable third-party source that states that it's the reason, not to the study itself. If we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film Jaws, we use as a reference the source that makes that statement, not the film itself. So no, it's not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. Nat Gertler (talk) 

That has got to be the clearest explanation yet. So what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality, then cite both sources? Or should I use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? Even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. Is this where wiki gets the facts, from opinions, then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is WP:OR? It is built by popular opinion of the editors, from opinion pieces, not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though I hope notDcrsmama (talk) 
No, I'm not saying cite both sources. References are there to verify the facts that are being stated in Wikipedia's voice. If the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality, then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy - there is no need to cite the study. Even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study, we might mention this study in the text, but the study itself is not reference for the statement. And I am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting. If you have concerns about the other sources in the article, you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns. Nat Gertler (talk)

"Citations Provided 
Hello, Blade.
I have provided some citations in Rajus page which are taken from famous hostorical books from famous historians.
There are more historical books which give more mistory and glory about this Kshatriya Raju caste, but due to time constraint I am not able to pick them all. 
It is unfortunate that Mr Sitush is removing citations from historical persons, and citing some odd quotations from infamous/ left out historical books. Mr Sitush has removed citation from  The History of Andhra Country, Yashoda Devi. Yashoda Devi is a famous historian. Please check about Historian Yashoda Devi and her book.

Its seems there is some allergy for Mr Sitush in accepting Rajus as Kshatriyas which is making him to remove valuable historical content on Rajus page. Please cross check the WP you would come to know.

As I said before, it is not my intention to convince anyone of deleting anything. Actually, I think what you mention hits exactly the point. Let's suppose I do come across a reliable source on why clothes do not affect rape rates in any significant manner. Even though I'm confident I can find it, it is also likely it won't be related to the Slutwalk, and even less likely that it's an answer to that specific response. And that's where I'm not sure on where would I be allowed to place the evidence. Not after the response, I guess, but would it be admissible all the way to the top, right after the words of Sanguinetti? Or somewhere in the middle? Or does it also depend on the kind of sources I find? Also, still supposing I find good material disproving these sayings, does it affect the possible neutrality of the article, or is this considered a minor detail? I'm not trying to get specific answers for this, but maybe someone can point me in the right direction. I just wouldn't like to start adding information in a misguided way, which would end up with me asking stuff here anyway...

That is a bit much to tackle all at once, so I'll start with the basics. Your edits removed a reliable source dealing directly with the topic (namely, the article from the St. Petersburg Times). Your edit also added material from a source which I believe is unencyclopedic and fails this site's sourcing policies. Both aspects make the article poorer. I will go into more detail once I have time to fully digest your argument, but for now, the Times article is entitled """"Doctor's syndrome a sham, board says"""". Our article reflects the content of that reliable source. I don't see any similarly reliable independent, fact-checked, third-party sources that have appeared in the intervening years to contradict that assessment - certainly the Board left the door open for medical science to corroborate Wilson's claims, but I see no reliably sourced evidence that such corroboration has occurred.

"Some Small Fixes
I have tried to give the article some balance. Bacque was actually an accomplished writer in Canada before Other Losses, but it is important to point out Other Losses was his first foray into history.
I think it's important to point out Bacque is talking about losses among German POWs held by the Western Allies. Certainly hundreds of thousands, and perhaps more that a million, German POWs died in Allied custody if the Soviet Union is included among the Allies. As well, tens of thousands of German civilians died in Soviet forced-labour crews.
Bacque does make a contribution, albeit flawed, to the historiography, one that has been built upon recently by Anthony Beevor and others, who have looked at the immediate post-war period, the state of Europe before the Marshall Plan, the European reconstruction period, the founding of the ECSC and the beginning of the Cold War.
I am not familiar enough with Bacque's books, especially the second one, to accurately describe them. I think someone who has read them carefully should, at least, give a bare outline of his argument before rejecting them out of hand.
I don't know why Holocaust deniers would embrace Bacque's work, since any neglect of Germans held as POWs by the Western allies does not negate the genocide against the Jews and other Nazi victims.

"WP:GUNS importance assessment
As you surmised, the ten percent standard is intended to be interpreted as an order of magnitude, rather than a difference between a disqualified 9 percent and a qualified 11 percent. I am certainly open to alternative suggestions to clarify the criterion; but I disagree about the absence of sources to define an order of magnitude quantification.

The American gun culture includes a large number of writers who emphasize opinions rather than pursuing statistics. As the internet allows anyone to screen for information sources confirming an existing bias, such authors may be well represented by conventional search-engine algorithms. I personally enjoyed articles by Elmer Keith and Jack O'Connor relating divergent first-hand experiences hunting with light or heavy bullets; but I sought out articles by Julian Hatcher to find results of side-by-side scientific method comparisons.

I believe sources are available to quantify the features qualifying as top importance articles. It may be difficult to find quantification in the popular press (including the anti-gun press); but well-researched sources are worth the effort required to find them.

Assessment of importance requires a fundamental understanding of the subject; and the amount of time required will vary inversely with the experience of the editor. I wouldn't encourage you to undertake this assessment task with an unrealistic impression of the knowledge or time required. As a practical matter, however, you may understand the subject well enough to know the answer after reading the article. If you think the subject represented more than ten percent of the firearms or ammunition, it's probably a top importance article; but it's probably not top importance if you have doubts. I doubt your decisions on that basis will be challenged; but it shouldn't be an unreasonable task to find documentation on the few which might be.",0

 Werner's Transformation 

Thanks for the feedback.

The section titled The era of the est training (1971 - 1984) says: He [Werner] started to see the world as perfect """"the way it is"""" and reported an insight that his attempts to change or modify either his physical circumstances or his mental outlook had their basis in a conception of the world (that it should differ from """"the way it is"""") that precluded or at least limited one's experiential and creative appreciation of it.

This attempts to describe a pivotal evet in Werner's life that he referrs to as a transformation. I felt that the description above fell way short of what it was that Werner has said he experienced. I'm not sure what the source of this material is. Describing an experience like this is exceedingly difficult. Seeing the world as perfect actually, I believe, was only a part of Werner's experience of transformation. Here is how Werner described it in his own words in the film Transformation: The Life and Legacy of Werner Erhard.

The way est happened was very simple. I had this transformational experience. I had a transformation. Whoever I had been up until that point I no longer was. I was on my way to work and there was nothing significant about it but I was on the Golden Gate Bridge. I just happened to be there and that's when I had the realization that what my life was about was really meaningless. It was empty. And this realization that the things that I thought were so significant like looking good and winning, just the normal things that most people think are important, that they really had no importance, that it was all empty and meaningless. When I broke through the sadness, broke through the sense of despair of having wasted my life, I all of a sudden realized """"My God, I'm free."""" What's that mean to be free: free to choose, free to create a life that was worth living.

In order to describe it accurately why not quote Werner directly? I did my best to capture his words exactly as he spoke them. Is that considered a reliable source, given that it's a record of him speaking personally?

My purpose in posting this was to improve this section first for accuracy and second to elaborate in an event that was pivotal in his life.""",0

"""===August 2007===

A tag has been placed on Dinesh Robinson, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   
 
 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.  If your achievements, etc., are verifiable and genuinely notable, and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later.

 Spin-off, character pages 

When first writing, for example, The Brittas Empire character page, I thought it was written in 'an in-universe style'. However in retrospect this does not seem to be the case entirely, and I will be reviewing the page shortly.

Just a quick point on 'Edio*Magica', although it wasn't you who blocked me directly, it was still rather silly to think I would vandalize the very pages I have been improving (Sooty & co., The Brittas Empire), and to think that I would replace content with insults directed at myself. Due to the blocking I had to create this new account in order to edit pages, but I'm willing to forgive and forget about the misunderstanding.   
It wouldn't be the first time that someone has disrupted Wikipedia. In the past, we've had people create vandalism on one account, so that they can look good on another by fighting it. I realise, though, that your case is that there are probably some other bored little school kids using the same computer pool as you. talk to me 
Well i'm glad you've seen sense. What makes their actions even more pathetic is the fact they're university students; nevertheless they seem to have stopped now.   
Why don't you try and build an article to WP:GA standard, and get a better idea of conventions? Many of the articles you edit really could do with reliable sources. talk to me 

 Image removed from The Brittas Empire 

Are you sure the image you removed is not perfectly acceptable? It is a screen shot I took of the series so doesn't belong to any organization, and from what I’ve read relevant screen shots adding to an article are acceptable. I think you should have discussed your action before carrying it out.   
Having seen sitcom articles through FAC, I'm sure. Non-free images can only be used if they convey information that words couldn't express. My action was in accordance with the knowledge I possess through extensive ediing in accordance with Wikipedia's policy and guidelines, rather than ones I make up as I go along. talk to me

 HST > Notable? 

832, In the heading it says: """"Notable roles"""". The three previous mentions were roles that the play and/or film, Truman was the main subject, taking up the bulk of screen/stage time and lines. These also won critical acclaim. The combination of the amount of script and praise is what made these portrayals of Truman notable. Does your addition really fit: """"Notable""""? There have been lots of roles with Truman in them:

Flags of Our Fathers (2006) Played by David Patrick Kelly (as President Truman)
Hiroshima (2005) (TV) Played by Kenneth Jay (as Truman)
The Messenger: Based on a True Story (2005) Played by Raymond Starzmann (as President Truman)
Keep the Faith, Baby (2002) (TV) Played by Cedric Smith (as U.S. President Truman)
""""Futurama"""" - Roswell That Ends Well (2001) TV episode, Played by Maurice LaMarche (as President Harry Truman)
""""The Korean War"""" (2001) TV series Played by Harris Shore (as President Harry Truman)
""""The Simpsons"""" - The Trouble with Trillions (1998) TV episode, Played by Dan Castellaneta (as President Truman)
""""Dark Skies"""" - Moving Targets (1996) TV episode, Played by Hansford Rowe (as President Harry Truman)
Truman (1995) (TV) Played by Gary Sinise
Hiroshima (1995) (TV) Played by Kenneth Welsh (as President Harry S Truman)
Brenda Starr (1989) Played by Ed Nelson (as President Harry S. Truman)
Day One (1989) (TV) Played by Richard Dysart (as President Harry S. Truman)
""""War and Remembrance"""" (1988) TV series Played by Richard Dysart (as President Harry S Truman)
J. Edgar Hoover (1987) (TV) Played by Walker Edmiston
Eleanor, First Lady of the World (1982) (TV) Played by Richard McKenzie
Inchon (1981) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S. Truman)
Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb (1980) (TV) Played by Ed Nelson (as President Harry S Truman)
""""Backstairs at the White House"""" (1979) TV series Played by Harry Morgan (as President Harry S. Truman)
MacArthur (1977) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S. Truman)... aka MacArthur, the Rebel General (UK) 
Tail Gunner Joe (1977) (TV) Played by Robert Symonds (as President Harry S. Truman)
Harry S. Truman: Plain Speaking (1976) (TV) Played by Ed Flanders
Truman at Potsdam (1976) (TV) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S Truman)
Collision Course: Truman vs. MacArthur (1976) (TV) Played by E.G. Marshall (as President Harry S Truman)... aka Collision Course (USA: short title) 
Give 'em Hell, Harry! (1975) Played by James Whitmore (as Harry S Truman)
The Man from Independence (1974) Played by Robert Vaughn (as Harry S Truman)
The Beginning or the End (1947) Played by Art Baker (as President Harry S. Truman)

But, Give 'em Hell, Harry! and Truman, both on stage and screen where entirely about Truman. In Give 'em Hell (if you have seen it), there is nobody else. It is a one-man play, 100% of the lines are portraying Truman. And Flanders played Truman at least four times, including the bulk of the work being about him in at least two occasions; Harry S. Truman: Plain Speaking and Truman at Potsdam. So, is his charactership in Flags of Our Fathers really """"notable""""?

 """"TMTCFY""""? new """"Dashes"""" section & """"memorable""""  

I'm delighted to see the new """"Dashes"""" section progressing (it appears) in the approval/adoption process.

In your reply to one of A. di M.'s posts in the subsequent discussion, you used the abbreviation """"TMTCFY"""".  A search of 4 major online dictionaries of abbreviations, plus both a WP and a Google search, yielded no explanation of it, and I couldn't figure it out from the context. Am I missing something?  (I'm not particularly fluent in that argot.)

Finally, in the section """"Features of the Draft"""" of your """"Preliminary Notes"""", you said, """"...  the principles themselves are simple and memorable.""""  Memorable?  MWC11 defines memorable as, """"worth remembering   NOTABLE .""""  Although these rules might be """"worth remembering"""" in one sense, I don't think they rise to the standard MWC11 intended, which IMO implies something of considerably greater significance.  E.g., the day you were born was probably a memorable day to your mother; """"To be or not to be, that is the question ..."""" is one of the most memorable lines in all of English-language literature; but 
""""an en dash is not used for a hyphenated personal name""""?  Umm, not so much.  It's simply of a different ilk altogether.  (I'm not sure principles was the right word to use, either.  Aren't they just rules?  Or rationales for those rules?  But I'll let that one slide for now.  My prior quibble is sufficient unto the day.)

Thanks for the encouragement. I'm working on the mountain map sandbox just now. I want to get the superimpose thing back. As usual I'm over-thinking it. The problem with using pixel coordinates is that the location of the marker moves if the image is re sized. The Germans introduced the idea of using relative coordinates.

""":::By my reading, 72.244.64.149 didn't accuse you of defending the content so much as just noting after your explicit denial that you were defending the content that you were, in fact, defending the content. And, I'd have to say that removing a POV tag (one that, by the way, was apparently placed only a couple of days after 72.244.64.149's first post here in talk received no responses) is, in fact, defending the content. There had been a lot of revert warring, beginning with Jayjg's revert of 24.136.98.130's edit, over the very point that 72.244.64.149 was making; 72.244.64.149 seems appropriately to have brought the dispute to the talk page and, having received no response to his concerns, placed the POV tag rather than joining the revert warring. You wrote that a POV tag placement is """"normally only done if no agreement on the neutrality of the article can be reached on the talk page""""  isn't this exactly the situation in which 72.244.64.149 placed the tag?
I think you owe 72.244.64.149 another apology for saying that he/she """"accused"""" you of defending the content. It would be more accurate to say that 72.244.64.149 fairly mildly disagreed with your impromptu denial of an accusation that was never made.

In other words, it should be clear that fields like bioinformatics, systems theory, and computational physics are not computer science (even though they rely on computers, and even contribute knowledge back to computer science, sometimes).

Speedy deletion of Phai thach

Ive changed the heading of what was the physics section, because, it appeared to have nothing much to do with physics! I made a new physics description, and put it at the top, but I think it generally covers what most people know of as distance. I deleted the """"distinctions"""" of distance that had been written, that said things like """"the distance formula is not true for curved surfaces"""", which cant be true, because the distance formula is part of the law of physics and is always true! they were true in a general sense, but i didnt see how they had any useful meaning.

if someone understands the special theory of reletivity better than i do, can they please give some information on how distance applies generally in physics.

ive been thinking that it might be overkill to seperate this topic into physics/geometry/maths, because distance is all of them at once, and it doesnt need to be explained over and over in slightly different senses.""",0

"That’s not really long and irrelevant. I mean, I told you above about General McCully who was always talking about really irrelevant things. Once he told me a story about myself (I’m not sure why I’d never been told it before by my family, but there you go, that’s families for you – not that I wish to make disparaging remarks about my family, they were quite nice, only you’d think that they’d tell me important things like this thing that General McCully told me).

Anyway, this story went as follows (of course, it being a long time since I lived in Fifestead, I won’t get it absolutely 100% word perfect, but I’ll get the plot details correct, which is all that matters in the long run, and in the short run too, probably):

Once, I went to tea with a girl called Sophie (to fully appreciate this amusing, and I may add, most relevant anecdote, you must realise that there was no romantic interest between myself and Sophie: in fact, we were both only four or five at the time; these ages are, you will no doubt agree, far too young for any real romantic interest to be taking place). Anyway, for reasons General McCully couldn’t quite remember (I was at least ten at the time, and being a fairly old man, General McCully didn’t have a fantastic memory), this girl Sophie (you may remember – she was the one towards whom I had no amorous intentions) put her spoon in my hair. Now, at this point in the story, you may well be saying to yourself, “So what?” But, the problem was, the spoon had a fairly large amount of yoghurt on it.

So this was, as you’ll no doubt appreciate, quite a difficult situation, and in the confusion I couldn’t help noticing the slightly random (and, I’ll have to admit, irrelevant) fact that the screws on which Sophie’s mother’s pictures were attatched to the wall required a flathead, rather than a Phillips, screwdriver (when I say flathead, do not use this term in its most obvious, literal definition, but as the DIY term in fairly common use).

Anyway, there was me sitting with yoghurt coursing down my face, examining the screws on my hostess’ mother’s pictures, and casting dark aspersions, and eventually I just walked out and went home, all on my own.

Now, when I make all these claims about being very friendly with a General, he may not actually be a General: the British Army (the army in which he had served) had several ranks containing the slightly bizarre, random and irrelevant term “General”, including Major-General, and I don’t know if he was simply one of these, since they’re usually addressed simply as “General”, as was the citizen of Fifestead General McCully.

Come to think of it, there even used to be a Brigadier-General rank and even a weird-sounding Captain-General rank in the British army, though I believe the rank of Brigadier-General still lives on in the United States Army, existing under some obscure, weird, bizarre, random and irrelevant star rating too, such as “three-star general”, though this almost certainly (speaking with an unfirm knowledge of that field of mathematics known as probability) isn’t the right term for the rank of Brigadier-General.

Anyway, being a busy person, I can’t waste any more of my valuble time on this, unfortunately.",0

 My block/unblock 

On the current arb case, there is a proposed decision dealing with myself at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Eastern_European_mailing_list/Proposed_decision#Russavia. It appears that several arbs have asked for another proposal to be put forward, which I have done at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Eastern_European_mailing_list/Workshop#Editing_restrictions_proposal; I don't know if they are aware of this proposal or not. I have another issue, that being my indef block which was put on myself for a perceived legal threat. This has been mentioned at Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Eastern_European_mailing_list/Proposed_decision#On_Russavia, and it has also been mentioned there and on the proposed decision case page, that WP:NLT should be dealt with as per that policy. I have dealt with on the PD talk page, and also on my talk page at User_talk:Russavia#Alleged_legal_threats_issued_by_myself_and_unblock_request, as per WP:NLT. It should be mentioned that my indef block was not as a result of any arbcom enforcement, nor as a result of a community supported ban, but as a result of the perceived legal threat. The indef ban was lifted so that I could participate in the Arbcom proceedings, but at that stage WP:NLT had not been dealt with to the satisfication of the blocking admin.? Anyway, I would like to seek some clarification from you at the clerk for this case, as to what I would need to do in order to have the indef block """"officially"""" lifted, so to speak, so that I can return to editing within the confines of the topic ban handed down by Sandstein. Your advice is appreciated.  Dialogue 
Given the Committee didn't pass that temporary injunction, I'd suggest that you are still under the restrictions set down as part of the unblock-to-participate-in-the-RfAr. When the case closes, I expect the Committee will deal with your blocking/unblocking in some way in the final decision; depending on what the final decision is in this regard (there are an infinite number of possibilities), you/we can re-evaluate the best course of action at that point. 
The only way to have the conditions on the unblock lifted before the final decision would be to appeal to the Community and get consensus to overturn the block; I doubt that this would be successful given the parallel arbitration proceedings, as most Wikipedians will likely say """"just see what ArbCom decides then play it from there"""".
My $0.02. Regards,   
Thanks for your reply Daniel, its appreciated.

Given that WP:DIGWUREN took some 3 months to reach a conclusion, and other cases can take longer, I would hate for this case to take that long only for committee to turn my indef block back to the community. As I am a content creation driven editor, you can probably understand that this is less like purgatory, and more like hell. Do you think it may be possible to seek clarification from the Committee if the issue of my indef block for WP:NLT will be dealt with by them, or not? If not, I would expect this would free me up to take the issue to the community via an avenue such as WP:AN in order to allow me to continue editing, under the confines of the topic ban imposed by another admin, with that perhaps being addressed by Arbcom (the topic ban). Sorry for being a pain in the arse, but hopefully you understand my predicament and hence why I think it would need clarification from the Committee, as to whether it will or won't be addressed. As you are the clerk, might you be so kind as to seek clarification for me, if you don't mind of course. Also, my apologies for bringing this to your talk page, as I am totally new to Arbcom proceedings (hoping this will be my one and only involvement in one), I am somewhat bamboozled at to where to ask for clarification on the case pages; it is a dog's breakfast that is for sure.  Dialogue 
Not at all, no need to apologise. I will certainly pursue a line of inquisition with the Committee about what they recommend you do and what their intended course of action is on the issue; if you haven't heard back from me by Monday please ping me again (the weekend is normally rather busy for me, so if it's not sorted and I haven't got an answer from the relevant Committee members by then, I'll probably be unable to progress the issue though Friday night/Saturday/Sunday",0

Ok, before we start, I just want to make it clear once again that I don't have anything against (and would be irrational so)  anyone personally.
And, although I believe there is no historical version that can be completely neutral and free from bias, and is that even healthy that people can compare conflicting versions (within a reasonable scope of rationally), 
my position is that there are certain statements and omissions in the historical part of the article, that are unacceptable in an encyclopedic article, and therefore must be remedied.
They are 4 (a minor one in the Colonial section, and the rest in """"early republic"""" Section). 
So, let us start with the proposed changes of 1rst paragraph of the section """"early republic"""":

 """"The early Brazilian republican period was nothing more than a military dictatorship.* Following the bubble of encilhamento** and the 1st naval revolt, the country entered into a prolonged cycle of general instability marked by several rebellions, both civilian*** as military.*** Little by little these rebellions undermined the regime in a such extent that by 1930, in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most of the military, to lead a revolt.* """"     (*) Spaces related to citations

"""Student essay editing...==
Andy, if you are so keen, then you are encouraged to make the improvements.  These contributions are inferior in many ways as is being widely discussed not only by myself but others.  The rest of us have day jobs, so limited time to contribute.  As you probably know from your teaching experiences, repairing student essays take hours of effort and time.  Sincerely said, I just dont think that these unsupervised contributions from students are of the technical or stylistic standards we are accustomed to in Wikipedia.  The graphics are copyright violations, the article are often violate WP:NOTTEXTBOOK and are preachy or making value judgements.  The referencing ignores WP:SECONDARY.  If you find these massive additions, salvageable, then you can join the completely absent instructor in editing.  We really hope that you can help with content!    
I find your mass removal of good faith contributions by new editors, and your repeatedly pejorative descriptions of them, both outwith the spirit of Wikipedia (WP:BITE, WP:AGF), and disruptive (WP:POINT). If you are too busy to make fixes, that's OK, you are not personally required to do so - just leave the material for others to fix.  (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 
As I have already indicated, at that stage in my traiing would have submitted similarly awful essays. So my pejorative comments are directed at the so-called ambassadors-coordinators-instructors who foster and protect such inappropriate and poorly crafted content.  Like you, they are waiting and praying for someone with writing skills to intervene.  But as you're discovering, determined mediocrity can be difficult to rectify within the fringes of Wikipedia.  Looking forward to your help with editing these and other articles.   
Those people may have been your intended targets, but that's quite clearly not the result you achieved; here as elsewhere. And no, I do not pray.  (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 
There is no result to be achieved ... the students dropped their essay bomb on Wikipedia and got their grades.  The ambassadors-coordinators-instructors are flush with approval that they are """"encouraging"""" and """"nuturing"""" and being innovative in their engagement of Wikipedia.

Fair use rationale for Image:A_Smoky_Mountain_Christmas.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:A_Smoky_Mountain_Christmas.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is either no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use, or else the rationale given is not valid. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

You page protected Amanda Knox.  The previous editor was redirecting it because they said the article was a copy of the murder article.  But the article has been up only 2 hours and already it has changes.  The previous editor before that was John Carter, who is an administrator.

What you should do is not to listen to the pro-redirect editor and let many editors improve the article so that it is not a copy of the murder article.  Then it can be judged on its own.  If people add biographical details to the murder article, those will probably be removed because they are unrelated to the murder.  So we are stunning the growth due to inflexible rules.

but I would also appreciate if you could encourage altaf to not continue making personal attacks against me, as it makes me feel highly unwelcome on this site. I say """"personal attacks"""" as his behaviour towards me in not appropriate. It is harassment, since I actually messaged him politely about the change i made (which I am not even supposed to do, since wikipedia is not his property) and if he found a problem, he could have likewise messaged me back instead of running to an editor with yet another complaint about me. I made such a minor edit to the article, and if there was any mistake, could he not have merely pointed out any errors to me as a newbie instead? Or does he have a problem with allowing newcomers to work on wikipedia as well and merely try to land them in trouble instead? I am not really sure why he is determined to complain about me no matter what edit I make, but his aggressive stance is clear, and if everyone were to behave this way towards newbies, I am sure wikipedia would become a very isolated place, which it is indeed not. I am open to anyone explaining how I can imp[rove my edits, but I am not open to being treated like a criminal - by this exact same one user - for every word I ever type on the site. Please note that my edits were made in good faith and that I have written nothing malicious. I am now afraid to even touch any other page as I am feeling stalked and now opening the wikipedia site is turning into a nightmare. I even saw a wikipedia banner ad today which says , """"please do not bite the newcomers."""" Please look into this matter, thank you.

I'd hardly say this is blind.... after all the article has suffered extensively since June 5th. Going through the phrasing of everything now could take a good editor of an encyclopedia days, and we'll be fighting against other edits. Look at the following:
""""Everything Revere told his British captors had a single goal, to move the soldiers away from Lexington, where he had left Hancock and Adams. Revere had reason to believe the patrol's mission was to arrest the two Patriot leaders. He and other captives taken by the patrol were still escorted east toward Lexington, until about a half mile from Lexington they heard a gunshot. The British major demanded Revere explain the gunfire, and Revere replied it was a signal to """"alarm the country"""". A few minutes later, came a flurry of gunfire that seemed to alarm the British captors even beyond the panic they were already in.""""

All of that is based on a single book, takes up a significant portion of the article, and itself the source hasn't been verified to be objective. The style its written in suggests to me it may also be lifted word for word from the book, and to me at least seems to break NPOV. And that last line, """"alarm the British captors even beyond the panic they were already in"""" takes a whole lot of liberties, nevermind certainly not being encyclopedic.
@ JeffJonez: I'm proposing a revision from 4 days ago, not a week. And much of what remains in the article from since the June 5th edits began is hardly verifiable or objective, and certainly doesn't maintain a neutral tone to the article. Determining where and when this all began is proving troubling as so much was added and removed, then added again. This is hardly just a few malcontents.   """,0

The """"neutrality"""" tag and """"original research"""" tag was put up by THF, who works for a right wing lobbyist; Cool Hand Luke wishes to keep them in because he appears to be following up old grudges, as can be seen from the conflict of interest entry for THF above. He has, ironically, deleted a good reference to US law, and does not seem to actually be concerned about approving the article.
So, a third opinion of someone who is interested in approving the article, preferably with some knowledge of debate about the tort system outside the US as well as in, would be useful.

Not being used to Wiki process I didn't see the warning until after it was made although I'm not sure what that difference would have made long term. The notion of fascism in respect of the operation of wiki is not meant as an insult but describes a particular way of operating a nation, organisation etc. Having spent many years dealing with institutional abuse of authority etc. the """"harassment"""" of my contribution was corporate, but for those very reasons it will not be a productive line of enquiry. I suppose I could also turn to a zealous enforcement of the rules and seek wiki awards. 
Anyway in respect of my request we're now leaving wiki territory in terms of copyright and going where statutory law applies.

"""==History==
FYI: """"Galen, a physician in second-century Rome, dissected pigs and goats, and is known as the """"father of vivisection."""" [17]""""

This claim comes from a section on the LPAG site that says: """"Then, during second century Rome, a physician named Galen began to dissect animals because Church protocol did not allow human autopsies. He began to dissect goats and pigs and compared his findings to what he knew about humans. He is now known as the """"father of vivisection.""""2

Following this citation back, it comes from Greek CR, Greek JS (2000) Sacred Cows and Golden Geese. The Continuum International Publishing Group, Inc., New York, New York., which, in turn, is based on a passage from Hans Ruesch's Slaughter of the Innocent.

From 157 and 161, Galen worked as a doctor to gladiators at Pergamum. This was around the time that Christians were being persecuted by Roman authorities and used as dispoable items in the games. Galen undoubtedly had opportunity to examine many ripped and torn human bodies, and there is no reason to imagine that he would not have been allowed to fiddle about on dying Christians, though I've come across no records that he did. """"Church protocol,"""" in this referenced passage is a claim not supported by the historical setting.

Here's a statement from another website: """"Vivisection originated in second century Rome when Galen, physician to gladiators, was prevented from continuing his dissections of human cadavers by the Church-led moral opposition. He switched his attention to goats and monkeys instead and thus became the 'father of vivisection'. http://www.allaboutanimals.org.uk/PT-Testing.asp

And another: """"In second century Rome, the state-supported Church frowned upon the co-called desecration of human corpses and autopsies were outlawed. With no human bodies to learn from, the respected physician to the gladiators, Galen, had little choice but to cut up pigs and other animals, hence earning him the title 'Father of Vivisection.'"""" http://www.ark-ii.com/campaigns/

This is a widespread claim, undermined when it is realized that Christians had no standing in the Roman Empire during Galen's time. What is very likely is that Galen learned things about human physiology from seeing so many people ripped apart, stabbed, clubbed, mauled, and otherwise opened to inspection. He probably sought to test his conjectures about what all this exposed tissue actualy did by dissecting living animals; at a tme when no real pain relief was available, a person in his position must have grown innured to seeing others' agony. This would have made his animal victims' cries unremarkable to him.

A more believable source observes: """"Under Nero in the 1st century AD, even the torture of Christians became a star attraction at the Circus Caligulas. There were few protests against such marketable massacres."""" http://www.iridescent-publishing.com/rtm/ch1p1.htm

"Another theory of mine owner of this site, the reason why Doug has now appeared out of nowhere, is due to the fact that the other 2 people couldn't revert after a certain point or else they would break this 3 edit rule. Notice how now this fellow Doug has appeared, blocked, then reverted the last edit I made. This I believe is an error of the system. It allows people to collaborate. 

The reality is Roux I suspect has some agenda. Wikipedia must understand that the Trance scene is currently being sidestepped by the House scene in a major way. Mainland Europe as of 2011 has practically lost it's Trance festivals. The rosters on the mainstages are almost exclusively House now. Trance generally has contained since the year 2000 some of the most loyal 'drones' in the dance market. The type of people who dislike anything outside of Trance music. Almost obsessive compulsive types. I suspected this behavior in Pengowl originally also. Then Roux appeared. Both of them would monitor anytime I appeared on the page. Trance followers often dislike much attachment to House, because the House scene has practically overshadowed the whole Trance scene currently, and due to the fact that House came first. This may give a certain editor (Roux) certain agenda's to have cited information silenced or to disqualify a citation. I suspected Roux was a Trance follower from his comments on Paul Oakenfold and also the clues telling me what year he entered the scene. I am guessing 1992 or even later - (Trance scene actually started 1987-1988). There also are other possible motives for deleting my important entry. So once again Wikipedia owner, this is likely the reason why Roux is trying to find some rule or anything he can to prevent that one sentence and those two citations from being included. Why? Because they demonstrate that the earliest published Trance works are actually from the UK Acid House movement - thus one can conclude that Trance had origins from the English House scene - which Trance people would HATE WITH A PASSION ) (Right now the world is to believe that it comes from mainland Europe only - there is zero reference to England, which in fact had one of if not the largest Trance scenes in the early years).

Information is just information. I personally don't have any pure attachment to House or Trance. I enjoy both, but one must speak about the origins. To silence the past is in a way misinforming an entire generation of newcomers to the scene. Few people can speak about the past because those early critical warehouse years were the beginnings of the scene. What may sound like a few years to you, in reality there is a big difference to someone who appeared in the scene in 1987 as opposed to someone who appeared in 1992. It is also difficult for anyone to speak of the origins of Trance without living through classic Chicago House in the 1980's. There is little to no documentation on the early years of Trance. The documentation that does exist is often written from the perspective of DJs or writers who did not live through classic Chicago House therefore it is difficult for them to piece together the past. To speak of the actual catalog releases of the creators of the music is extremely important in my opinion. In fact, the records themselves (the only medium that the art was released through in the early years) are the actual only true un-biased reference to the genre, wouldn't you agree? At the end of the day, Trance doesn't exist in space, it exists in published form contained on a vinyl record. I am not sure why the site would want me to avoid speaking about the creators of that art.",0

 Addressing your concerns 

888fortune, I found your comments at Duke53's talk page that flesh out some of your concerns.  I'm glad to see them, and I'm sorry I didn't spot them before I left my earlier message.  I'd like to try to address some of those concerns.

If I'm not mistaken (and please correct me if I am), this seems to be your core concern: """"I believe it is confusing to a person searching for that name to find another name.""""  You might be unaware of this, but Wikipedia has a """"redirect"""" feature that can take a commonly used search term and re-point it to the article it refers to, if that article exists under a different name.  You can try this: type """"The Wild Center"""" into Wikipedia's search box; it should take you to the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks article.

From a reader's perspective, the redirect does have the potential to be confusing: """"I typed in one thing, and the big headline at the article says something completely different!""""  Naturally we don't want such confusion.  There are two things that can help.  One is that Wikipedia will show a little message saying """"(Redirected from The Wild Center)"""" so the user at least knows they didn't somehow hit the """"Random article"""" link or something like that.  Another one that the editors of the target article can do is to make sure the common search terms are mentioned.  In this case, the article's lead sentence highlights this by introducing """"The Wild Center"""" as an alternative name, and it's in boldface so it's harder to miss.  A person searching on """"The Wild Center"""" and arriving at the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks article will probably not be very confused, since they'll see """"The Wild Center"""" prominently displayed on the page, and since they'll more than likely already know that The Wild Center is a museum of natural history located in the Adirondacks, so the full official name is unlikely to surprise them.

You also say """"I think that the Museum has the right to choose its own name.""""  I don't think anyone would disagree with that, but it's reasonable to think that the nickname """"The Wild Center"""" could be in vogue for a few years and then replaced by another nickname. (""""The Otter Stop"""", perhaps? )  If there's a stable, official name that will stick with it for as long as it's a museum, it makes some sense to use that name for the article title and to set up redirects for all of the popular nicknames.  The purpose of Wikipedia is not to aid the museum in marketing itself, but it's definitely reasonable to adopt some of the marketing phrases if that's how a significant number of people might identify the place.

Does this satisfy any of your concerns?  I'm interested in your response.  /talk/ """,0

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

"""

Qwyrxian, let me attempt to point out the flaws of your response to my arguments set forth above: Yes, I'm a new editor, however, with all due respect, that has no bearing on your inclination to decide on behalf of all viewers what should be made available to them.

I very much understand the purpose of Wikipedia.  My assertion is NOT that the middle-finger incident should be included in the subject article (I started) because of news reports, as you contend.  If you will review the foregoing, the reason why I cited the news reports is because a flagrantly reckless comment was inserted that what is of issue now is not worthy of documenting when the exact opposite is true; the news reports is best evidence in that regard, and the person who said it is not worthy has only but his mouthan inferior source of 'evidence,' relatively speaking.  It is noteworthy, and, if you can come to appreciate the context of the subject's profession and for which has become known to be involved in, then you'll come to appreciate the significance it plays out in the essential need to properly reflect the entirety of the trial in which the subject became a major fixture as co-counsel.

Your example of everyday political speeches is seriously an aytypical example by which to convey your point:  Contrary to a mudane, everyday speech, here, an attorney just allegedly got out of court in obtaining a siginficant finding in his client's favordefeating immense odds and seemingly going against the court of public opinionand just afterwards gathered with his team at a restaurant just down the street from that historic victory, during which he released the manifestation of his emotions, etc., as one could imagine.  This was included as part of a segment of the whole article of the article-there is no article specifically on this incident, so let's also come to appreciate that.

And, to the contrary that this incident is of interest only at the moment, more and more discussions are being held about the audacious incident, and has cultivated an interest in what happens next, as if it is leading to a whole host of other actions (whether that includes the filing of a bar complaint, etc.), and this leads us to the national grand scale interest of the audacity of officers of courts acting in such a manner, etc.

Furthermore, I concede that Wikipedia is not in existence for the greater good, and that was never my contentio.  Again, you misunderstood the context I place in the words, """"public interests."""" Going back to the above, it is incontrovertible that is of the interests of the public, and, consequently, it should be documented well because, as noted in the latter paragraph, it is beginning to take shape in having a lasting impact on what we have come to expect from individuals, such as the subject of the article.

Let otherscertainly at least those who helped me in creating the articlechime in with their thoughts before you take an action on behalf everyone else.  Let's not do something in such a haphazard way.  Do not deny information in haste.   """,0

Here is part of the 1957 paper, """"The FORTRAN Automatic Coding System"""" by Backus, et al., this snippet on the FREQUENCY statment and its use in a compile-time Monte Carlo simulation of the run-time to optimise the code generated. Quoting ...
The fundamental unit of program is the basic block; a basic block is a stretch of program which has a single entry point and a single exit point. The purpose of section 4 is to prepare for section 5 a table of predecessors (PRED table) which enumerates the basic blocks and lists for every basic block each of the basic blocks which can be its immediate predecessor in flow, together with the absolute frequency of each such basic block link. This table is obtained by an actual """"execution"""" of the program in Monte-Carlo fashion, in which the outcome of conditional transfers arising out of IF-type statements and computed GO TO'S is determined by a random number generator suitably weighted according to whatever FREQUENCY statements have been provided.

Speedy deletion of Tim keim
 A tag has been placed on Tim keim requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies.

Somewhat earlier  correctly observed that """"a citation for that formal definition of equality with domain but not codomain could be useful in that discussion"""".  The citation I gave is from Tom Apostol Calculus, page 54, but this is rather old.  Looking in recent literature was very instructive.  The problem is that definitions of function equality in the literature seem rare somehow (not found in about a dozen of recent math and CS books where such a definition could be expected).  Googling on """"function equality"""" or """"equal functions"""" was equally ineffective, but """"functions f and g are equal"""" yields many results (mostly lecture notes).  Some definitions of function equality include codomain equality, some do not. Here are a few that do not include codomain equality, as requested:

http://solitaryroad.com/c303.html
 http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs103/handouts/25%20Functions.pdf
 http://www.bus.ucf.edu/sgerking/ECO%203401/Chapter%202.ppt
 http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~wcherowi/courses/m3000/lecture8a.pdf
 http://www.cse.unl.edu/~cse235/files/Functions.ppt

An interesting subtlety: many of the latter group define a codomain, but do not include it in the definition of function equality.  As Leibniz would say, this means that they do not really consider the codomain as part of the definition of a function.  More subtle: some talk about """"the domain of f"""" but about """"the codomain"""" (without """"of f"""").

A pragmatic observation: authors including a codomain (say Y) in the definition of a function seem to do very little with it, except (i) defining when a function is """"onto"""" instead of """"onto Y"""", (ii) allowing it to restrict flexibility in the way functions can be combined, for instance, by composition.

Mistake in vandalism reversal

I reverse the changes also added to the article by the unsigned individual. There is some content here that might be worth retaining and incorporating into the article. 
However, 
 the same individual also removed my comments from the talk page. This amounts to censorship and suggests at minimum bad faith in regard to the wikipedia process of revising articles.
 the new content was a quick cut and paste from some previous text as shown by the fact the section left its original references at the end and a """"summary"""". As I noted above not all this new material is inappropriate.

I would hope that you read both the source and my points fully before making your edit and writing your response.

As I initially said the source is biased - it is true. They state themselves that their very organisation was set up initially purely to oppose Nuclear Power.

Let's leave that to one side however, we could always come back to it later.

The crux of my point, leaving aside the bias issue, is three-fold. 

Firstly, irrespective of your argument that this is presented as a claim, the fact remains that the way the claim is presented is illogical - there is no fair comparator for the claim that """"Nuclear Power is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions"""". A fair comparator should be found or some idea of efficiency viz. inefficiency should be presented, if even from the biased source itself, before re-inserting this part. Without it, it is on the same level as saying something as intellectually vacant as """"some people claim that Ferraris are not fast machines"""". Not exactly the sort of style an Encyclopaedia should be aiming for, especially on a scientific article, would you not agree?

Secondly, with respect to your argument, the very empirical information the underlying source uses is being mistreated in what amounts to, if I may say, a misuse of data on a level which is so obvious it it would actually be quite comical if it were where it belonged along with many thousands of other equally lazy special interest group papers. It is  a self-contradicting source. Here's why:

It makes its supposition that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions by producing a table of data. The data shows """"Yearly Costs to Avoid 1000kg of CO2 Emissions"""". These are divided between Energy Conservation Measures and Energy Production Methods. Nuclear Power is shown to be more efficient than solar power and as efficient as wind power at cutting emissions. However, the only conclusion the article draws is that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions. By your logic, I could equally claim in this article using the same source that """"some environmental groups claim Wind and Solar Power are inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions"""". You can see how this would get a little crazy, no?

Thirdly, there is only one quoted source yet the text reads """"but environmental organizations indicate the problems with nuclear waste and claim that this energy is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions, excluding it from clean energy"""". Why is it pluralised? Surely the text should read something along the lines of """"the WISE group, a Dutch anti-nuclear lobby group indicate the problems..."""".

In conclusion, I can see the point you are trying to raise here is based on one guideline - as a claim, it is not presented as fact. That would be fine for articles dealing with philosophical issues, or political issues or any other number of normative debates. But we are not discussing ethics here. We are discussing the efficiency of Nuclear Power in cutting CO2 Emissions. We have to hold Scientific articles to a higher level of proof when it comes to """"making claims"""" or worse, """"stating beliefs"""". Science, prima facie, is about the pursuit of absolute truth, not the espousal of circumscribed belief. That way leads to the abuse of Science.

To fully understand the nature of Limbaugh's comments, full context of the entire conversation must be included in the article.

The first caller, """"Mike in Chicago"""", who identified himself as a Republican and former service member, told Limbaugh, """"I do believe that we should pull out of Iraq."""" Limbaugh argued with the caller and ended up treating him dismissively.  After that call, Limbaugh next spoke to a listener who wanted to """"retort to Mike in Chicago"""" (the original caller).  This second caller, who identified himself as a soldier,  complained that the media never talked to """"real soldiers"""" like himself.

DELETION OR THEN MERGER 

There must be verifiable, objective evidence that the subject has received significant attention from independent sources to support a claim of notability NRV.

WP:NOPAGE -notability is a very serious question here and the weak and non-scholarly material does not amount to a stand alone article. The article is a combination of some  critic/red flagging of the  criticism of the Frankfurt School theories labelled here as """"Conspiracy Theory"""". Yes it can entertained that some  claims & rumours are discussed on minor internet sites that amount to """"Conspiracy talk"""", but it is no reason for a Wikipedia entry or let alone a stand alone Wikipedia article.

 REASONS FOR DELETION ARE NUMEROUS AND VERY CONCRETE
WP:NPOV neutral point of view! 

WP:OR -The term """"original research"""" (OR) is used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published sources exist

WP:V - means that people reading and editing the encyclopedia can check that the information comes from a reliable source. Where available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources, such as in history, medicine, and science.

WP:FRINGE -A theory that is not broadly supported by scholarship in its field must not be given undue weight in an article

WP:NOTOPINION -Opinion pieces, although some topics, particularly those concerning current affairs and politics, may stir passions and tempt people to """"climb soapboxes"""". 

WP:YESPOV -Avoid stating opinions as facts

WP:WEIGHT -Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represents all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources, in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint in the published, reliable sources. For example, discussion of isolated events, criticisms, or news reports about a subject may be verifiable and impartial, but still disproportionate to their overall significance to the article topic. This is a concern especially in relation to recent events that may be in the news.

User:76.110.22.186 left the following message on my talk page: 

I love how you just undid all my work on the Eddie Brock page without asking me to change or edit. Thanks so much for being considerate. Unsourced original reasearch? Its already sourced at the bottom of the page , do you really need me to resource it? 
It's all in Amazing Spider-Man and it's all characterization which is completely essential to the article whether you fail to realize that or not. So you removed it stating that it could be integrated into the publication section...IT WAS ALREADY INTEGRATED THERE BEFORE YOU REMOVED IT.

I’m sorry that you’re upset over the removal of the material you added, but part of editing on Wikipedia means that your edits may be mercilessly edited, and if the material you add is found to be in violation of policy, then editors required to remove it. They are not under any obligation to ask your permission to do so, and in general, the Wikipedia community is not going to rearrange the way they do things in order to suit the demands of a newcomer. Rather, it is your obligation to learn the ropes here.  Responding to my rather polite post above, in which I complimented your work, and provided links to the relevant policies in question, with the message you left on my talk page, which was rather rude in tone, and ended with an all-caps remark (which is considered the equivalent of yelling on the Net), is a violation of the Wikipedia's Civility Policy, and is not the best way to show the community that you’re willing to be a part of it.

For now, I’ll put aside your message to me, and try to explain a bit further the policies in question. 

Yes, Wikipedia’s Verifiability Policy does require that we source the material we add to articles, so that readers can verify the material. They cannot do this if we do not inform them of where the material comes from.

The sources in question have to be reliable. That means they must be considered credentialed experts in the area in question. For comics, examples would be sources such as Wizard magazine, Comics Buyer’s Guide, The Comics Journal, Newsarama, Comic Book Resources, books by analysts like Danny Fingeroth, and interviews on DVDs of movies adapted from comics, as well as any mainstream press stories you can find.

Websites whose content is user-generated, such as personal blogs, forums, message boards, fan sites, other wikis, The Internet Movie Database, The Comic Book Database, etc., are not reliable, because anyone can create a blog or submit material to those sites, which do not exercise editorial control over that material. Exceptions to this would be the personal websites of people would be considered reliable sources in the field in question, such as Mark Evanier, John Byrne, Peter David, etc. (See WP:USERG, which is part of WP:Identifying Reliable Sources.)

Similarly unacceptable is material derived from the editor’s own personal opinions, observations or analyses, which is called Original Research. Adding an analytical comment to an article about a film is fine if it's from a review you cite by Roger Ebert. Adding such a comment when the observation comes from the editor who adds it is not. Some editors point to the primary material in which the narrative is found, but the primary sources (such as an issue of Amazing Spider-Man) only contains the narrative itself; it does not contain any analysis of it. Material is not quoted or paraphrased directly from a source, but which constitutes an analysis or observation derived from it is called synthesis, which is a form of original research. The bottom line the need to ask, Who is the person making the observation? If it's the editor, it's simply not permitted.

The website you cited in your revert is not a reliable or verifiable source, not only because it is a fan site, but because it doesn’t even mention any of the material you added. It simply lists issues of the books. You can’t just point to books and say, “It's all in Amazing Spider-Man”. The original stories might be, but comments like """"The key difference between Brock's heroism and Peter Parker's mainly being..."""" are not.

As for the remaining issues:
As far as the issue of integration is concerned, the analysis by Mike Conroy does not deal with the issue of characterization, so I added it to the Lead, where such summary-type analyses can go. The material on Paul Jenkins’ run belongs in the Publication section, alo",0

Question from Bishonen: an injunction for XAL?
Oops. I didn't realize that the Bogdanov Affair affair had made it to RFAR; I just blocked XAL for the third time for unrepentant personal attacks. 72 hours. Should I unblock her so she can respond to this RFAR? I'd appreciate it if she could get an injunction against editing anywhere else, though (especially not on Talk:Bogdanov Affair), for what would have been the duration of the block. I'm not happy about all this vitriol she spreads, and, from past experience, I'd expect it to be worse now that I've gotten her worked up with a new block. Bishonen | talk  PS, re Snowspinner's request above that XAL along with other users be banned from editing the article: she never has edited it. Never edited any article on wikipedia. I want her banned from the article's talkpage.

For what it is worth, I support this motion. XAL has contributed nothing to the discussion, in stark contraindistinction to most of the other users like Igor or rbj or ybm, and often stirs things up. Maru (talk)  
Also from an outsider: XAL appears to only rant and to only rant on one topic (user:YBM, whose letters are sequentially one after hers, like IBM and HAL), and to contribute nothing but a negative  an anti- point of view. Thus, she seems to have come to us from some outside web fight and longterm flamewar. Since coming here, she has demonstrated the grace, understanding, curiosity, and equanimity of a wounded hyena with rabies. Geogre

 ******* Double Standard Against Bosniaks *********** 

ChrisO doesn't want me to use copy of the original investigative article that was published in 1993 by David Bernstein (Pacific News Service).

It's still original article published 13 years ago by Pacific News Service with full copyright notice? http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html

On the other hand - he allows use of personal """"lists"""" or """"groups"""", such as """"mail-archive"""" and Serb-run """"balkanpeace"""" from Toronto when reading articles republished from Canada's Globe and Mail, example http://www.mail-archive.com/serbian_way@antic.org/msg00008.html

Anyways, balkanpeace.org is Serb-run website in which Bosniaks, Croats and other ethnic groups are portrayed as the worst of the worst, while Serb crimes are excused.

One more thing - if I stop being active here, then you will know that they banned me. And if that happens, it will be clear example of pro-Serb one-sidedness and double-standard that is attempting to plague this very important article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre .

I urge ChrisO to protect Srebrenica Massacre article in a same way Israel's article is protected http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel .

And remember: Srebrenica massacre article is not about Serbs or pro-Serb lobbyists such as General Lewis Mackenzie. Srebrenica massacre article is about 8,000+ victims of genocide. Let's focus on the victims and honor them.

How would you feel if you lost your children, mother, grandmother, grandfather and all people that you loved and lived for? Ask yourself this question every time you edit Srebrenica massacre article. Search for love and compassion in your heart, you will find it.

"Reply to FyzixFighter 

FyzixFighter, you are making some of the same mistakes as Brews. You seem to think that we can take that four part expansion of acceleration in terms of polar coordinates and read some physics into it. We can't. The polar terms tell us nothing about any particular motion.

But they are nevertheless very useful. We can use the expressions in a properly modelled differential equation that involves real physical input. The radial convective term is used as a centrifugal force in the two body gravity problem.

You seem to think that because it is derived with a negative sign that it has to mean centripetal force. That is not so. The negative sign is a consequence of the outward positive convention for the position vector.

The expression is merely the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction.

When we construct the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.

It doesn't matter. Just concentrate on the equation and solve it. And in doing so, you will see that inward radial gravity is working in opposition to an ongoing outward radial centrifugal force.",0

FROM THE TIMES

""""The sudden loss of pressure in an airliner cabin, as occurred on the Ryanair flight, is a frightening and potentially painful experience for passengers but it is does not usually endanger the aircraft. Half a dozen episodes of rapid pressure loss have been suffered by airliners over the past year.

Pilots follow a standard procedure if the cabin pressure suddenly drops while at cruising altitude. They don the oxygen masks which are constantly at their shoulder and put the aircraft into an emergency descent to about 8,000ft above sea-level, the altitude at which the air becomes comfortably breathable.

At the same time the crew would have declared an emergency to the en-route air traffic control and requested immediate clearance to the lower altitude and landing at a nearby airport. In the meantime the oxygen masks will have deployed automatically to supply passengers and other crew during the descent.

The Ryanair Boeing 737 performed exactly this procedure after it suffered pressure loss. The pilots descended from about 35,000ft to 8,000ft in five minutes, according to the authorities at Limoges airport, where it landed. The media and passengers may call such manoeuvres a """"plunge"""" or a """"free fall"""", but the descent rate of about 5,600ft per minute is perfectly controlled and within the normal performance of the aircraft — assuming that all its flight systems are functioning.""""""",0

OK...you all call my behavior 'aggressive,' but I consider it WP:BOLD. You all call my editing behavior 'uncivil,' but I just call it 'being vocal' about the removal of valid material from Wikipedia. I will refrain from using 'strong language' in edit summaries in the future, including capital letters. You say that: """"This is persistent and entrenched behavior on your part that you don't seem to understand or want to change after many warnings and two blocks""""  I've never had any substantial warnings, only the two expedited blocks. You say that I should """"accept the rules"""" when other editors are totally disregarding and/or misquoting them, or trying to pass off essays and guidelines as policy when they are not. The fact is that if someone is removing good/valid/sourced material from Wikipedia, I'm going to call them out on it. Any way that you put it, strong wording in edit summaries is not a valid reason to perma-block people, as short sentences like that can easily be taken out of context.

Regarding my claims of censorship and vandalism in the above-mentioned edit summaries: I'm not sure what else to call it if not censorship and vandalism...I suppose I could always call it """"the constant removal of valid categories/information from articles,"""" but that would be whitewashing the issue. For whatever reason, entirely valid, relevant, and sourced material is consistently removed from many articles (Paul Wolfowitz, Ben Bernanke, Lewis Libby, others) by the same editors again and again, and after a while it just gets very old, ridiculous, and frustrating to have to keep inserting this valid information over and over. By the way: I consider the removal of valid material/categories from articles over and over again to be censorship and vandalism...don't you? Some kind-of phantom clause in WP:BLP is constantly cited to try to justify the removal of this information even though this information is currently found in thousands of other articles with no problem at all.

When I wrote """"Revery [sic] Jayjg's idiotic edit..."""" in an edit summary for removing Category:Ethnic nationalism from the White nationalism article I only made that statement because the very first sentence of the article said """"White nationalism (WN) is a form of ethnic nationalism...""""  thus the removal of said category seemed rather idiotic in my opinion since the first sentence of the article obviously confirmed that particular category. Jayjg then changed that first sentence (he provided no source for this edit) and removed the category. I never called Jayjg idiotic, only that particular edit.

Since everything I write on here seems to be misconstrued, taken the wrong way, and wrongfully considered 'uncivil' and/or 'aggressive' (what is and what is not 'civil' and 'aggressive' is highly POV and a matter of opinion, by the way), I plan to edit  and remove any and all information that could be considered 'offensive' or 'uncivil'  I am going to bring the page down to the basics.

Truthfully, I try my best to avoid getting caught up in all of these Wiki-politics, personal vendettas, petty edit wars, childish games, etc.; I am part of no group/cabal here, I stick to myself and mind my own business, and improve and expand Wikipedia as best I can. However, when I see factual edits constantly being reverted for no apparent reason (what I term censorship and vandalism) it tends to make me a bit angry, so I have no choice except to be vocal about it and hope that other good editors see what is happening and will begin to take action and discuss these issues. That's another thing...the complete and utter lack of discussion by these people, whether in edit summaries or on talk pages. I would like to discuss these issues (and I always try to leave a good edit summary), but whenever I try to discuss these issues the response I so often get is one or two bogus sentences and the mindless repetition of a bunch of Wikipedia essays/guidelines (NOTE: NOT POLICIES) in an attempt to justify the censorious deletion/vandalism """"the constant removal of valid categories/information from articles.""""

"Hi Maury, great recent work on the BAC 1-11. I added the court-line pic (also used on the court line page), and I happen to know the colours are correct. The image is a little washed out, but not to the extent that it is meant to be portraying a the yellow/gold/orange scheme - It is actually pink! I made a note about this on the 1-11 talk page but maybe you didn't see it. Though the yellow scheme was probably the best known, as it was used on their first TriStar G-BAAA, they had three other funky schemes which were used across the rest of the fleet - green bands, pink bands (also used on the second L-1011), and purple bands. They used to be a cheerful sight flying over our school in hemel hempstead when I was a kid - always turned my head to watch whenever they went over, though the 1-11s in particular were hard to avoid as they were so noisy! Airliners nowadays are a lot better, but also a lot more boring, and that goes for the colour schemes of the airlines too.  23:54, 18 Oct 2003 (UTC)",0

Thanks.   Believe it or not in the real world I think that we think mostly alike on this.   I'm for the societal normalizaion of homosexuality.   I'm not for the nasty tactics used by some folks who feel that way, including branding anybody who feels otherwise as having a phobia.    And such work against themselves.     But in a Wikipedia sense, such opinions are not relevant.  Two definitions of the word exist, and one of them is sky-is-blue obviously controversial. The problem with the article is that, as a part of a POV quest, it pretends that the more controversial """"all opposition is phobia"""" definition is the ONLY definition. That would be just a difference of opinion but the more severe problem there is the nasty tactics used by a certain cadre there against people who do not agree with their quest.  I think that they have set the record for the amount of bogus tactics and bogus accusations used against a fellow editor.  And when I see people using such tactics against people in Wikipedia to further their purposes, I really see red.

And no I do not think that you are misguided.  I think that the real world you and your thoughts and efforts are right on track and admirable. And in Wikipedia you are a kind and thoughtful editor.  About the worst complaint I could muster is taking real life advocacy a bit too much into Wikipedia and having a bit of a hard time understanding my someone abstract analysis of the structure of the article, which is necessary to present the issues in Wiki-terms. But the first in very minor, and the second is somewhere between normal and being a failure of mine to explain better.  Your friend.North8000  """,0

That's a delicate argument to make and requires a high level of trust among the editors involved.  I don't see any evidence of that trust here, and so I'm not surprised that argument wasn't successful.

Hi folks! I'm a visitor on this page, but as i come from geomagnetic background there are a few things a would like to mention:
1) the Earth's magnetic field is NOT created by telluric currents! It is created by currents in the liquid outer core (as mentioned in an paragraph above) but that are not telluric currents. telluric currents are induced in the crust / mantle by electromagnetic waves from the atmosphere - due to thunderstorms, e.g., or (as mentioned in the article about telluric currents) solar wind or currents in the ionosphere.
changes of the main field, that is the field generated in the deep interior, are much to slow to induce currents in the crust or mantle. they occur over time scales of years rather than days or even hours.

"Northwich Victoria

Just logged into find loads of stuff about you.  It looks like it's getting harder for you having to do lots of edits, before your main edits.  Is it worth the effort x

Hello there, me old fruit!

It is true that it's getting harder for me with having to put in ten edits before I can use my accounts. They sometimes get spotted and blocked whilst I'm making the ten edits, especially if I've just used an account and especially if User:Hut 8.5's online. I have generally targeted a dormant user talk page or tagged my own sockpuppets to achieve the ten edits.

It is not too difficult yet. User:Raul654 has put in loads of IP rangeblocks which do restrict me. I can generally get on using BT.

There seems to be a concerted effort now by many different users to revert my edits quickly. I suppose a good measure of my effectiveness is the percentage of the time that my edits are visible, or whether the page is fully protected. That percentage is very low at the moment. VICS is fully protected, but Northwich Victoria F.C. and Witton Albion F.C. are not.

It is worth the effort; I still hate the whole Wikipedia concept of truth by consensus. I can cope with being reverted within minutes by many different editors, being checkusered regularly and blocked on sight. User:Raul654's checkuser investigations are only about 95 - 98% accurate in terms of percentage of accounts that he labels actually being me.

I have included your message to me because  routine.

I still think it's funny that people like to assert that I'm a banned user eg here despite the fact that .

Well, I left for two days anyway, and I see no reason to dredge up a closed thread.  

I will say that the whole point of the thread (as Calton indicated) was to not have to get involved in it myself, and there was also really no need for an IP which displayed disruptive behavior in the past to get involved.  IPs are nice to hide behind, and I will bet money on the fact that it's been the same person all along (which is where my remarks came from).  I'm happy to admit a mistake when I make one, but this was not a mistake.  I will stand behind everything I said, based on the following line of reasoning:  a static IP is often tied to the same computer in an office (MHEC, the IP location, is not a school, it's a governing authority for the state schools in Massachusetts, so it has an office and an .edu address, but not a campus of 50 million people using a computer in the library).  The chances of two different people on the same IP (meaning at the same computer) knowing enough of Wiki internals to: go poking around ANI, try to run for ArbCom, request a block for an admin, and then have troll unblock requests (""""hello"""" is not a spurious unblock request, really?), is just too small for my liking.  I'm sorry if I'm not going to AGF that, but I cannot suspend my disbelief that far, and I got hammered for it.  

I neither expect nor require an apology, but I do want it to be known that something important was missed in that thread, and that IP's going to be a problem until someone takes care of it.   """,0

 Original founding directors 

You claim: - """"I don't think a school prospectus is a reliable source."""" How so? Surely a school knows who its Board of Directors is?  Not only is it a direct source but by law (in the UK) the information MUST BE CORRECT. To name directors who are not in such a position is a criminal offense under the Company (Disclosures) Act (1985/6 revision and 2002 revision) which also requires the propectus includes the company ID number and the VAT number. As such it is a legal document.

Disclosure of names of directors
8.—(1) Where a company’s business letter includes the name of any director of that company, other than in the text or as a signatory, the letter must disclose the name of every director of that company.
(2) In paragraph (1), “name” has the following meanings—
(a)in the case of a director who is an individual, “name” has the meaning given in section 163(2) of the Act; and
(b)in the case of a director who is a body corporate or a firm that is a legal person under the law by which it is governed, “name” means corporate name or firm name.

Further particulars to appear in business letters, order forms and websites
7.—(1) Every company shall disclose the particulars set out in paragraph (2) on—
(a)its business letters;
(b)its order forms; and
(c)its websites.
(2) The particulars are—
(a)the part of the United Kingdom in which the company is registered;
(b)the company’s registered number;
(c)the address of the company’s registered office;
(d)in the case of a limited company exempt from the obligation to use the word “limited” as part of its registered name under section 30 of the Companies Act 1985(3) or article 40 of the Companies (Northern) Ireland Order 1986(4), the fact that it is a limited company;
(e)in the case of a community interest company which is not a public company, the fact that it is a limited company; and (f)in the case of an investment company within the meaning of section 833 of the Act, the fact that it is such a company.

I don't know if you're Wikignoming because you lack the time or resources to expand articles or if it's just something you prefer to do, but there's certainly other stuff that you can be profitably be doing. Ship article titles need to have the ship's name in italics or you could focus on improving their categorization, neither of which I tend to remember to do anything about.

I think that one of the confounding issues is what to name what Einstein called """"spooky action at a distance."""" The idea of action involves the application of some force over some amount of time, and our ordinary idea of """"causing something"""" involves exerting force on some system to influence its behavior. But entanglement is exhibited without the lag that would be required were interactions at a velocity ≤ c, so something is going on that is not """"causal"""" in the usual sense. On the other hand, before one or the other entangled twin particles is measured, they both have the freedom or the potential to manifest either spin, and after one of them is measured and must manifest a spin then the other no longer has the freedom or potential to manifest any spin other than the opposite of the one that was first measured. So something has changed, and it strikes me as creating an intellectual smokescreen to say that there is only some kind of abstract """"correlation"""" involved. Like the """"collapse"""" of a wavefunction, we have no idea of what is going on or how to describe it. All we know is that it happens. It also strikes me as possibly significant that the time sequence may not be clear. From my frame of reference, electron A is observed first, and electron B is observed second. Someone else, in another frame of reference, may see electron B as being observed first and electron A as being observed second. There are also phenomena within the same frame of reference that we call retrocausal. We have no way of knowing that the discovery of the polarity of photon B at time T+n determines, retrocausally, the polarity of photon A at time T. If we say that these changes are not local, that must  (I think) mean that they are not local in space-time. So, in a sense, I end up arguing against my own discomfort with the idea that there is """"only"""" a correlation between the discovered states of any entangled twins.

when the current flag was designed in the early 1990s, were the people who made the flag aware of these supposed medieval connections? Or were they simply pointed out later by vexillologists? What is the earliest reference to the post-1991 flag?  Adoption by the  United National Movement dates to c. 1999.  Kldiashvili wrote a """"History of the Georgian heraldry"""" in 1997.

Did it really demonstrate that the disease was not exclusive to a particular community, or did it demonstrate that it was not exclusively contracted through sexual contact? Did it really demonstrate to """"many"""" or did a significant number of people remain prejudiced?""""  Yes, the gay community felt very strongly that White's illness *did* demonstrate AIDS was not exclusive to a particular group of people.  Amongst those who remained prejudiced, they remained prejudiced by-and-large because they *wanted* it to be a gay-disease in order to either give them a better reason to be prejudiced against homosexuals or to promote their own cause and/or agenda.  But it wasn't as if White having AIDS suddenly changed the face of AIDS - it took time, but his illness *did* make a difference in how AIDS was thought of and perceived .  I remember once hearing an educated, well-known and repspected pastor and Bible scholar saying, """"AIDS is lodged in the rectum, that's why it's a homosexual, sodomite disease"""".  And that was *after* Ryan White died.  As far as the above claiming that there was """"resentment"""" amongst PWAs that it took White's illness to bring the proper attention to AIDS amongst the mainstream media and the rest of America - that's untrue.  There was general anger that there had been people dying of the disease for so long and no one outside the gay community seemed to care.  There was definite anger toward the Reagan administration, the Moral Majority and what was seen as the self-righteous extreme right.

While I've declined speedy deletion, I see two major areas that require improvement in the article.
Notability: While there are some assertions of significance, such as winning Seedcamp 2008, it's not entirely clear how major that competition is. Accordingly, there's no clear demonstration that this is a notable web service. IMO, there's enough of an assertion that the article should not be deleted under speedy deletion criterion A7; however, it could easily be sent for deletion discussion.
Reliable sourcing: Other than basekit's website, the only source provided is a review at Download Squad. It appears to be on par with Engadget in terms of reliability. Still, to build a robust article (and demonstrate general notability), citations to other independent reliable sources should be made.

There is a precedent for letting people in similar situations give a private explanation, and only to sanction them if they refuse or fail. It was not possible to provide public evidence without giving further publicity to a website which engages in stalking, and which gave speculation about not only SlimVirgin's identity, but also another contributor's. And you seem to be overlooking the fact that Cyde was in a longstanding dispute with SlimVirgin, so obviously should not have been the one to block. See also . This is not a question of making a mistake in believing WordBomb. This is a question of believing WordBomb, and then, instead of reporting it privately to the ArbCom, or asking SlimVirgin privately for an explanation, engaging in extremely inappropriate, hasty, behaviour, even crowing over the person he was accusing of sockpuppetry, and showing most clearly that he had a grudge against her. Additionally, in another case which is being heard at the moment, a user who had originally registered with his real name requested a name change, and repeatedly asked people not to keep referring to him by his old name, and Cyde responded by provocatively posting a link to the user rename log.

 Midway = turning point 

In my view, if there WAS a turning point in the war on Japan, Midway has to be it. While the Japanese had been stopped at Coral Sea, they still had the initiative; they could still choose where and when to attack, and the allies had to react. But not after Midway! It was, after all, THEY that launched the Midway/Aleutians operation, and THEY that were then rocked back on their heels, and THEY that fled afterward. It was THEY that had lost 2/3 of their big, fast carriers (and the carrier was to the War in the Pacific what the ballistic missile was to the Cold War. Somewhere above someone argues that the remainder of the Japanese fleet was still a formidable force, but that is nonsense; all that force could do would be to sail out and get sunk by a carrier-equipped US NAvy)). Far from being """"merely"""" a tactical victory, it changed the whole complexion of the war. 

Now, while they DID attempt some more offensive action (notably by trying to take Port Moresby, again, this time over land via the Kokoda Trail in the 2nd half of 1942), this was all relatively minor, designed to strengthen their DEFENSIVE positions not to conquer, and was  ultimately almost all unsuccessful. They never again tried the kind of massive, seaborne, combined arms operation that had swept them across most of the Pacific in a just a few months. Then just 2 months after Midway the US landed on Guadalcanal, and clearly the initiative was ours, and Japan was in defensive mode. Thus the Guadalcanal campaign can't be considered the actual turning point either - by then the US was clearly on the attack.

I don't think the argument that there is no turning point because Japan could never have ultimately 'won' the Pacific war works out either. Japanese planners DID know that they could not win a long war MILITARILY but that was not their plan. Strategically their plans went something like: 

1. Start the war from as superior a position as possible (hence Pearl Harbor)
2. Race across the Pacific, seizing resources and territory BEFORE the US could gear up for war.
3. Attain as defensible a position as possible (Hence the Kokoda Trail offensive and takeover of the Solomons) and DIG IN.
4. Let the US grind itself down against near impregnable fortresses. 
5.Win a favorable peace settlement when the US tires itself out throwing itself against their defenses.

But they failed at (1) when they didn't sink the US carriers at Pearl Harbor, and only 6 months later Midway signalled the early end of (2). By the failure to take Port Moresby, they also failed at part of (3). They had some hope to succeed at (5); when the bloody costs of both Tarawa and Buna-Gona became known, US public opinion was shaken. Even as late as 1945, many americans found the though of the casualties invading Japan would cost to be appalling.

So, MY conclusion is that Midway WAS *the* turning point in the Pacific. I realize this whole idea of a turning point is rather subjective, but I really think if there was one in the South Pacific, it has to be Midway.

"JON R. CAVAIANI
SERGEANT MAJOR (RETIRED)
Jon R. Cavaiani was born in Murphys, Ireland and sent to England in 1943.
He came to the United States in 1947 and in 1953 moved to the small farming community of Ballico, California to be with his stepfather, Ugo Cavaiani. In 1961 Ugo formally adopted Jon and in 1968 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

Jon Cavaiani joined the U.S. Army in 1969. He volunteered for Special Forces where he spent the next 17 years. Cavaiani was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions while a platoon leader on an isolated radio relay site deep in enemy territory. Jon was serving with the studies and observations group (SOG), an elite reconnaissance unit when he was written up for the Medal of Honor for his actions on 4 and 5 June, 1971, in Vietnam. Eleven days after this action, wounded and still trying to evade the enemy, Jon was captured and spent the next 23 months as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.

His other assignments included tours in the Middle East, South America, Europe and Southeast Asia. Jon spent three years in Berlin, Germany as the Senior Operations Sergeant Major for British, French and U.S. Forces. He was selected and assigned to the United States’ most elite Counter-Terrorist Force.

Upon retiring, Jon has made time available to serve as the 6th region director of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. Cavaiani recently graduated with honors from the culinary arts program in Columbia, Ca., where he and his wife Barbara live. Jon has three grandsons and two granddaughters.

Among his numerous awards and decorations are the nation’s highest award for valor, the Army Medal of Honor; the Legion of Valor, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal (Valor), Purple Heart with oak leaf clusters. Jon was a freefell and static line jumpmaster and has over 5,000 jumps all over the world.",0

Quantrill's Raiders

Thank you for your copy edits and reference work on the article Quantrill's Raiders. You have, by your edits, cleaned up most if not all of the NPOV issues I had with the article. I know I did not have the resources available nor the time at the moment to do much with the article; but I was pretty sure that someone would if I tagged it. My editing doesn't involve Civil War articles but only as they are co-incidental the the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the revenue cutters that operated during and immediately after the Civil War and almost all my reference materials involve the USRCS or it's successor agency, the U.S. Coast Guard. As a Kansan interested in Kansas history I realize that the origins of the Civil War began as far back as the Missouri Compromise and later with the Kansas-Nebraska Act. As a Kansan, one is sometimes referred to as a 'Jayhawk' and that is how I ran across the article on Quantrill's Raiders. It was interesting to me, but I saw NPOV issues with it. Anyway, thanks for your edits and when you feel that the article has been edited enough to warrant removal of the tag, you certainly have my blessing. Cuprum17 (talk)

War crimes are serious violations of the laws of war.  The key words here are """"laws"""" and """"war.""""  Unless one lives in a corrupt town, laws are made by legislatures, or in this case ratified by them, after being written and argued over by diplomats in consultation with their military's generals.  The laws of war were written with the understanding that killing large numbers of people may be a legitimate and necessary part of that process.  The laws of war were not written by corrupt and ignorant peaceniks sitting around dreaming up what they think would be moral.

It is a random hyperlinked jumble (as it should be!).  Its only order is that it is separated into articles with titles, but that is hardly an order worth noting.

 Avoid trying to POV-push anyone's guilt or innocence, just word the text using common phrases, without trying to over-emphasize a legal ruling.
 Remember to use British English, such as: centre, centred, flat (apartment), US (for """"U.S.""""), behaviour, etc.

I have therefore, decided not to induce any more NPOV in this and similar articles because they are only belly-filling exercises by resourceful missionaries; and as such deserve sympathy.

Do you mean that you blinly believe in an obviously falsified interpretation just because it is group interpretation? In other words, are you totally castrated or simply circumcised???

I repeat my great source is the mere text of the Second Commandment and I say that the WIKI does not require a better source so that any wikipedist may take the Second Commandment as specific reference, especially if this wikipedist chooses the Orhodox rabbis' translation (Paris: Editions Colbo; French Rabbinate) Sigismond, astonished to report that the four tildes do not give his signature????

Dear Vrenator!
Nice to meet you. 

Yes, I do believe that you made an error removing my edit on the Jostein Gaarder page, having assumed that it was not constructive. 
However, I appreciate that you are open for a civil discussion, which is not as frequent nowadays as it should be. So, let's go (on my side not in native English, and I ask for your patience if the same could be said briefer).

Your first impression could have been that my adding the word """"controversial"""" after the """"and"""" in the subtitle """"Environmental and human rights activism"""" can be bias, as certain Wikipedia guidelines generally suggest about this word. Generally it may be true, but not if, as in this case, the paragraph itself factually speaks about the """"Gaarder controversy"""", and it opens to a whole session about that controversy.

Just the other way around; actually the existing title was a bias: because all the Journalistic Ethics Guidelines I've ever seen, state that titles should express more or less what is written within the article, and can't say the opposite.(Which, unfortunately, is a not unfrequently used way of bias; utilizing that much more people read the title than the whole paragraph, and the title remains in the minds, while the truth-qualifying statement somewhere inside the article runs unnoticed). 
How can the title be simply about his """"human rights activism"""" when there is a controversion mentioned in the article about his hate-speech against a whole nation and a religion? 
I don't suggest that the Wikipedia article condemn Jostein Gaarder, as I learned and think now he has fully deserved, but 'controversial' his human rights activity certainly is.  

Therefore I firmly believe that you should revert my edit: 
I added in the title the word """"controversial"""", as the paragraph itself proves it expressedly, in order to make it: """"Environmental and controversial human rights activism"""". Also, for balance, besides Gaarder's own views of his own op-ed, I added at the end, how some others see the case: 'But some others see this op-ed as an expressedly anti-Semitic document'"""" 

Bthw, about the whole Gaarder controversy subject in this Wikipedia article it feels strongly that the Gaarder side - for which it is a central issue - dented it rather succesfully as if almost only the Norwegian Jews found his op-ed """"offending the Jews and Judaism"""". In fact several serious works of others (see later) also condemned Gaarder's op-ed as terrible hate-speech.

At least one more change - addition - is required: where the  """"Gaarder controversy"""" session writes about """"others"""", it asks in blue [Who?] and I wanted to add there the best source I know (The Augean Stables website), but it seemed as if I was blocked to do so. 

So, if, as I suppose, you are sincerely interested to learn about the controversy, read: 'Open Letter to Jostein Gaarder: Fisking Crypto-Supersessionism' on http://www.theaugeanstables.com/multiple-part-essays/open-letter-to-jostein-gaarder-fisking-crypto-supersessionism/ .
This is a scholarly answer to Gaarder's every statement by an American historian, and it gives every chance to Gaarder to correct himself in a respectful way. What Gaarder has never done,he only said some vague self-justifications like 'it was written in a haste' and 'should have been worded more cautiously"""" - as if these could justify vehement hate speech by an authority.

As a summary, my edit is a very mild correction only to Wikipedia's Jostein Gaarder article, relative to the hate-speech he committed against a whole people and a religion, and has never corrected.       (P.s.: It can be more convenient to use e-mail - I willingly give you my address any way you suggest to do this. )
Sincerely Yours,

Don't you think this essentially Kantian (or maybe Hegelian) view expresses a sentiment that lies at the heart of the misgivings that many have about adopting an excessively pro-scientific stance?

Almost every scientist I have ever spoken to about the nature of science believes that scientists study the world 'out there' ; in other words, they study an objective world devoid of human emotions and meaning. They find it quite difficult at first to understand that what they are really studying is the phenomena - the mental representations of the world 'out there'. Once thus enlightened they can then perceive that their knowledge of the world 'out there', far from being objective, is intimately bound up with, and inseparable from, their hopes, fears, and other emotions. The world is one thing, and our knowledge of it is another ; we ought not to imagine that our understanding of the world is the world itself. James, Norwich

"Hey, gimme a break, I had no idea you weren't meant to edit an article more than 3 times in a day - five hardly seems excessive when I'm trying to revise what I'm putting in in light of criticism each time.  Besides, surely Drmargi must be over the same limit.  And I have no idea what you mean by a 'bare link', I put in 5 different links to 5 different newspaper articles, didn't realise there were stylistic rules on ho to do that.  As it is I'll just make my case here for now.

The whole of the British Press is reporting the speculation that Ben Collins is the Stig.  This is not a recent phenomena, as newspapers have been suggesting this since at least January.  However, recent articles have, for the most part, dropped specific refrences to any individual other than Ben Collins in this role.  Seeing as one of the main reasons for the Stig being mentioned in secondary sources (like the press) is due to his identity, this is some of the most important information about the role and ought to be in the lead section.  Since Ben Collins has repeatedly been linked to the role in the press (unlike anybody else), this should be clearly mentioned.  Since the speculation that the Stig is Ben Collins is highly relevant and verifiable, comment should be made of this speculation in the lead.",0

This term described all the facilities such as accommodation, gaming, entertainment, dining, convention, and spa under one property, and was meant to differentiate the positioning of their property from the rest of the Las Vegas Strip properties.

"That is true. The entire Vojislavljević family were of Croat origin too. Please protect me in this case. I have proof off that site.

The proof: 
 From 1036 to 1042 Dobroslav, called Stjepan Vojislav, member of an old Croatian family from Duklja, revolted and liberated Duklja and Rasa. - This statement shows that Stjepan Dobroslav I Vojislav was of Croatian origin, meaning that his distant ancestor, Archont Petar, was of Croatian, not Serbian, origin. 

Bodin (1081 – 1101), king of medieval Croatian Duklja, ushered in a new political era in Serbia. At the outset of his reign Bodin liberated Rasa from Byzantium and installed as its princes his two palatines Vukan and Marko, both Croats from Duklja born in Ribnica near modern Titograd.  - This statement shows that Duklja was actually Croatian, rather than Serbian, which I agree. This statement also shows that the House of Nemanjić is of Croat origin as Vukan is of the Nemanjić's ancestors (Nemanja's great-great uncle or great-grandfather).

Thanks for your notes about five images I've added to the Joseph Eastham High School page.  I designed and drew two of these images myself:

2. The Superpupil comic was drawn by me.

5. The only problem would be the Profile Magazine Christmas cover by Wai Tsau Wong who left the school in 1988, I've no idea where she is now. Can anything be done to keep this image in, or do I need to replace it with a credited image?

"I wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.

But, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.

Now you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.

For some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.

One reason given was that the posts were anonymous.

So I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).

So it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.

I therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others. 

I tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.

This was dismissed.

Someone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.

That too was dismissed.

So it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.

Therefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)

In vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.

So what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.

Two choices.

Stop posting completely

Try and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.

Hence the challenge.

I fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.

I have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.

You see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.

I have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.

So we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.

So there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.

Finally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers. If it is accepted though I shall return just the once, to link to the article!   16:57, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)",0

"up, Martinez decided to law low from the city for a while, but eventually came back to mess with Vic’s woman, Louise. Since the failed deal, the Vance brothers were forced to do business with the Mendez brothers. This was around the time the Vances built their own organization in power, taking over businesses from rival gangs. Victor did help with a transgender get things straight and met Phil Collins and his manager. At first, it was believed that the Mendez Cartel wanted to establish a business relationship, but their real plan was to have the Vances give their businesses to the Mendez’s and leave Vice City, or the Vance brothers and Louise would die. When they refused, the Cartel kidnapped them and took them near the Escobar International Airport. The brothers blew the death row and stopped Mendez’s men from taking over their businesses. Their plans were foiled. They kidnapped Louise and threatened to kill her if the brothers didn’t leave the city. Not long before the Vances storm into their mansion in Prawn Island. Lance was held hostage, while Victor proceeded through the gangsters and killed Armando Mendez. Louise was left on the floor dying, next to Lance. A vengeful Victor formed an alliance with Ricardo Diaz (a crime lord) to bring down the Mendez’s operations once and for all. Victor invaded into the military base, stole their army helicopter, and returned it to Diaz’s mansion in Starfish Island. Once back in the chopper, Victor said he would owe Ricardo nothing and was doing this for him. After that, he flew to the Mendez penthouse and killed all the Mendez henchmen at the building in downtown. Jerry Martinez arrived in the scene and was prepared to kill Victor. Finally at the rooftop, in the final confrontation, Jerry Martinez cornered Vic, believing he was too easy to trick. Diego Mendez came and the final shootout between the 3 men led to the deaths of Diego and finally Jerry. Lance came into the scene and but it was already over. The Vance men decided to lay low with the drug money they made to take care of their sick brother outside the country. Vice City became the major spot for the drugs trade, it attracted several criminal organizations to be interested, including the Mafia. Liberty City’s Mafia-linked Forelli family sent Tommy Vercetti, who was recently released from prison after a 15-year stay, down “South” to get started with their expansion, with Vercetti as a Forelli representative, just to keep him out of Liberty City. Upon arrival to Vice, Tommy and 2 other men (later learned to be Harry and Lee) met Ken Rosenberg, a bent lawyer with Forelli connections, at the airport. They soon met with the Vance family leaders at the docks to make the deal. However, 3 masked men killed everyone but Tommy, Ken, and Lance who managed to escape without the money and drugs. Tommy informed Sonny Forelli about the incident. An angered Forelli demanded that Tom found his money and drugs immediately and get those responsible for the incident. Rosenberg feared to suffer consequences from the mob and refused to stick his head of his office. Sonny called periodically to check up on Vercetti. A man for information was Kent Paul, who gave info about a chef. Tommy killed Leo Teal, who failed to squeal about the ambush. With nowhere to go, Colonel Juan Garcia Cortez, who also set up the deal, was his way in to find the money. He was at his most expensive yacht. Cortez had a feeling that his right-hand man Gonzales squealed about the deal and was to be killed, and met Lance Vance. Vercetti met Avery Carrington, a Southern gent who was into prime real estate. Tommy met Ricardo Diaz, now a powerful coke baron. After watching a deal, Diaz offered Vercetti work since he liked his style. Soon after working for him, Lance and Tom discovered that Ricardo was responsible for their busted deal. Lance attempted earlier to avenge his brother but failed only to be captured and taken to the city’s junkyard before Tommy came to the rescue. Before they could their revenge, Tommy escorted Colonel Cortez out of the city after a corrupt French government was after Cortez for assigning Tommy to steal their merchandise earlier. The men finally stormed in the Diaz’s mansion grounds and killed the drug master. Diaz trusted and was going to have him made, but he was made by the 2 men. Tommy took over all his local businesses. The Forellis sent Vercetti some support, later forming his own organization in the progress while gaining power. Tommy decided to go solo and form alliances with Cuban (now in feud with a Haitian gang) and biker gangs, including Love Fist. He owned a protection racket, several assets, including the Malibu, a Pole Position strip club, a porn studio, Kaufman Cabs Company, a car dealership shop, a boatyard down the docks, and a printing company, and in progress making acquaintances with other powerful people of the criminal underworld. Through those progresses, he performed robbery on a bank, produced porn films,",0

Who are the web site of Jean-Pierre Voyer, a kind of model person for mister Messager/YBM, and who spred a quiet special form for ideologie, which goal is to play with words and how to defend and argue about things who do not exist, how to play with words and """"fuck others"""" as phrased on his web site, and essentialy, how to display a superior attitude in order to effectively use the communication on internet to their full interest, by using the circumstances frame of the dialogues. This include displaying lies as being facts with such a forcefullness as to convince others.
It is called: postsituationnisme, ideologie who is followed by YBM, together with a sympathie to the 3rd reich, and a, by some, called pseudo-Hégelianism.
YBM run his forum where he defend the man and his positions, with as much furore as he dispells those of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
You will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of """"mass communication"""" and a weapon to convince anyone of anything.
 
I am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle.
 
I hope you will excuse my very late assertion or révélation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years.
Actually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
 
No need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed.
 
Why so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met?
They were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions.

Here are some other links who do compleete the picture:

I consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J. Baez paper on the subject if it hadn't been for Messager and Voyers' questionnable work in the name of very questionnable motives, all accomplished to serve a completely useless ideology.
I think that this will teach us all a lesson regarding objectivity and our hability to evaluate a given problem properly, and to be able to use our sense of sceptisisme ans sound judgement.  On a more general way and even more central here, our power to distinguish between agreeing to a given opinion based on facts, and being manipulate in doing so for all the wrong reasons.
 
This information compleete the picture and gave it its true mening, even if it is by showing how meningsless a huge part of this affair was.

The Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra is a professional orchestra based in Rhode Island which performs throughout Southern New England.  Founded in 1944, its current music director (as of July 2009) is Larry Rachleff. Based in East Providence, Rhode Island, its performing home is Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Providence.

In the 1960s, Erich Kunzel served as its assistant conductor.
As of 2010 the orchestra has attracted the likes of conductor Jahja Ling,  violinists Jennifer Frautschi, Karen Gomyo and David Kim and pianists Ilya Yakushev, Jessie Chang and Jon Kimura Parker to perform with the orchestra. 

Music school
The Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra is the only fully integrated professional orchestra and music school in United States. It has a major music school founded by Alan Fox,  which eduates over 14,000 young people and adults with music lessons of all ability levels and instrumentations with classes and ensembles. The educational program of the school spans not only classical music but extends into pop, jazz, rhythm & blues and advocates youth orchestras and big band ensembles.  The orchestra received a grant to support """"Music After Hours"""", a consortium with the Music School geared towards educating aspiring young musicians grades 3-5 children after hours. This was put into effect in 2001.In September 2008,  the Rhode Island Philharmonic Society established the Carter Center for Music Education and Performance, located Waterman Avenue in East Providence which has over 30 private studios, including  a jazz, rock and blues wing.
Every May, the orchestra puts on 4 education concerts at VMA and groups of musicians perform at schools and community centers throughout the year.

Apparently you missed the """"no response is needed"""" above.
There was not a drop of """"pretentiousness"""" in my comment.  I didn't """"start drama:"""" """"drama"""" """"started"""" when you showed up on my talk page and presumed to instruct me in a brusque and arrogant manner as to what talk pages are foras though I were some noob and you the wise and experienced Wikipedianand what my tone should be like.  You are correct above where you say that """"talk pages are for discussing how to improve the article,"""" but I didn't see you telling that to Santamoly.  If you jump on anyone who uses a talk page for anything less pure than """"discussing how to improve the article,"""" you're going to be a very busy bee indeed, and probably to little effect.
I wasn't """"offended"""" because Santamoly disrespected my religion (Voudon isn't my religion), I was appalled and disgusted (see my original reply to you) at her/his provincial and outdated attitude toward a perfectly legitimate religion, and made my point firmly.  I admitted to you that I could have been less snarky, but that wouldn't do.
Apparently, people only have a """"proper sense of judgement"""" when they agree with you?  You're not """"discouraged from pointing out attacks or incivility,"""" you're discouraged from doing so in a pompous and arrogant manner which exacerbates rather than resolves.  As I said, if you had courteously suggested that I was out of line, you might have received a """"thanks for the reminder"""" from me.  In fact, despite your pompous attitude, I was nevertheless """"receptive"""" enough to offer the concession that some of my remarks could have been better phrased, but that wasn't good enough for you: no, you charged onto my Talk page to slap me down.  When I declined to cower, you went looking for bigger kids to beat me up, only to find that they were disinclined to do so. 
Perhaps when you've been around Wikipedia for a while, you'll have a better grasp of how things happen around here.  Or maybe not.  Either way, if you don't like my attitude you're welcome to stop reading my Talk page any time.  There's clearly no way I'm going to get through to you that I'm not the only one who was out of line here.

Page protection
Keilana, can you please explain why you have semi protected the page Huma Abedin ? You have stated vandalism which is clearly not the case! Please see Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard where the matter is being dealt with ! Can you explain your actions ? I understand I am new here but it was one of the first pieces of information i have cont. to wikipedia there has been no decision made, I can not understand your actions !

Having now had the rules for vandalism explained to me I believe you have abused your power as my contib. clearly dosent fit any of the terms ? I ask you to reaccess your actions.

The decision was made at Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Huma_Abedin_.28edit.7Ctalk.7Chistory.7Clinks.7Cwatch.7Clogs.29. Its common practice during an edit dispute such as this for an uninvolved admin such as Keilana to semi-protect the page to reduce the intensity of the dispute. In any case, from the tone of Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard#Gossip_magazines_as_reliable_sources it seems that semi-protection was the right call to stablize the article while discussion continued there and on the talk page of the reliability of sources. MBisanz talk  
I would question how uninolved you actally are give these messges left on my talk page: And don't worry! You'll be able to edit that page in 5 days! Enjoy! —BoL 

And by waiting for five days is by just waiting and you'll be able to edit the semi-d pages. Don't worry, give Keilana some time! She's offline right now, and so am I. —BoL  Retrieved from """"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:100%25freehuman""""

You clearly statd vandalism as your reason for the protection i would not you made no contibution to the talk page and sort no concensus from you action! I will also ask you to explain you relastionship to those who have sort to remove the information ? I would also like to know why you have changed you id ? thanks I will be adding this information to the talk page and any were else i find help ! I also note you did not add the fact the matter was being listed to protection page to the talk page of the article ?

I did not create the name of the page in regards to gossip mag tittle had you read the info you would understand Hillary Clinton was interviewed for the article.

To request unprotection, please go here Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Current_requests_for_unprotection. To ask for Keilana to be examined(?) I'd wait for her to respond here, and if your not satisfied, there is the Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard. I leave the personal inquiries for Keilana to answer is she desires to. MBisanz talk

Hello, Sorry I couldn't attend to your concerns earlier. I semi-protected the page (here) because of the reasons stated there. As it is election season in the United States, articles about prominent political figures such as Mrs. Clinton are particularly vulnerable, hence the protection. There was a dispute over the reliability of sources, and I protected the article to cool the dispute. Protection isn't an endorsement of the current version, I have no ulterior motive. (see here for protection policy/information). In general, an admin doesn't need consensus to protect a page when a dispute is ongoing. Is there a problem with my administrative actions?

More or less """"have you done the research for me?""""  I worry that these tools have rapidity, yes, but might not make it any easier to judge the recent history of edits.  Thus they can miss that the preceding series of edits might be bad, as they focus on just the latest edit or the latest editor.  I've seen a number of times where simply reverting the latest most obvious bad edit actually restores another vandal's bad edits.  Thus I slog along my watchlist checking recent histories manually.  Do any of the tools allow an adjustable 'window' of recent history, with the view to making it easier to find the better point to revert back to? I'm wasting time, yet finding things missed using the simplistic tools.

"Hello, the Heleen Mees article is now full of nonsense. Mees never was an employee of the european Commission, the 2006 article about women (not) working was not her first article in NRC Handelsblad. She had published quite a bit before that. Also, the article includes vicious and superfluous references to the stalking charges that are set for dismissal and is quite unbalanced. The following would be a much better text:

Heleen Mees (born Heleen Nijkamp, 1968, Hengelo)[1] is a Dutch opinion writer, economist and lawyer. She has been credited as being a third wave feminist.[3]

Biography
Mees graduated in Economy and Law at University of Groningen. From 1992 to 1998, Mees worked for the Dutch Treasury in The Hague. From 1998 to 2000 Mees worked as a national expert for the European Commission in Brussels.[5] In 2000 she emigrated to the USA, where she changed her surname to Mees.[6] Mees lives in Brooklyn, New York.[2]
Mees' breakthrough as an opinion writer in the Netherlands came in 2006 when she wrote The time is long overdue that women should go to work.[8] That same year, she co-founded Women on Top, an organization that until 2011 advocated more women in top jobs.[9] 
From 2006 to 2010 Mees wrote a bi-weekly column in NRC Handelsblad, and from 2012 to 2013 for Het Financieele Dagblad. Her work has been published in the Financial Times, Foreign Policy and other international newspapers. Currently she is a columnist for Project Syndicate[11] and the German magazine Capital. Mees is the author of three books. 
Mees has been president of the New York chapter of the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA) in New York. In 2008, she worked as a volunteer for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.[12]
In August 2012, Mees completed a doctoral thesis at the Erasmus School of Economics, focusing on the effect of China's economy on the emergence of the 2008 global financial crisis.[13] While completing her research, she worked as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Tilburg University.[14] From September 2012 until July 2013, Mees was employed as an Adjunct Associate Professor of Public Administration at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.[15]
In July 2013, Mees was arrested in New York on charges of stalking her former lover, the chief economist of Citigroup, Willem Buiter.[16] In March 2014, the court decided that the case against Mees was to be dismissed in one year provided that she complies with two conditions.[17]",0

 http://www.mediaradar.org/mcdowell_kanin_credible.php links to an interview where McDowell admits to research into false rape reporting.  theforensicexaminer/Gross (used in article) cites the 1281 sample size number, and the link to how it is possible that some people misquoted 556 has been quoted as: 

The discrepancy in the size of the dataset can perhaps be explained by the wording in the CfMR article which implies that the 556 case dataset was an earlier study “cited” in McDowell’s 1985 paper, not the main subject of it. The difference in percentages between CfMR and mediaRADAR might be explained by CfMR citing McDowell correctly, while the 60% figure was obtained by someone just adding the 80 “false” cases to the 256 “inconclusive” ones and calling them all false. (http://www.feministcritics.org/blog/2009/04/20/claims-about-mcdowells-research-into-false-rape-allegations-are-not-credible-noh/)

 but the mcdowell section (here) didn't include a 60% claim.  It included the 45% claim. No reason to throw that out.  We should use the 1281 sample size. One reason that the study is often attributed to McDowell and Hibler is their 1987 book """"Practical aspects of rape investigations"""" http://books.google.ca/books?id=iV398oA5DdsC&pg;=PA181&lpg;=PA181&dq;=charles+mcDowell+practical+rape+investigation&source;=bl&ots;=P2Yt9i_z6y&sig;=R-ezsxhzIw3KPJYGnybSBJp2BX8&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=0_59T8SGI6Xd0QGRoPTHDg&ved;=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q;=charles%20mcDowell%20practical%20rape%20investigation&f;=false , and so likely published there.  Perhaps we should disprove the existance of this book, before claiming that an unused potentially wrong version of McDowell exists invalidates that mcdowell exists.

"Hi,

Taekkyeon is a sensitive topic because many people want to learn it and not enough qualified teachers to disperse the knowledge. If you truly desire to learn Taekkyeon there are only two masters in the world who know the complete system. One is in S. Korea, he doesn't teach many people. The other lives in Los Angeles, CA. The truth is, you have to either move to Los Angeles or S. Korea if you want to learn the Taekkyeon as taught by GM Song and Im Ho. 
I will tell you this. GM Song was a bodyguard of the remaining Choson Dynasty family memebers. The top Taekkyeon masters always defended the king, They were in the military. Taekkyeon was a military artform first and a civil cultural game for children and adults later. By calling Taekkyeon a civil martial art game is demoting it from its real status. However, Taekkyeon is still a Holistic Martial art with many healing aspects and a civil game for children and adults. Its all three!

On another note, the article currently sits at First-rate (with a hyphen) with a redirect from First rate (without a hyphen).  I think we're both in agreement that this should be the other way round, and I suggest we move it as soon as the discussion on capitalisation is complete.  Another thing we agree strongly on is the insane use of pennant number as a disambiguation for modern ships - fine for US Navy, but madness for the RN.  Who searches for HMS Ark Royal (R07)?

Descriptions such as """"Heinrich """"worked"""" in German Southwest Africa, and Hermann was a """"well known member"""" of the NSDAP""""; this guy """"originated the slogan Lebensraum while in GSWA in 1910, a sympathizer who influenced the NSDAP since 1923""""; or even """"member NSDAP in 1933, founder of German East Africa"""" (this article is not about German East Africa). Enumerating every single person who visited GSWA and later had some role in WWII does not seem especially remarkable or particularly informative and the entire section could be reduced to a paragraph or two summarizing the arguments for the link that some authors have provided. Remember, this article is about German South-West Africa - i.e. narrower in scope than German colonialism and wider than the Herero and Namaqua Genocide.  (''talk) """,0

@Settleman 

In this article that you created, you wrote """"(...) pray at the compound"""". That's not exactly what the source says.

Would you mind reporting the statu quo that has been negociated between Jewih religious authorities and Waqf, as well as between Jordan and Israeli authorities regarding the management of the """"al-Haram al-Sharif / Temple Mount"""". That's an important background in order to understand the situation. Of course, would some group contests this, that should reported too.

I could not find this in the source  """"funded by the northern branch of Israel’s Islamic Movement"""". The reference to Isrel is amazing and in any case requires a very good sources with information cross-checking.

I wonder if the use of """"Jewish extremists"""" and """"activists"""" is appropriate here. Given the sources are highly poved (not to say not wp:rs) this should be contextualized at minimum.

 Some villages (vesnice) are parts of cities (Sedlec-Prčice is """"město"""" but contain two towns and 34 small villages as municipal parts), some villages are parts of big municipalities which contain several (up to tens) of villages, some villages constitute a small one-village municipality. Municipalities which are neither """"město"""" nor """"městys"""" are sometimes called """"vesnice"""" but that is incorrect and confusing. Municipalities which are neither """"město"""" nor """"městys"""" are called simply """"obec"""" (municipality). 

 Cities and towns are also municipalities but use the word """"město"""" or """"městys"""" instead of """"obec"""". (There exists also differentiation by administrative level - the first grade is simply obec, the second grade is """"pověřená obec"""" (""""obec s pověřeným obecním úřadem""""), the third grade is """"obec s rozšířenou působností"""". Most of the second-grade municipalites and nearly all third-grade municipalities are cities (but many of smaller cities are of the first grade). The biggest 26 cities (cca over 40.000 inhab.) are titled """"statutární město"""". 

 Besides that, some cities are seat of the district (""""okresní město"""", now only formal) or seat of the region (""""krajské město"""", in both systems of regions). Prague as """"hlavní město"""" (capital city) have a special status.   """,0

I find it telling that neither of you had the courtesy to respond to my proposal and K3 went ahead to begin editing the article without any consensus being reached. Let the record note that I am now compelled to reciprocate your actions and make my suggested changes. JJ obviously lacks any serious knowledge in this area and was only here for circumventing 3RR, so there's no point answering his most recent underinformed questions. I'll focus on Kautilya3. If you were significantly acquainted with the topic, you would understand that the Kakatiyas were feudatories of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty.So the question of when the formal royal dynasty began is a natural question, not """"patent nonsense"""", and probably one of the reasons some previous editor changed the old date to """"Uncertain"""". 1053 was the date given for the first royal inscription based on the permanent grant of Hanumakonda (their original capital for your edification) as a fief to the Kakatiyas. I also suggest you both refresh your knowledge of WP:Civility, to improve the quality of your current and future discussions. If you don't know about an author, here's a hint, ask...politely..rather than first disrespectfully dismissing the author, then demanding his c.v. What's more, his book speaks for itself. Its the History and Culture of Andhra Pradesh (the old state which included the new state of Telangana). This is not some arcane ivory tower speculative paper, but a WP:RS. So if you want to change the date to 956CE, perfectly fine by me. The only difference is, I had the sense of responsibility to provide a citation. I suggest you do the same. 

Let me repeat that I am perfectly fine with having a respectful dialogue. But as I've said before, it takes two hands to clap. Ball is in your court, gentlemen.

I'm only answering this because I'm really bored, excruciatingly so, and I also find it kind of amusing. People writing and, or, approving of psychologically harmful disinformation, that starving girls read, including the expressed desire to include a potentially triggering image of such a starving girl, illicits no response whatsoever. A collapsible box however, seems to be somehow construed as a threat to  civilization. One inane comment after another becomes somewhat irritating. 
Despite only having a ninth grade education, I actually did learn how to read. I also learned the proper use of Latin phrases, e.g.; id est (i.e) and exempli gratia (e.g.). For example, or to use an abbreviation of a Latin phrase, e.g.; ...in article text, i.e., how they were recently used here. Should have been e.g., not, i.e.. That being said, I read this:  
MOS:COLLAPSE:Scrolling lists and boxes that toggle text display between hide and show are acceptable for use, but should not be used in article prose.  This includes reference lists, image galleries, and image captions; Collapsible sections are useful in ,infoboxes, or to consolidate information already covered in prose.

This is not prose:
Candidate genes include dopamine transporter, dopamine receptors D2/D3,[46] dopamine beta-hydroxylase monoamine oxidase A, catecholamine-methyl transferase, serotonin transporter promoter (SLC6A4), 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2A), 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B receptor (5-HT1B),[47] the 10-repeat allele of the DAT1 gene,[48] the 7-repeat allele of the DRD4 gene,[48] and the dopamine beta hydroxylase gene (DBH TaqI).[49]

Your alleged concern over compliance with WP:ACCESS is unwarranted and seems to be self serving. It says nothing about """"Collapsible boxes"""".

 Regarding References Cited 

Thanks for the heads up.  The reason I changed all those headings was because of the following message left after some of my work:
""""This article includes a list of references, related reading or external links, but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations. Please improve this article by introducing more precise citations where appropriate.""""
This implies since I did not do in-line citations that the source material remains unclear and uncited, which is not true, though I understand Wikipedia's policy for standardization.
I do politely disagree that the word """"reference"""" by itself implies internal citation.  It does not.  Many professional journals' ending sections say """"References Cited"""", because """"References"""" by itself could mean simply works used but not cited anywhere.  That is, it is a """"referral"""" to the actual work.  Thus I did not see it as vandalism, but rather, as clarification.

And my reason that I am advising caution about the reports is that for now only the Wall street journal and a Spanish media outlet have reported on the possible story. No other mainstream media has reported on it. And again the everlasting propaganda war of this civil war. The rebels claimed to had compleat control of Brega for three days straight until they admited to control only a third of the town (and plus there are sporadic clashes in the areas of the town they claim to control). So I am again sceptical about this claim also.",0

Okay, thanks, that's clear, I will action that when I get time. It is not really that I am attacking anybody, but that I am defending myself again the attacks of User:Bobrayner against articles that I spent a lot of time on (without pay) to inform readers. The main objection I have to User:Bobrayner's editing is that he edits articles without any proper knowledge of the subject and then substitutes his own interpretation, the result being a bunch of errors. Let me give a recent example to illustrate. In the article on the Marxian concept of Surplus product, User:Bobrayner recently wiped out the sentence """"The concept plays an important role in Das Kapital"""", but for no good reason. After all, Marx writes that: """"Since the production of surplus-value is the determining purpose of capitalist production, the size of a given quantity of wealth must be measured, not by the absolute quantity produced, but by the relative magnitude of the surplus product."""" Cap. Vol. 1, Penguin, pp. 338-339. This is absolutely central to Marx's argument. The concept is discussed in more detail across about ten pages and at least five places in Capital Vol. 2, and again in at least 11 different places in Capital Vol. 3. So it is an important theoretical concept in Das Kapital. Yet User:Bobrayner wipes that out! Next, I write """"Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics, surplus economics as well as sociology and other social sciences”. User:Bobrayner wipes out “surplus economics”, “archaeology”, “sociology” and “other social sciences” so that the  sentence now reads: “Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics.[2] political anthropology, cultural anthropology, economic anthropology” (in that case, it should really be “AND economic anthropology”). However, scholars familiar with the concept know quite well that this concept is used exactly in the way that I said, and references can be provided for this (in fact I quote plenty examples in the rest of the article). However, if I provided references, then User:Bobrayner will no doubt wipe them out on the ground that I am offering a “quote farm” or some such thing. User:Bobrayner next wipes out the statement that “For most of the history of civil society, the meaning of the surplus product was fairly obvious and clear. It consisted of (1) that part of what workers produced (products, offspring or services) which they had to hand over to the chief, the landowner, the lord, or the state, as a tax, rent or tribute, and (2) incidental surplus produce, in excess of the producers' own requirements, which was traded for other goods. However, the meaning of surplus product becomes less clear in capitalist society (see below).” There is nothing particularly controversial about this statement, and it could be referenced without any problem; I explain the reasoning in subsequent sections of the article. Next, User:Bobrayner wipes out “the statement that “Since trade always involves two or more parties with their own interests in the matter, the meanings of that trade can be construed in different ways by different stakeholders, and they can evolve across time. If that is the case, the economic meanings of trade are never completely fixed once and for all. Such ambiguities gave rise to many different interpretations of what """"fair trade"""" or """"just trade""""(and therefore trade of benefit to society) might be considered to be. For a long time, it was very difficult for economic theorists to separate out the moral judgement about different kinds of trade, from a scientific appraisal of the actual objective processes of trade, because commerce was dominated by legal codes and by religion.” For any scholar of the subject, this is quite obvious, but nevertheless User:Bobrayner wipes it out. After wiping out a few more small  clarifying bits, User:Bobrayner modifies the sentence “The existence of a surplus product normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour” and adds, “In Marxism, the existence of a """"surplus product"""" normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour.” But this doesn’t even distinguish between Marx and all sorts of Marxisms or Marxists or other historians using this concept.  When I write carefully, “With the bourgeois state, taxpayers typically have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally. That possibility has rarely existed in non-capitalist states; there, any public criticism of the state  that the critic  could be fined, imprisoned or killed,” then User:Bobrayner changes that to “With the bourgeois state, taxpayers have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally. That possibility has",0

"The ArsTech article provides a great potted history of the project, it includes a lot of the information I had hoped to read here at Wikipedia. I'll try to briefly summarize: from a 1 man project to a 2 man project, eventually getting a code repository. Story on Slashdot November 3, 2001, bringing many more developers and users. The scope of the project expands to more than just SCUMM games. Rewritten from C to C++ starting in 2002, addition of a GUI, etc. 
 Then the legal issues with LucasArts  this is far a more notable part of the history of the project than an alleged GPL violation many many years later  and their amicable resolution and ongoing development of the project. (That's just page 1)
 Then cooperation from games companies, sharing of source code and in some cases offering the games as freeware (a section of prose on this would provide context and make the long lists of later in the article more meaningful). ScummVM developers evening working with companies under NDAs. Merging the SCI engine goes from April fools joke to actual reality many years later. 
 page 4 of the article talks about the Mystic GPL issue that already has been given undue weight in this article, an issue best solved by rebalancing the article with more prose. The article mentions touch support added for WebOS that might be generalized and also mentions the Google Summer of Code.

"""POV fix ==

I removed text that claimed that most liberals claim the posting of the commandments on a government building violated the """"separation of church and state"""" (and the statement that """"separation of church and state is not part of the constitution"""" or whatever it was) and replaced it with """"liberals oppose the posting of the Ten Commandments on public property, arguing that it violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."""" and I wikified the link to the first amendment.

While posting the ten commandments is not literally """"making a law"""" establishing a state religion, it could create a """"slippery slope"""" situation that eventually entangles government in religion to a degree that the establishment clause is more likely to be violated.  It is a rational position to presume that it is safer for the constitution for the government to """"avoid the appearence"""" of impropriety by not posting religious symbols.  I wonder how many Christian or Jewish groups would like to walk past a Ganesh or Buddha statue whenever they go to court?  Probably they wouldn't.  Religious neutrality is a critical element of American civil society, and reflects the reality of pluralistic religious faith.  By acknowledging none, the government is actually honoring all of them and the beliefs of every American as equal.  

It would also violate the Equal Protection clause for the religious beliefs of any citizen, including a belief that the ten commandments were of divine origin, or that the clearly religious commandments must be upheld to avoid angering a god, to be sponsored by the government by posting them as they commonly are on government buildings.

These positions better reflect the normative liberal view of the establishment clause, and I will see if it is possible to work them into the article as a description of these philosophies, without promoting them.  Understanding positions that are contrary to your own can be an important source of personal intellectual growth.

I also explained the conservative/religious view of the posting a bit better, and deleted the reference to the Dershowitz article because 1) it was totally irrelevant (about same sex marriage, not posting the ten commandments), and 2)the editor who referenced it to support his POV argument that liberals only favor a separation of church and state when it suits their purposes either deliberately or accidently misunderstood Dershowitz's point.  Dershowitz was arguing that government should be less entangled in deciding who could get married than it is now, and leave it to the individual religious to decide what marriages are acceptable.  This would promote the separation of church and state, not undermine it.  Because it was both POV, and reflected confused thinking, not to mention totally irrelevant, I simply removed it rather than trying to fix it.

That quote discusses what happens to the penis after circumcision, which is not what the article is about. The sentence may use the word """"foreskin"""" but it is clearly a quote that is directly related to circumcision, rather than the foreskin, thus it is off-topic, and does not belong in the article. The only part of the sentence directly related to the foreskin is """"nerve endings in the foreskin,"""" and that section by itself doesn't add much to the article.

Allowing material that discusses what happens to the penis after the foreskin is removed would allow the entire Sexual effects of circumcision and Medical analysis of circumcision articles to be copied to Foreskin. When taken to this extreme, it's quite evident that discussing what happens to the penis when the foreskin is removed is beyond the scope of this article. If readers wish to learn about what happens to the penis when the foreskin is removed, there are plenty of circumcision-related pages that are directly related to that topic on wikipedia, and we already link to them from the Foreskin article.

It appears that the article is being used as a soapbox for discussing circumcision because of the number of sentences devoted to circumcision in the article. If it was just one or two sentences, I would not have a basis for making this accusation, but as we can see from this diff (your revert conveniently shows all three of my edits, so I'm using that rather than listing them individually), the amount of off-topic text devoted to circumcision is substantial.

Thanks for continuing our discussion, I think we're getting somewhere again. However, I also note that you have now been reverted by two other editors, indicating a lack of consensus for including the material in question, so I'm not sure if further discussion is necessary, but I'm happy to continue the discussion if you wish.

Dear Sitush,

You have asked about the independence of """"Andhra Kshatriyas History by Pencommunities.matsa Krishnam Raju, Kshatriya vamsa ratnamala""""
earlier in this talk page. Its strange how you follow a different standard when it comes to Kammas page where you have vilified a caste book (Kammavari charitra by KB Chowdary) which is more of a Caste book rather an independent author, as it is 
written by A kamma on Kamma caste.
I may not be a full timed wiki author/ contributor like you, but I do follow same rules for all wiki pages and communities. my only concern is you have been following double standards in Kamma page may be its your community.

Apart from Andhra Kshatriyas History book,
you have also removed content which had AP archaelogical inscription sentences (http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume10/kakatiya_dynasty_1.html) and 
sentences from Pg 174 The History of Andhra Country, Yashoda Devi.

As you are the author for Kammas page plz be reminded that same rules apply for all pages, if some caste book can be taken as reference/citation, then can every other community can refer ther own community history books.
I request you to be fair to other communities also.

Basically she cut me off and said, 'Save your breath  the president has already decided what he's going to do on this,'  Mr. Haass said.

"Re: Glitch Art 

Hey James,

I'm an open-source practitioner and a big fan of wikipedia. I also happen to be a glitch theorist/practitioner and an active member of that community. I created the first Glitch Art wiki page some years back. I realize the page was flawed, I'll admit I'm not the most encyclopedic writer and I have a lot to learn about the rules of this community but I don't know that the page's imperfections (no pun intended) was cause for deletion. I've been meaning to work on the page for a while, but have been preoccupied with life stuff. Many others have worked on the page while its been up and have helped with its shortcomings and many more have used the page as a resource (both are contingent on the page remaining up and accessible).

Is it possible to reinstate the page, and if not what needs to be done to make that possible?

thanks,

Tony, thanks for the apology. However, it really doesn't alter the fact that Wikipedia as a body has been entirely hypocritical in regard to sceptics of global warming. The """"neutral point of view"""" is defined as the """"peer reviewed science"""" - which if you had read the climategate emails and followed this subject generally, you would know really means the view of a very political group of """"scientists"""" who have used wikipedia like a propaganda machine. Unfortunately, for you, the internet doesn't forget. It's already starting to happen on the climate, and no doubt within a few years I am quite sure there will be numerous instances, in numerous subject, where people are bringing out old articles from Wikipedia and highlighting the way they were POV in the extreme. I'm absolutely sure one of those areas will be the climate articles. And very soon as the """"consensus"""" on subjects change as real facts (and not opinions of people calling themselves """"scientists) come to light, the right wing press will have a field day highlighting the embarrassing way Wikipedia got it wrong in so many areas.

 Hagin's Teachings 

Kennith E Hagin  Kennith Hagin was a preacher of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  His life is well documented and his ministry succeeds him, by his son Kennith Hagin Jr., and is based in Tulsa Oklahoma.  The emphasis of his popular ministry was on faith.  He stated in his writing that he held nothing against anyone, who disagreed with him.  Among his readers, Hagin remains a very popular and positive force.  His writings center around what the Bible says.   

Promises A popular saying the epitomizes what Hagin taught is """"The Bible says it.  I believe it. That settles it.""""  Hagin believed in promises of God, found in the Bible.  He has stated in his teachings that the Bible is a system of promises and rewards. 

References Hagin did use material from others in some of his teachings. The word teaching needs to be emphasised here.  As another person so poignantly stated, Hagin was publishing a message, not trying to win academic awards.   He even stated that he was once given some material from a retiring pentecostal preacher and pastor to use as he would.  

Full Life Kennith Hagin live a full life.  He died past the age of 80, when he wasn't expected to live past being a teenager.  At a young age he became a pastor, and then later traveled the country preaching and teaching on the promises of God and praying for the sick.  He started a Bible training center to prepare people for ministry.  Hagin wrote that as a young man, his desire was to find happiness in life and have a family by his own testimony, he was able to have all these things. 

Today One of the great reason Hagin remains popular today is that people who are in need are looking for answers.  Kennith Hagin taught on receiving the promises of God, as found in the Bible, through faith.  His writing bring hope to millions of people.

"""They are progressive power metal buddy, when a site reviews an album they don't lost every genre, and by the way AMG lists kamelot as heavy/death/black metal so who cares what you found on some random webpage.  The fact is they are progressive.

As wiki states prog metal is """"Progressive metal is a genre of heavy metal music which shares traits with progressive rock including use of complex compositional structures, odd time signatures, and intricate instrumental playing. The high level of musical proficiency is often combined with a lyrical counterpart in the form of epic textual concepts, resulting in lengthy songs and concept albums. As a result of these factors, progressive metal is rarely heard on mainstream radio and video programs, much due to that the length of the songs are not suited for those medias.""""

Kamelot meets most of those requirements, to deny that they are prog is to deny them what they are.

"Well I suggest you read that file again and turn your thinking cap on this time. I do not need a lecture about the 'meaning' of George Wrights actions from you. George Wright has destroyed the organization along with a couple of editors here, and others at Techinc Washing. I also think that your use of the term 'Technocracy fundamentalist movement' is ignorant and demeaning. I posit that you being a 'self styled expert' that bit off the whole thing, and has instantly digested it is a little comical. You are dead wrong in your appraisal. If anything those people are the ones that are more in the genre you are suggesting. Building church`s in a Technate ? Special Interest groups in a Technate. Kolzene wrote and edited much of the Q&A;, and according to wiki that is self generated original conclusion stuff then that is a form of 'advertising' and blog 'driving' to original conclusions. To say what they are doing is a movement is sad. There are two people their that self publish stuff, and have sucked in the unwary who do not stay long. 
Further more you imply that movement has made 'progress' over time and become more interesting and more representative of the current status of things. That is not true. Technocracy was thought out originally to a purpose by a handful of brilliant scientists. Your implication of fundamentalism is just plain 'stupid'. You say that you have not read the book for a while ?
Well I suggest you read the last two chapters with a view to opening your mind a little, and with a view to thinking about the design.  http://technocracy-incorporated.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Technocracy%2520study%2520guide.pdf
Technocracy%20study%20guide.pdf  There were 200 to 300,000 people for a while that thought this was not only the way to go but worked toward that end. Now there are 4 people on the NET site and Two people on the TechCa site that claim they and their 'belief system' , reward and punishment, 'contract', and church building, and referendum Democracy voting voting is 'smart'
These people are ignorant. You sound ignorant now also. Technocracy is important. It deserves to be fairly brought out. As to your suggestion about what I can do, you suck, and so does the horse you road in on. Oh and I did not 'assault' anyone, I told the truth about George, and since when do you decide what is unacceptable ? You are an ignorant person, or perhaps a believer like them. You now lack credibility.  ( )",0

"SHB pictures 

Here's what I suggest makes a good SHB picture:

Follow the fair use criteria, especially the Images that cannot be fair use guidelines. These supersede all the following criteria. Also, source your images fully (including all applicable from issue/page/panel, scan source, web source) and give a fair use rationale.
Ensure that the picture clearly shows as much of the character as possible:
The ideal image is a full-body, three-quarter picture of the character standing straight with no background, with a facing-the-camera or profile picture as the next-best.
If a full-body shot is unavailable, the picture must show the whole of the head and torso (or the equivalent for non-humanoid characters).
Visibly contorted poses should not be used under any circumstances.
Pictures which hide significant areas the character in shadow should be avoided (exceptions apply only where the shadow is itself part of the character's look - e.g. Raven.), as should pictures where blur or distortion effects are applied.
Colouring should be neutral - pictures which have a heavy colour cast, or otherwise depict the character with false colours should not be uploaded unless the cast has been removed first.
Heavily stylised art should only be considered for use when the character is closely associated with the style to the exclusion of less extreme styles.
Pictures which have more characters and/or objects than the subject of the article should only be used if the subject is the most prominent object - editing the picture, by cropping, obscuring and/or painting out the other characters may help to ensure this.
If the character has a clearly-defined primary costume (e.g. Superman), a picture of this should be used. Otherwise, the most recent ongoing costume of the character should be used.

Hopefully, you can see why I consider the Colossus and Juggernaut pictures (in addition to the earlier Turner pictures) Not Fit For Purpose. -",0

 God created everything in six days and rested on the seventh  

The article states that """"The text of Genesis relates that God created everything in six days and rested on the seventh.""""  And I agree if you do a casual reading of English translations.  However, some commentaters, notably E. W. Bullinger, argue that the six days describes the creation of the new world after the """"world that was"""".  I have researched and understand Bullinger's argument.  I will present it here.

NIV:

Ge 1:1  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2  Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

KJV:

 Ge 1:1  In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

Now, the English word """"formless"""" in the NIV and the english words """"without form"""" in the KJV are translations of the Hebrew word tohu, G/K Number H9332 and Strong's Number H8414.  The Strongs Concordance lists one of the meanins of toho as """"to lie waste"""" or simply """"waste.""""  

Likewise, the english word """"empty"""" in the NIV and the english word """"void"""" in the KJV is translated from the Hewbrew bohu, G/K Number H983 and Strong's Number H922.  Strong's Concordance provides one of the definitions of bohu as ruin.

Consequently, it is argued that the verses could be considered something like ~ """"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2  Now the earth was waste and ruin, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.""""

Furthermore, Bullinger's observations continue to, and link 2Pe3:6, which states (KJV) 2Pe3:6 """"Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.""""  Bullinger believes that this is a reference to Ge1:1-2, and not the flood during Noah's time.  He concludes with """"The creation in eternity past, to which all fossils and remains belong.""""  (Companion Bible, page 3).

Consequently, the articles should include, in my opinion, the fact that some theologians reject the young Earth on literal grounds.

See the Bullinger's side notes [].

Also, a quick google search will show that other literal interpreters [] with Bullinger.  

To summarize:  The article should be changed to reflect the fact that some literal interpreters of the Bible do not think the Earth is roughly 6000 years old.   Vacuous Poet""",0

 Hi again Ethel

As you have requested i will quote from Brooker and Kleinig:

""""As a generalisation, """"forest trees"""" are single-stemmed and have a crown forming a minor proportion of the whole tree height, with the combined forest crowns occupying at least 30% of the ground cover. """"Woodland trees"""" are single-stemmed although they may branch at a short distance above ground level, and have a crown occupying a major proportion of the tree height, with the combined crowns occupying less than 30% of the ground cover.

Having reflected on the above and the original edit I did I can see that there are interpretative errors in my edit. If you would like to make cleaner sense of the above in the article, as I see you have attempted in historic edits,then by all means, please,  go ahead.

As to Plot, 80% of it is still there, but minus some sloppy sentences that add no value or contain the previously mentioned colloquialisms. On a similar note, all that good info on the illustrations is still there, but as it is a publication matter it belongs in the Publication history. 

Reception is largely fine, with two sentence fragments culled as that is the writer inserting their point of view, not the quoted source. The Legacy component is actually PH material. The list of characters is unnecessary, as a link provides said list, and in the main article it looks fannish. Some of the related commentary was also unnecessary.

 Military history WikiProject Newsletter, Issue I 

 The Military history WikiProject Newsletter Issue I - March 2006  Project news
 An independent military history peer review has been created for the benefit of the project.  A number of articles have already been reviewed, receiving significantly more feedback within the project than they did on the generic peer review page.
 The project's Collaboration of the Fortnight got off to a great start with Ferdinand Foch and is now focusing on the military history of Spain.
 Two new task forces—dealing with warfare during classical antiquity and the Middle Ages—have been created.
 An effort to build a catalogue of high-quality maps for use in military history articles is now underway.
 The newly-formed translation department is looking for volunteers to help with translating featured articles from other-language Wikipedias. From the Coordinators
Welcome to the inaugural issue of the Military history WikiProject's newsletter!  We hope that this new format will help members—especially those who may be unable to keep up with some of the rapid developments that tend to occur—find new groups and programs within the project that they may wish to participate in.  

Please consider this inital issue to be a prototype; as always, any comments and suggestions are quite welcome, and will help us improve the newsletter in the coming months.

 Proposed guidelines for categories of military people are currently being discussed.  A number of issues have already been resolved, but the proposed scheme is still in draft form and further input would be very welcome.

Thanks for getting back to me. I share your """"opinion that we should point out clearly and repeatedly that both Republicans and Democrats are clearly to the right of the demographic center,"""" and I agree it seems like a minority opinion in the mass media. But I still view it as a neutral opinion. With this view, the idea that """"the Democratic Party is almost evenly divided between left-of-center liberals and more centrist moderates"""" seems irrelevant in the lead of an American Left article. I thought that text written in the prefaces to the Encyclopedia of the American Left might hold sway over other editors by serving to dispel disagreements about the scope, lead, and the most important subdivisions of topic. That might be the case in German Wikipedia, and I think it's the case here in science and history articles, but, in politics, perhaps no academic authority can ever hold sway over editors here. This means that even the foundational defining terminology of US politics articles like this one with a potentially ambiguous scope might never be stable. But I respond easily to baiting, I bait other editors myself, I can be sarcastic, and I'm an infrequent (but confident) contributor. If the article is improving now, then it's probably best for someone like me to just shut up.

 Radiocarbon dating 

Most writings on the DSS say they are mostly dated between 150 BCE and 70 CE. I see the section on radiocarbon dating here mostly falls in that general line (that is also used at the start of this article). I see that one radiocarbon dating cited here says they fall between 385 BCE to 82 CE with """"68%"""" reliability (not sure of the correct term used for this part of the dating). Does anyone know a lot about these dating methods? I'm guessing since the 150 BCE to 70 CE is the usual range always given, the 385 BCE is an outlier (as I've never heard any number going back beyond 200 BCE in anything I've read) not sure how this relates to the 68% number provided on that as well. Just wondered if anyone had any background info on that as it can be seen as contradictory (with the usual 150 BCE- 70 CE dating given everywhere else).  """,0

Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

Dear Administrators:
""""I would like to file a complaint against user """"nescio"""" for wanton vandalism of the article entitled """"Police State"""". User Nescio has been deleting sections of the article he or she personally disagrees with e.g. historical police state examples """" Chile under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet"""" and """"Argentina under the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional"""", as well as other examples .

Regretfully , I have no choice but to request that this user be blocked from editing at this time. 
Sincerely yours,

It seems that you harass anyone who attempts to edit the Police state article without your viewpoint. This is against WP:NPOV policy. Please stop harassing users otherwise more effective measures will have to be undertaken.

Both edits are well sourced and, after a cursory look at the editing history, it can be seen whoever removed them did not give an explanation for their actions.

My Offer Anent My Unblock
I am back to pursue my case, not in the form of """"trolling and harassment"""", but in a polite, urbane manner. I ask that you bear with me on this.

History
From alpha to omega, here is an aperçu.
My work on Wikipedia commenced rather abruptly when I made my debut using 207.97.213.170. My subsequent edits were along the same line. I was promptly blocked for vandalism. In retrospect, I understand that my edits were definitely not constructive, but I would not construe them as vandalism, as I was just an abecedarian then. 

I returned with Hiineedrequestforcomment to """"pursue defense of my actions on my previous account"""". I was quite hostile to Jpgordon and continued to argue my case quite impolitely, insulting other users. After making my only constructive edit, I was blocked for """"trolling and harassment"""". I continued to argue against my block, and my block settings were changed, disabling me from editing at all.

I returned with The Reformed Editor, truly thinking I was reformed. I created my userpage declaring that I was the alternate account of Hiineedrequestforcomment. I made several improvements to Julia Mancuso, Shaun White, Ted Ligety, Purna, Akola city, and 2010 Winter Olympics, but then I started arguing with users about the ranking of the 2010 Winter Olympics medal table. I do admit that my actions were quite inappropriate. Après reading my userpage promulgation, Andrwsc blocked me. I asked him tersely, """"Does [my block] mean that all indefinitely-blocked users cannot ever return to Wikipedia to make changes, even if they are helpful?"""" This prompted him to change the block settings of Hiineedrequestforcomment to allow me to make my offer. Here I am now.

Declarations
I pledge allegiance to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. However, that promise has unfortunately been denied to me.
I promise to let sleeping dogs lie. It was my obsession with pursuing justice of that petty IP that led to my downfall.
I promise to continue making constructive edits. The following are the inexhaustive diffs for all the constructive edits I have made:
Bode Miller
Julia Mancuso
Shaun White
Ted Ligety
Purna
Akola city
2010 Winter Olympics
And many more. . .
I issue an apology to all those editors who have construed me as a detriment to Wikipedia.

Final Thoughts
The year of 2009 was an annus mirabilis, but my only regret was not coming to Wikipedia earlier.
To Andrwsc: you didn't think much of my constructive edits. Yes, they may not have promoted articles to Featured Article of Good Article statuses, but nonetheless, they were improvements to the general quality of Wikipedia.Also, I don't understand why you are giving me this chance when you say at the Administrators' noticeboard that you """"would personally !vote oppose to an unblock"""". Does that mean I have no chance of getting unblocked?
I will assay to refrain from argufying that may launch into a full-scale argumentum.
I hope to participate in the development of an accurate, just, collegial ambiance here on Wikipedia. For me, in the aftertime, I hope to develop mutual understanding with my fellow editors. My amour propre is quite high now, so please don't ruin it.
I hope you will help me help Wikipedia by unblocking me forthwith and allowing me to apply my abracadabra to those articles stark",0

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

"Hi 
Hi . Just to be clear, I haven't made any threat. You misunderstood. I told , that if he will vandalize Vaslui articles again, I will report him to the admins. I didn't said anything about me to block him, because I don't have this kind of power. Starting three or four weeks ago, an anonymous user, kept editing on Vaslui page, false information about the team. The media speculated many transfers, and this user edited them all as being sure transfers. This was for almost three weeks, when I just couldn't keep revert his edits anymore. So I started to reedit every single information from Vaslui page, and linked every sentence (because there was no reference before), and I applied for semi-protection for SC Vaslui page. After I got the page protected, there was no longer any false information, until  edited again one of the players who just signed for Vaslui (back then, he wasn't). I saw his contribs, and noticed that he is 13 years old, and is a big SC Vaslui fan, and he edited almost the exact pages the anonymous editor wrote before. I don't think that's a coincidence. However, I noticed he has no current activity, so I think he either got my message, or he was blocked by admins. Either way, I'm more than happy. Hope you see this message, and reply me.

I think Pittsburgh did get a #1 ranking a few years ago in a Livability survey (can't remember where, but I don't think it was Forbes), and that might be worthy of a mention in an intro to the Culture section; but an entire section on """"Livability"""" seems like overkill to me,...   

Agreed. The livability of Pittsburgh doesn't need to be flogged so much.  Not to mention how much is uncited in that section.  

montage image in infobox
I've reverted recent additions to the infobox of montage image (collections of photos) because they were simply added and created by random users without any discussion whatsoever. The most recent montage added is actually rather poor quality:

For starters, these images are not very well separated  there needs to at least be lines between the images  the trolley at the bottom really blends in with the image of PNC park, which looks really bad. See the Washington, D.C. article for an example of how this is done.

The image of the Cathedral of Learning is horrible quality  very pixelated. As a matter of fact, most of these images are very grainy and pixelated, and shouldn't be used as an infobox image. Most of the images seem to be used later in the article as well  images in the infobox are better if they're more unique, and not used over again. There seem to be plenty of images to choose from though, and we could probably prune some of the images later in the article as well (some sections are very image-heavy).

The image of the astronomical observatory isn't even in Pittsburgh itself, but in the suburbs and surrounding areas, so it shouldn't be included in the montage anyways. The buildings and structures pictured in the infobox should be key buildings that define the city of Pittsburgh. I think we should stick with five images for a montage  start with a good image of the downtown area/skyline and put that in the middle. Then put two images above that and two images below it. The Cathedral of Learning seems to be a pretty big landmark, and certainly can be included; including CMU as well would seem to represent Pittsburgh's status as an educational city. Maybe put those two as the images at the bottom? For the other two images, maybe either Heinz Field or PNC Park (but not both, as too many sports pictures would be overkill; but we could put, for example, PNC Park in the infobox and then a picture of Heinz Field in the Sports section). For the last image, maybe either a picture of the incline, to connect with the city's industrial past, or a city of one of the bridges?

But overall, I think we need more discussion on this, because the two images that random users have added as a montage were very poor quality, and really were just randomly collected images from the ones submitted to the page so far. I will continue to revert any additions by anyone that adds a montage image without discussion or consensus.   

I agree that there are too many photos in that montage and the quality was lacking as was the separation of pictures.  However, the Allegheny Observatory is indeed in the City of Pittsburgh, located in Riverview Park on the North Side in the aptly-named Observatory Hill neighborhood.  Other than that, I agree with your choices for pictures, though I would make a pitch for a photo of landmark bridge(s) rather than of CMU whose main building is recognizable but not iconic in the way the Cathedral of Learning, the inclines, the bridges, or t",0

What I appreciate about this discussion, is that it is being conducted by people who demonstrate a great deal of concern for the issues involved - both the subtleties and the sweep of the issue. I believe this is appropriate (though admittedly tiring) because, in legal matters, a great deal often hinges on a comma, or the inclusion/exclusion of the word """"not,"""" or other such maddening technicalities. Ergo Shakespeare's famous dictum about lawyers.

Consejo de Salud Playa de Ponce v. Rullan does provide federal precedent, and a framework for discussion and debate. However the Rullan ruling is not ultimately dispositive of a U.S. constitutional question or territorial status issue, since the U.S. Supreme Court is the court of ultimate (and binding) jurisdiction in both of these areas.

The language of the Rullan ruling did not grant full constitutional privileges to Puerto Ricans living on the island itself (as opposed to those living on the mainland). The Rullan court stated that """"Congress today, thus, must afford Puerto Rico and the 4,000,000 United States citizens residing therein all constitutional guarantees.""""

However, as stated earlier, Puerto Rico is subject to the U.S. Congress' plenary powers under the territorial clause of Article IV, sec. 3, of the U.S. Constitution.U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2 (""""The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States ...""""). 

The Rullan ruling occurred in 2008. Three years later (in 2011), insular Puerto Ricans have neither U.S. Congresspersons nor U.S. Senators, and they cannot vote for a U.S. president. Therefore insular Puerto Ricans are not fully-enfranchised U.S. citizens, and they have not been extended """"enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U.S. Constitution.""""

It is thus clear that (in the exercise of its plenary powers) the U.S. Congress has chosen to ignore the Rullan ruling.
 
The operative word in this discussion (and I understand the frustration on both sides) is the usage of the word """"must"""" in the Rullan ruling. As forceful as that word sounds, it was mis-used by the Rullan court, because the U.S. Congress clearly ignored it.  

Again...a lower federal court is not the court of ultimate jurisdiction for the issues addressed by Rullan. The U.S. Congress ignored it. Puerto Ricans (on the island) are not fully-enfranchised, and therefore do not have """"enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U.S. Constitution.""""

I hope this helps your process of consensus. I provided it in that spirit.  """,0

Follow-up.

You reduce """"false rape"""" claims to people (women) changing their minds. But if rape is sex without consent, it does not require anyone changing his mind. It can be people feeling ambivalent or curious beforehand. Ambivalence or curiousity do not imply consent. Cooperation does not imply consent. And you cannot prove consent unless you have maybe signed a consent form, into which you could have been tricked / coerced to sign. Don't you see the huge plunge into plain old fashioned insanity the legal system takes when rape is sex without consent?

I am aware that it is hard for women to get rape claims heard etc, I am aware of that. What I am trying to explain to you is this is exactly the result of exaggerated rape claims. If rape was just a special form of assault, there would not be little misunderstanding to what constitutes a rape and what not. This would serve the potential victims as well as everybody else, especially the legal system and the police.

I am not familiar enough with the example of South Africa that you bring up. From experience, if a statisticly huge drop like 60% in a short time for something that is greatly influenced by social mores (which usually take ~50 to 150 years to change), then this is most likely caused by a change in the way the figures are obtained.

You bring up the example of date rape not being covered by the definition of """"sex by force"""". You have some pretty messed up ideas. Drugs are force. For example, the police tries to use knock-out gas to remedy certain hostile situations, and they refer to these gases as """"non-lethal force"""". Similiar to another example, where people are """"just holding you down, not hurting you to rape you"""" - holding someone down - by force - is force. Locking someone up in a basement, only to offer food and water in exchange for sexual service - is also using force (if you have thought about bringing that example up).

The second half of your post mostly rambles about how expensive guns are. Yes, they are way too expensive, but the reason for them being expensive has a lot to do with government regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of firearms. As for an unsightly bulge when carrying a weapon - I've got some more unsightly bulges than that, and women tend carry purses perfect for concealed carry. So, women have an easier time to carry guns. 

God, I want it to be socially acceptable for men to carry a purse. But then again, it looks like total ass.

Every civilized society requires all its citizens to be armed at all times. Because violence is the very foundation of a state - The state removes the right to be violent to each other from the people, and instead claims a monopoly on violence, and resolves disputes with a legal system, and enforces the laws with an armed police force. But when the state is the only one controlling violence in its controlled territory, nobody controls the state to prevent government abuse, totalitarian laws, dictatorships. Aside from discouraging small time petty criminals, an armed civil population has the benefit of being able to remove a government once it no longer serves its purpose - that is, the well-being of the citizens - and replace it with a new government, preferrably with the severed heads of the old goverment decorating the state capital just to remind the new goverment what happens when they step out of line. As such, any effort to outlaw an armed civil society must be punished harshly.""",0

"possible problems  

I want to point out a few possible problems with some specific sections or topics, esp pertaining to 'no citations':

no citation, npov: The system is still encountering strain and financial constraints, some say more than ever. And what is the point of the sentence anyways?
Healthcare
The Campbell government inherited a health care system that was encountering strain and financial constraints upon assuming office.

No citation: It also has an issue that he campaigned on NO cuts to government workers, hospital workers, etc, in fact, when accused by the NDP of his going to have to make large cuts and layoffs, he fired back that the NDP was fear mongering:
[edit] Income tax reductions
In 2001, Campbell campaigned on a promise to significantly reduce income taxes. A day after taking office, Campbell reduced personal income tax for all taxpayers by 25 per cent over two years. Cuts were applied to every tax bracket; the tax rate on the first $30,000 of income was cut by 2 points from 8.4% to 6.05%, while the top tax rate for income over $85,000 was cut by 5 points from 19.7% to 14.7%.

No citation:
Education
While funding was increased to record levels during the Campbell government’s first term in office, challenges remained in K-12 education.

Again, no citation. Campbell might have been in favour, but it was started by the NDP, as many pundints are quick to point out when hospital closures are compared against the cost of new luge track.
2010 Olympics
British Columbia won the right to host the 2010 Winter Olympics on July 2nd, 2003. This was a joint Winter Olympics bid by Vancouver and the ski resort of Whistler. [18].
Campbell, a main proponent of the bid to get the games, attended the final presentations in Prague, Czech Republic and made an impassioned plea for the games to come back to Canada for the first time since it was held in Calgary in 1988.

This is only a quick look. I would appreciate some feedback before changes are made.
As I have pointed out earlier, a great deal of this article reads like a press release. If you compare this premier with any other, there will be a world of difference. 

Perhaps it should be scaled back to the bare minimum bio, and everything else gets chucked into the appropriate spot.

Do not accuse others of being vandals.  Because Ninlil's intervention did not seem partial to you, you have resorted to getting the page 'blocked from edits in the garb of it being an FA category (howsoever inaccurate' by Yellowmonkey.

Now whom should the question be asked: whether it is appropriate to mention the demise of the Cholas along with the demise of the Chalukyas, when it is clearly known to everyone that the Chalukyas first remained without a capital for over 30 years up to 1160/65 and finally demised in 1189/1192 AD with the Cholas lasting another 9 decades before being routed and finally eclipsed by the Pandiyans in 1279 AD?. This is simply because there is no relationship between the demise of the two kingdoms, the Cholas did not cause extinction of the Chalukyas or vice versa. The demise of the Chalukyas does not deserve mention in the Chola page even though the Cholas existed, but mainly because the Chalukyas were mainly consumed by their local rivals.  Then what could be the reason for mentioning the demise of the Cholas in the page of the Chalukyas who demised many, many years before them?

After edit conflict  including with myself. (D'oh.)
The way your reply is phrased leads me to wonder...  but never mind, this could end up as an infinite regression.  Shall we just say, the inferences you draw from my statement are not the ones I recognise as my intent, or as their actual implication, so you making a corresponding complaint seems somewhat ironic.  (You also don't address my question about notification at all.)
My statement was about a) JS's actual notability being predominantly in the area of Creationism, rather than chess (and certain versions of the article veering away from this reality); and b) the motivation of that editor (indeed, every editor, at least to that point) to be writing about him at all.  That's pretty clearly related to his significance as a creationist, and not some interest in writing about about chess more generally.  An implication of a """"pretext to promote a creationist agenda"""" does not appear to correlate with what I said at all.  (What I had in mind was more, increasing similarity to dust-jacket prose, and AA being reluctsnt to acknowledge this about his relative notabilities.)
Your """"false comparison"""" is likewise, nothing like any I was making.  JS is very notable as a Creationist, being a bucketload-selling author on such topics, as well as an internet celeb, which certainly merits an article, which in turn requires some discussion of his prowess  and distinctly lesser notability  as a chess player.  He's not so notable as a chess player that he would ordinarily have an article purely on him as such, and I see no reason to include every possible fact about him as a chess player, out of proportion to actual notability.
At any rate, if your evidence on the RFAr page stands as is, I shall feel compelled to respond to dispute your assertions about my comment.  I was rather hoping to keep out of the whole mess, personally, going as it largely does to """"does privacy policy completely trump autobiography concerns"""", about which I have opinions, but little direct involvement.

My point is that if you're going to editorialize, it shouldn't be one sided.  He chooses to """"introduce"""" papers that are highly critical with his own commentary, but doesn't introduce papers where similarly relevant information makes cold fusion look bad.  The guy is spinning what should be plain original sources.  I don't know of any library or librarian that would modify original sources with their own comments.  I don't agree that /acrobat/ERABreportofth.pdf is """"moderate"""" - I consider it highly prejudicial to the paper that follows.  Some of it is just plain nitpicking (i.e. the throwaway use of """"simple"""") designed to make the authors look biased where there is no credible claim of bias from that particular passage. 

For these reasons I do not think it's appropriate to use lenr-canr to link the source of any paper.  In my opinion it's far better to not have the full source online than to have altered sources introduced with prejudice.  It's just a bad idea; it allows anyone to upload some source paper, add their own commentary to the lead and potentially tamper with other things, and use it as a source on Wikipedia instead of the typical and totally unbiased DOI links. 
 
Whether this justifies a blacklisting based on policy is another matter; it may not.  I'll take your word for the scope and purpose of the blacklist, in which I agree that blacklisting lenr-canr.org is extreme.  I'd agree that it certainly deserves a place in the external links section.   I've also found it invaluable for getting up to speed on various papers.  However, if blacklisting is the only way to stop this terribly biased source from being used as a reference, then I support it.    """,0

ONIH has not addressed the issue, and he has also not answered my question.  

1. I said small would be more appropriate relative to """"minor"""" - """"""""Minor"""" reflects a point of view. """"Small"""" would be more appropriate.""""  Most appropriate would be to not have any modifier.  If the split was so minor, why are so many people still ticked off about it?  And it's not fair to say that the RSF folks left the movement, they just continued pursuing a direction they had pursued for years.  The """"movement"""" is bigger than PSF and PIRA.

2. I did not state that Peter Taylor is a """"mere journalist.""""  If I did, my apologies to Peter Taylor.  Indeed, please point it out where I used the phrase """"mere journalist."""" 

I did state that he has written some excellent books.  For better or worse, historians are not journalists.  They have different schools for each, in fact.  Provos accompanied a documentary broadcast; it's a great publication, but it's not a detailed history of the Provisional IRA.  The wikiepedia entry for Peter Taylor states, """"Peter Taylor born Scarborough, North Yorkshire is a British journalist and documentary-maker who had covered for many years the political and armed conflict in Northern Ireland, the so-called Troubles. From his experience he has written and produced books and television documentaries on the Northern Irish conflict.""""  The entry for J. Bowyer Bell states, """"The Troubles began in Northern Ireland in 1969, and Bell's The Secret Army: the IRA 1916-1970 was published the following year, and was one of the first detailed histories of the IRA along with The IRA by Tim Pat Coogan which was also published in 1970.""""  Many of the people that Taylor interviewed were also interviewed by Bell; and Bell probably interviewed them first and, in some cases, more than once (though Taylor probably interviewed several people multiple times, too).  

3. One Night In Hackney states above that he """" wasn't using one source over another, I was using what the source actually said.""""  But Bell clearly states, as noted above, """"Ruairi O Bradaigh, Daithi O Conaill, and about one hundred others walked out to form Republican Sinn Fein.""""  So, the sources disagree.  At one point, I believe, the word """"twenty"""" was in there.  It is not in there now, and from my view this is appropriate.  If the sources disagree we should not choose one over the other, but instead we should either acknowledge the differences and quote from each or find a way to be neutral  not quoting from either.

4. Once again there has been a dispute in which One Night in Hackney has chosen one source over another and then when confronted with a direct quotation from an alternate source he has chosen to ask questions, change the subject, and deny the validity of the source.  The reality is that Taylor and Bell are both valid sources, and Bell was clearly talking about people walking out of the Ard-Fheis.  Bell might have been wrong, Taylor might be wrong, but we as Wikipedia editors are not in a position to make that determination.  To do so is to engage in Original Research. WH.

Re 
I tagged Byron Long for speedy deletion since it appeared to be entirely unreferenced, which, given the controversial nature of the subject matter, would constitute a serious WP:BLP violation.  WP:BLP states that Administrators encountering biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone, where there is no NPOV version to revert to, should delete the article without discussion (see Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion criterion G10 for more details).  Looking through the page history, however, it appears that there actually was a reference for the article, which I have restored.  
CSD G10 does use the term """"negative in tone"""", which is a somewhat unfortunate choice of words.  The more fundamental policy here appears to be Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons, which states that """"biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone"""" should be speedily deleted.  The underlying issue is not whether we believe that a description of a living person as a """"porn actor"""" is actually negative.  Rather, for WP:BLP purposes, the issue is whether, if an article incorrectly described someone as a """"porn actor"""", such a description would be regarded as defamatory for the purpose of Wikipedia:Libel  that is, whether such an incorrect description, if widely believed, might be likely to have a significantly adverse effect on the employment prospects or general reputation of the subject of the article.  I would contend that describing someone as a """"porn actor"""" is sufficiently """"controversial in tone"""" to invoke WP:BLP concerns for the speedy removal and/or deletion of any unreferenced claims of this nature.

Say what?

I decide to check out the AfD articles, not something I normally get involved in. I come to an article for deletion, A Course in Miracles (book). I look over it  I see it's been documented and footnoted almost to the very last comma. I observe a tremendous argument ensuing over one word, """"cult"""", that's being interpreted multiple ways. Multiple editors are squabbling over whether User:Ste4k is being """"POV"""" for using it. I change the wording to eliminate the troublesome word while meeting what I see as the intent of the original author of the quote, Garrett. I think I do an adequate if not very eloquent job. I go to a lot of effort to explain what and why I made the change, citing the dictionary, etc. I do screw up and forget to sign some of my work, which you helpfully catch and fix.

I then vote in the AfD to delete the article but to keep its content and merge it into the main article. I explain my reasoning, but without going into detail as to my views of both articles as they presently stand. If I had, I would have said something along the lines that the main article flows well and is comprehensive; I think it's generally well written. At the same time, it screams out for about 200 {{fact}} tags. It's not clear to me how reliable it is. The book article, by contrast, is not as pretty and, as the principal author herself more or less says, reads like a U.S. District Court decision. There's a reason judges' decisions are not high literature and that's because they're shooting for reliability and precision, not memorable prose. There's considerable overlap between both articles with much discussion as to whether there should be a book article and a movement article or just one combined article; there's even discussion as to whether the word """"movement"""" should be used. It seems to me as it all this talk of different articles is putting the cart before the horse (reliability), so I vote """"merge and delete"""" so that the overall Wikipedia coverage can get fixed and streamlined with some sort of consensus built.

Now I wake up and I find that you've spent hours during the night sarcastically mutilating your own article. It appears that one word, """"cult"""", and my good faith editing of its usage may have been your tipping point to go into a frenzy. That or my one vote in the AfD process. If you don't like my cult edit, just reverse it and explain how I got it wrong.

Then there's this message on my talk page:
""""I'm not originally from the U.S. I was born in Kharkov. In our country, we beat liars, and if one wants to eat, they work. The only POV in that article I wrote was that I wanted to find out the truth, did research, marked it with citations for verifiability, refused to consider any source that came from some primary provider, and all I found out for my trouble was that this encyclopedia isn't even worth quoting. You should be ashamed to have your familiy member's name on this medium.  """"

What do I make of this? Are you saying that I'm a liar and should (or would) be beaten? That I should be working harder to eat? And what's this about my family?

And as for Wikipedia, being flawed, it certainly is that. It is profoundly flawed in terms of the reliability of some of its material. In fact, if so many millions of people didn't use it, I'd say forget about it. But the fact is, Wikipedia is very important and growing in importance everyday. Every day, more people abandon traditional sources of reliable information such as Britannica and turn to Wikipedia. Every month, Wikipedia's Google rankings move up higher and are often in the top 5 for a given search. The fact that so many other sites such as answers.com mirror the content makes what's written in Wikipedia seem all the more """"reliable"""" since to the undiscerning, it looks like other sites are agreeing with Wikipedia.

So like it or not, Wikipedia is here to stay and further grow in importance. You can fume and I can fret, but our children and grandchildren will use it more and more as their first source of knowledge, reliable or not. That almost pessimistic view of Wikipedia's growing role is what motivates me  not some idealistic, Woodstockian notion that """"information longs to be free"""" or so much of the other idealistic stuff that motivates thousands of mostly earnest, smart but very young editors on this project.

I'm protecting this page to prevent repeated vandalism. Among other things, this allows for discussion of a stable version in VfD. I know this is an inconvenience for editors. I suggest that those affected post drafts of any rewrites they want to make here in Talk in preparation for merging them back later. As far as I know there are no content disputes over this page.

Why Korean comfort women?

Why Korean comfort women during Korean War and why Korean collaborators? Because it is true. It all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. So we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.

From, The Construction of US Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Transformation and Resistance by Lee, Na Young, 2006
 
'The term “comfort women” (wianbu) to refer to military prostitutes serving American soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. This term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the 1950s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to UN soldiers” and terms like yanggongju (Western princesses), or “UN madams” (woman getting a livelihood by serving UN soldiers).129 This usage continued during the 1960s and 1970s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from non-U.S. military prostitution.  The Korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution, which was, in the decades after the war, regarded as a necessary means to feed Korea’s impoverished population.'

The Chosun Ilbo or Daily News is major newspapers in South Korea 2,200,000 readers. Examples given are in Chosun Ilbo 23 August, 1960, it mentions, """"In Pup’yLng, some 150 'comfort women dealing with American troops'. Similar reports using the words """"comfort women"""" are: KyLnghyang Ilbo, 11/25/1955; Chosun ilbo, 11/08/1957; Chosun ilbo, 8/23/1960; Chosun ilbo, 12/03/1963. A “Comfort Women’s demonstration” is also reported in 1966. 

In the mid- to late-1960s, there were numerous articles in Chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by American soldiers that continued to used the term 'comfort women'. Korea college girls recruited for the Nangnang Club were also viewed as """"yanggongju"""" or comfort women (Seoul Sinmun 26 July, 1952; 10 October, 1953). Post-war military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the Japanese one.

In 1958, the Chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as 300,000. The women who served “one American husband” were called “yangbuin” (Western madam) instead of the usual """"yanggalbo"""" (western whore) who were generally treated by Korean society as “non-human beings”. Generally, the Yanggongju have been ignored in official Korean histories as a national shame until recent. 

Song-gun Chong in 1967 wrote, 3,000 so-called “comfort women” registered with the  Health Section of the Military and the Military Police Corps of the U.S. Army (“Current Situations of Korean Prostitutes and Countermeasures.” Pophak-nonchong 8:65-87.)

""":The Michael Jackson post was simply a result of a minute of gullibility. I thought """"Anything's Possible"""" though Curps being MJ was highly unlikely. Some minutes afterwards I surmised that MJ would be too busy IRL to ever edit as much on WP as Curps does. The reason for posting on the MJ article talk page was so maybe I could get a followup from other users as to who Curps really is. I realized afterwards that there were better places to ask.

The edit at Jesse Jackson was to remove what I thought was Vandalism. (How could a prominent reverend have an extra-marital affair?, I thought.) After FreplySpang reverted it, I went to Google to find evidence, and it turns out he really did father a child from an extramarital affair in 1999.

Asking for photos of other admins wasn't intended as harrassment. Many other admins already had photos posted on their userpages (and/or the WP:Facebook), and I was curious about what some admins looked like that didn't have photos here, therefore, I asked them politely but somebody decided to misconstrue these requests as harrassment.

 (I'm pinging you as I don't know whether this is on your watchlist on not), original research is material for which no reliable, published sources exist – are you suggesting that the New York Times is not a reliable source?

I'll remove the """"terrible"""" part and just put """"criticized by liberal opponents for his civil rights record"""", if you believe that will make it NPOV. Also, it isn't synthesis if I'm stating material not published by one of the sources. Symms himself even gave a reason for voting against a civil rights bill because, in his words, """"It's just another layer of the federal government that we don't need"""" and that free market should determine how many housing units there are for disabled. I didn't state anything not explicitly stated by the source. I stated """"criticized by liberal opponents"""". Indeed, in one of his liberal opponents, Marilyn Shuler of the Idaho Human Rights Commission, stated that """"I'm saddened that, once again, Sen. Symms has chosen not to support civil rights legislation."""" I believe my edits were entirely sound. I'd like to hear an argument for why they weren't, but I'd need to hear it quickly.   """,0

For what its worth, I disagree with your characterization of  as a spammer; I believe they were a new editor contributing in good faith, who does not understand Wikipedia policies and guidelines.  I had been having a discussion with the user over the past few days on my talk page regarding their articles Jenny Sawyer and 60second Recap.  It was only today, after they restored the 60second Recap article that they began adding the external links.  

Granted, they were making a lot of promotional entries, but they had also been doing some minor fixes to articles.  They do seem to have some ownership issues, which frequently makes alignment towards working within site guidelines difficult (and sometimes impossible); but I had hoped they could be made a productive contributor to Wikipedia. -  (talk • contribs) -",0

The technique used by CMYK printing is dithering, among others. The CMYK article even says so. Should there not be mention on this page of dithering, especially seeing as how it's popularly used for sprite and pixel art with a constricted palette?",0

"""Beating does not necessiarily casue death - maybe the beaten person dies of heart attack, for which he has been susceptible genetically from birth. Still, it seems reasonable to label beating-related deaths like that. A person having beaten and dying soon afterwards reasonably dies related to that. Analogically, a massive cyberbullying case that makes objectively mesurable neurotic symptoms is reasonably related to a death if the death occurs soon or in that context. Of course, the person may have emotional labilities from earlier, but, following the beating and heart attack analogy, I think the """"no direct casue-and-effect"""" argument goes to far.

here I answer with an example: according to your philosophy, in the voice Rome there should be a list of the (about) 53 settlements, mountains, and so on, which take names from the eternal city. This makes no sense, but make sense to write on each single voice about its etymology.

Last but not least, the information that you write in the article is out of context in the place where you wrote it.

Australia-Italy 15-0
Don't worry... I surely complain also about the Italians! Not to speak about the easy target, our overlord Silvio Berlusconi, give a check to nice guys such as Umberto Bossi... and his electors are around me now I lived in northern Italy! Brr... chills of disgust.  Even Piedmont (I am in Turin now) which was traditionally leftish, now has a total Northern League jerk as governor. To put it on the fun side, maybe I'm especially angry against you Commonwealth guys since Australia again washed us out yesterday in rugby! So for me being polite, or the grocery man, wait till we'll be beating Australia or New Zealand! Joking! Seriously, I really admire Anglophone and Nordic civilizations, and I honestly think you (and Australia in particular) are far better than us in 90% of life things (and 90% of what remains comes from our past). Again honestly, in the matter I got disappointed since I always had a very big picture of Times and British journalists in general (while 90% of Italian ones are renowned to be just serfs of they payers), but for once I understood that journalist made a big mess and did not study in depth the matter. Ciaoooo!! Hugs from Attilio.   
 What Nona really wants to know is: The word """"desktop"""" has been used in the material that Murray pasted on the talk page. The auto-translator (I am almost sure that this wasn't translated by some arrogant Italian with very poor English....) has it as:
The quality of the painting in general and fundamental stylistic characteristics such as the indefinite desktop.... What on earth does it mean? If you could possibly find the Italian version, I'm sure you could translate this more accurately.

Keep'er """"Technical 13"""", I admid this is a third Keep'er, invokes an """"WP:NS#Aliases"""". But this time it must be deemed not too general (I can not follow, but I must conclude that). If """"Keep"""" individual pages were reasoned to be kept, why not conclude the the others are to go? Requirement for individual mentioning only works one way?
Also, in one point you complain that there was """"no discussion about the individual redirects"""". Well, that could also be because an argument applies to the whole list (a logic you disallowed explicitly). Then, when I do point to individually addressed Rs (here above, linked), you do not see a contradiction in that. Even worse, when I do demonstrate there are Rs named specifically, you respond here with but not everybody agreed with you. This does not undo my point that individual templates were addressed. Confusingly, here you are jumping the reasoning.
As was repeatedly pointed out the most recent times that it was discussed the consensus was that at least some were useful and that there was no consensus for a prohibition on their creation or use. Here it is you introducing arguments from *outside* the RfD list at hand. Earlier RfD's outcomes as an argument? How am I allowed to argue with that? WhenI use an argument involving general sanity (not even stepping outside this RfD), it ends up in the bin. And, above I linked tot two more recent R deletion conclusions (a G6 """"non-controversial"""" speedy! March 2013, and a full RfD-list deletion in December 2010), that contradict your reasoning. Also you write T: as a prefix or the use of such prefixes in general in the closing and XfD not RfD here. That is an expansion of the topic beyond RfD. Why is that allowed?
It doesn't matter how long ago a consensus was reached - it applies until there is a newer consensus formed, it doesn't somehow expire.and Consensus can change, and older consensuses are often more likely to, but ....  No  was reached. Repeat: there is no consensus. You are repeating an editors' 2007 injection -not a conclusion- into an essay. With that, indeed it is irrelevant how long ago the irrelevance was written: today it is still irrelevant. II note that you took over this bogus claim from an editor. As for old or new 'consensus': can an admin research & report how many T:-redirect were deleted without RfD, over the years? Of course, they leave almost no trace for non-admins. But I'd like to see the numbers & arguments for all T:-redirect deletions since template space was introduced. Some 'consensus' must be visible in there too. There is no consensus. So there is no argument from that  non-existent consensus. And don't blame me for introducing """"history"""" as a reason. 

Yes, you argued about specific redirects, but not everybody agreed with you. Out of logic. Why do you say this? You concluded that there was no individual targeting (and check that the nom is addressing them by listing them, and that the nom is detailing arguments very specific). The I point to them, and you jump to arguments. Did you or did you not see them when closing?

 In particular your proving that transclusion didn't work was argued to be not relevant to way the redirect was used (remember these are redirects to templates not templates), and and your opinion alone does not demonstrate consensus. A catch 22 you created. First you complain that no individual Rs were mentioned, then I point to one that was already there, and then you say: but that is not consensus. Yeah, and what did you expect, of an argument??? You only accept arguments that so",0
"User:Scarfaced Charley 

I don't know if you remember Wikipedia:Contributor copyright investigations/Scarfaced Charley from over a year ago – I see he was also blocked as a Sockpuppet. I worked a bit on helping fix some of those.  Yesterday I found that Scarfaced Charley had made a duplicate Campaignbox template and therefore some relevant articles were using that Template:Campaignbox Little Rock while others were using the preexisting Template:Campaignbox Advance on Little Rock which follows the WP:MILHIST convention of naming campaignboxes in accordance with the campaigns defined by the American Battlefield Protection Program unit of the National Park Service. That site is currently unavailable because of the Government Shutdown, but can be verified in Google's cache.

I merged the content into Template:Campaignbox Advance on Little Rock, updated all the articles to use the correct campaignbox template, blanked the duplicate template and tagged it with db-t3. I had originally also put a redirect to the corrected template, but I couldn't figure out how to make both the redirect and the db-3 tag work... Hopefully I've done it correctly. Does this situation indeed qualify for speedy deletion or does it need to be brought to TfD? 

Also, there's one talkpage comment at Template talk:Campaignbox Little Rock. What's the proper way to handle that?  Thanks.",0

"Relations to Kathy Beale 

I would like to begin by apologising if I have upset and annoyed people. That has never been my intention, my only intention is to contribute towards Wikipedia and improve articles involving subjects which I am particularly interested in. However, just because I have been blocked for my actions, that will not stop me from standing up for what I believe is completely right and trying to forge a consensus on facts which I believe certain editors are deliberately ignoring.
I will start with Kathy Beale and why she should be included. Those of you who have been watching EastEnders for a very long time will recall, that Kathy had a major involvement in the Ian's custody case. I will use a few sources:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ar2iQeDmwM
- These links is Kathy's direct involvement in trying to rescue the Beale kids from Cindy Beale.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CvgCs5c_Vw
- This link shows that Kathy was involved in the storylines regarding Lucy and Mel Owen, often having to look after the kids when Ian was very depressed - a very important storyline.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kyf5XoJl58
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP1nY3upeXc
- These show Kathy's strong involvement with all her grandchildren - Lucy, Peter and Steven. She even had to go to court for them. All of that is aside from the babysitting, family meals, Christmases and her death which had an effect. I will make my edit, and I hope afer watching all these clips, people will come to realise what I mean and what we can come to an agreement. I'd go as far as to argue that Kathy is more involved to Lucy's storylines, than Bev Williams - in fact that is a fact. So let us all take stock.",0

Let's say Company X has a store, with 500 jobs, paying $10 an hour, then Company W comes in,  adds 500 jobs, paying $6 an hour, drives Company X under, now the wages that Company W pays are the ones being spent in the area, guess everyone benefits from a 40% drop in the spending from 500 people's incomes.",0

 Climate data 

An unregistered editor keeps adding climate data to the article, but I have removed it because it isn't clear where the data has been gathered. The unregistered editor has provided a source for the data - http://www.myweather2.com - but I am yet to be convinced that that source can be considered reliable, and anyway it also very clearly states that """"The climate profile is taken from closest available data source to North Chideock"""", which is not the same as stating the data was gathered actually in Chideock. It is quite likely the data was gathered at a weather station such as on the Isle of Portland or at Yeovilton in Somerset, and because of this I consider it misleading to the reader to present the info in the article as if it applied specifically to Chideock.In addition, some of the text added by the unregistered editor was not supported by the source - for example, the claim that Chideock is one of the sunniest places in the UK. This statement may be correct, but it is not supported by the source.   """,0

 Car8025's Objection and Nebilla's Reply about The LEGAL ASPECTS of Turkey's 1974 Action 
Answer to  
i) """"your arguments are very biased and unethical."""". You took sentences that suit you from different documents to make a point without revealing the conclusion/true intentions of the author in your sources.
ANSWER: I directly wrote what is written in the resolutions and books. The title of the heading """"The LEGAL ASPECTS of Turkey's 1974 Action """" cannot prevent you put the resolutions/sources that indicate the operation as illegal.

ii) Why didn't you write the whole thing?
ANS: In the book, it wrote: """"the member states did not maintain this view after the second round of military operations"""" is not something that is related with PACE. The views of the member states of a particular organization (here: PACE) does not bind the organization itself unless there is a resolution is made in that organization. 

iii) """"The Resolution of the U.N Security Council and General Assembly indicate that the Turkish invasion was an illegal act..."""" in contrast with your other argument that """"there is no UN resolution that calls the Turkey's 1974 action as """"invasion"""". 
ANS: Here, in this sentence, """"indicate that the Turkish INVASION was an illegal act.."""" is a naming that is done by the author, not the UN Security Council. What is binding in UN is the UN SC as you may know. And, once again, I am backing my writing: """"There is no UN resolution that calls the Turkey's 1974 action as """"invasion"""". If you claim otherwise, just put a resolution no/date so that we are all behind you at this point. Here is the whole UN SC resolutions: UN Resolutions. Which one of them calls the intervention as INVASION? No one! 

iv) Kareklas concludes: """"Nevertheless, having regard to the EQUALLY POWERFUL ARGUEMENTS militating against unilateral armed INTERVENTION envisaged by treaty, it may be clearly concluded that Turkey SHOULD NOT HAVE EXERCISED A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION in Cyprus, 1974; however, such a proposition could remain subject to criticism, in view of the peculiarities of the Cyprus issue"""" 
ANS: Even the Greek Kareklas uses the word """"INTERVENTION"""" as you see. Dear , """"SHOULD NOT HAVE EXERCISED A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION"""" even demonstrates the legality of the intervention (the fact I empasized about the legality of operation in that aspect). """"SHOULD NOT HAVE EXERCISED A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION"""" means that """"THERE IS A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION"""" but """"IT WOULD BE NICE IF THAT RIGHT WAS NOT USED AND THE ISSUE WAS SOLVED BY OTHER MEANS"""". , if you do not understand in this way, you should develop your English.

v) In 1979, JUST AFTER 5 YEARS LATER THE OPERATION, The GREECE's Athens Court of Appeals: """"The Turkish military intervention in Cyprus...was LEGAL."""" Here, GREECE's court did not distinguish between the 1st phase (20-22July1974) and 2nd phase (14-16August1974) of the operation. In 1979, both of the first and second operation already finished 5 years ago. GREECE's court, hence, thought legal situation of both of the operations, in advance of making any decision about the 1974 war. , in the sentence """"The Turkish military intervention in Cyprus...was LEGAL."""", do you find any separation about both phase of the operations? 

vi) So... dear , as you see, I did not take the specific parts of the sources in part. The title """"The Legal Aspects of Turkey's 1974 Action"""" does not prevent you to find and write illegal aspects of the operation as well. You are welcome to state this. As long as these are not the parts of the interested parties, you can be sure that the sources you will find will be welcome. As you see, I directly write the text of PACE's resolution. PACE is not one of the two parties. I directly write the text of the decision of the GREECE's court. Here, GREECE's court certainly is a party, but indicates opinion/decision just opposite to GREECE's government.  That is, you should show sources i) not a party (neutral source) ii) one of the parties but express opposite view to the party (in which it is located) itself.  """,0

 Felice Beato 
Thanks for your message. I am delighted, that you are pleased that it got translated into German. By the way, I - naturally - checked some literature as well, although not so extensively as you obviously have. To my literature, a large encoclypedia on the history of photography, Felice Beato got naturalised as a British person in the 1860s. I probably will change the now translated text to that as I regard this encyclopedia as pretty trustfull.

 Alpha Phi Omega (APO) International Service Frternity and Sorority 

Alpha Phi Omega (?FO) (commonly known as APO,Join APO in the fight against Breast Cancer! but also A-Phi-OUC Davis Greek Life - Alpha Phi Omega and A-Phi-QThe Gramblinite 4/30/2009 A Phi Q crowned champs again) is the largest collegiate fraternity in the United States, with chapters at over 350 campuses, an active membership of approximately 17,000 students, and over 350,000 alumni members. There are also 250 chapters in the Philippines and one in Australia.

Alpha Phi Omega is a co-ed service fraternity organized to provide community service, leadership development,""""About Alpha Phi Omega."""" Alpha Phi Omega. Retrieved on February 23, 2007. and social opportunities for college students. Chapters range in size from a handful of active members to over 200 active members, independent of each college's size.

The purpose of the fraternity is """"to assemble college students in a National Service Fraternity in the fellowship of principles derived from the Scout Oath and Scout Law of the Boy Scouts of America; to develop Leadership, to promote Friendship, and to provide Service to humanity; and to further the freedom that is our national, educational, and intellectual heritage."""" Unlike many other fraternities, APO's primary focus is to provide volunteer service within four areas: service to the community, service to the campus, service to the fraternity, and service to the nation as participating citizens. Being primarily a service organization, the fraternity restricts its chapters from maintaining fraternity houses to serve as residences for their members. This also encourages members of social fraternities and sororities that have houses to join APO as well.

History
Alpha Phi Omega was founded on December 16, 1925 at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, by Frank Reed Horton and 13 other students who were former Boy Scouts and scouters, as a way to continue participating in the ideals of Scouting at the college level. These founding brothers were Frank Reed Horton, Everett William Probst, Ephraim Moyer Detwiler Jr., Thane Sanford Cooley, William Taylor Wood, Lewis Burnett Blair, Gord",0

Question about Edit

Where is the proper place to put forth an individual and allow his talents to be fully utilized? Would you suggest I use the edited text as the basis for an RFA? Surely any poly-degreed Oxforder with 18,000 edits in 22 months can be, indeed is, a formidable Wikipedian exerting a vast influence on the quality and tone of the project. Here is the meat of the text - I would appreciate any guidance you might be willing to offer:

I think this project could possibly use the help of the Editor . He has not one, but Two, degrees from Oxford - has written several books [Love Songs and Other Mysteries (1991) - Bad Choice (1989) - Sorry, No ISBN numbers exist to link to ...] and has made just a hair under Eighteen Thousand edits in 22 months at Wiki. 

As he has frequently invoked the """"Superior Authority"""" of his multiple Oxford degrees and education and on numerous occasions brandished his Oxon academic honors to defend and enshrine his edits in Wikipedia and to eliminate the need for discussion, perhaps he could be of some use here - building the entry for his alma mater. Surely an American 'emergency responder', author, 18,000 count wiki Editor, and pedigreed intellectual with the rare accomplishment of two Oxford post graduate degrees would be of special use to the project.  

""""With respect, I went to Oxford, so i am fairly well aware of Brit English...penultimate being the climax of the story."""" - Arcayne

""""Regarding the 'penultimate' stuff - not worries - as I said, it's just a word. I always thought is was used as next to the end, as in right before the ending. A slightly different meaning has become popular, like how the original phrase """"buck naked"""" (meaning, naked as a male deer) becoming mispronounced so often that now people say """"butt-naked"""". It would render me a crabby old man to decry the loss of the word meanings. It was also make me something of a jerk. Words evolve. - Arcayne  14:34, 3 July 2008""""

""""I did attend Oxford. I did graduate from there with the two degrees I have previously noted"""" - Arcayne

These are the two degrees Arcayne previously noted:
the EU is not a single nation, nor is the UN or UAE. They are actually something called NGO's, or non-governmental organizations.  - Arcayne
 The EU is nothing BUT a governmental organization. Its purpose is to politically unite the countries within the European Community. ... it is a united entity. Ditto the UAE. Kapowow 
Are you seriously trying to suggest that the EU is not an NGO? ... If you consider me throwing my political science and international relations degrees at you to be derogatory, then I have to say that I am sorry you feel that way. I am not a potted plant; I know the policies of which I speak,' ... - Arcayne'''

I trust the Project will be the better, as has Wikipedia in general, with such a confident and industrious Oxonian on board.

Surely Wikipedia, or the Oxford community, have a place for those such as Arcayne, who are able to place 18,000 edits in 22 months as the very public face of Oxford Wikipedians.75.57.205.135  """,0

To continue: If you are thinking in terms of """"model species"""" or even functional models, I can understand your cognitive dissonance, but there are many kinds of scientific models (sometimes, """"model"""" is used in the sense of an instance that represents desired properties (e.g., a fashion model), but this is a prototype, not a model).  This page, scientific model, might be helpful.  There are only two options here, given the use of the human genome generalization: Either the human genome is the genetic material for all members of the species, Homo sapiensin which case, """"human genome"""" is not an abstractionor it is an idealization that represents the human species as a single ideal representation of genetic material (i.e., a scientific model).

At any rate, you still have not provided any reference or authority for what you referred to as how """"human genome"""" """"is formally defined"""" (i.e., as """"actual genetic material"""").  I can't find any such formal definition of """"human genome"""" outside of this Wikipedia article.  It applies to """"genome"""" accurately, but you haven't backed up your claims regarding that definition of """"human genome"""".  18:23""",0

I find it odd that neandertals are considered non human when """"Archaic Homo sapiens evolved between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago"""".

The newspaper cuttings can be found in date order at Press Cuttings, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton. There are no paqe numbers. In the Michael Aldrich article other references are also used.

 Ranchi in Jharkhand 
No need to write NOW Ranchi was in Bihar or it is in Jharkhand, edited where described about Garib Nawaz Rath. Guddu 

 Deification 
Wow, this article seems to make a local god out of Laloo Yadav, while SYSTEMATICALLY ignoring or underestimating his negative sideshim being a curse upon  India. Silly, rare articles have been quoted praising him, while blatantly ignoring his long time image among the educated Indian middle class and the media. Everybody just seems to have a """"bias"""" against himwhat an excuse! All these constitute serious breach of Wikipedia's NPOV. I have added in the intro that he is known for his caste-based politics, his corruption, and his primary mass appeal lies among the so-called backward castes, and I will not tolerate its removal. 

I second this comment. Cygnus_hansa couldn't have been more concise and accurate when he said """"he is known for his caste-based politics, his corruption, and his primary mass appeal lies among the so-called backward castes"""".  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.82.157.73   

This Wikipedia biography seems to be prepared by a staunch fan of Lau Prasad. A much more balanced picture should be presented that should also throw light on his negative impact on the polity and economy of Bihar which lost precious 15 years of development opportunity under his rule which has been often called “jungle raj” or Jungle Rule. A more clear and focussed biography should expose him for a petty corrupt politician with criminal antecedents, that he really is.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 Name 

According to the official profile of Lalu Yadav from bhiar his name is Lalu Prasad NOT Lalu Prasad Yadav. http://164.100.24.208/ls/lsmember/biodata.asp?mpsno=2439  even his father's name does not have Yadav in it.

Education Qualification
I dont think he is a complete illiterate. Can someone add that to this article?
Thanks!  talk  
From what I have heard, he is a graduate (B.A., LL.B) from Patna University, but this is not confirmed. The article certainly does not provide a balanced view of Lalu, again which is not his actual name Lakshmi Prasad. 
Yes I agree this article has too many hyperboles. It would be difficult to confirm his educational qualification given that the person pretends to be rustic in public. As per Indian Government records his name as Lalu Prasad the issue has been discussed above.  

 POV 

I am placing a POV and clean-up tag here because this article is partial to Lalu, has unreferenced statements and some very misleading references. The article does not mention his corruption cases, misrule of Bihar and controversies enough. I don't have the time, but someone is requested to clean it up.  

I think your understanding of Lalu Prasad Yadav is based on the media, which has already been claimed in the article to be biased. I think the article is not at all partial to Lalu Prasad Yadav and at the same time need further improvement. I find that some of the editors are biased against Lalu Prasad yadav, which is reflected from some of the edits intending personal attack on him.   

Wikipedia is full of people like cygnus hansa, especially in Indian circle. many of them had got banned earlier, but some seems to be surviving to this date. This guy has also left some uncivil remarks on my talk page. I am deleting another libelous comment by anon. |no-blast",0

 Supposed influence on historical events 

I am entirely new to editing so I hope someone can guide me on this matter. The claim """"The meetings would have a great influence on the shaping of the modern country of Canada as well as on the Pacific Northwest of the United States"""" appears in the beginning with a now invalid citation link, which isn't terribly surprising given it was listed in 2006. The issue is the cited material does not back the quoted claim in any fashion and nor does any historical narrative I have read. The diplomatic wrangling between the Americans and British for a few decades was over the Columbia River as a border (or not). Eventually the British agreed to an American proposal for the continuation of the border along 49th the parallel.

Where does the PGO fit into this? It stated the 54'40 was the northern border despite having no control over any land north of the Columbia River. In 1845 an agreement with the local Hudson's Bay Company was established, with the company """"joining"""" the government. Theoretical control was extended by the PGO, but the majority of the offices for the northern districts were held by the British. I don't see this event holding """"great influence"""" over both Canada and the United States. About the only matter that the PGO was to create that influenced (only America) was the Cayuse War.

So what should be done about this exactly? The claim is simply far too bold to be considered historically accurate. In the meantime I updated the link, but it is worth repeating it doesn't validate the claim.   """,0

 Objectivity of Circumcision article should be flagged due to Gilgal Fellows on salary who patrol & edit the article 

As a matter of curiosity

As a matter of curiosity, if a person with a Circumcision Fetish found his way to this article, would they be allowed to edit it as an authentic observer? By the way, the circumcision in front of the grass hut on page 5 of the WHO pamphlet, """"Global Trends,"""" would indicate that the purported HIV protection targets village people who live in primitive conditions. Would that also target the English-speaking readers of a wiki site like Wikipedia? ... Anyone ever hear of an educational foundation known as the Gilgal Fellows  perhaps an entry in this article could describe their work. Joe Circus (talk) 

    Unfortunately it appears anyone may edit the article regardless of a conflict of interest. I have also questioned the relevance and impact of third world African HIV studies on our modern audience to no avail. Garycompugeek (talk) 

        Thanks for the link to a conflict of interest. Since there are a number of fellows who edit this article, it would be helpful to know if any of them have information about the Gilgal Fellows described here It could be revelatory for Circumcision Wikipedia to include a section on the Gilgal Fellows, who apparently have quite a mission. It's my understanding that GILGAL is an obscure word for MOUNTAIN OF BURNING FORESKINS. Joe Circus (talk) 

            No one having objected to the proposed sections on Circumcision Fetish and the Gilgal Fellows, I will assume a consensus, delegate the research, and get back here with it ASAP. Joe Circus (talk) 

                It's impossible to assess such a vague proposal. If you provide some specific, sourced content, we can assess its suitability. Jakew (talk) 

                    """"...we can assess..."""" Now would that be the Royal We or you claim to speak for other fellows? Joe Circus (talk) 

                        """"We"""" refers to myself and others who may be interested in evaluating the proposal. Jakew (talk) 

                            All the same, I don't get why YOU in particular deigned to represent the other fellows without asking their permission. It'll take a lot of Human resources to put these sections together... and if the """"consensus"""" is already fixed in advance, what's the point? Joe Circus (talk) 

                                Perhaps it's a little presumptuous, but it's realistic. It's usually a safe bet that more than one person will comment on a proposed change; take a look at the archives if you want to confirm that for yourself.
                                As for your proposals, previous discussions have found that there are no reliable sources discussing a """"circumcision fetish""""; searching Google Scholar for """"Gilgal Society"""" indicates that there are no reliable, secondary sources regarding that subject either. So I would think it doubtful that content could be written in a way that conforms to our policies. Jakew (talk) 

                                    """"Our"""" policies?... You mean the Gilgal Fellows? I'm not certain WHO you're representing here. Joe Circus (talk) 

                                        Wikipedia's policies, obviously. Jakew (talk) 

                                            Another reader deleted this interesting discussion for some reason. In trying to improve the Circumcision article, it's important that we discern between authentic readers and those who are paid a salary to patrol and manage this article. That's not a personal attack, nor a lack of presumption of good will. It's merely being realistic about who finds their way to this controversial article, and a healthy cynicism about some readers' intransigence. One reader has left a very rude & domineering comment on my user page. If personal attacks like that are the norm, I can only assume that a number of fellows are paid to patrol this article, and its objectivity should be flagged on the title page.

They were just attacking a military base because it is their daily regular job. I mean if you don't want to call it an """"attack"""", a """"battle"""" could be called because there was a battle and 32 out of about 200 were killed. I wrote the article in Turkish Wikipedia; and I called it """"21 October 2007 Hakkari PKK battle"""" because this -what you call incident- happens regularly. Just like the 7th October 2007 Şırnak PKK battle where another dozen of Turkish soldiers were killed too. Incident occurs once, not regularly. If Slovenia regularly attacked Croatia; and let's say, their troops came from the sea with heavy weapons, blew up a military base's bridge, killed 12 Croatian soldiers and took 8 hostages; would you call it an incident ? And how about Slovenia regularly attacked -let's say- since 1984 almost all cities of Croatia. Would it look like an incident to you? Or would it look like a battle or an attack?

Don't get me wrong dear """"Korku tanrısı""""; I believe you're writing amazing articles on battles and military; and your contributions are wonderful for Wikipedia in all languages (since all of them are translated in many languages; and actually I'm one of the translators of your articles to Turkish).

This """"thing"""" could be called at worst """"21 October 2007 Hakkari PKK Battle"""" (which I called in Turkish); yet it would be unjust to not call it an attack. 

Some people who have military bases in another country (which is controlled by anarchy) who happens to be your neighbor is attacking your country quite heavily equipped with weapons is called an """"attack"""". And as a military base and a country; what you have against them is a """"battle"""".

Status and Advice 
I deleted it, both as copyvio and because it would be considered promotional in any case.  

A Wikipedia article  needs to be written like an encyclopedia article, not a press releasedon't praise the organization or person, say what they do. Don't talk about the overall importance of the subjector use adjectives of praise. . Remember not to  copy from a web site, even your own  first it's a copyright violation, but, even if you own the copyright and are willing to give us permission according to WP:DCM, the tone will not be encyclopedic and the material will not be suitableas this was not.

You will need to rewrite the articles to Wikipedia  style; a good place to start learning it  is    our guide to writing Wikipedia articles .  

First, give the basic informationthe source should be the CV birthplace and date, degrees, previous positions. If there are published books, list them in formal bibliographic style.  List the 3 or 4 most influential articles similarly, getting citation figures from Scopus or Web of Science or Google Scholar, or some other appropriate source. Do not include conference presentations, book chapters, and other minor published work. Such a list needs to be frequently updated, and belongs in the CV, not an encyclopedia.  

Include major national level offices and awards, but not minor ones and certainly not student awards. Be sure to list editorships (but not mere editorial board membership) we consider it very important, and you should add it to the articles for the relevant journals also, with a link to the bio. AQ award is worth mentioning; a nomination for an award is not. 
 
It is not necessary to cite the basic information in detail to other than the official CV. However, give  references providing substantial coverage from  3rd party independent published reliable sources, print or online, but not blogs or press releases, or material derived from press releases. For any part you quote directly from a published bio, include quotation marks and a reference. Do just just say """" It has been widely covered by press outlets such as The New York Times and Forbes."""" Give the reference in full, including the title of the article and a link to it.  

Pay particular attention to the way we make links to other Wikipedia  articles.  Avoid WP:Peacock terms: do not use words of praise, ofr state that the person is important: the contents of the article will show it. 

Don't just give a general list of all the fields he is interested in. Say briefly what his research has shown, with citations. 

Include only material that would be of interest to a general reader coming across the mention of the subject and wanting the sort of information that would be found in an encyclopedia. Do not include material that would be of interest only to those associated with the subject, or to prospective studentsthat sort of content is considered promotional. Keep in mind that the goal of an encyclopedia  is to say things in a concise manner, which is not the style of  press releases or  web sites, or CVs,  which are usually more expansive.

 Please! Help with the CNN article 

Hi, I am fairly new to Wikipedia. However, in looking at the CNN article, I noticed that in the beginning (fourth paragraph down) the following statement appears: """"Among the general public, CNN has a more centrist perception.” The source for this proposition is FAIR, FAIR being a “progressive media criticism organization” whose “target invariably is bias on the right” . Needless to say, FAIR is not a reliable source. On the other hand, the academic literature (i.e., peer-reviewed, scholarly journals) is full of articles addressing CNN's bias. They have concluded that the public perceives CNN to have a liberal bias:
>Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, Harvard University, & Project for Excellence in Journalism, “The Invisible Primary – Invisible No Longer: A First Look at Coverage of the 2008 Presidential Campaign,” p. 32  (noting that “The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates—by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral.”) 
>Jeffrey N. Weatherly, et al, “Perceptions of Political Bias in the Headlines of Two Major News Organizations,” Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics (2007) (12), 91 at p. 97 (finding that “Overall, participants . . . rated the headlines from CNN as significantly more liberal than those from FOX News. . . . CNN tilted more to the left than did FOX News. The conclusion that CNN’s headlines were perceived as more liberal than FOX News’, rather than FOX News’ headlines’ being perceived as more conservative than CNN’s, is supported by the finding that overall, the headlines from FOX News were rated slightly on the liberal side of neutral. If FOX News’ headlines had been perceived as biased toward the conservative viewpoint, then the overall ratings should have exceeded 50 percent.”) 

The administrator who semi-protected this article knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that (1) FAIR is a blatently unreliable source, and - equally important - (2) actual,peer-reviewed studies suggest precisely the opposite of the proposition that CNN is perceived as """"centrist."""" Would you please help in removing the unreliably-sourced, and inconsistent-with-real-literature statement concerning CNN's perceived """"centrist"""" position (it's semi-protected)?

 Comment from Homosexuality (workspace) 

Actually, my citation can be the very same 2000 Breedlove study that our friend in Farmington includes in Fetal hormones and sexual orientation. Background is that length of ring finger relative to index finger is strongly correlated with fetal testosterone levels. That fact is rather well established quite apart from sexual orientation. Breedlove found an additional much weaker correlation between implied fetal testosterone and sexual orientation, with lesbians in particularly being most strongly androgynized. It's definitely interesting. Gay men show the same pattern (gays more androgynized), but to a smaller degree.

However, there is a huge overlap between the suggested fetal testosterone levels and sexual orientation. That is, on average of a bunch of lesbians had higher fetal testosterone than a paired group of straight women. But many lesbians had lower fetal testosterone than the straight-woman average. And many straight women had higher fetal testosterone than the lesbian average. The standard deviation within each group is much more than the mean difference between the groups.

So what does it show? Well, I dunno. There's something potentially interesting there, especially if it can be replicated in much larger samples. But it's hardly clear causation, nor even clear correlation. What it amounts to might be something like (purely hypothetically): """"High testesterone exposure female fetuses have a 10% chance of becoming lesbian; low testosterone exposure female fetuses have a 5% chance of becoming lesbian."""" But that's about the strongest conclusion I can imagine coming out of this (and it hasn't yet, it's been suggested), and that's a relatively weak factor.

Both Amazon and Google are sites that use English in their searches. The west is particularly advanced when it comes to using the internet to create pages or discuss things. Amazon is obviously dominated by goods and books retailed in the Western countries. Therefore the results you get back disproportionately represent the opinion of the West. Most westerners have little or know knowlege of the event, save the famine that followed in 1975, so it makes sense that they'd defer to the most simplistic title for the event, namely the """"Bangladesh War"""".

 My Conrtibutions to Shady Records 

So I've been asked to consult this page by JrPut or idk his name; but anyway:

The Shady Producers/DJ's list should be updated.
I have valid links for Mr. Porter, Alchemist, Rikanatti, and Luis Resto. The following are all Reliable links, and even though Aftermath Ent. Blog is a blog, we have used it as multible sources on additional articles, and we have also used MTV News as a reliable source, and that in itself is a blog.
 Alchemist 
Luis Resto
Rikanatti
Eminem also acts as a producer for the label, and since he is the founder, CEO, and signed to the label as its main artist, I would presume that linking references for him as a producer is frivalous and uneeded. 

Now, The Bass Brothers and Eminem have ended their working relationship. We have multible sources for this including when Em purchased his new studio, and F.B.T sued Interscope/Aftermath.

However, with that said, we have no additional proof that DJ Head has ended his working relationship with EM. We have no source saying that he has, and unless you supply one, we're going to be leaving him in the active section. Just because a producer didn't release any tracks for the label in a while does not constitute their absence from the label.

So Please, Let me re-add Alchemist, Eminem, Mr. Porter, Luis Resto, Rikanatti, and DJ Head to the production list, and let us move on with our lives. No need to keep pricking this crap in the butt.

Also, """"DJ Green Lantern"""" should not be under the """"former artist category."""" If you leave him there, you're going to have to add the other Producers/DJs onto said list when and if they leave the label.""",0

Elelland

Hello Humus

I am sorry if I have placed this note in the wrong spot. I m very inexperienced with Wikipedia. I was enthralled by Wikipedia. Initially. That is until I met Eleland. I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland. Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted. He organised a """"kangaroo court"""" made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.

The Article was on Ed O'Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent. The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. He was amongst the candidates for this year's HR.com dishonest reporter award - despite being in the Australia only catchment area - so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.

Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.

So I studied Eleland a little.

I've looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict. More than 95 were directly anti-Israel. His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro-Israel side. In this way he has undermined many many articles.

Personally I don't care what his opinion is, but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate, delete, manipulate etc. I think there is a problem.

Wikipedia is, I am afraid, beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script.

Who is Eleland? What power does he actually have?

Can anything be done?

 Górny & Rosiknoń Witnesses to Mystery: Investigations Into Christ’s Relics 

Several editors tried to prevent including material from that book, voicing an opinion of the authors that """"the results of numerous time-consuming and comprehensive analyses, conducted using the most technologically advanced equipment available, seemed to coincide with assertions prevalent in Christian tradition."""", under the pretext of RS. For discussion of the matter, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Is_a_book_by_a_journalist_and_a_photographer_a_reliable_source_for_an_analysis_of_religious_relics.3F 

Ignatius is a serious Catholic publisher, I don't know why books published by them should be excluded from Wikipedia -except someone's hostility to Catholicism. If we exclude Górny, then we should also exclude Carrol-Cruz -catholic writer as well, and Nickell, sceptical writer, who is much more biased (against any relics) than any Catholic source -so his book is not the sort of book that should be used to write a neutral article. The statement is an opinion cited, not a fact. Besides there is no such academic discipline as study of the relics yet -anyone can publish whatever wants. In the lead, we have two negative opinions, by Erasmus from 1500s, and by Thurston from 1913. So the lead is not neutral. To balance it, we have posititve Górny&Rosiko;ń opinion from 2013 -much more recent, after several researches on some relics (described in their book) have been published.

 Rothwell struggles in vain to withdraw from Wikipedia 

This is somewhat off topic, but I was surprised to discover that a person is not allowed to withdraw from Wikipedia or delete the contents of his own talk page. Apparently it is cybernetic tar pit.

Had I know it was against the rules to erase one's own talk page, I never would have talked there, since I frequently use it for things like unfinished manuscripts (which have embarrassing errors), jokes and so on, which were never intended to be permanent. Anyway, for the past day or so I have been trying to erase these comments without success. One of the Sysops here, Mr. Connolley apparently wishes to preserve this page because it includes proof that I have committed an egregious violation of the rules, by calling someone: “childish, boorish, pig headed [and] unreasonable” and earlier “an insufferable ninny.” The poor fellow was so overcome by grief & consternation, he felt compelled to report this outrage to the authorities. (I might also call him a crybaby or a tattletale, but he would die of shock. I have done enough damage already; I fear he may need long-term therapy.)

Anyway, I was banned for this unspeakable language, and Connelley will not even allow me to purge the evidence of my shame. I changed my description page and sent a message to Connelley with damning evidence for him to use in place of my talk page. I fear he may revert both, and delete this message, but before he does readers here may be amused by the new text here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JedRothwell I quote Schiller's warning: """"Mit der Dummheit kaempfen Goetter selbst vergebens."""" ('Against stupidity the gods themselves struggle in vain.') (Maid of Orleans, act 3, sc. 6). Hence, the title of this message.

Thick-skinned readers here might also enjoy the egregious replacement insult I sent to Connelly:

. . . If you would like a reason to block me, or prove that I have violated the rules, you need not preserve the talk page. Here is another deliberate & intentionally provocative violation of the rules  an old-school personal insult:

You are a loathsome, sanctimonious, hypocritical, ignorant twit. If you were in state of uncontrolled combustion, I would not take the trouble to extinguish the flames by urinating on them.

I hope that is satisfactory.

That goes for you, too, Mr. . . uh, Chihuahua – isn’t it? Bow wow! Ruff! Grrrrr . . . Consider yourself gravely insulted. If this were the 18th century you might challenge me to a duel, but since I am a craven bounder, I would, of course, run away instead of accepting.

A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams. Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman.

The Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.

                           History
The present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.

                       Proper History
As early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion of 1988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.",0

 Your sorting effort

One minor caveat: Award articles, like Wigner medal, all seem to get the """"stub"""" category, per """"auto"""", allegedly because of a stub template. But:
 To the best of my knowledge those articles never had a stub template

1. not allow others to dictate the direction and management of the movement.(Geaves)
2. manifest his own vision of development and growth. (Downton)
3. decide what direction the movement should take.(Melton)

and this desire caused

1. a deep rift in Prem Rawat’s family.(Geaves)
2. he had to encroach on his mother's territory and, given the fact that she was accustomed to having control, a fight was inevitable.(Downton)
3. a split between Maharaji and his family, ostensibly caused by his mother's inability to accept Maharaji's marriage to an American follower(Melton)

 Proposition 

This article is overwhelmed with images of socialist emblems. This is not a gallery, this is an article about socialist heraldry, and it is no rally useful to have images of every single socialist emblem ever used. I think we should make an inclusion criteria for images of emblems in this article. I propose this inclusion criteria: 
We should only add to this article images of emblems of internationally recognized states that existed for more than few years. If the state used several similar emblems during it's existence, they should not all be added, but only the one that was used the longest.
According to this proposition, we don't need emblems of unrecognized states like Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. We also do not need three emblems of Socialist Bulgaria () because they are very similar, practically the same. I am going to remove some emblems according to this proposition.

 General Authority Assignments 
Thanks for updating Elder Zivic's assignment. However, I looked on LDS.org and failed to find any mention there of his assignment. I see two other seventies (though I can't remember who) that are listed as Assistant Executive Directors of the Temple Department, but under Zivic's LDS.org biography, that assignment is not listed. Is it possible that this was a previous assignment that he has now been released from? As soon as LDS.org has an updated list of assignments, I guess we'll know for sure. Please respond on my talk page, as I don't habitually check other users' talk page for a response. Thanks.   
Hi!  I do recall that LDS.org's bio on Elder Zivic does not list the Temple Department assignment.  Actually, as I recall, it does not list anything subsequent to his previous service in an area presidency.  I obtained the information from other directories I reviewed.  There are actually 4 assistants at the present time to William Walker, in his role as Executive Director.  Hope that helps some.  Thanks for the question to ensure we're on track.   
On the list we have, I see Elder Choi, Elder Zivic, and Elder Gibbons listed as Assistant Executive Directors of the Temple Department. So now my question is, who is the 4th person you spoke of? Also, on the list that you are taking this information from, does it contain any other assignments of general authorities that we can put on that page? Again, please respond on my talk page. Thanks.   
It is Elder Baxter and I have updated that portion of the table/info box.  Thanks!   
It seems you forgot to respond to the second question of my last post, so I'll ask it again: On the list that you got the information from about the Temple Department Assistant Executive Directors, does it list any other assignments for seventies that we don't have on the WP list? Any additional information you can contribute would be appreciated. Again, please respond on my talk page. Thanks.   
I didn't forget, but I don't believe there is anything else that we would add, so I probably just skipped over the inquiry. ) There are some items that need to be officially announced before they are included as well.  Thanks!    
There are other changes, but we'll have to wait until they're officially announced? I really wish you hadn't said that. My curiosity is piqued. I won't ask what these changes are, much as I want to. You're probably not at liberty to say. One question I can ask: Where are you getting all this information? Do you by any chance have access to the CDOL? What Church position do you hold that allows you to be privy to this information? These are questions I feel I can ask. In the meantime, for the sake of my sanity, any additional information you feel you can give me, even if we have to wait until it's officially announced to list it here, would be appreciated. If you can tell me anything, I promise that I won't make it public. However, if you can't give me any more details until it's official, I understand completely. I am copying my comments here to my talk page, where I hope you will respond to this post as you have the past ones.

"DID CHRISTIANS INVENT SATAN.
The idea that Christians invented Satan is lies, propogated by some adherents of WICCA and other pagan believers, we see that the Holy Scriptures that came from Judaism has a book called JOB, so why blame the christians!, rather The Scriptures reveals in Genesis how EVE was tempted by the Serpent, who had refused to worship adam, also later we see that David is tricked into taking a census by SATAN (Old Testament 2 Samuel) later on further we see that Jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul (Satan) by Pharisees, Jesus refutes the accusations of the Pharisees. In the NT we hear that I saw Satan cast out of Heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the West. So also In Revelations we hear that there was WAR IN HEAVEN and St. Michael and all the Loyal Angels to GOD fought against the followers of Satan and the Battle was won by the GOOD ANGELS, revelation also reveals, woe unto man for the Devil has come down to earth, being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short! Also elsewhere we hear that Satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. Christ was tempted by the Shaitan 3 times after his Baptism in the desert. So to say that We Christians invented something which was already revealed in Judaism and OT is silly and obnoxious. The Devil had pride, then disobedience, then Jealousy, then slander, then much later we learn that Jesus called the Satan a liar, murderer and thief.
Why dont the WICCANS look to Zoroastriaism or other DUALISTIC Religions and see the concept of GOOD VERSUS EVIL in those religions? Why, so that the Christians get the blame for something that actually EXISTS. Even the Muslim believe in a the serpent called Iblis, and even buddhists had a concept for the Evil One called MARA, who was a TEMPTER. Jesus even spoke to St. Peter and said that the Devil had been given permission to sift St. Peter like wheat, whereby Jesus siad that he had prayed for CEPHAS such that he would not enter into temptation. The truth seems to be that the devil was an Arc Angel in Heaven, who became too full of himself, later whe GOD created MAN in HIS OWN IMAGE, GOD requests all the Angels to BOW to ADAM, all do except for ONE ANGEL (later called LUCIFER). He refuses based on himself being made of fire and that Adam is made of clay, however, GOD allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in JOB, some mention that in ISAIAH: O Lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the Heavenn is a direct reference to the DEVIL, but I also consider it to BABYLOON, as in revelation, fallen, fallen is BABYLON the GREAT etc. Revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. GOD has talks with the SATAN, so SATAN can not be inferred thence to be a non-entity, as GOD does not talk to non-entities. Also some people believe that the DARK SIDE of human nature to be some impersonal evil, others realise that this is negative non-sense. I know that people were possessed by demons, fallen spirits and that Jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming 'Ha, Jesus you Nazorean, what hast thou to do with us, hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us!', Jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet! So far as I concerned the truth is in the Holy Bible, some truth is also in the Quran.
There are some truths to be found also in other religious books, but the whole truth is Christ and the books of OT and NT are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Have a read of Revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from GOD! 

Enough of this rubbish about Christian inventions of spirits. Pagans invented their gods, and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.

Jews and Christians had the opposite, GOD revealed to them the TRUTH and THE WAY, AND THE LIFE.

 Race and Intelligence: Asian-Americans 

I've noticed you've contributed much to the race/intelligence articles and thought these articles might interest you:

http://paa2009.princeton.edu/papers/90354

""""Using data from recent Current Population Surveys (CPS), this study compares third-and-higher 
generation with earlier generation Asian Americans and non-Hispanic whites in terms of 
socioeconomic characteristics and demographics. The findings suggest a “third-generation 
decline or flattening” for Asian American and white men as well as Asian American and white 
women. For each of these groups, the mean of years of schooling among the 2.5 and third 
generations is lower than among the first and second generations. This pattern is most 
pronounced among Asian Americans. As for wage determination, the generational differentials 
can be explained by educational attainment and other basic demographic variables. Overall, these 
results suggest that assimilation beyond the first generation immigrants no longer improves 
socioeconomic attainments as expected by traditional assimilation theory. Furthermore, in the 
case of Asian Americans, cultural assimilation across the generations may actually lower 
educational attainment and thereby reduce wages contrary to traditional assimilation theory.""""

""""It is widely noted that Asian immigrant parents have higher educational and socioeconomic 
expectations and motivations for their children than do non-Hispanic white parents (e.g., Goyette 
and Xie 1999; Kao 1995, 2004). Asian families also tend to invest more aggressively in 
financial, human, and within-family social capital than families from other racial groups (e.g., 
Sun 1998). Yet, protective effects of ethnic cultures and resources decline according to more 
acculturation into the mainstream U.S. society (e.g., Kao and Tienda 1995). As third-or-higher 
generation Asians become more “Americanized,” they tend to embrace the prevailing U.S. norm 
that as long as good efforts have been made based on one’s ability, the outcome would be 
acceptable even though one has not achieved the best performance or reached a higher level of 
education (Chen and Stevenson 1989; Stevenson 1988).""""

Likewise...

http://www.ibtimes.com/asian-americans-increasingly-defying-stem-stereotype-246578

""""Shinagawa pointed out another interesting phenomenon; later generation (second, third, fourth, etc.) Asian Americans on average have markedly lower education and income compared to immigrant Asians.

In 2007, 33 percent of PhDs conferred in the U.S. were to Asians. However, of that 33 percent, only 2 percent were Asians Americans born or raised in the U.S.""""

These trends are reflected in their TIMSS/PIRLS scores, which are often used by people like Charles Murray and Richard Lynn as proxies for IQ.

http://i39.tinypic.com/zob4p0.png

Note that native born Asian-Americans perform worse than native born Whites in every subject.

My goal here is not to put down Asian-Americans, but I've noticed that lots of modern racialists like to use Asians as a battering ram against other minorities. Yet, as the above evidence indicates, even """"model minorities"""" who start from a much more advantageous position than the others can still succumb to negative cultural influences which significantly hurt their academic performance. This suggests that culture does, indeed, matter greatly, even on exams like the TIMSS which supposedly test for 'g'. 

If you have any contacts with academics in the field, perhaps you'd like to pass this information along? James Flynn who wrote an entire book on Asian-Americans might be particularly interested.""",0

"Wage Slavery in Canada Today
Shouldn't this article mention the wage slavery conditions prevalent in Canada today? Such as the countless ads, for example on Craigslist (anytown) Canada, calling for 'live-in caregivers' where pay is $8.00/hr and they charge you rent?  Slavery is alive and well today, only difference is you are paid just enough to scrape byor less.  Fore example say you live in Vancouver, BC and you work at any minimum wage job8.00/hr, which after taxes nets you $1,000/mo. Ohby the way a studio flat here costs $1,000/mo. so hope you have a trust fund to draw upon if you are paid anywhere near minimum wage in BC. Mountains here are nice though!

What evidence is there for any concepts?  Again, none of this debate really matters in the absence of sources.  What specific sources support specific TCM concepts?  What sources support """"cold herbs"""" having antibiotic or anti-inflammatory properties?  What sources support a """"heat pattern"""" being inflammation (aside from the trivial observation that inflamed areas are warm)?  Without sources, these abstract discussions are pretty pointless.  If a reliable source echoes your assertion, for me the only real question becomes how to summarize it.
The assertion that TCM is speaking a different language rather than simply """"right by accident"""" is also an assertion that requires a source.  All prescientific medicine usually manages to be correct about certain herbs, be they emetics, analgesics, laxatives or soporifics, but that doesn't validate the medical system.  And if we're debating the modern medical model, when modern medicine was introduced to China I believe that, like all nations, they experienced a considerable boom in longevity, a drop in infectious diseases and a much higher rate of survival out of childhood.  Mao brought back TCM for political reasons, not because it was as effective as vaccinations, surgery and drugs.

 Re: Tracker (business software) 

Hello, thanks for your comments on my talk page.  You mention that the article was """"already reviewed by admins and approved for inclusion in Wikipedia"""".  I tried to make clear the purpose of my edit in the edit summary, but I guess I didn't do a good enough job.  I read through the AFD, the DRV, and the past deletions to get an idea of what was going on.  AFD/DRV were able to determine the notability of the article, but you hit it right on in your comment to me that in it's past state the article wasn't much more than a product sheet, which to me is synonymous with advertising.  Wikipedia articles aren't about features lists or product offerings, they are about bringing together neutral, third-party-verified information about topics.  As I'm sure you've seen I rearranged the page a little more since.  I have no problem with the screenshots or product names & descriptions, so I tried several things which display that information in a little bit more standard Wikipedia.  (Also, this is minor, but Wikipedia admins are no different in terms of article approval than any other editor. I am also an admin, but that just gives me the ability to work on more technical aspects of the project).

You are welcome to expand on the article as it is now, but it would be preferable to do it by gathering information from the many third-party sources listed.  The article is very well sourced, but not very much of that information is brought into the article.

As for the List of project management software, with such a relatively short list, it is inappropiate to have several links to the same family of products.  I don't know a way would satisfy your concern, other than to suggest to put the link in the best place you see fit. In the future, it might be worthwhile listing separately the desktop and the web-based products, but not while there is only enough information for one article.  Again, please remember the primary focus of Wikipedia (see What Wikipedia is not), which is to bring neutral information, not advertising or promoting.    """,0

New Aboriginal Article

Gundagai is a place of considerable reputed Aboriginal cultural significance, with both archaeological sites and antropological associations related to sacred and spiritual beliefs of the local tribes.

Acknowledgement of country

Acknowledgement of Country is a protocol used in Australia in relation to Indigenous Australian affairs.Reconcilitation Australia, 24 March 2010, Available [online] http://www.reconciliation.org.au/home/reconciliation-resources/facts-figures/q-a-factsheets/welcome-to-and-acknowledgement-of-country

The Gundagai area is part of the traditional lands of the Wiradjuri speaking people before and post European settlement, and also holds national significance to Indigenous Australians.  The floodplains of the Murrumbidgee below the present town of Gundagai were a frequent meeting place of the Wiradjuri. One indication of the ancient, sacred cultural landscape that is North Gundagai is the bora ring that has been identified close to town.

The location of Gundagai on a sizeable prehistoric highway, (the Murrumbidgee River), along with the significant and sacred Aboriginal ceremonial ground across all of North Gundagai, and other ancient archaeology, indicates it would have been an important ceremonial, mining, manufacturing and trading place for Aboriginal people before the arrival of the Europeans.Kabaila, P. (2005), 'High Country Footprints: Aboriginal pathways and movement in the high country of southeastern Australia: Recognising the ancient paths beside modern highways', Pirion Publishing Canberra  As with all ancient sacred places, particularly within still continuing Australian Aboriginal culture, the sacredness of Gundagai's amazing Australian Aboriginal cultural landscape continues despite colonial and later intrusion.

Gundagai Aboriginal Elders, Jimmy Clements and John Noble, attended the 1927 opening of the new Federal Parliament House in Canberra by the Duke of York. Jimmy Clements also known as King Billy whose traditional name was 'Yangar',http://australianmuseum.net.au/Aboriginal-Group-Sculpture-1925 walked forward to respectfully salute the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI of the United Kingdom and Elizabeth the Queen), and after that the two Elders were formally presented to the Royal couple as prominent citizens of Australia.http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/3853897?

Australian dialogue meeting
Aboriginal leaders Pat Dodson and Noel Pearson; the former Chief of the Australian Army and Governor of West Australia, Lieutenant General John Sanderson; and current Australian business leaders, met at a remote property on the Murrumbidgee River near Gundagai in September 2008 on the first stages of an Australian Dialogue to promote constitutional reform and structural change for Indigenous Australian people.

 Understanding """"Wikified"""" language 

Hi, and thanks for taking the time to """"Wikify"""" the language I added to """"Ballast Point"""".
If you don't mind, I would like to ask a question so I can better understand this; I am new to this, still learning.
The background is that in the 1800s, the European settlement of the Sydney area was in its early days.  Place names were informal, and often duplicated.  There were at least two, probably three places on Sydney Harbour known as """"Ballast Point"""" then.  This is what I attempted to clarify with my comment that it was another site also known by that name.  The revised wording gives me the impression that there was only one place of that name in the 1800s, and it changed.  So can you please indicate why the new wording is preferred, so I can adopt the best approach in future?   """,0

"REPLY: Many distributors say not to use chlorine bleach nor cationic sufactants (fabric relaxers, fabric conditioners).  

AIUI too high a concentration of bleach may distort the fibers [please confirm].  The cationic surfactant will fill the holes in the microfiber and reduce its efficiency.

Similarly microfiber should not be washed at too high temperatures (eg 80 celsius).  However it is hard to get microfiber to release the dirt it holds and so the method of washing needs to be a bit of a compromise.

Do not wash with other garments especially those which shed small particles of fiber as these will be taken in and held by the microfiber cloth.

There does not seem to be a case for using special detergents.

Again, some will advocate using a drier but the temperature must not be so high as to distort the micro fibers.  I would not want to iron or press washed microfiber because of the possible loss of the dirt traps.

Some distributors will suggest the use of bleach (eg 3M and its Scotch-Brite microfiber kitchen cloths) and others will specify rather high temperatures.  Perhaps their microfibers have been treated or manufactured to withstand such washing but I am not sure how it could have been achieved.

The version that you keep reverting to is at least as anti-contra as the other version is """"pro-contra."""" The irony is that while the Sandinistas themselves have been willing to admit their errors and have reached out to win the votes of former rebels and their sympathizers, some of their foreign supporters seem to be stuck in their circa 1986 vision of Nicaragua. Some Wikipedia editors are holding to views about the contras that even the Sandinistas don't believe anymore.

For instance, while pro-contra editors like to emphasize the role of the MILPAS, anti-contra editors prefer to emphasize the role of former Guardsmen. Yet even Envio, in its February 1987 review of the contra war, noted that Dimas' MILPAS rebellion was """"the most serious episode"""" of the early part of the war.

 NPOV and unbalanced 

I would prefer both tags, but I suppose once is enough.  First a certificate of Life birth is not a birth certificate which the lefties are trying to say as proof he was born in hawaii.  If his mom was a astronaunt and gave give on the moon, he could still have a certificate of live birth.  So the certificate of live birth is worthless as evidence.  His own family says he was born in Kenya, and if so his father was kenya and his mom was 16 and could not pass US citizenship to Obama.  If this claim is true, he cannot be a natural born citizen required by artical 2 section 1 of the us constitution.  Secondly his islamic school in Indonesia required him to be a Indonesian citizen, while it may be possible to get an exception, we don't know.  He has traveled to ?Iran? during the 1980s when it was illegal for Us citizens to travel there, was his travels illegal or did he travel under a different citizenship.  There is no proof that obama is a natural born citizen yet more than enough doubt, and there have been lawsuits over these doubts but the courts are refusing to hear these cases.  We cannot say Obama was born in Hawaii, nor can we say he was Born in Kenya, his birthplace is unknown.  Obama and his team of lawyers, probably on the taxpayers dole, are trying to hide whether or not he is a natural born citizen; smells fishy, what does he have to hide?  As long as we have a constitution, we have to find that out or he is not the president.  Needless to say our brave military have joined a quo warrento lawsuit, and ask by what authority obama has to be president and CEO over them.  It remains an open issue, and so far there is no evidence leading us to his birthplace or his citizenship status, however the bulk of the evidence points in the direction of him being illegal.

Jorfer's complaint above is actually deeper than just whether or not 0.999... = 1 .  His issue, rather, is rather the concept of limits actually """"applies"""" to """"real life"""".  He is agreeing that the series (0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ...) has a limit of 1, but he is not agreeing that the corresponding decimal 0.999... should be said to be equal to 1, but that they must instead differ by some as yet undefined infinitesimal amount.

The reason that an infinite series in the real number system has a sum equal to the limit of its corresponding partial finite sums is that the real number system is defined in such a way that two numbers which differ by at most an """"infinitesimal"""" quantity must be equal.  The article Archimedean property has a section that explains why the reals have no non-zero strictly positive infinitesimal numbers.  Since 0.999... and 1 differ by at most an infinitesimal quantity, and the only such quanity in the reals is zero, 1 - 0.999... = 0 and thus 1 = 0.999...  """,0

In developing the theory of relativity, Einstein realized that the equations led to the conclusion that the universe had a beginning. He didn't like the idea of a beginning, because he thought one would have to conclude that the universe was created by God. So, he added a cosmological constant to the equation to attempt to get rid of the beginning. He said this was one of the worst mistakes of his life. Of course, the results of Edwin Hubble confirmed that the universe was expanding and had a beginning at some point in the past.

Oxonian2006, my tone may sound a bit out of control but I'm not. Issues like this one are very important to me due to my own family history. Now, going further into your comment...unfortunately the knowledge of the occupation of Poland is not as universal as you may think. To many """"the Nazis"""" does not mean the Germans as you suggested. Poland was not occupied by the """"Nazis"""" who came from """"Greenland or Mars"""" or """"Nazi allies"""". Poland was occupied by the Nazi Germany or German Army (Wehrmacht) and at the beginning of the war also by the Soviet Union or Red Army. There were no other German allied troops occupying Poland unless you count Italian, Spanish and other Waffen SS troops marching to the Eastern Front. """"The German-led Nazi occupation"""" you suggested is also incorrect, there was no such thing. Half of Poland was incorporated into the Third Reich with their citizens either murdered or expelled into the """"General Government"""" which was created and %100 controlled by the Nazi Germany, nobody else. 
Therefore he """"Nazi"""" is NOT a perfectly good word to use in this case and never will be.
Now, about the Polanski who in your opinion is not a Holocaust survivor. Well...he escaped the Cracow Ghetto on the way to the extermination camp. He would be dead otherwise. Then he barely survived hiding at sympathetic to him farmers barn avoiding the Germans who would kill him immediately if found. Every Jew hiding outside the Ghettos was immediately shot by the Germans. His rescuers and rescuers family was also killed.  I don't dare to suggest that you did not know about that.

"Re: illogical: Supervening influences on half life of samples  
I understand that the half-life of a radio-isotope is unaffected by temerature, pressure, etc. But don't other radiological sources have an effect? e.g. the atomic fallout from a meteorite or a supernova in a nearby star system. It seems such events could trigger substantial 'non-spontaneous' decay that would cause is discontinuity in the typical half-life curve and set dates off by an order of magnitude. Also the level of C-14 in the atmosphere could increase significantly in response to such events too: making a sample appear younger than it really is. 

No? Are there any reliable sources research on this?",0

 Dropping accents for category indexes 

For sorting. See Wikipedia:Categorization#Category sorting. From the page:

Don't forget to convert letters with diacritics, or non-standard letters to the nearest standard letters (that is: """"standard"""" in English, at the time Wikipedia is written), examples:
Diacritics are omitted: e.g. Étretat: [[Category:Communes of Seine-Maritime|Etretat]], or: Ål: [[Category:Municipalities of Norway|Al]]
Ligatures are separated: e.g. Æsir: [[Category:Norse mythology|Aesir]]
Sometimes which is appropriate depends on the language e.g.:
From the Bruno K. Öijer article: [[Category:Living people|Oijer, Bruno K.]].  From the Ötzi the Iceman article:[[Category:Mummies|Oetzi the Iceman]] (in this case the German umlaut on the O is expanded to an """"e"""" - preferably only omit the diacritic, without applying foreign rules that could make collation seem illogic in English: [[Category:Mummies|Otzi the Iceman]].
From the Arne Åhman article: [[Category:Swedish athletes|Ahman, Arne]].  From the Lasse Åberg article: [[Category:Swedish film directors|Aaberg, Lasse]] (Contrary to the previous example the """"Å"""" is here expanded to """"Aa"""" - again, better to only omit the diacritic, to avoid collation confusion in English: [[Category:Swedish film directors|Aberg, Lasse]].

 More description of location please? 

Hello, I wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence, maybe in the description section, to explain where this bridge is? I do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things X and Y but if you don't already know Stockton well (or recently!) this is not necessarily all that helpful. I was wondering if you could write a more bottom-up description which says something like """"the bridge crosses the Tees at blah (or near Blah Street etc); it is A hundred metres downstream from the Foo Bridge and B hundred metres upstream from the Bar Barrage"""" or whatever, which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. What do you think? Any yes, of course the maps link does nail it (assuming the co-ordinates are right!) but something in the text which helps in this way would, I think, be very useful. I may be being unusually thick  (happens all the time, actually) but on my first reading - and I was last in Stockton in 2007, you see - I was not at all sure where it was, wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. I cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps, yes, but the sentence I'm asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg.

The way this request is worded contains/implies several fallacies that might mislead a new editor and as such they must be pointed out. 

The statement """"It's not verified that it's still the person's proper name today"""" implies, with zero reliable sources offered in support, that Dado Prso might have legally changed his first name. This is completely baseless. Not a single sources supports this claim/implication. On the other hand, numerous reliable sources state his first name to be Miladin.

Furthermore, the above claim about the statement Dado Prso's real name is Miladin being """"a Croatian/Serbian nationalist talking point"""" is nothing but a claim by Joy that's by no means established fact. Originally, he claimed it's a 'Serbian nationalist talking point on Wikipedia' and 'thinly veiled political advocacy' (presumably also Serbian), but now in the request he changed it to 'Croatian/Serbian talking point'.

Magashito. Central Asian people were nomads, with nomadic """"value system"""".

I don't think that European high culture is comparable to asian. Lets look the architechture. Western gothic cathedrals were bigger thaller (with bigger windows) than ancient roman temples. (see English French German cathedrals). They were the largest architectural challenge until the invention of skyscrapers. The medieval English Windsor Castle (see the photos on that arcitcle) was even bigger than the largest imperial palace of the Roman Empire (the so-called famous Nero palace). The ancient European and renaissance mathematic philiosophy theatre , sculpture fine-arts paintings are also much finer than Chinese or Japanese. Western European technology and civilization became much developed around the 14th century than the Eastern high cultures. The metallurgy and steal industry were much developed than the eastern too.The development of Eastern science and technology stopped around the 14th century.

Steven Colbert
Why can't this guy knock it off. This page was just fine until he opened his big mouth. He has given the wikiadministrators a lot of greif. What's his problem?  

Because it's funny.  God forbid people should cause you grief by opening their big mouths.  You should complain about that to an authority figure.

It's a fact that people get paid to write biased things on wikipedia, and the content can be bought.  If you believe wikipedia is an encyclopedia, with good information and other good things, then he's right, reality is a commodity.  Wikipedia told me so, and I believe what I read on wikipedia.

vandalism does not make things better. 

So how many people with the attitude that """"reality is a commodity"""" does it take before it's reality?  I have peer reviewed the idea that """"reality is a commodity"""" and I agree.  In fact, I've decided to pick it up!  

I love this stuff. Fred pays Jim to lob a brick thorough a shopkeeper's window. Who gets the blame? the shopkeeper!  

  I see what you did there. But there's more backstory to that shopkeeper than meets the eye. So there's this shopkeeper, right? And this shopkeeper, he has a shop that doesn't exactly sell anything. He just stands in his shop all day, and gives people answers to whatever they want to know. Now people start noticing this shopkeeper, and they feed the shopkeeper information to answer these questions as well as asking them things they need to know. It becomes a tightly knitted community. Things go well, until people start to unquestioningly believe what the shopkeeper has to offer. These people here, they forget that people like them are the ones feeding him information, and that whoever fed the shopkeeper this information might be just as clueless as they are. But they keep asking, and the shopkeeper keeps telling.

  Then Fred here comes along, and notices this from an outside perspective. He notices the fundamental flaw in that the advice people are getting from the shopkeeper is just as flawed as the people who told the shopkeeper the information in the first place. So Fred goes up to these people and points this out to them, but nobody seems to care. They're all happy as can be, asking their shopkeeper whatever they need to know and blindly believing what he has to offer. Some of them even retaliate against Fred for disrupting their bubble of ignorance. 

  Fred knows there's nothing that he, Fred, can do to stop this situation. But Fred here, he knows that if something isn't done, people will continue to flock to the shopkeeper like cancer patients to the messiah. And Fred knows guys. And these guys, well, they just happen to own a few bricks. So Fred calls up Jim, slips him some money, and Jim lobs a brick through the shopkeepers window. Of course in this instance, the shopkeeper is Wikipedia. The shopkeeper's devout followers are people who use the Wiki religiously. Fred is Steven Colbert, Jim is anyone willing to follow Steven, and bricks are the messages of those willing people who think that that anyone who uses the wiki religiously, and is willing to attack somebody for calling them on it, should take a step back and look at things in perspective. 
So the shopkeeper had it coming.

 First project for Wikipedia 

As of April 2, 2008, edited this page as first project.  Any comments appreciated.  Did the following:
 From previous posts, learned that page direction was for terminology, not necessarily biology. But added more succinct genetic information citation to definition, making the body of the text heavier.  Added short biology section because of this.
 Found more usage of the term """"black sheep."""" Depending on the group culture using the phrase, it was either positive or negative, so further clarified usage by splitting the term into two groupings with citations and examples for each.  I know Baa Baa Black Sheep was removed once.  However, it is an example of the use of the term.  The other examples should be obvious.  If not how do I clarify.

Tao, being as lazy as he is, is a very uninteresting person to argue with. But my ultimate intention is to positively contribute to the page. Please look at my record. Please look at what I have contributed to Wikipedia in the past. Look at the Theatre of the Absurd page. I essentially wrote the whole page. Look at the Howl page. I wrote most of that page as well. Look at the Beat Generation page. I wrote very large portions of that page. The indefinite block should be very short because my intentions are very positive. Please read the first part of the post I did in which I very honestly identified myself as a sock puppet. I begged  and I would have been on my knees, if that was possible  for Tao to actually do the work necessary to positively change the page. And what did he do? He blocked me further. Why? What does that contribute positively? It's just a power game. That is the cancer of wikipedia. And as you have demonstrated from your comments, you are functioning only to continue that cancerous effect.  Please, please actually read what I'm actually saying. Why is nobody actually reading what I'm actually saying? Add up all the things I said on that talk page. My swear-filled rant was short. My genuine attempt to engage Tao in a positively focused debate was much, much, much longer. Please just, one of you for once in your life actually read.  Look at the post entitled """"Cite Off: Formal Argument edition."""" I say nothing in there insulting. That represents my true intention. I want to say this again because I'm afraid none of you are actually reading what I'm actually saying: Please, actually read what I'm actually saying. I don't know how much plainer I can make it. Please do not be lazy with the sort of laziness that destroys Wikipedia as a source. Read the section with """"formal argument edition"""" on it and tell me if that in any way represents a """"diatribe"""" as Tao claims. Then look at the way Tao says he's not going to read it because he assumes it's a """"diatribe"""". That section represents my genuine inention for the page, as does the """"let's get down to business"""" section. Ban me based on my rant, sure, but you can not seriously think that I'm the sort of poster it would be worthwhile to ban. I'm willing to follow your rules and to be cordial for the sake of the page. I am contrite to the degree that I recognized I broke rules and promise I will abide by the rules from here on forward, but I seriously want to urge you on a larger level to recognize the faulty bizarro world catch-22 of this system, where someone with only good intentions for the content of the page stands up for himself and for what is right and he's the one who gets punished, yet someone who undermines the value of Wikipedia as whole with laziness and stupidity is rewarded. Thank you.  """,0

 Conflict of Interest 

Pm_shef: This is an attempt to resolve the concerns that relate to your conduct on Wikipedia and the editing of articles that you are personally involved in.   

As you know, the official policy of Wikipedia, according to WP:NOT, is that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and that editors should avoid contributing to articles that they are personally involved in. That doesn't mean that your edits have not been neutral; rather, it means that any editing at all of Vaughan Council-related articles is inappropriate, no matter what is written. 

Here is the fulltext, from WP:NOT: 

Wikipedia is not a soapbox
Wikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not:
Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a """"sympathetic point of view"""" for every article.
Self-promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006 that: """"Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so.""""  Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles, or to articles in which you have a personal stake, is similarly unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography and Wikipedia:Notability.
Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small """"garage"""" companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. See also WP:CORP for a proposal on corporate notability.

I understand that you've written to a user that you will not be involved anymore in Vaughan-related articles. That's a commendable position. I'm sure there are many subjects and articles of interest to you on Wikipedia that do not relate to your father or his opponents. Do I understand your position correctly? And is this approach of abstention one that you permanently take? If so, I again commend that position. I trust, as I'm sure you do, that the administrators and the contributors to Wikipedia will maintain quality articles about worthy and reputable subjects.  """,0
"""lol you're a complete freak in my opinion (now boy genius, is that a """"personal attack""""?)
the first person to ban me for supposed vandalism was an idiot like you. the successive people (with one exception where it was legitimate) just did it because they blindly followed that idiot's lead. the highest level admin to look at my user talk agreed that I had a legitimate dispute and never should have been banned in the first place. so suck a big one. you know you like to. )

"About the Sum 41 edits 

I think the way you did it that it goes with two chronologies (studio and non-studio albums), it is very confusing, and I haven't come across any band, and this goes for bands with even more albums and EPs, to have such a split chronology between studio and non-studio albums. I think it'll be for the best if there will be one chronology with all the studio albums, live, EPs, etc. like most bands, its less confusing that way. Full discography could be viewed in the discography page anyway, so thats my opinion. I think it'll be better this way.",0
