I'm happy to help, but unfortunately I won't have time to deal with this in any detail for about 10 days.  I agree that Stevecyberbunny'''s edits are inappropriate, but I don't agree that they're vandalism: edits are only considered vandalism if an editor is attempting to harm the article.  In this instance, I think the editor believes he his correcting inaccuracies.  In my opinion, he is adding material not supported by reliable sources.  While this is inappropriate, it's technically different from vandalism.  For example, if no reliable, published source explicitly says Matt the Knife is, as he put it in an earlier edit, """"facing scrutiny,"""" or that his records have been challenged, then the article shouldn't say those things either.

First I have to ask you if you have any connection to the subject in the article, because that will limit the ways in which can mitigate the problem.  If you are affiliated with Matt the Knife in any way, it is generally considered inappropriate for you to be editing the article  with some important exceptions I'll come to in a moment.  Please have a look at Wikipedia: Conflict of interest to see if it applies to you.

If it does apply to you, then you are entitled to revert vandalism  but please make sure you've thoroughly read the definition of vandalism.  You are also entitled to remove anything defamatory or any negative unsourced or poorly-sourced information (please see Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons.  If the editor persists in restoring material you consider inappropriate, please raise the matter at the Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard.  If you post to this notice board, make sure to declare your conflict of interest.

If Wikipedia: Conflict of interest does not apply to you, you are free to rewrite the article as you please, provided any material you add or change is anchored by inline citations from reliable sources.  Please see Wikipedia: Verifiability for more information.  If you end up in a conflict with another editor over the article, try to find common ground by starting a discussion on the article's talk page.  If you are unable to resolve your conflict this way, please see Wikipedia:Dispute resolution''.

 Our ancestors 

Most of us trace our musical origins to the B's, but, past the B's, everything, and I mean everything is due to The Fans, Pylon, and Vietnam.  The Fans had records on db (Danny Beard = db records).  Their single """"True,"""" in particular, is a fantastic distillation of half of what Athens would be (avail. on """"Squares Blot Out the Sun,"""" a db sampler).  Vietnam was never recorded.  The Fans split up, with Kevin Dunn remaining about the scene as a solo act (Kevin Dunn and the Tribe of Women were on db).  Alfredo Villar, the singer of The Fans, went back to his day job.  

The other thing is Pylon.  There just are    not     words for how important they were/are.  REM's favorite band is Pylon.  The B-52's favorite band is Pylon.  Everyone's favorite band was/is Pylon.

The other huge starting point is in Atlanta.  The Hampton Grease Band, despite being Atlantans, was a kick off to the whole idea that we could be weird and successful.  Although they claim that """"Music to Eat"""" sold fewer albums than any in Columbia history (not true, as a Yoga instructional record undersold them), they looked successful to us because they had integrity and played and got to pay their bills that way.  In particular, although that band's career was very brief, Bruce Hampton never went away.  Both in The Late Bronze Age and Aquarium Rescue Unit later, as well as the various incarnations as Hampton B. Coles and Colonel Bruce Hampton, he was a magnet for musicians.  Furthermore, Glenn Philips, who played guitar with the Grease Band when he was 15 years old, stuck around and continued to gig.

I'm a stinkin' expert on Athens 1980 - 1986.  After that, I quit my band and wandered away to academia, but I was one of Them back then.   """,0

I selected you and many other editors pretty much completely at random; I picked one day's AfD archives, and clicked on the talk pages of the first two or three dozen editors' talk pages I came across.  I hope that in using this selection method, I will get editors who are well-versed in AfD policies, yet who also represent a good cross-section of AfD philosophies.

Spite
User:Dennis Brown, you accused me of """"spite"""" on a public board for removing the article body content at Veniamin Sozin. (You accused of """"ownership"""" as well, but I already explained at ANI how your interpretation of editsum was not correct.) Why I removed body content at Sozin is complex, but it wasn't something as stupid and petty as """"spite"""". It's a big sorrow to me to have to leave ortho chess article editing. (I have loved it. I had no idea, the hostile and ruthless culture at WP, and the editors who revel in that environment to throw lies and smears and do bullying would ruin it for me. But I should have known better. The signs were early and my love of editing made me want to ignore them.) The deal is, Dennis, I regret ever creating that article (and there were only two others) for the orthochess project. I just regret it. And that regret, also somes with pain. And sorrow. But in the end, I wish I never edited for that subproject. I met some nice talented editors doing (e.g. User:Tocatta Quarta, User:Cobblet whom I learned to understand better and appreciate), but there were some bad apples, and the environment allowed them to make hay with me. That wasn't nice. When defacto subproject leader Quale defamed me consistently by complimenting my detractors, and disparaging my good-faith efforts out of prejudice, well, that's life in the big city, it's political and nasty here, and I'm not willing to suck up to it. I'd rather leave. So I did. Seeing the three articles I left behind I created, that I can no longer expand, made me sick. I began to sincerely wish I never created them. So I made mercy killings of them. (Have you seen One Flew Over the Kookoo's Nest? There's a mercy killing in that movie. Was it spite!?) You apparently have no idea what complex emotion caused me to delete those contents, so, a quick & dirty answer you accuse on a public board, is that of """"spite"""". (Why do you jump to suppose bad faith like that? You should think about that. In effect an accusation of """"spite"""" is a dig of my character. I've never toilet-papered a house or lawntree in all my life. Or played a mean trick on anybody for fun. Why should I start now? To accuse me of mere spite is to say I'm no better than a juvenile delinquent. And you don't see the insult value and personal affront in that? You are Mr. Editor Retention. And yet you seem clueless what I as editor have gone through, who has done a partial quit of Wikipedia  the quit of a subproject [orthochess]. The emotional toil is real and genuine. I know I cannot prove that, only attempt to explain to you. But please note how you jumped to bad faith explanation, and affront, and maybe why you would do that.Like I mentioned, the emotions were complex. Take one of the other three articles, for example: Paris Defence. Some of the above was at play with the deletion of that artice's body content, but there was something else, too. I had to fight tooth-and-nail, to get that article to 'Keep' status, and a WP:CHESS member also who is a deletionist kept pestering me about why the article couldn't be 'Merged'. The reasoning for 'Delete' and 'Merge' were all faulty, and I painstakingly and patiently tried to reason and explain. To little success. But the article stayed. Only through my perseverance, I guess. I never demanded the article stay  I don't think I even !voted at the AfD for it. I simply made comments because even then, I had disassociated myself as project member due to already giving up on the level of civility from one editor initials CPL who you favored at your Talk against me, when I went to your Talk in good faith consel session, and there was no counsel discussion, just diaparaging criticisms of me, and I withdrew. That is when I never trusted you again. (Your compatriot Elen of Roads of course came in to render supportive disparaging criticisms of me, there and on her Talk, without end. You see how """"friendship"""" explains all on the Wikipedia. Arguments are for losers, it seems.) The reason I deleted body content of Paris Defence is because I worked so hard, so very very hard, for the good, and consistency, of WP chess articles then, to keep it, and prove it. (CPL was saying the opening didn't even exist. That it was a joke of a 3rd move by Black. Yet he was willing to tell everyone at any opportunity that he's a """"chess Expert"""" rating, in repeated boasting. I worked so very hard hard hard to keep that article, I improved it during the AfD, and it was amazing to me, because those imporovements didn't seem to matter (no one said they did), when they were in fact central and vital and the whole point. So where does the sorrow come in? After working so hard as I did, for the reasons I did, I was alone. Alone alone alone. No support from the """"community"""" of """"collaborative editors""""  what a Project is supposed to be all about. Silence. When my arguments to keep were valid, the",0

And, if you read the Mau abstract, there does seem to be evidence for the gene, they've narrowed down the probable location of the gene.  What is not known is if it has linkage to Sabino, and sabino may be caused by a number of different genes, of which only SB1 has been mapped:  """"So far, it is not known whether dominant white (W) and sabino spotting (S) share a common genetic background. In this study, a pedigree consisting of 87 horses segregating for dominant white (W) was used to genetically localize the horse (W)-locus.

It was 89.57. You rounded up. I love how have to type sentence after sentence about a subject you clearly know nothing about. It was a 27.3 m (89.5 ft) female caught off the South Shetland Islands in January 1925. Whether it was measured or not I can't say. It wasn't measured by a scientist in the standard zoological manner (in a straight line from the tip of the rostrum to the notch of the flukes) though, so it probably wasn't measured accurately (if at all). It was most likely measured alongside a factory ship during flensing (unless it was taken to the Deception Island station). This was just before the widespread use of stern slipways, so it would have been difficult to measure if it indeed was. The cited source should be Mackintosh and Wheeler (1929), which cite Risting (1928), which I don't have access to. Mackintosh and Wheeler simply say it was """"27.3 m. or 89 ft. 6 in."""" (p. 321).

Third, Deja Vu Artworks is based in Japan, if I worked for them that would seem that I lived in Japan as well, in which case, why would I want to Americanize the article?  Which brings us to trying to improve the article. As noted before, a good chuck of infomraiton in the original revisions was irrelevant - you do NOT need a song listing from a flash animation in an article that is a general overview of a subject. Also, the Deja Vu information was removed because it was unsourced and I can't seem to find any indication of resolution for the topic - it happened in 2004 and it is now 2007 either it was resolved or it fell by the way side, where as the Netrunner controversy is still on going and received a great deal of notice when it happened. If there is a bunch of information on Deja Vu that I am missing then by all means, point out some links and we can work it into the article. Now, in regards to most of the changes - this article toes very close to the fancruft category and as such most of the edits are there to try and pull it away from that category. In case you haven't noticed, most of the information in the List of OS-tans article is gone because that article was deleted; one of the reasons for which was fancruft. Now all that said, there is no reason why the descriptions of the top five 'tans can be expanded a bit, but you must remember that should not be a full bio of the characters, plus the fact that they can be changed at an artists whim means that you can't write in the matter of """"OSX-tan is always seen poking XP-tan"""" with a stick - that is just one thing that an artist can do.

 Sjones23, about your sand-box version of plot. I must say that I don't like it and reasons I telled earlier. Look, you write, for example:""""After Ashitaka returns the head to the deer god, the land becomes green again, and the accursed and lepers are restored to health. San and Ashitaka part, vowing to see each other as much as possible, while Ashitaka, finally freed of his curse, decides to rebuild Tataraba. Eboshi vows to rebuild Tataraba along more harmonious lines,..."""" - what I see there it's completely muddle, misinterpret, lie. This is rough OR and distortion of what we really see in the film. I hope you will understand. And much places in your sand-box version like this example. So I disagree, must decline your version. Reread please what I wrote to Elen about different variants (point two).

Is it necessary to have this many pictures of NorthPark Center? Most major malls have only one picture of the mall, and NorthPark Center, being not too notable nationwide, has 5. Shrek05 14:31 26 Jun 2006

While NorthPark may not (yet) be notable nationwide, I don't see any reason not to have the pictures of the mall, for this reason:  the mall is the largest in Texas (at 2.35 million square feet) and one of the five largest in the US (according to the International Council of Shopping Centers).  Consequently, the pictures give readers of Wikipedia a view of how a quarter billion dollars was spent in its recent expansion.  With the 1.4-acre Center Park in the middle, NorthPark also becomes the only mall in the nation with a sizeable outdoor area for eating, playing or relaxing.  At one time, shortly after its opening by Raymond Nasher, the mall also held the distinction of being largest air-conditioned building in the entire world.
 

 picture rendering under Thunderbird looks all wrong 

The pictures on this page come out all wrong when viewed with Thunderbird (I'm using ver 1.5.0.4 under Windows XP).  It looks fine in Internet Explorer (v 6.0, same OS).  Looking at the page source, it seems like more of a problem with Thunderbird or the CSS for same, but I'm no web developer.  Leaving a note here in the hope that someone more skilled might find it and fix it.   

 Fountains 

It's been probably a year since I last visited, but one of the major interior architectural features has always been the fountain with colored lights, and another feature I can't describe well, sort of a mini-pond with a bridge. Unusual features worth mentioning very briefly. Incidentally, having looked at the existing pictures (only one of which is at all attractive or unique), I think we'd do better to find or snap a good picture of the fountains instead. (I'd have to look into whether there are any restrictions on taking pictures; I once had problems taking pictures inside a supermarket for my Spanish class (they thought I was some sort of corporate spy).

 Major Edit (3/26/2007) - Staff Email 

I contacted NorthPark Center staff asking them to release some images of the mall into GNU license, since the mall recently underwent construction and could use some new photos.  What I got in return was neither photos, nor permission, but a revised version of the Wikipedia article deemed to be factually correct by their staff.  (A full copy of the email is provided )

Most of the email has been transplanted into the article, with a few exceptions, as some parts did not meet Wikipedia's standards of notability or NPOV.

The biggest omission is the list of stores exclusive to NorthPark.  The information does not appear to be notable.

The introduction claims """"NorthPark Center is one of the top five shopping mall’s in the United States"""" but it appears to be outdated because the List of largest shopping malls in the United States would rank the mall as #7 in the US, based on Gross Leasable Area.  The infobox has been updated to match up with the International Council of Shopping Centers data, rather than the figures currently displayed on NorthPark Center's website.

  
There's still a lot that violates NPoV here. I slapped the neutrality tag on it.

"Hazel Eye Myth==

The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some insatnces can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. 

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America and areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green within the gold and/or on the outskirts when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.

As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown. 110.174.147.166

A matter of fact

In 1987 The New Yorker magazine published an article written by Alec Wilkinson concerning one Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo, a 23 years of age individual who would sit out in Greenwich Village and offer passersby Free Advice. In 1991 the first media reports about the three Free Advice Ladies began to appear. Why? Because, unbeknownst to the general public, Amy Alkon and her two colleagues Minnick and Johnson, had read the article in The New Yorker and figured they could make it appear to be their own original idea. Nothing could be further from the truth. The evidence exists at The Official Free Advice Man Web-site.When the original Free Advice Man went back up to New York from Baltimore, where he was residing at the time, and confronted the three intellectual thieves, he asked them, without first divulging his own respective identity, where they had come up with the idea. Because they were not under the spotlight of a major mass media outlet they divulged the truth: """"...we read this article in The New Yorker and thought that this would be fun to do..."""". Nowhere, not on Oprah, not on CNN, or anywhere else, did these three persons inform the public that they were making their fame at the expense of someone else's idea.  """,0

Is this necessary?
On another page, in another conversation, two experienced editors have commented:
adding citations does make it easier if someone tries to slip a hoax in, particularly while quite a lot of the naems are redlinks.   
and
 ... there isn't a requirement to have all citations for all the members in the list. As long as every member is covered by a general reference then that is fine.

 Once again, you are proving that you lack the ability to understand. If you had payed attention, you would have had realised that I actually removed that paragraph, because their Turkic origin is NOT disputed in mainstream sources. 
 I think that 90% of the people are not interested in their ethnic background, and especially not in their Turkic ethnic background, because they did not rule in the name of Turks, not had they any influence or some other kind of nationalst involvement in the history of the Turkic peoples. Not even Encyclopaedia Britannica (your favourite source) mentions their ethnic background: . 
 What's important is that the dynasty was started by a former slave, and that it rose out of the chaos that followed Seljuqid decline in Central Asia. It's absolutely unimportant whether Anushtigin was a Turk, a Mongol, a Chinese, or a Brazilian, because his descendants ruled as the """"Shahs of Khorezm"""" and not as the """"Turkic rulers of Turkistan"""". If someone is interested in Anushtigin's background, he can click on the link. The dynasty was certainly not """"Turkic"""", as you claim (and this is indeed bad faith), but only the dynasty's founder was (most likely) of Qipchaq origin. 
 In the article Mughals we agreed not to mention any ethnic lables, because the Mongolian origin of the dynasy's founder has no importance - the Mughals came from a Mongol background, but they were not Mongol rulers (in contrast to their Gengghizid ancestors). 
 I do not dispute authoritative sources, such as Iranica, who describe Anushtigin as a Turk. That'S why I have modified the Anush Tigin Gharchai article. But I do dispute POV claims that try to """"Turkify"""" a dynasty that was neither Turkic in language, nor in culture or identity.  """,0

"The name is familiar, but I don't actually have any copies of it. It would be good to add Japanese sources to the gaming articles to expand their reception sections because the inclusion of sources from different nationalities helps to reduce systemic bias and POV. Naturally English Wikipedia will use mostly English-language sources, and naturally there are a lot of high-quality English-language RSes, and these are sufficient to demonstrate a game's notability, etc., but high-quality or major non-English and multinational sources would address Wikipedia's second pillar by reducing or eliminating cultural biases in the reporting. It sounds to me like reviews from GAMEST would be a great addition to Wikipedia for this reason.
For articles on games created in non-English-language countries, I think it's also very helpful for a full grasp of the topic to include reception from the originating culture. So in my view, reviews from Japanese sources like Famitsu or GAMEST should be used to expand the articles on Japanese games whenever possible. (And similarly, reviews from French magazines would be helpful for French games, and Russian magazines for Russian games, etc.). I have heard that Famitsu is considered Japan's premier video game magazine so I think that its reviews for Japanese games are particularly helpful, and I have been adding them to gaming articles recently, but thanks for bringing my attention to GAMEST too.

"Wikipedia:Requests for Comment/GoRight 

Thanks for your kind words about my comments. I'd disagree, though. I'm not convinced that GoRight was, exactly, baiting WMC, he was, more accurately, confronting some clear double standards. The edits which got him blocked for harassment were echoes of what WMC had said, and which had been supported by, as I recall, Schulz. Whether it was true or not, those comments were set up, GoRight just noticed it and said it, violating User:Abd/Rule 0. I'd call it uncivil, but on a scale not worse than what had preceded it, and certainly, because of it's mirror nature, more just.

I've tried to reach out to Connolley, but he rejected it, which is sad. I suspect that he's a good man who has fallen into some bad company. (Maybe they are all good men who have fallen into a bad constellation, some pattern that reinforces the worst aspects of the way they are working here.) The incivility serves no obvious good purpose from any POV except one that would hate the project to be successful, and I'm sure that's not Connolley's POV.

In any case, I have not denied the uncivil aspects of GoRight's edits, I've merely noted that they are easily explainable as a natural response to what clearly appeared to him to be an abusive cabal, and what he was seeing confirmed what was in the Solomon source. I believe that he is now able to see beyond that, and that he's learned to not make accusations that involve assumptions of bad faith. I draw a distinction between noting a reasonable suspicion that something is off, and claiming that it is off. I might note that a user shows characteristics of a block-evading sock, but I won't claim that the user is a block-evading sock unless I'm prepared to back it up with sufficiently solid evidence. I'll only state the former, as well, the suspicion, if the suspicion is clearly reasonable, so I'd just be stating the obvious, which sometimes must be said.

And that's how I've treated sock puppetry charges against me: if there was some reasonable basis, not matter how shallow, I didn't charge abusive SSP filing. GoRight clearly went too far, but he didn't keep it up. Meanwhile, he was blocked in outrageous violation of block policy, and I'm mulling over whether or not I should do anything about that. Baley has denied that there was any error in the block, and this is what actually might make it necessary to go for an RfC. It's pretty clear, it's not marginal. But, of course, RfC isn't the first step. The first step would be something like what I just did on User talk:William M. Connolley. The next step, for me, would be to attempt to identify someone Connolley might trust, to give him a friendly nudge. Has to be a friend, not merely an ally.",0

 This is the English version of Wikipedia! Adjust yourself to that fact or go somewhere else. 

Why are English speakers always barraged by racists trying to insist that we use their language? Especially Spanish and Arabic. This is the English version of Wikipedia, and it should be written in English. Why do these racists always try to cram Spanish down our throats? Everyone in the world has a language. Yours is not better than mine. In fact, it is inferior. Speak, read and write Spanish if you want. And use the Spanish-language version of Wikipedia. I don't care. But stop harassing me! This page is not nearly as bad as many others, but I am fed up with this practice. The leading paragraph of some topics is virtually unreadable because a translation has been added for almost every word.

In this article the leading paragraph provides the asinine translation found in this sentence: """"He is the founder of Ricky Martín Foundation (in Spanish Fundación Ricky Martin), a non-profit charity organization."""" To begin with, a moderately mentally-retarded person, who doesn't speak either language, could probably figure that out. There is no legitimate reason for this translation. And why the racial prejudice? Where is the Russian translation? What about German, Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese, etc? The logical conclusion of this absurdity will be that every word of the English article will be followed by its Spanish counterpart. Insanity! We don't vandalize their wiki; they should stop vandalizing ours.

I checked the Spanish-language wiki for this article, and it contains no translation into English. That is appropriate. This version should contain no translations into Spanish, unless the Spanish wiki is shut down completely. Then it would be acceptable to include a few pertinent translations. However, this instance is completely pointless.

Do you mean you can read about those work conditions & not see that it's slavery?  Prepare yourself for earthshaking news: the wage system is slavery but most people didn't think so.  Slavery means """"someone who is controlled by someone or something.""""   A boss controls a slave, but a slave also enslaves a boss.   Being offered a wage you can't live on is slavery.   All jobs are being eliminated by machine-slaves,  which makes it more obvious than ever before that all people must have a Guaranteed Minimum Income, although I prefer the word 'residual' to 'minimum'.  Read child labour & try to see it was child slavery into the 20th century, & it still is today since many children work in their parents' business.  When they """"ended child labour"""" that didn't set the children free; they were """"free to starve"""" because what they need/ed is a GMI.  Having children is a form of slavery too: parents become slaves to their children (when they need to eat, bathe, etc) but the children are also slaves to their parents.  So """"no control"""" also means we'll always be slaves to needing food, & we can find ways to eliminate all the work with machines which again means all people need a GMI.  (Actually all people should own all things, because when a few rich people own everything it's obviously slavery; how did every person not know that?  America refused to let any attempts at Socialism & Communism succeed; instead they forced it to fail by starting many wars, teaching torture, & you must read Wm Blum's """"Rogue State"""".  Fidel Castro was right & America was wrong.)  And the BLS is wrong; they always underestimate, because most of those people are probably illegal immigrants from many generations back.  They say every year 50,000 people are smuggled into the US to work as prostitutes (that's slavery), so can you imagine how many illegals there must be in America hidden behind walls, & all supporting a few rich slave masters who travel the world & raise their families on the backs of SLAVES in America.  How can you read about multinational corporations & not see they cause poverty in those other countries, as well as in America?    If Liberia has a population of 3 million & one corporation goes there & """"creates only 2000 jobs"""" then can't anyone see the wage is causing their poverty??  That's just an example, but do you see what I'm saying about the wage is the problem worldwide, not the solution, like America thinks?  When 3,000 people show up to apply for 20 job openings, you know the wage is wrong & it's slavery.  I know I'm a slave, & I know every person is a slave & I'm right & everyone is wrong.  Gerry Spence also says we're slaves in Give Me Liberty.  That's all for now.    02:08, 31""",0

"""irrelevant; only what the world calls her matters. So I checked Google News: 2,753 hits for """"Ashlee Simpson"""", 489 for """"Ashlee Simpson-Wentz"""". I feel this demonstrates that """"Ashlee Simpson"""" is still the correct title. Does anyone oppose moving it back?   

I was going to say the same thing. Her legal name is irrelevant, this article should be at the most commonly used name that most people know her by, which is obviously Ashlee Simpson. 92.1.2.237  
Yes, and even her official website still calls her """"Ashlee Simpson"""".   

I will move the page back to """"Ashlee Simpson"""" in 24 hours unless there is an objection, or unless Google News indicates a significant trend toward general adoption of the """"Simpson-Wentz"""" name.   

I searched Ashlee Simpson as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz and pages are starting to refer to her as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz. Let's keep the article as-is.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.151.137.19   

Yeah, I've searched her as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz in Google News, and they've started referring to her as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz. The article is fine the way that it is.   

You can see the numbers I posted a few days ago above. The current numbers are 3,358 for """"Ashlee Simpson"""" and 559 for """"Ashlee Simpson-Wentz"""". I don't see a trend towards the latter. Most of the newest articles refer to her as """"Ashlee Simpson"""".   

Considering that she got married a couple weeks ago, I think that 559 results as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz is a good number of articles. It will probably increase as more articles are written.   
If that were the case, we'd see a trend, but what I see is that there was a spike in the use of the new name after it was announced, but that subsequently most sources continued to use the old name. The results indicate to me that the new name hasn't caught on.   

Read this: 
she's taking Pete's surname and is going by Simpson-Wentz professionally. I think this settles this dicussion. 24.151.137.19  
The point is that it doesn't matter what she calls herself. Wikipedia articles are titled according to the common name of the subject.   

Exactly. Ashlee is changing her common name. 24.151.137.19  
She can't change her common name. Her common name is decided according to what people want to call her. If they now start calling her Ashlee Simpson-Wentz, then that's her new common name, but if they keep calling her Ashlee Simpson, then that remains her common name. That's why I've been comparing Google News results, to see whether this new name is really catching on. Also, as I pointed out, her website still uses her old name, but maybe they're just lazy. Since there are two of you in favor of keeping it at this title, I propose that we wait one week, then look at the results again and see if there's more of a shift towards Simpson-Wentz.   

I just noticed that Danny has been going around changing the articles on her albums so that they are described as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz albums. Considering we don't even have a consensus on what she should be called now, I don't think it's appropriate to try to extend the Simpson-Wentz name to album articles which were released under the Ashlee Simpson name before she married Pete.   

I've searched Google News for Ashlee Simpson, which had 3,162 results, and Ashlee Simpson-Wentz, which had 1,613 results. So clearly, the results for Ashlee Simpson are dropping while results for Ashlee Simpson-Wentz are increasing. But, as Everyking said, he",0

Possible Original Research:
I only skimmed through on these parts, but it seems to me that most of this needs to be cited - either for verification, or simply for the sake of further reading.

1. French people often refer to Metropolitan France as L'Hexagone (The """"Hexagon"""") because of the geometric shape of its territory.

Unless it was a Frenchman or Frenchwoman who added that in, how can we know for certain that they really do? Is this self-made nickname for that region so internationally renowned that it's a surefire fact? Unless one can respond in the affirmative to either question, It needs a citation.

2. There are various theories as to the origin of the name of the Franks. One is that it is derived from the Proto-Germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a francisca.

Another proposed etymology is that in an ancient Germanic language, Frank means free as opposed to slave. This word still exists in French as franc, it is also used as the translation of """"Frank"""" and to name the local money, until the use of the Euro in the 2000s.

However, rather than the ethnic name of the Franks coming from the word frank, it is also probable that the word is derived from the ethnic name of the Franks, the connection being that only the Franks, as the conquering class, had the status of freemen. In German, France is still called Frankreich, which literally means """"Realm of the Franks"""". In order to distinguish from the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne, Modern France is called Frankreich, while the Frankish Realm is called Frankenreich.

Now here we're talking about cite-cite-cite-for-crying-out-loud-cite! Some of this might not only be original research, but speculation, also! Two Wikipedia-no-nos riddled into one! It seems like you only walk one paragraph or two down the article and bam! The poor thing is literally kissed with original research! Something has to be done!

So africa's average I.Q. of around 70 is lower than it's potential as evidenced by american blacks who have an I.Q. of about 85.  However this is probably the upper limit as to what african blacks could achieve since there is significant white admixture in american black populations.  Studies of adopted children have shown that asian children tend to have I.Q.'s significantly greater than their adoptive parents (110)  while black children have I.Q.'s that are lower than their adoptive parents (90).

 A violation of wiki rules 

Apparantley I have made a mistake called WP:OUTING in regards to sockpuppet user 86.40.192.203 whom had begun a discussion on the admin board against me with false charges. this sockpuppet had done this previously saying he was not a sock - yet again he oppened a second admin section against me with a new sock saying that he was someone different yet he was clearly the same guy (lying and saying he was a new editor)

i say in no uncertain terms that i had never heard of WP:OUTING and am sorry if i have violated this policy - but i should also say that all the information i posted i got from his own prior vandalism - essentially he outed himself - he vandalized a page to give his name and date of birth - which got reverted by another editor because it had nothing to do with the article he was vandalizing - his location i got from the wiki's own traceroute function that i thought we were allowed to use to prove sockpuppetrty68.231.15.56  

in one of his sockpuppet attacks here Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#User talk:68.231.15.56 he states that """"This person has only recently been reported."""" this sentence implies that SOMEONEELSE reported me and yet the IP of the previous reporter is 86.40.107.69 which traces to the same location in Ireland - this is by definition sockpuppetry or the use of various IP's to do malicious intent without acknowledement of ownership68.231.15.56  
myself i have used this same IP for over 5,000 edits whereas i can see a pattern of daily vandalism and sockpuppetry of the 86.40 IP as far back as 2008 (man thats a lot of vandalism) endlessly ANON changing his IP to avoid block which i am betting he is already long ago blocked administratively68.231.15.56

Well, opposing viewpoints frequently meet in wikis.  """"Neutral"""" POV and """"common sense"""" are highly subjective and the only solutions are to either favour one viewpoint as a matter of site policy or to let people battle it out.  If you choose the former approach, admins need to monitor contributions very carefully.  If the number of contributors is large, you have to police the site through very """"blunt"""" use of editing restrictions (massive IP range blocks, night editing restrictions etc) which slows the development of the wiki considerably.  If you choose the latter, editors are allowed to run free and the project grows quickly.  However, you can end up with long, protracted debates between editors about seemingly trivial points.

Wikipedia was founded on the principle of allowing very open editing with minimal intervention by admins, and I doubt that will ever change.  You can console yourself with the fact that all of the millions of articles here can be copied freely (under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license) to other wiki projects and edited to suit the viewpoint of the site!

So you wrote yourself: this article is more than just recognition. I write that it is also about illegal precedent... if not only about it. I myself comprehend the term recognition as a term which explains a process. Wiktionary for the english language for (Wikt:recognition) states as the first definition that it is an act or condition of being recognized, whereas wikt:recognize explains this transitive verb as To match something or someone which one currently perceives to a memory of some previous encounter with the same entity. So if we follow the literate meaning we could conclude that to make an act of recognition or come to the state of recognition one should match sth... ...with the same entity. What should should be matched here: eventual Kosovo independence with independence of othere countries. If there are some lists, which you mention, then there are lists of independent (or better nondependant) countries and other entities. Since there is a dispute whether Kosovo should be in one list or some other, some major (as in comparative of lat. magnus - en. bigger) thoughts could be given here. If you mention moving (from one list to the other, than you intuitively agree with me that there could be a POV that a process could exist, or not. Moving, by itself, is a dynamic category (Aristotel discussed this issue long ago), so it could be perceived and comprehended as a process. All this is much simpler (at least for me) to comprehend and explain in serbian language, since serbian language has svršeni and nesvršeni vid of a verb which adds to a bit more refined expression of thought, if I may be so language-subjective. Sorry if I offended you somehow, by quoting your words or in any other way, it wasn't my intention. I will conclude in hope that my too elaborate essay (I may call it now so -) ), constructively adds to comming into terms and resolving the current dispute on the article's content and title.

Hi I'm currently reading ppenheimer's book. It's excellent, he has a comprehensive iblyography and notes, and uses previously published peer reviewed scientific papers. It has a very comprehensive feel to it. I haven't read Sykes book yet, but looking at the appendices and index it doesn't have the sort of comprehensive or academic feel of Oppenheimer's work. Still we can cite both and I suspect there will be many areas of agreement. All the best. Oppenheimer certainly argues strongly for the Iberian origin of most people from the British Isles, though he mentions a paleolithic contribution from the Balkan refuge to England.

Well what I was trying to explain is that I never make any personal statements about him (with the exception of """"to promote a positive image of Iran and Iranians"""", which, as I explained later in the same section, any person assuming good faith would take as an insult). You also might want to talk to him about accusatory statements such as this one, personally pointing me out by name. I never did anything comparable to this. Is this in accordance with your policy of """"we discuss articles, not users""""???? 

As for the unsourced tag, it's been discussed in the talk page. The article does not provide any sources discussing the subject of the article. All the sources provided are about other ethnic groups, but they make side comments that have been taken out context and are contradictory to some of the other statements appearing on the page. The article is on Iranian peoples, so it should contain at least one source discussing who these people are. Such a source has yet to be provided. 

I think the article was initially meant to be written on the linguistic group of all speakers of Iranian languages, but the definition has changed considerably due to some misunderstandings (Iran is also the name of a country and some Iranian citizens see themselves as part of a greater ethnic group, that of """"Iranian peoples"""" - see the article on Greater Iran for signs of this). I'm not sure what's the best way to move on from here. The article definitely has to be rewritten with a clear definition in mind, but a lot of users are not being cooperative. I'd consider any advice or mediation. Thanks, Talk

As far as I can tell by roughly looking at my contribs, I've made somewhere around 7000 edits (possibly more or less) in the last 8 months since I was last blocked, and except for reverting vandalism, I don't believe I have reverted any editor more than once in a 24 hour period, although there might be a few exceptions that I may have missed; in fact I do believe there was one incident where I reverted an editor twice.  As for my three blocks, the first was for reverting an editor three times in a 24 hour period, the second was erroneous, as I was blocked for reverting scibaby vandalism on sight three times, and the third was for making three reverts to the same article I was originally blocked.  In other words, in all three instances I was not blocked for violating 3RR (even though Madman claims I was in the edit summary; he never retracted in the edit summary but he did retract on my talk page and another administrator came forward to criticize the block[ser_talk:Viriditas/Archive_18#Blocked]).  As for the other two blocks, I have made three exceptional changes to insure that I was not blocked again, including permanently leaving the article of which I was the primary contributor; abstaining from editing alongside the editor I was involved in the edit war with, and; leaving that particular WikiProject altogether to avoid running into the same editor by accident.  Since that time, eight months have passed with little if any  problems to report, and during that time I have continued to revert vandalism to Hawaii-related articles.  I believe that I do not have a history of disruptive editing, however, I did have a problem with a particular editor on a particular article who worked on a particular project, and I have eliminated that problem by ignoring the editor, removing myself from the article, and unsubscribing from the project.

For the record as you have accused me of making threats I would like you to know that I wasn't, merely pointing out that if his nationality is Irish you should not try and claim him as english. Furthermore block me all you want as i have done nothing wrong in fact I'm quite right in changing his nationality to Irish when you claim he is not.. I appreciate he may be a citizen of britain but that does not mean his nationality is british, it's really not that difficult to understand that if his parents are Irish and he was born in dublin and lived there until he was 5, he is clearly Irish.. I would appreciate no more threatening messages from you in mail.. Peace from Eire",0

 Hello 

I wanted to let you know that I just reverted essentially all of the content you added to Tone Trump. In my opinion the way you wrote about him was overly-promotional and didn't reflect the neutral point of view that is expected in Wikipedia articles.

I do hope you will continue to contribute to that article, and lots of others, but please do bear in mind the need to write in a neutral voice.

Cheers,

Thank you for your reply. 

About my message and your reply: this is my third message if you notice to your previous messages, the first one, I have written you few month ago also.

Number of photos: Somehow you are right there is no standard to the number of the photos per article in Wikipedia. Yes there are a lot of photos in Moscow and other famous cities' article also but it is only Tabriz that has a tag on is header. Also the number of the photos for this cities are proportional to their text.  

Some of the photos are belong to attraction of other cities of East Azerbaijan Province (Marand, Jolfa and ...) That could be involved inside their own articles not Tabriz.

There are some photos from the same monument that shows the same thing, where the monument has its own article and these photos can be presented in the original article and may be one photo in Tabriz article is enough.

Another thing is that we wanna to create a beautiful  article for Tabriz not Moscow or anywhere else.

About my photos: The images that you have mentioned belong to more than one year ago. Also there were not taken with a high resolution camera but quality of some of them are still good in comparison with newly uploaded photos it is the reason that they could survive up to now yet. By the way I have never reduced the resolution of the photos by myself as some users doing. Actually in those times there was no one other photo so at least even photos  with low resolution were better than nothing. 

Your edition: during your previous edition you undid the section about: Capital of Iran, modification in references, sister city and the box at the end of the article.

As a final point I think that we are in the same boat and both of us are about making a good article for Tabriz so may be our contribution together helps to having a better article.-User talk:M_karzarj",0

"Help clarify an artice: John Stark 

I was looking for information on John Stark and came across a confusing section. In the part about his early life, there is a paragraph that reads:

On April 28, 1752, while on a hunting and trapping trip along the Baker River, a tributary of the Pemigewasset River, he was captured by Abenaki warriors and brought back to Canada but not before warning his brother William to paddle away in his canoe, though David Stinson was killed. While a prisoner of the Abenaki, he and his fellow prisoner Amos Eastman were made to run a gauntlet of warriors armed with sticks.

The problem is that there is no mention of who David Stinson is, only that he was killed. I see that an edit you made (10:57, 2006 January 25‎) removed some clarification on him, instead identifying Amos Eastman as the fellow prisoner. As you have better knowledge on the subject, can you please put back some info identifying him? (or possibly remove the unclear info??)

Everything was done to cover up the connection for obvious reasons since we were at war with Italy at the time. The best evidence I have is from my Aunt Victoria Sarfatti as related above. Also when I was in Brazil with Fred Alan Wolf in 1984 wined and dined by the wealthiest people in Brazil, an older woman came up to me and said, """"I knew Margherita Sarfatti."""" She simply assumed I was her blood relative from looking at me. I made no mention of the connection at that meeting. It was not relevant. In any case that is really not the point. The point is the artistic and occult connections as shown in my 1980 meeting with David Padwa - a very odd occult tale of high strangeness told in detail in """"Destiny Matrix"""" with a corroborating photograph. Padwa lives today in Santa Fe New Mexico and he will confirm the true story in my book.

 The Dellums mayoral campaign was criticized for holding expensive fundraising dinners and because Dellums would not disclose his plans for the city, or his positions on issues.  - please provide a reference for this; surely, per WP:BLP, you would never insert something like this without a source?

 Elise Ackerman, an Oakland resident who bought the domain recallmayordellums.com sent an open letter to Dellums that was covered in the local press, saying to Dellums, """"African Americans and Latinos live in fear in Oakland because of your lies. Middle-class residents working two jobs live in fear because of your lies. Nurses, teachers and social workers live in fear because of your lies."""" Near the end of the message, she continues """"You are not effective, you are not honest, you have no integrity and you should step aside."""" - what is your source for this?

 In 1972 John Lennon wrote the song Woman is the Nigger of the World. Asked for his reaction to the use of the word """"nigger"""" by a white singer in a pop song Dellums wrote """"If you define nigger as someone whose lifestyle is defined by others, whose opportunities are defined by others, whose role in society is defined by others, then good news - you don't have to be black to be a nigger in this society, most of the people in America are niggers!"""" Lennon was delighted with his reaction and proudly read the quote on the Dick Cavett Show prior to performing the controversial song with his wife at the time, Yoko Ono. - can you explain the removal of this material?

 Grenada and Cuba controversies, treason allegation - why did you add the bolded text to the header?

 Conservative journalist David Horowitz suggested Dellums' actions were treasonous. - source?

 Why did you change Dellums worked as a lobbyist for the government of Haiti in 2001–2002 to Dellums accepted $500,000 in payment for lobbying work for the government of the impoverished nation of Haiti in 2001–2002?  How is it acceptable, per NPOV to add the impoverished nation of?

 Pre Christmas Review 

Hi Spinning, 
I'm doing a quick review on your edits right now... One of the things that you need to remember is our primary purpose here is to build the encyclopedia.  Coaching is secondary as is working towards adminship.  I noticed that you've read a few of my recent essays on CSD, I know this because you've made edits to my essay on why I hate speedy deleters.  I appreciate the edits.  Another essay that I would suggest you take a look at is my essay on my coaching philosophy and what it means to be work with an adminly spirit.  One of the key things that I look at isn't """"Does the candidate have the right edit counts in various places"""" or """"Does the candidate know policy backwards and forwards, but rather do they have the spirit of an admin.""""  Do people respect the candidate and do they act as in a manner that instills confidence and respect from the community.  Do they embody what I think an admin encapsulates?  To me being an admin isn't about the buttons, one can (and should) be an admin before they ever submit themself to the community!

That being said, I encourage you to look at this edit.  I like the fact that you use your user space to keep notes and work on articles.  This shows a sign of somebody who has been burnt by CSD'ers ;-)  No, in reality, I think developing ideas and concepts in the user space should be encourage.  Is  a list of things that you'd like to work on?  If so, what have you succeeded in acomplishing in the past?  Eg, what isn't there that might have been there 2 months ago?

""""And a couple more texts are required if you study quantum theory related to those subjects"""" Quantum theory started by a German Max Planck, but nobody knew its real mathematical background therefore it remained just a semi-science, until a Hungarian János Neumann made it. Lot of famous scientist of the era tried to made the mathematical background of the Q.theory but its proved to difficult for them. Neumann redefinied the definitions, he pointed out serials of former serious errors. He made Q. theory to a calculable science which made it a practicable science for industry. He invented the famous game theory and designed the world-famous ENIAC digital computer too.(ENIAC, short for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer,[1][2] was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It was a Turing-complete, digital computer capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems.[3] ENIAC was designed to calculate artillery firing tables for the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, but its first use was in calculations for the hydrogen bomb. When ENIAC was announced in 1946 it was heralded in the press as a """"Giant Brain"""". It boasted speeds one thousand times faster than electro-mechanical machines, a leap in computing power that no single machine has since matched. This mathematical power, coupled with general-purpose programmability, excited scientists and industrialists.) Neumann was the main mathematican in Manhattan Project. Other famous Hungarian was Jenő Wigner often reffered as the father of quantum mechanics. Other famous Hungarian: Leó Szilárd his invention changed the basis of nuclear science:  he invented the nuclear chain reaction and invented the nuclear reactor (and he invented with Wigner the first nuclear power station) as well as the first Particle accelerator. Therefore the nuclear physics became a practicable/utilizable science for mankind. As the inventor nuclear chain reaction, he realised foremost the atomic-bomb, he made the basic """"Cutaway Drawing"""" of the first atomic bomb. He asked Albert Einstein to write letter to president Roosevelt for the realization of a concrete nuclear Bomb. In Manhattan project dosens of scientist and hundreds of engineers worked for the realization of Szilárd's idea: a working atomic bomb from 1939-1944. An other Hungarian Ede Teller invented the H-bomb. And it is just particle quantum / nuclear physics. It is just a branch of physics.  We had dosens of similar great scientists in other branchs of the physics and natural sciences.
The exaggeratedly anglocentric Rico have never heard about these scientists. The expert historians of natural sciences are always shocked about great number of Hungarian scientists, how is it possible for such a little country.

 Piano Sonata No. 10 (Mozart) 

Hello, you've recently added the following to this article:  """"In the recapitulation the main theme starts in C major, modulates to G major and then modulates back to the subdominant key of C major"""".  Isn't the piece in C major?  The subdominant would be F.  Am I confused?  Also note there is some discussion at Talk:Piano_Sonata_No._16_(Mozart) about how subdominant recaps were not that uncommon amongst lesser known composers of the day... it was something Haydn never did and Mozart did very rarely.

"Thanks 

Greetings Mikhailov, Thanks for the welcome and your generous suggestions! I particularly like the four waves and will incorporate that in my modus operandi. I wish I had more time to edit, although that is not my calling, yet I'd love to help. Here I am just trying to keep my two Cuba books (I'm the author) in the further reading sections... Yes, another self serving bastard. For me it is difficult to stay on top of this alone. I do have several questions that you certainly could answer, yet if you will is another matter entirely. 

1) When there is no further reading section, should I A) create one or B) add the information in the reference section (I feel that may be a faux pas)or C) do something else like ... run Forrest run? 
 
2) Unfortunately I have not had anyone write a bio for me... yet. I'm afraid I am responding at a poor time because while I usually dominate Google searches with my books, interviews, and my Blog at Sulekha, at the moment I am a distant second on the first page. Sadly, I share the name of Charles Spencer King with the inventor of the Range Rover.... This confuses many a seeker as you might imagine. Regrettably, Mr. King (the other) died in the last month, and that has thrown the proverbial monkey wrench into the rankings (Addendum: I assure you I am alive and well).

    I would love to at the very least get into the Disambiguation section, however I am afraid I would need a bio for that.... Am I correct? 

 3) For some reason my ISBN does not seem to work here despite the fact I am on everything from Amazon through the Library Thing....and everything between. Odd, yet I would be delighted if at the very least I could get this to go to either the individual page at Amazon or the title page ( this one:)    http://www.amazon.com/Charles-Spencer-King/e/B002ELIWKI/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1 

Thank you in advance for your valuable time and expertise. I look forward to our next adventure that undoubtedly is awaiting our attention.

 More on Second Amendment """"edit war"""" Kenosis and Salty Boartr seems to be the same person 

Evidence that Kenosis and SaltyBoatr are the same person - if so - this more then meets the requirements of a 3RR violation and editing under multile ID's is a violation in and of itself. Below is a message left for Kenosis left by myself and I find SaltyBoatr responding to it as if he is Kenosis. Currently Kenosis/SaltyBoatr has filled in the gap between my question to the Kenosis ID and the response by SaltyBoatr ID with intent to hide the connection.

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&diff;=321208025&oldid;=321206918

What is this source? Who wrote it? It looks like a hodgepodge of blurbs about antifederalists in PA pulled from somewhere, but I'd be interested to know by whom and from where this stuff was culled. As to the article text w.r.t. the Pennsylvania minority, presently it reads as follows:

""""Another non-military usage of the phrase is found in a one-man Pennsylvania """"minority report"""" published after the ratifying convention [cited to Uviller and Merkel who in turn cite to other RSs, with selected quotation from the """"minority report""""].""""

At least until this discrepancy is sorted out, I would advocate changing the text of that passage to something like:

"""" Another non-military usage of the phrase is found in a Pennsylvania anti-federalist """"minority report"""" published after the state's constitutional convention: [followed by selected quotation from the """"minority report""""]

Just to be cautious here, I'd recommend a citation to Uviller and Merkel, and another WP:RS representative of the position that the minority consisted of, what was it?, twenty-something participants/signers, whether they were in fact part of the convention or not. ... Kenosis (talk)

 Regarding your edits to Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey 

I have reverted your edits to these two articles. Please review WP:V to learn about appropriate, reliable sources for the information you keep adding, and also visit WP:LIBEL and WP:BLP to learn about appropriate information in biographical articles of living people. Insinuating that these two individuals are having an affair or are anything other than faithful to their respective significant others is libelous, and against Wikipedia policy. You have not provided a reliable source to support the POV suggested by your edits. WP:NPOV will help you learn about Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.

The quotes you have added are taken out of contexttheir mentions of a """"crush"""" on each other were done in a joking manner, and another cast member followed their comments by saying she had a crush on both of thembut that's not grounds for speculating that the cast member in question is having an affair with both of them, and if I said or insinuated that she were, that would be libel. These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other, and frankly, good public relations by supporting their on-screen chemistry and by extension, that of the fictional characters they play. Many other cast members have complimented their co-stars, including PD and EP, but no reliable source has, to my knowledge, ever published information that these two (or any other cast members) were anything other than co-stars who happen to be friends. On the contrary, both speak frequently of their significant others in high esteem (in print and on camera), and speak well of each other's partners. There's also a question of whether such compliments are even relevant in the grand scheme of the article, but that's a moot point because your edits are unsourced, and against the WP:LIBEL policy.  If you have a reliable source for your edits, in accord with WP:Verifiability, then it's a different story, but as it is, your edits are potentially libelous and not in accord with Wikipedia editing policy.

Answer from  Thanks a lot for taking the time to explain your position, it is really helpful. Although I have quite a different reading of the issue, I hope that comparing our POVs will result in a more neutral article. Also, when referring to """"rumors and gossip"""" it wasn't your edits I had in mind, so please don't take that as an offense.

However, I globally disagree with your approach to the subject matter. You are magnifying the importance of the mailing-list activity, while considering NNs music and software art as """"a backseat"""". This personal judgement is contradicted by facts: Her software has received international awards. Her websites have been featured in notable design publications (72-dpi, Die Gestalten Verlag). Her software and music have met strong response from the academic field, represented by major institutions such as IRCAM or STEIM. I doubt that all this was the sole result of NNs mailing-list behaviour.

« There seems to be a strange disconnection between the way that people who were exposed to and victimised on a daily basis for years and the way that some media theorists evaluate this project »

This might be true, and doesn't come as a surprise, as critical reception of a cultural artifact often differs from the reaction of its contemporaries. You could say as well: «There seems to be a strange disconnection between the way that the people who were exposed to Cubist painting at the 1913 Armory Show Exhibition and the way that some art historians evaluate this exhibition.» Generally, encyclopedies tend to give more weight to the latter. ;)

Talking about media theorist, it's interesting to note that even Inke Arns, who certainly """"was exposed to and victimised on a daily basis for years"""" (since she was administrating the Syndicate mailing-list) still aknowledges the artistic value of NNs textual output, describing it as a """"contemporary form of mail art"""" .

« Hardly anyone has actually heard the pieces currently listed in the music section. »

What is your point? For sure this is not mainstream music. However, NNs sound works have been performed at some of the major media art festivals (Transmediale, Ars Electronica). If you don't consider those festivals noteworthy, then please refrain from editing articles about electronic artists.

Adios.   """,0

 Inverted Ad Hominen is non-notable 

When I correct the ad hominem article later, I'm zapping the 'inverted ad hominem' term.  It is completely non-notable (86 hits in google) and was invented and inserted into the article by User:Layman.  Heck, the article itself even attributes it to Layman, a random web user, as having said it.

Original edit inserting it under an ip address
Edit by User:Layman the same day

There's a reason why the term wasn't invented by logicians too, because """"inverted ad hominem"""" is still ad hominem.  There's no """"inverse"""" about it.  The so-called """"inverse ad hominem"""" is just a case of ad hominem where someone says """"my qualifications are better than yours"""" instead of directly saying """"your qualifications suck.""""

Again your anger and personal hatred over the internet is amusing and saddening all at once.  I'm sorry you take life far too seriously.  And I made note of the Scherer connection simply because you acted out like a child and naturally tried to tell me your friend was far more knowledgeable than I in the field of professional wrestling. Now that may be the case but the manner in which you went about it was not very likable. I don't know you personally so I will just assume you needed a nap and are a far better person than you have shown to me.

Basic concept of GPS
A GPS receiver calculates its position by precisely timing the signals sent by GPS satellites high above the Earth. Each satellite continually transmits messages that include
 the time the message was transmitted
 satellite position at time of message transmission
The receiver uses the messages it receives to determine the transit time of each message and computes the distance to each satellite using the speed of light.  Each of these distances and satellites' locations define a sphere.  The receiver is on the surface of each of these spheres when the distances and the satellites' locations are correct. These distances and satellites' locations are used to compute the location of the receiver using the navigation equations. This location is then displayed, perhaps with a moving map display or latitude and longitude; elevation or altitude information may be included. Many GPS units show derived information such as direction and speed, calculated from position changes.

In typical GPS operation, four or more satellites must be visible to obtain an accurate result.  Four sphere surfaces typically do not intersect.  Because of this, it can be said with confidence that when the navigation equations are solved to find an intersection, this solution gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a very large, expensive, and power hungry clock.  The very accurately computed time is used only for display or not at all in many GPS applications, which use only the location. A number of applications for GPS do make use of this cheap and highly accurate timing.  These include time transfer, traffic signal timing, and synchronization of cell phone base stations.

Although four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known altitude, dead reckoning, inertial navigation, or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.

"I always thought that the shunt diodes were needed. The conceptual model that one diode is on during each half cycle, shorting out the corresponding cap isn't quite right.  What really happens is that the node between the two caps gets charged up (or down, depending on whether the + or - ends are connected together) and stays charged, so that both caps are biased with sufficient dc that their voltage never goes negative.  The reliable source we have cited there (app note from a cap manufacturer) says that you don't really need the diodes, because the caps will act as diodes and conduct in the reverse direction to accomplish that effect.  I would think it would be more reliable to have that reversed current flow through a diode, but given that it's only a transient phenomenon as the cap charges up I can see that in some applications it could be acceptable to do it without the diodes.",0

Somehow you and I seem to have developed an unproductive relationship.

"Clearly you *haven't* read WP:NPA, otherwise you wouldn't have written this. It is difficult to understand why someone interested in Jeremy Sinden should instead rush across to his far less well-known brother's article and immediately feel the need to remove tags? The tags remain because the article is in severe need of a rewrite, not least because one of the main contributors has claimed to be a 'good friend' and a 'fan' of Marc Sinden from the age of 12(!), when they met on the set of the 'Hey Jude' video recording(!). Unfortunately this is the very same editor that was caught dragging along a bucket-load of socks to try and support various POV positions and outright puffery of Marc Sinden and Sinden-related articles. Amazingly enough, this editor and their socks have added Marc Sinden's name to around 130 articles on Wikipedia. 130! For someone who's less notable than my goldfish!
It's certainly true that the Jeremy Sinden article might lead one here, because of course there are no less than *three* mentions/links to Marcus' page from there - sadly there is not one single link from Marcus' back to Jeremy's, indeed his name has been expunged completely from the Marc Sinden article. It seems more than odd that you should seem so determined to enter an edit war in only your first day as an editor, instead of fixing the egregious error that would strike any true contemporary of Jeremy's immediately! May I therefore suggest you take three actions? 
1. Go read WP:NPA yet again, just in case it hasn't impinged. 
2. Add links and content to the Marc Sinden article that reflect and respect the memory of your school chum Jeremy Sinden, because in all the puffery of Marc, poor Jeremy seems to have been wholly ignored. 
3. Expand the content of the Jeremy Sinden article such that it *at least* matches the Marc Sinden article, because it is a disgrace that the puffed-up Marc Sinden article is perhaps ten times the size of the Jeremy Sinden article, when Jeremy was perhaps ten times more notable - go and put this right. 
Finally, as an observation; as a contemporary of Jeremy you would be around 60 years old - it is both surprising and disappointing that with such advanced age has not come the sense of insouciance, and the wisdom of seniors, that one might normally expect. May I suggest that you therefore refrain from further conflict and personal attacks, and put your editing efforts to work exclusively on the person you *do* know about? Thanks.",0

 I also agree with you that it's best to use modern sources.

 Thank you! 

Dear Mr. Petiatil,

Thank so much for the wonderful welcome note. That was very nice and considerate of you. I really appretiate it.

Unfortunately, I am having a lot of trouble with some WikiUsers who are lobbying against be and reverting all my edits, comments, posts, or even welcome messages to other users. I will need your support if they do it again. Please keep in touch. Once again, thank you. Also I would like to ask you an honest question; don't you ever notice all the lobbying going on? I mean, I for one have noticed that whenever I write a comment or make a constructive edit, a WikiUser usually adhering to the Bahai faith comes up to me and revert or rebukes everything and anything I write. Please respond on my page, not here, thanks.

BTW, I used to be a WikiVandal, did you know that? Well, I've changed now, but there's a lot of material out there about me. Go ahead, look me up or ask your fellow WikiAdmins/WikiBosses about me...I'm sure they'll have a lot to say ;)

"""Pete, it is justified scholastically because mainstream scholars have never accused Anthroposophy of being founded on rascist principles. Mainstream encyclopedias never accuse Steiner or Anthroposophy of rascism. Here's what Wikipedia has to say about it:
""""In other words, views held only by a tiny minority of people should not be represented as though they are significant minority views, and perhaps should not be represented at all.

In particular, to elaborate on the last comment above, if you are able to prove something that nobody currently believes, Wikipedia is not the place to premiere such a proof. Once a proof has been presented and discussed elsewhere, however, it may be referenced.""""

This is why I believe that the section on racism should not be a section. A mere couple of sentences is, in my opinion, too much, but I would be willing to compromise with that. Because the presence of race as a section on Steiner's page gives the article undue weight.

 List of products in The Simpsons 

Hello George. I see you've been actively making additions to List of products in The Simpsons. It is good that you're enthusiastic about the list. However, I would like to suggest that you might be going a bit overboard. There are literally thousands of products and stores in The Simpsons that are seeing in single shots as throwaway jokes, etc. If one were to list them all, the list would be fairly bulky and useless (this has happened on other Simpsons lists already and have had to be cut back). I'd like to suggest the following guidelines:
Stores aren't products, so I would suggest you not list stores such as """"Herman's Military Antiques"""".
Bulk groups of products like the """"many antiques at Herman's Military Antiques"""".
Do not include real-world products like """"English Muffins"""". If you do that, it's pointless. Everything in the house is a product. TVs, couches, drapes, carpet, etc. Besides which, I would argue that noone in the world would ever need to look up whether English muffins are sold on the Simpsons. Real world products are assumed to exist on the show since it is rarely shown otherwise.
The list should really be for Simpsons-invented brand-names or invented products.

The next issue is subjective, but I believe crucial to keeping the list from spiraling out of control:
Products on the list should only be included if they are used more than once on the show. Throwaway jokes like Itchy & Scratchy Land Personalised License Plates are basically just describing a joke on the show. The list is really designed more for things like Laramie cigarettes, squishys and things that make up the Simpsons lore than a list of throwaway jokes. That doesn't mean some of your edits aren't perfect for the list; I believe you added """"Radioactive Man Comics"""", """"The Springfield Shopper"""" and """"Li'l Bastard Kits"""". These are great ones, but things like """"Disemboweller IV"""" needn't be included.

I am going to be deleting some of the ones that fall into the bullet point list above (real-world items and bulk groups) but I'm not going to immediately delete single-appearance items, but I suggest you join a discussion at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject The Simpsons#List of products in The Simpsons.

Fyunclick vs. Outside Sources

Wikipedia is an """"encyclopedia"""" and as such, should reflect outside sources, not one's own POV. Not only that, Wikipolicy calls for PLURALISM which requires the articles to reflect major points of view, not just one. However, in this case probably the majority, if not a plurality, of sources reflect my POV. For example:

http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/history?type=men

When ESPN lists the winners of Grand slams, they don't worry about issues such as Open era/pre-Open era, challenge round, or pre-1925 French. Not only that, but research has shown that the French was actually MORE open to outside competition than the US Open and Wimbledon were in their early stages. 20:15, 5""",0

Oppose - The current title is overwhelmingly preferred by the policy of using the most common name, and the manual of style specifically encourages editor discretion. The MOS is great for our writing style and when the official or common name might be unknown, but to argue that it should be used to take an official name with a specifically chosen title that is used by the absolutely overwhelming majority of reliable sources, including books, newspapers, and websites, as well as is the generally common name is fairly absurd. Our title guidelines and policies are unfortunately somewhat murky. But, what it comes down to can be gleaned from Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization), which states that """"an adherence to conventions widely used in the genre are critically important to credibility"""". If Billboard is using a style, and Rolling Stone or the New York Times or Spin or just the bulk of reliable sourcing in general largely use the official title, is it really common sense for us to be saying we shouldn't be following the sources here in order to somehow adhere to conventions and gain credibility? Wikipedia is a unique construct in that our work is so clearly tied and based off of reliable sourcing about the subject  making us stand out and go against the grain here just doesn't make much sense.There's also just the general notion (which certainly should not be the deciding factor in finding consensus) that certain lowercase words just look weird in titles. Perhaps this may give some indication as to why """"like"""" and other 3 or more letter words are very often capitalized in composition titles but words like """"a"""", """"to"""", or """"and"""" often aren't.

James Pope Hennessy, Queen Mary's official biographer, spoke to many people then still living who actually knew Prince Eddy (see his posthumously published book of interviews), so his statement that Eddy's private life was 'dissipated' must be taken as gospel (as too must his statements with regard to Eddy's intellectual slowness). Hennessy knew what he was writing about, and indeed, died at the hands of rough trade. His close friend James Lees Milne, who was bisexual, and with whom one can presume he would have shared the more unpublishable results of his findings, wrote the first frank biography of Lord Esher, the grey eminence of the Edwardian royal court who was pederastic, and who kept a folder of letters from parties about the scandal.

 List of USN ships 

Hello, I've been doing some updating and correcting on the article List of current ships of the United States Navy. I see that you contributed a great deal to article previously. At one point, with about a half dozen edits, you added 24 ships to the section """"Ready Reserve Force ships"""". You listed them all as belonging to the Cape Ducato class, however that is a class of only 5 ships. I'm wondering if you had other info that stated these other 19 ships were considered a part of that class? If not, then if you have some free time, would mind stopping by the article and help correct this? From what I've (briefly) read, most of these ships are from various sources, builders and countires. Some are listed as """"Type C7 ships"""", while others don't have any such designation. Anyway, any help help you could provide would be appreciated. -  '''' """,0

Chile

Cielo Estrellado please please do not support Al Andalus on this. The word Mestizo is never used in the hispanic world to describe people who are predominantly European as is the case for most Chileans. 

Firstly, as you may know, in Latin America it is used for those who are predominantly amerindian in their ancestry. (It would apply in Mexico and Central America). 
Secondly, there is no defined ethnic group in Chile which can be defined as mestizo, there are just people with more or less Indian bood, Spanish origin being nearly always the larger part of the ancestry. There is no sense of common belonging shared exclusively by people with amerindian ancestry which excludes people who dont have this ancestry. This is a vital characteristic of an ethnic group.
The word mestizo is pejorative in our language and should be used as little as possible. Ill give you an example. When the movie """"Harry Potter and the half-blood prince"""" came out in the Spanish speaking world, it was translated into Harry Potter and the Prince, because of the negative connotations that the word mestizo implied.
Finally, in our cultural community, Latinness, Spanishness (or if you want to use racial terms """"whiteness"""") is an expansive concept which does not exclude people placind then in a different ethnic group on the basis of their blood being """"tainted"""" as happens in the Anglo Saxon world. Although, I agree that that in certain countries where racial divisions have been stronger due to a much larger Amerindian community, (such as Peru or Guatemala) leading to implications regarding identity and ethnicity..

Anyways I hope you understand my position and we can establish some dialogue on this issue which transcends the narrow (and in my opinion racist) perspective of Genetic studies.
I also hope you are not a sock puppet of user: al andalus! This would make things much harder:-)

You are mistaken. The Johnson School is no different than the departments in the Arts College or the Engineering School. PhD students enroll in the Graduate School and pick a """"field,"""" which roughly correspond to the various academic departments (e.g., Chemistry, Management, Mechanical Engineering.)  The Johnson School is not acredited to grant PhD degrees.

For most of the school existence, these were perhaps its most distinguished programs.  The idea of reassigning notable alumni from the school where they graduated to a different school based on subsequent reorganizations is troubling.  I think we should just have  the list of notable alumni in the main Cornell Univrersity article and the List of Cornell University people.  In some cases, there is no modern equivalent to the program which granted a particular degree and in other cases we may not know the school.  Does it matter that Ed Marinaro was a Hotel School graduate when he is notable as a football player and actor and never entered the hotel industry?

Writing new guidelines that general folks understand
18-July-2009: These recent events have just re-confirmed what I've been telling people for years: Wikipedia runs on mobocracy, despite other people claiming (for years), """"No, no, WP decisions are made per logical reasoning, in accordance with written policies"""". Well, actually, that's not how decisions have been made, for several years, as of July 2009. I'm not quite sure what the problem is with the wiki-masses, in this attitude, that """"truth"""" is a popularity contest. There can't be a massive, multi-year wiki-cabal, so I suspect these mob-judgments are simply what happens when ordinary folk are challenged to think.Many school teachers have concluded that thinking must be taught to most people. In America, people are not allowed, typically, to become official judges without some type of formal judicial education, where they must pass standards of clear thinking. Not just anyone can sit on the bench, and start making decisions that affect thousands of other people.We have to write reality-based guidelines, with totally obvious examples, so that anyone could understand them. The wiki-masses don't follow concepts such as """"significant coverage"""" in reliable sources: I must conclude the current WP policies are like wiki-calculus for the masses. They cannot calculate wiki-integrals of the policies to reach a logical conclusion. Hence, the current policies are a failure for coordinating general editors.So, these bogus AfD discussions are such a waste of time, re-hashing misunderstandings as confirmed by popularity votes. We have to write policy essays to explain actual examples to be followed: I don't think there's any other hope. Most people just don't understand the current policy points, no matter how carefully that text is quoted in discussions. They see """"NOTINHERITED"""" and that's the extend of their reading: 2 words is a policy to them. Perhaps they started to read the policy text (yawn) and re-zoned to the 2 words, period.

To be readable, we must list obvious examples, such as the one-event R.M.S. Titanic generating """"50"""" notables. Plus, those examples must be listed in easy-to-read essays (no consensus required), so when we put """"WP:BIGEVENT"""" they know that, historically, big single events have generated numerous notables (e.g.: Lee Harvey Oswald & Jack Ruby in JFK assassination; Charles Manson & Manson family in Sharon Tate/etc. murders). It's the only way to defeat the notion that exceptions, to the intricate policies, must be determined by intense debates of popularity votes. No, instead, big-event notability can be explained by a simple essay of examples. We need those policy essays to shift the mass voting. -  """,0

"""==  Inclusion of school type, gender, and religious information for HNMCS ==

There have been repeated deletions by Mikeycanuck (aka 99.254.17.230) which remove pertinent information about Holy Name of Mary College School (HNMCS) from this article. The two schools are brother and sister schools, and as per the History section in the HNMCS article, """"The Felician Sisters and St. Michael's College School co-founded the independent Holy Name of Mary College School"""". As such, it is appropriate to contain some basic information about HNMCS in this article and in the same way, to include some basic information about SMCS in the Holy Name of Mary College School article. The inclusion of the school type (independent), gender (all-girls), and religious information (Catholic) of Holy Name of Mary College School in this article, is meant to illustrate the parallels to the school type (private), gender (all-boys), and religious information (Catholic) of St. Michael's College School.174.89.27.124  

I don't agree that it is relevant information to give these details about Holy Name on the SMCS wiki. People reading the SMCS page quickly learn that Holy Name of Mary is the official sister school, and that it must be an all-girls school. That Holy Name is Catholic or private is also irrelavant in the SMCS article. If a reader interested in information on Holy Name wants to learn about it, he/she can go to the Holy Name wiki. I believe it should be removed as not necessary in an article about SMCS (and the same for St. Mike's info on the HNMCS wiki).  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.254.17.230   

The point of including this basic information is to show how Holy Name of Mary College School and St. Michael's College School are connected by virtue of their school type, single-gender, and religious affiliation. The inclusion of this basic information is included to illustrate the parallels between the two schools.  These parallels are part of the reason they are brother and sister schools, and therefore this information is relevant and should be included in the article. 174.89.27.124  

They are two separate institutions. If you want to write a paragraph describing the schools' connections, that can be done in sub-article within the main article. Readers can go to the other school's wiki for more detailed information and don't need to see it in the introduction, where it appears as self-serving PR. See Basic Navigation in Wikipedia  """"Wikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced. When highlighted text like this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information elsewhere. Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead. The reader is always one click away from more information on any point that has a link attached.""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About  

So if understand correctly, the inclusion of a section on each wiki describing the links between the schools is an acceptable compromise in your view? 174.89.27.124  

I only ask Mikeycanuck for clarification because it goes against his reasoning for removing the very basic information previously included in the introduction that drew the parallels between the two schools. In removing that content, Mikeycanuck commented (see View History), """"Removed superfluous information on Holy Name. Should be in HNM's wiki.""""  So Mikeycanuck, you are adverse to very basic information included in the introduction, but you would welcome an entire paragraph within the article?  I want to ensure we have reached agreement before I go ahead and add that paragraph. 174.89.27.124  

The detailed information does not belong in the introduction, which should always be concise and relevant. In a later section, a description of the school's links is acceptable, if it is relevant. If SMCS chose Holy Name as its """"sister school"""" for certain reasons, and they are verifiable, I would not object. I am never opposed to compromise and reasonable discussion and discourse.

 Edit summary 

When editing an article on Wikipedia there is a small field labelled """"Edit summary"""" under the main edit-box. It looks like this:

The text written here will appear on the Recent changes page, in the page revision history, on the diff page, and in the watchlists of users who are watching that article. See m:Help:Edit summary for full information on this feature.

When you leave the edit summary blank, some of your edits could be mistaken for vandalism and may be reverted, so please always briefly summarize your edits, especially when you are making subtle but important changes, like changing dates or numbers. Thank you.  

I do, when I'm doing anything more than grammar. The only exception to this would be on Clan Fraser of Lovat, of which I'm the only editor at present, and I didn't think to add edit summaries. Otherwise, I believe that I have done so. If you have any particular situations in which I have failed to do so, I'd be happy to explain myself; I'd much appreciate it.  
See it for yourself: Green bars are for edit summaries, red bars are for edits with no summaries.  
That's quite a nifty tool there. I'm fully aware of edit summaries. I don't provide edit summaries on my own talk page, or my User Page. I also don't usually provide them on other users' talk pages. In earlier editing, I didn't take the summary seriously; if you're referring to anything from several months ago or more, I do apologize. Like I said: if you have any particular situations where you believe I missed one, please bring them up to me. I would sincerely like to know. Otherwise, I don't see what you're trying to accomplish here.  
I think the link speaks for itself.  As for what I'm trying to accomplish, I think my original comment explained just that.  
If you were trying to just helpfully remind me, I thank you, though I don't think it was needed. I saw the page; it didn't say anything to me, except that I finally know my edit count. If you really want to get a point across to me, I suggest you do so blatantly. If your original comment explained your motives, then we are done here.  

 Your """"nonsense"""" page 

If you are interested in archiving your old talk, you may want to review Wikipedia:How to archive a talk page.  Accusing other editors of """"defacing"""" your talk page for politely reminding you of Wikipedia policies against personal attacks does not demonstrate good faith on your part, and will only make you look bad.  I suggest you move the archive to a more appropriate name like User talk:Canaen/archive1.  Furthermore, making negative comments about discussion by other editors, and claiming that their edits """"are not worth reading"""" shows that you aren't interested in abiding by  WP:NPA, WP:CIV, nor WP:EQ.  If you want to improve your working relationship with other editors, it might help to avoid incivility.  
I'm not interested in archiving my old talk as of yet, but thank you for the suggestion. I use """"nonsense"""" in a lot of ways other people do not, because I find a lot of other words to be boring at present. Likewise,  instead of """"cool,"""" or """"awesome,"""" or """"that's interesting,"""" I'm currently in the habit of referring to things as """"nifty."""" It's something I do. I know how to archive a talk page, I've done it before. I still do not consider suggesting ignorance to be a personal attack, because I've grown up in a rather intellectual atmosphere. I'm not going to change just because a few people are offended at my words. I thought that this was resolved by now. I have quite decent relationships with other working editors; it seems that a particular user and myself simply do not get along. It is regretful, but something which seems to be. If someone takes offence to my creation of a Nonsense page, they can bring it up to me personally, as you",0

The newest trick in this discussion is that Septentrionalis has shifted from saying speak German to saying read German. (If you think these are synonymous in Septentrionalis's mind, read on.)

Is it not possible to contemplate the possibility that great many of the readers of this article can understand the sentence The city of Meißen grew out of the early Slavic settlement of Misni and was founded as a German town by King Henry the Fowler in 929. but they would have a great difficulty in understanding Meißen ist die Kreisstadt des gleichnamigen Landkreises im Freistaat Sachsen und hat knapp 30.000 Einwohner.

On March 14, 2011, one or more members of the decentralized collective Anonymous began releasing emails it said were obtained from Bank of America.

The source, identified publicly as Brian Penny, is a former LPI Specialist from Balboa Insurance, a firm which used to be owned by the bank, but was sold to Australian Reinsurance Company QBE, who subsequently branded the company QBE First in 2011  in order for the bank to obtain the funds necessary to pay back their Federal loans.

Personally, I think it is an important enough point to make in the first paragraph, although if Tim and others prefer moving it to the fourth paragraph I won't object.  However, I have to say I do not read the first paragraph the same way Graft does, I see no non-sequitor.  The subject of the first sentence is not inherited traits (that is in the predicate) and the subject of the second sentence is not fact versus theory (which again is in the predicate.  The subject of the first sentence is """"evolution"""" and the predicate provides a definition.  The subject of the second sentence is evolutionary biology - the field of academe that makes the study of evolution its object, and the source of just about all the contents of the article.  The third sentence goes on to tell us about what we learn from evolutionary biology.  This progression (define a subject, explain who studies/has expertise in it, then elaborate on this field of study) makes perfect sense to me. I don't mean to prolong any argument with Graft, but I just don't see this degrading the quality of the article or its educational value to a general readership.    |  Talk 16:30""",0

 Packerfansam 

Better to continue the discussion here, I think.

The ANI, in which we both participated, was closed out in June or so with no action, based on her assurances that she understood the nature of the problems she'd occasioned, and a promise to try to stop.  You'll recall that she had been removing references from articles to non-Christian religions and thought, sexual orientation, and sex generally, among other things; and while I was the one to raise this initially at ANI, it is certainly fair to say that I was not the only one to be troubled by these edits.

As the matter wrapped up, I was skeptical that she appreciated the problem (she described it along the lines of """"offending one or two users"""") or that she'd actually quit the problematic editing, but after being characterized as """"overzealous"""" on the point, I withdrew.

She has slowed, but certainly not quit, her POV editing.  A partial list of such edits since then includes:

July 9
At Christianity, without explanation, she recast the “Criticism and apologetics” section as “Arguments and apologetics”, and removed sourced critical commentary by Nietzsche, Bertrand Russell and current Jewish and Muslim theologians, as well as a (sourced) observation by an atheist that some Bible stories may be based on myth.

July 30
At Trois-Rivières, removed without explanation the identification of a (Canadian) Liberal Party politician as “liberal”, as well as a reference to another person’s being the first Jew elected to public office in the British Empire

August 15
She erased, without comment, mention of Hugh Hefner’s attendance at the Art Institute of Chicago.

August 18
She removed proper and wikilinked mention of a notable alum who is best known (and described as) an LGBT activist.

October 15
At Ted Turner, she removed a reliably-sourced quote from Turner declaring himself to be agnostic, claiming it was “contradicted” by info elsewhere in article, when the excised information was more recent than the “contradictory” text and, indeed, nicely illustrated the point (in the source itself), which is that Turner has waffled on the issue over the years.

Here too I am not the only editor to remain concerned - see this Talk page entry from September.

I agree that the """"party school"""" edit to the University of Wisconsin is, in the larger picture, kind of a silly thing; but between her registered account and the IP she sometimes edits from, she has made the same edit at least four times now - see May 15, June 13, October 3 in addition to today's.  And to be clear, she's not removing the """"party school"""" material but just the (perfectly good) citation to Playboy.  Indeed in her October 3 entry, she updated the """"party school"""" rankings to 2015 and went out and found a different source to insert in Playboy's stead.

So I take your point, that maybe this particular edit is a trivial thing to template her on; but she has continued her practice (albeit slowed) of idiosyncratic, unexplained or deceptively described removal of content for reasons that can only be explained as in furtherance of a personal point of view.  I don't think that such editing should pass without at least occasional comment, and that's what I did.    """,0

You can see what he did here. In the 'History' section, he replaced an entirely duplicated section, duplicating the content immediately above it. He called it an """"Unexplained removal of content"""". No content had been removed, it had only been paragraphed ... which he then duplication. 

He was obviously in the wrong. He obviously paid no attention to the content. 

Then he left the erroneous and damaging bad mark which I have asked him politely to apologise, and remove and erase it.

It strikes me it would take a lot less effort just to do so than all this running around.

It is not a """"content issue"""", it was bullying.

Obviously, regional languages exist there too, but they exist in Italy, Germany and France (actually Spain is far more homogeneous than those countries, linguistically speaking) as well, and that map simply misleads the reader. It makes you think that Spain has four equally spoken languages, whereas France, for example, only has one. That's not the case, both countries have their national language (Spanish and French, respectively) and their regional languages (Catalan, Occitan, Breton, Basque, etc.).

I have supplied two reliable sources in English, but the summaries I provided of those have been altered in a manner that deprives the reader of important information, so there is a need to discuss that. 
Further, the quote, """"it had not interfered with any online product evaluation report and had stopped online marketing campaigns involving posting or responding to messages in online forums"""" is not a quote from Samsung but a quote from the source indirectly reciting what Samsung said on its Facebook page without quoting Samsung.

How is Marxism considered to be at odds with Darwinism? In some Fascistic sense maybe? Marxism is supposed to be about an economic-social science; Darwin about biological science. Marxist teleology is as much political stance as it is analytic, if it even is analytic at all. In fact Marx's precise invocation of Hegel was in order to expunge the latter's idealist teleology and his focus on 'identity' (hence Marx's book 'the Poverty of Philosophy), and then to take synthetic (dialectical) method and apply it to material history. This current article is not only incomplete and limited in its discussion of teleology, but misleading about other topics as well.

Nlu: I've made edits to the alkyl nitrites/poppers page that you have called 'vandalism'.  However, each of those edits is based on sound evidence.

I would appreciate it if you would explain why you consider the subject edits to be 'vandalism', so that I may understand where you're coming from.

Oops, I think I'm seeing the issue and it is indeed my error.  Somehow I missed that the epidemiology section had a second section regarding comorbidity in it.

I would argue however that """"incidence"""", which relates to new appearances of DID in the community at large, isn't a good subheading because the section includes a discussion of both incidence and prevalence.  I suggest using a subheading with both (==Incidence and prevalence==) though another option is simply leaving it as epidemiology.  The WP:MEDMOS#Diseases or disorders or syndromes doesn't give much guiance here bar noting that ==Epidemiology== should include incidence and prevalence information; no mention of subsections.  Usually you leave it as a single larger section until it gets sufficiently lengthy that it makes sense to split them out (which is itself dependent on the sources).  I've replaced the section heading (but both I and P).  The section overall needs fleshing out with more sources, which I think are unfortunately lacking.  Searching on pubmed for DID and both incidence and prevalence turns up no articles specifically focussed on either topic.   (t) (c) Wikipedia's rules:simple/complex

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,1

Hi,

I would have preferred to have sent this to you as a private e-mail - but it seems you do accept e-mails. So, I have to ignore my need to be well mannered and respond to you publicly.

I must say that I am rather disappointed that an editor with your expertise would be so rude to a newcomer - totally disregarding the Wikipedia rules of 'Do not Bite the newcomer'. No one likes spammers including me - but surely you should check out your facts before accusing people. And you should also give them the chance to read their first mail and figure out how to navigate this system before threatening them.

I have deleted the remaining links and will leave the hole in the wikipedia information untouched. (I did not notice all the other external links being discussed in the article talk pages. It would also be a huge time consuming exercise for the editors and myselfto do that for nearly 36 species and more on an on-going basis.)

It seems Wikipedia has still a long way to go in making genuine contributors welcome. I hope other users are treated with more politeness and consideration in the future.

Yes. I wasn't denying that that was a consequence, but I just think to mention that but not the occupation is a major oversight. I don't think it's really arguable that the most long-lasting and significant consequence has been the illegal occupation, which continues to this day. That has been the source of conflict for over 40 years, with incalculable repercussions. I suggest adding after the above sentence:

 """"Another lasting consequence of the war that has had enormous repercussions and which helped establish the Six Day War as a watershed event in the Middle East was the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, which continues to this day.""""

That's perhaps not as brief as you were looking for, but I think this is crucial and its importance cannot be overstated. It deserves at least one sentence in the lede. I suggest concluding the lede with this. I've worded it in a way that won't be controversial, or require sourcing.   """,0

Harassment by Appletrees
 declared in 15 April 2008. 
You regret? www That's a good one. You visit here with the ID as I'm getting to almost forget this matter. Your appearance always draw my attention back to the ancient history of Japan. Yeah, I'm studying it hard. I have to take a nap, so see yeah soooooooooon

And, this Korean is repeating harassment to the ancient history of Japan.

1. """"百濟國主照古王 以牡馬壹疋 牝馬壹疋 付阿知吉師以貢上"""" 
The document of this China was rewritten to an opposite meaning by . 

The meaning of """"貢上"""" is """"dedicated"""".However, he rewrote """"dedicated"""" in """"granted"""". 
The meaning of """"granted"""" is """"下賜"""".

 did a similarly wrong translation, and ruined Imperial House of Japan. 
 said. the 30th Japanese emperor Bidatsu was also a Korean. The section has many potential to be expanded indeed, so what is your rationale?

He translated """"大原真人 出自謚敏達孫百済王也"""". (Quotation 新撰姓氏録) into """"大原真人 is Korean emperor(百済王) Bidatsu(敏達)'s grandchild"""". Of course, Appletrees's translation is completely wrong. A correct translation is """"大原真人 is a descendant of the grandchild """"百済王"""" of emperor Bidatsu(敏達)"""". 

 2. Korean civilization 
""""The Encyclopedia of World History: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern"""" P56  is being written. 
Via these Korean contacts, Japan opened her doors to continental culture and Chinese civilization. This also enabled direct contacts with China. 

And, """"JapaneseHistory.info""""  is being written. 
Chinese and Korean immigrants played an important role in introducing Chinese civilization to early Japan.

Though a Korean civilization was not written at all, He rewrote, """"A Korean civilization introduced the culture to Japan"""". 

 often misinterprets the source. 
For instance Shakuhachi 

""""Diplomatic and cultural exchanges between Chinese continent and Japan being common, we can think that this flute was introduced in Japan with other musical instruments that were intended to give entertainments at the court (Gagaku; court music).""""

This source is not writing Korea at all. However, he rewrote it. 
""""The bamboo flute first came to Japan from China via Korea. The shakuhachi proper, however, is quite distinct from its Chinese and Korean ancestors, the result of centuries of isolated evolution in Japan.

 CNN Article - Got some citations for you. Please Help Me with the Unreliably Sourced Statement 

Hi. I saw your comments on the CNN talk page in which you claimed - in response to another user's claims that CNN had a liberal bias - """"Please add citations to back your claims. Avoid using weasel words when making claims."""" Well, here are some peer-reviewed, scholarly articles to back that claim:
>Jeffrey N. Weatherly, et al, “Perceptions of Political Bias in the Headlines of Two Major News Organizations,” Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics (2007) (12), 91 at p. 97 (finding that “Overall, participants . . . rated the headlines from CNN as significantly more liberal than those from FOX News. . . . CNN tilted more to the left than did FOX News. The conclusion that CNN’s headlines were perceived as more liberal than FOX News’, rather than FOX News’ headlines’ being perceived as more conservative than CNN’s, is supported by the finding that overall, the headlines from FOX News were rated slightly on the liberal side of neutral. If FOX News’ headlines had been perceived as biased toward the conservative viewpoint, then the overall ratings should have exceeded 50 percent.”)
>Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, Harvard University, & Project for Excellence in Journalism, “The Invisible Primary – Invisible No Longer: A First Look at Coverage of the 2008 Presidential Campaign,” p. 32  (noting that “The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates—by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral.”)
Please note that at the beginning of the CNN article (fourth paragraph down), the following statement appears: """"Among the general public, CNN has a more centrist perception.” The source for this proposition is FAIR, FAIR being a “progressive media criticism organization” whose “target invariably is bias on the right” . Needless to say, FAIR is not a reliable source. Will you please help me to get rid of this statement on the CNN article? It not only is backed by a patently biased source, it is actually REFUTED by peer-reviewed, university-sanctioned sources. Thanks.   """,0

Most of your edits are fine. Thank you for restoring previous edits in a non-POV way which I think is acceptable. Most of the article is fine. I will just question two points. First I am not sure what you have accomplished by suppressing the publishers' understanding of the Singapore Math method. You may disagree with them, but it is still valid in a Wikipedia article to report what the publisher believes about their own work. I actually agree with much of your evaluation, but in order to keep Wikipedia neutral, our opinions should not be used to decide what to report and what not to report. The publisher's own description of their books should be included in this article. Perhaps you could write it in a way that makes it more clear that this is the publisher's own (and perhaps biased) opinion?

Second, if you suppress the reason why the National Math Panel believes Singapore Math to be exemplary, you should delete the entire reference to this fact. You may disagree with the Math Panel's thinking, but the fact is that this (and Singapore's success on international tests) is the only reason Singapore Math was cited in their report. By deleting what the Math Panel said leaves the reader under the impression that the Math Panel reviewed Singapore Math (they did not) and are in agreement with all of the features of Singapore Math. Their precise statement was, """"The Singapore standards (Singapore Ministry of Education, 2006) provide an established example of curriculum standards designed to develop proficiency in a relatively small number of important mathematics topics, as validated by a recent analysis (Ginsburg et al., 2005).""""""",0

But the Sox were a contender during the early 1950s and into the mid 1960s, and once again outdrew the perpetually inept Cubs. 
 Inept says who quanity it 
It was downright painful for old-time fans to watch.
 Painful as in actual physicial pain ? Quanify it , maybe some old timer where happy to leave an old stadium
Some Sox fans believed that the move was unnecessary,

It was originally both located (what we might call an """"institutional home"""") and indeed published at Harvard University (or at least in Cambridge). """"Home"""" and publishing location are not always the same.  For example, Mind's home is the University of York, but it's published at Oxford.  I do not believe the editor has to be located at the home, especially not anymore with email and cloud storage and all that fancy stuff.  I think the reason it helps to mention that it was originally at Harvard is because both the old issues list the location as Harvard and citations may list Harvard, so keeping a record of that here helps anyone trying to understand that the old issues are indeed part of this journal.

If their is some fundamental law of nature saying they aren't mercs, then why include them in the article on mercenaries at all? (Anymore than a section in the Birds article called Dogs are not birds).

Ajax is consistently referred to as the second greatest warrior at Troy, in the Iliad, but this is made somewhat confusing in Book 23.

 """"Exactly Chevin"""", Thanks...Watch out Boothy doesn't start staulking and deleteing your stuff w/o taking the burden of proof there is a copyright... 

 Which picture?   Incidentally I'm writing about UK law. American law used to be marginally different. For instance to have copyright in the UK you only have show your work to someone, whereas in America I think you have to send it to the Library of Congress - books anyway. Also you used to have claim copyright separately in different countries. Then there's publishing rights, a whole different can of worms.

 I think that a picture such as Image:Pottsville court house.gif is liable to be a double copyvio - of the original postcard (if still in copyright) and of the gif image.

General. I am not sure why Scott and Boothy have put this lot on my talk page. I am watching and will give my considered opionion in due course.   17:50:48, 2005-08-20 (UTC)

 Rollback? 

Hi there! Could you please explain why you rollbacked this? The category was earlier deleted via CFD process. adiant_>|< 12:33, August 23, 2005 (UTC)

 Aren't you supposed to clear a category before you delete it? I have edited the cat taking my precedent from here. In my defence, I would say that {{db|see [[CfD debate]]}} would have been better than {{deleteagain}} which has a rather vague  may have undergone a vote for deletion here - note the missing link. And after ten minutes of hunting I cannot actually find the original CfD debate. But I am not dsperately bothered - if you want to delete it straight away, feel free - but do provide a link to the CfD debate.   13:55:01, 2005-08-23 (UTC)

""""The footpath sign was a result of an abortive attempt to photograph the south portal of the Milford Tunnel - I did not think the golfers would take kindly to my walking across their fairways and I am not sure how else to get to it."""" When I went train spotting, I used to walk along the edge of the field at the opposite side off the Milford Road, opposite the signal box. The North Portal is said to be prettier and you seem to have caught it in a rare moment when it wasn't deep in shade. I like 058133 - the train gives it a bit of movement.

There are loads of photos around but they are all copyright. My solution is to link to  websites that are lkely to be permanent. """"Picture the Past"""" has a photo of Toadmoor Tunnel which really shows the elliptical shape.

058162 would show Ambergate station as it is now. Belper and Duffield have been similarly erased. 

I'm sure I should know what Chatter is. I have this feeling it's  limestone pebbles from the quarries that you'd use for a driveway. I'll have to ask around, or perhaps we could ask on the """"Voices"""" BBC programme that's coming up.

Why did you remove the speedy tag from Rob Vincent? I do not see anything in that article as it stands that looks like a claim of notability to me.

There is much room for further revision (and since the lead, among many other things, was not written by me, I would have no objection to revision of it).  My comments were directed to the deliberate removal of all my references to primary source documents, and to the perception that Pearson and Nelson's books are reliable sources.  In some respects they are, but both books also contain egregious factual errors, and they cannot be cited without checking the 'facts' cited in them against the primary source documents.  Your comment that the transcripts and translations on my site are 'not considered a reliable source for information' puzzles me.  If you can demonstrate to me that anything in any one of my transcripts does not accurately reflect the content of the document in question, I'll be happy to change it.  I've striven to make the summaries as accurate as possible, and I think they are accurate.  Moreover my transcripts have the advantage of being in modern spelling, and are thus accessible to everyone, which the original documents certainly are not, being in Latin, and in various Elizabethan scripts.  As for what you term the 'glosses' and which I term 'summaries', their purpose is to summarize the sometimes very obscure content of the documents for readers, and to refer readers to other related documents on the same topic which they might not otherwise be aware of.  The 'glosses' (summaries) are thus a very valuable resource for readers.  But again, if you can find any instance in which one of my summaries misrepresents the content of a document, please let me know and I'll change it.  Re the Brinknell incident.

Notability of Julia Olteanu
A tag has been placed on Julia Olteanu requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  Excalibur!

Articles for deletion
Hi!  I noticed that you've been participating in the deletion discussions at WP:AFD.  Thanks; we can always use the help.  Since AfD isn't a vote but a discussion, your recent contributions haven't been as helpful as you might hope; in addition to a 'keep' or 'delete,' some information about why the article under discussion meets or doesn't meet Wikipedia's standards is needed.  You might find this essay to be an interesting source of advice about how to make your AfD contributions most helpful. - (talk · contribs) 
hmm i dont totally agree with you because why have a vote when the vote doesnt count. a vote should count in when a page is either deleted or the opposite.  
It isn't really a matter of agreeing or disagreeing.  Regardless of what you may think it should be, AfD is not a vote, and doesn't function as one; administrators reading the discussion to determine consensus just disregard any comments that don't include reasons that are based in Wikipedia policy.  You are welcome to continue participating in the way you are, but it is not a useful way to spend your time, since your contributions won't be used to determine whether an article should be deleted or not. - (talk · contribs)  —Preceding comment was added at

 Greek spelling 
There should be a spiritus asper over the eta in the greek word. Does anyone know how to fix this?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 83.250.229.5   

Do you mean this:  (instead of this: ἡπαρ)? —   

 It should actually be a circumflex + rough breathing (spiritus asper) over the Eta (in the nominative singular). I have fixed this. I also added the root ἡπατ-, which should only have the rough breathing as accent is not indicated for roots.

 Missing Ketone production ) 

In the article about Ketogenesis, it states """"Ketone bodies are produced mainly in the mitochondria of liver cells"""". This fact is missing from the functions of Liver.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 132.170.54.14   

 Liver regeneration and the Greeks 

On this page and the Prometheus page, someone has added a reference giving a bogus definition for the Greek word for liver, hêpar, claiming that it  derives from the verb hêpaomai, meaning to mend or repair. Thus hêpar is supposed to translate as, """"repairable."""" This derivation is fanciful. I'm surprised it lasted as long on Wiki as it has since it wasn't even confirmed by the original source given! I've deleted this bogus definition. I doubt you need references for a deletion, but here are some anyway: J. Pokorny, Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch (Bern and Munich: Francke, 1959), pp. 325, 504; P. Chantraine, Dictionnaire étymologique de la lange grecque (Paris: Klincksieck, 1990), p. 414; H. Frisk, Griechisches etymologisches Wörterbuch, Vol. I (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1973), pp. 638-9. These sources make it very doubtful that hêpar was related to hêpaomai.

I've also changed some text in the section on Liver Regeneration which asserted that the myth of Prometheus proves that the ancient Greeks must have known about the liver's remarkable capacity to repair itself. Actually this is a matter of some dispute. I've changed the text to reflect this controversy. I’ve looked at a great deal of literature on the subject and have found only one attempt to actually argue that the Greeks knew about liver regeneration: Chen T and Chen P (1994). """"The Myth of Prometheus and the Liver."""" Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 87(12): 754-755. I've added a reference and link to this. I've also referenced and linked to a historically detailed critique of this position: Power C and Rasko J (2008). """"Whither Prometheus' Liver? Greek Myth and the Science of Regeneration."""" Annals of Internal Medicine 149(6): 421-426. This is by far the most comprehensive treatment of this topic.

The addition of the above references made an existing reference redundant (ie Michalopoulos, George K., and DeFrances, Marie C., """"Liver regeneration”. Science, 4 April 1997: Vol. 276. no. 5309, pp. 60-66), so I removed it. Like a great many articles on regenerative medicine, the Michalopoulos article simply asserts that the Greeks must have known about liver regeneration, citing the the myth of Prometheus as its only evidence. Chen and Chen go much further than this. Likewise Power and Rasko.

 Christianity and its Polytheistic Attributes  

Here are some credible, scholarly sources, as requested, for the statement about Christianity and how it is believed to be polytheistic. I request that editors maintain an impartial approach when dealing with Christianity-related articles and other religious articles. I further request that editors acknowledge the polytheistic elements of the Christian faith, the controversy around the issue, and that Christianity believed to be polytheistic by some. 

It says in the American Encyclopedia (an academic accredited work): 

""""The belief in the Oneness of God – as a theological movement – began at a very early stage in history, and in fact it preceded the belief in trinity by many decades. Christianity developed from Judaism, and Judaism firmly believes that there is one God. 

The path that led from Jerusalem (the home of the first disciples of Christ) to Nicea (where it was decided in 325 CE that Christ was equal to God in essence and eternal nature) can hardly be described as a straight path. 

The doctrine of trinity which was affirmed in the fourth century CE bears no resemblance to the original teachings of Christ concerning the nature of God. Au contraire, it is the opposite, a deviation from that teaching. Hence it developed in opposition to the belief in One God… (27/294)"""" 

Will Durant, in his The Story of Civilization says: 

""""When Christianity conquered Rome, the new religion (i.e., Christianity) was infused with the blood of the old idolatrous religion: the title of archbishop, worship for the great mother, and an innumerable number of lords who gave peace of mind and were like who exist in all places and cannot be detected with the senses. All of this came into Christianity as the blood of the mother comes into her child. 

The civilized empire handed over power and administration to the papacy and the impact of the word replaced the impact of the sword. The preachers of the church started to assume positions of power. 

Christianity did not put an end to idolatry, rather it reinforced it. The Greek mind came back to life in a new form, in the doctrines and rituals of the church. The Greek rituals appeared in the rituals of the monastic saints. From Egypt came the idea of the holy trinity, the day of reckoning, eternal reward and punishment, and man’s eternal life in one of the other. From Egypt also came the worship of the mother and child, the mystical union with God, the union which led to Platonism and agnosticism, and the erasing of Christian doctrine. And from Persia came the belief in the return of the Messiah and his ruling the earth for 1000 years. 

Despite the element of atheism in the words of Durant, which is something that he is known for, and which is apparent in his claim that the idea of eternal reward or punishment came from the Egyptians, tracing the origins of deviant idolatry in Christianity is no longer a secret, and he is not the only one who has researched them. In his book Christianity and Idolatry, Robertson states that Mithraism, which is a religion of Persian origin, flourished in Persia approximately six centuries before the birth of Christ, and it reached Rome around the year 70 CE, where it spread throughout the Roman lands. Then it reached Britain and spread to a number of British cities. What concerns us here about this religion is that it says: 

-         That Mithras, after whom it is named, was an intermediary between God and man (for a similar doctrine in Christianity, see Acts 4:12).

-         He was born in a cave or in a corner of the earth (cf. Luke 2:8)

-         His birthday was December 25 (which is the day celebrated by the Christians as the day when Jesus was born)

-         He had twelve disciples (cf. Matthew 10:1)

-         He died to save the world (cf. I Corinthians 15:3)

-         He was buried but he came back to life (cf. I Corinthians 15:4)

-         He ascended to heaven in front of his disciples (cf. Acts 1:9)

-         He was called “Saviour” (cf. Titus 2:13)

-         Among his attributes is that he is like a peaceful lamb (cf. John 1:29)

-         The “Divine supper” was held in his memory every year (cf. I Corinthians 11:23-25)

-         One of his symbols was baptism

-         Sunday was sacred to them """"

Horse articles 
I agree that the use of """"Footnotes"""", (or simply Notes) """"Citations"""" and """"References"""" is perfectly acceptable. However, there is no consistency in the way these terms are used and on quite a few of the FA articles the term """"Footnotes"""" is used in place of """"Citations"""" (or References) and on at least two articles the notes were labelled """"Notes"""" and the citations were labelled """"Footnotes"""". There appears to be some misunderstanding as to when and where the terms """"Notes"""" and/or """"Footnotes"""" ought to be used. If """"Citations"""" is the preferred heading for inline references, then you need to take this up with others who write about horses. My point here is specifically to eliminate the wrong usage of the term """"Footnotes"""" for sections that do not contain anything that even vaguely resembles a footnote.

"Recent Edit

1. Moved the Hariakhan Baba paragraph above Post-Yogananda Claims. According to that entry Hariakhan Baba taught from 1860 (before Paramahansa Yogananda was born) to 1924 (before the publication of the Autobiography of a Yogi in 1946). People accepted and revered Hariakhan Baba as the Babaji since pre-Yogananda times. The timing of his appearance also coincides with Lahiri Mahasaya's Kriya Yoga initiation from Babaji (1861).

2. Corrected a minor spelling error from Hari Dasa to Hari Dass.

3. Added Roy Eugene Davis' name and book as support for the Mahavatar Babaji/Hariakhan Baba theory. Basically,  to show that there is someone from the lineage of the author of Autobiography of a Yogi who agrees with Dass and (Mahendra) Baba's conclusion. Roy Eugene Davis was ordained by Paramahansa Yogananda himself in 1951. So, for someone like him to agree that this Hariakhan Baba is the same as the Mahavatar Babaji mentioned by his Master and venerated by all legitimate kriyabans from the Lahiri Lineage is not a light matter.

4. Added Sidhoji Rao Shithole's legal and proper name.",0

Okay, I'm going to try and explain this to you again.  There are a few points which you don't seem to be understanding, so I'm going to number them.
Infoboxes contain links to various sites which contain information.  For instance, an actor's infobox will often contain a link to their official web site as well as a link to their IMDb profile.  These are not meant as sources or references.  They are simply links to other reference type sites which are well known for their content as it relates to actors.  The reason that they are included is summed up on WP:EL which states in part """"... information that could not be added to the article for reasons such as copyright or amount of detail, or other meaningful, relevant content...""""  IMDb and IAFD go into a great amount of detail which we don't include.  This is why they are linked in the infobox.
IMDb, much like IAFD, cannot be used as a source for biographical information.  This is because there is little, if any, fact checking done for that information.  For instance, for my IMDb profile (yes, I have one and no, I will not share it with you since it has my real name), I could supply IMDb with a date of birth, ethnicity, and so on and claim to be me but they don't actually know that I am who I say I am.  The filmography on my profile though is supplied by the directors, production companies, etc. which have had me work for them on their films.  Filmographies come to IMDb from official sources.  IAFD works much the same.  Biographical information is not very well fact checked and comes from the average user/reader/whatever you want to call them.  Filmography info comes from the production companies.
You keep asking me for a source.  I don't have any other source than what is already supplied in the article.  If you go to Bitoni's article and look at the ethnicity in the infobox, you'll see a little number """"2"""" next to it.  That number refers to a reference in the references section of the article.  When you look there, you'll see that all the references are numbered.  Click on the second reference and that is the page that is being used as a reference for her ethnicity.  The """"a, b, c"""" that you see there means that the same source is being used for two other facts within the article.
That source is from Bitoni's publicist.  It's as credible as can be and is trusted.
There, now that I've explained all of this, do you have any questions?  If so, please explain which point you don't understand.  |(talk) """,0

"Again, I think we see different problems.  You see my piping the Ravi Shankar links as a burden, which I unfortunately created by having Ravi Shankar (musician).  I do not, because I believe there will always be a need for someone to watch over new links to Ravi Shankar.  The links that had already been created demonstrate that people will link to Ravi Shankar, even when the person meant is not the musician.  This will continue to happen, and it will continue to need correcting.  The question is are we going to make it easier on those who do the correcting, or are we going to make it harder.  I can appreciate the argument that the needs of the end users and the needs of the editors outweigh the needs of link-fixers.  But I have yet to hear exactly how an editor or an end user is inconvenienced.  If you could explain that to me, I would be very grateful.

"The RBA is bound by the Reserve Bank Act 1959, and while the bank has certain freedoms to direct monitary policy, it must report to the treasurer and in matters of disagreement the Governor General can intervene and if need be force the bank to implement changes to its policy, so the RBA isn't a law unto itself (perhaps more akin to a stubborn teenager who will direct all efforts towards trying to get away with whatever it can and never admit to being wrong). It is important to distinguish the RBA from the US Federal Reserve, because as I understand while the Fed Act Section 31 reseves the right to amend or revoke the Act by Congress, there doesn't appear to be anything about accountability beyond reporting to Congress (Congress doesn't appear to be able to overrule policy without amending the Act, wheras in Australia there is a legislated procedure for disagreements).

Since only the developer knows the exact height, we should not use any updates or information from other sources.  Once the height on the official website is updated should we change the height here on Wikipedia.   (talk | contributions) 
I agree.  One official source is better than many conflicting unofficial sources.    

 Remaining milestones 
I have my doubts whether the Petronius oil platform qualifies as a """"world's tallest freestanding structure"""" and as a milestone for Burj Dubai to pass.  Most of it's structure is below water and therefore doesn't qualify under CTBUH rules.    
I do not have an opinion on the issue, just a few comments.  Consensus is that it is not considered the tallest; and therefore may not warrant being included as a milestone.  But, despite that, it does stand taller than the CN Tower, even if it is in water.  It will not hurt if we keep it, and will not be a major deal if we take it away.  Let us see if anyone else has an opinion.   (talk | contributions) 

 At this rate, we gotta keep all those deep level mines too since they are much 'taller' than any tower or oil platform ever built.
  

Actually, many argue that the Petronius is the """"tallest free-standing structure"""", hence the usual addition of """"on land"""" to the Burj Dubai's title (for now), and previously to the CN Tower's title. So I don't agree that consensus agrees to the contrary; consensus agrees that it is not on land, but there is much support of it being a free-standing structure in general. CTBUH has never released any information about the world's tallest structures; it only measures the height of the tallest buildings, so by its rules the CN Tower also would not count. It is therefore not very relevant in this situation. Anyway, I believe that the Petronius should be kept as a milestone. Cheers, -me 

Would Petronius stand on it's own without buoyancy?   
 Even if it can, a lot of the difficulty of a tall structure is in the construction process.  Oil rigs have a serious advantage there because they don't need tall cranes, because you can access the top with boats.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 32.97.110.142

 Early Republic; 2nd paragraph 
Right,
For the 2nd paragraph, the why (for what needs to be done), and how (suggestions) -
1st, the why:

besides the 1) excessive number of bibliographical citations in Portuguese, which I claim to be unneeded, since there is abundant literature in English dealing with the subject;
My suggestion is that (keeping the paragraph short, btw depending on the option to be chosen, even shorter), must be also fixed:

2) the truncation of the narrative, referring to fix the correlational gaps of
2.1 the beginning of the republic and the military rebellions of the 1920s, and to
2.2 the mentions about all revolts of the 1930s, and not just the communist one, 
Or 
- 2.2.1 - to maintain coherence, don' mention any (1930s) revolt specifically , in the manner suggested below

3) (Regarding the briefness of the paragraph); remove the excess of detail inferred from a source in Portuguese. Details that can be contained in other more specific articles of Wikipedia, related to the history of that period
I refer specifically to this passage  """"The repression of the opposition was brutal with more than 20,000 people imprisoned, internment camps created for political prisoners in distant regions of the country, widespread torture by the government agents of repression, and censorship of the press.**"""" ; 
which can be summarized as suggested (see suggestion about Point 3) below 

My suggestions for How -
Regarding to: 
Point 1, use the abundant literature in English dealing with the subject, as some which I used

Point 2.1, a variation of what I had proposed:
 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, through various civilian and military rebellions, that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt."""" 
Or, shorter 
 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, that by 1930 it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt."""" 

Points 2.2, 2.2.1 and 3 (bold letters)
 """"Vargas and the military who supported him, were supposed to assume the power temporarily, but instead they closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with their supporters, having defeated between 1932 and 1938, 3 major attempts to remove them from power. Being the 1935 communist one served as an excuse for they preclude elections, launching a coup d'état in 1937, making their regime a full dictatorship, with all that this entails. """" 

Thus (following the justifications above), one possibility of how the entire paragraph could be:

 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt. Vargas and the military who supported him, were supposed to assume the power temporarily, but instead they closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with their supporters, having defeated between 1932 and 1938, 3 major attempts to remove them from power. Being the 1935 communist one served as an excuse for they preclude elections, launching a coup d'état in 1937, making their regime a full dictatorship, with all that this entails. """" 

Note that, besides Not contain the defects stated above, even With the phrase  """"in the wake of the murder of his running mate, """" - this possible version is by far a shorter paragraph than the present version.

"If you read the Oohashi paper, you will see the trouble they have gone to, to source ultrasonic music from gamelans, special playback equipment, special tweeters, etc .... everything checked from source to speaker system. Meyer Moran does not even seek to be a test of ultrasonics. It does not pretend to be a test of ultrasonics. It does not claim to be a test of ultrasonics. If you wish to assert that Meyer Moran is a test of ultrasonics, you will have to formally prove that EACH AND EVERY ONE of the elements of the chain passes the ultrasonic test. So let's check it out

1. Source material:  

This is discusssed at:  
http://www.sa-cd.net/showthread.php?page=1
It turns out that the vast majority of source discs used by Meyer Moran were recorded in the 50s, 60, 70s or 80s ... they are CD quality masters, and therefore do not have ultrasonic content.  
Summary: SOURCE MATERIAL:   FAILS ultrasonic test

2. The playback equipment used by Meyer Moran has to be able to reproduce ultrasonics. 
The source equipment used by Meyer Moran is listed at:
http://www.bostonaudiosociety.org/explanation.htm
The principal equipment consisted of an Adcom GTP-450 preamp and Snell C/V speakers.

You can find the specs for the Adcom GTP-450 preamp here:

http://www.users.interport.net/a/d/adcom/gtp450.html

The specs are listed as: 20Hz to 20kHz.  FAILS ultrasonic test

The specs for the Snell C/V speakers are given here:

http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/1194snell/index3.html

They show massive drop-off above 22 kHz. FAIL

Summary:  The playback equipment used by Meyer Moran cannot reproduce ultrasonics properly.

GRAND SUMMARY:  Meyer Moran is not a test of ultrasonics. Meyer Moran do not claim it is a test of ultrasonics. The only person claiming that it is a test of ultrasonics is you, it is  your own original research, which is a violation of the Wiki original research provisions. Worse, your claim is  completely flawed and erroneous, at EVERY LEVEL of the chain, from source material through to speakers.

I'll leave this up for a day or so for some discussion. If you cannot prove your original claims, then ... out it goes.

P.S. Your Lehrman (2008) reference is just a quote of Meyer Moran - it also has absolutely nothing to do with hypersonic, or ultrasonics. You might want to take this to the CD advocacy page - but it has nothing to do with the ultrasonic effect. Out it goes. (  )",0

The followers of Claude Vorilhon call him """"His Holiness""""; what do you think of that? If they called him """"Holy Father"""", would that be legitimate?

Here a forensic anthropologists argues that the race concept is valid and that there is obvious political bias and suppression involved by the race deniers:

Here's one scientist that says that: """"The idea that human races are only social constructs has been the consensus for at least 30 years."""" Referring to the Lewontian ignoramuses, of course. But then continues with: """"Beneath the jargon, cautious phrases and academic courtesies, one thing was clear: the consensus about social constructs was unraveling.

"I'll layout my mindset when writing Dennis Lo.  The employer contacted me because he had previously worked with me on another project unrelated to this.  He asked if I could write up an article.  I told him I needed 3 days to decide if I would take the job to determine if an article could even be written that was met guidelines.  I determined that there was, accepted the job, and wrote it.  Now, could the article have been written by anyone without getting paid?  Yes.  In fact, red links for Dennis Lo already existed in two other articles.  I gathered as many sources as I could and wrote what they said.  Did that prohibit me from being critical?  As seen in the Tops In Blue article, I can be critical of topics I have a COI in (I have a friend who was in TiB at the time I rewrote that article).  So what does payment get the employer?  Well, he doesn't have to wait for some random disinterested party to get around to writing it.  They arn't buying my integrity, it's not for sale.  They arn't buying my bit, that's not mine in the first place.  As far as I am concerned, me getting paid gets me to write in topic areas I normally wouldn't.  That's the only 'effect' it has on me.  I'm much more interested in this project than picking up some crappy freelance job that's going to lead to me being asked to leave.  My guess is that most established editors feel the same way.

"""Is there any half-decent Cantonese pop music, or is it all treacle?  04:41 25 Jun 2003 (UTC)

Is there really """"westerners"""" listening to Cantopop?  I doubt the sentence """"To western ears,..."""" is NPOV.

The article fails to mention the composer 顧家輝, singer 仙度拉, and their song 啼笑姻緣 which overturned the preception that Cantopop as a second grade Music (i.e. for old uneducated person only).  And it was Sammy Hui who finally pushed Cantopop to overtake Mandarin pop as the music of choice for HK youths.  
Yes no mention at all of the Gu Gaa-fai,Wong Jim collaboration. No mention at all of the popularity of TVB TV theme songs, while everbody else was sticking their own lyrics onto somebody elses music these two, seemed to be the only people producing original material. 

 I'll try to NPOV the article more, but I claim no responsbility on contentyou can't get much further from my musical domain than Cantopop.  05:06 25 Jun 2003 (UTC)

 No problem.  I bet you have the chance to listen to the most popular Cantopop songs but not the best.  I will get the same preception if I listen only to Madonna or Britney Spears.

I didn't mean that I wouldn't like it.  I meant that I've never heard any, and I certainly don't know the history behind it, so my editing is limited to grammar and attempts at NPOV. )  05:23 25 Jun 2003 (UTC)

 Tones 

I heard that Cantonese music differs from Mandarin in that Mandarin respects the language tones in the melody, but Cantonese doesn't. Is it true?
 

 Good Cantopops do respect the language tones in the melody, as all Chinese dialects are tone-sensitive. What you heard is a recent disaster in HK music, beautiful face is more important than singing skills and so songs become less important.  But there are still many real musicians care about the tones and the melody. 

Cantonese is more tonal than Mandarin.  Mandarin only has 4 tones for each pronunciation, but Cantonese has at least 6 tones according to most dictionaries.  Some author even claims there are 9 tones in Cantonese.  Even though written Chinese can be pronunced in Cantonese or Mandarin, but the sound differs so much that you cannot sing a Cantonese song in Mardarin nor vice versa.  Many popular tunes get both Cantonese and Mandarin lyrics which are totally rewritten and sometimes with unrelated subjects.   20:31, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Yes but Mandarin has a more pleasant rhythm when spoken with natural darkness and light and this translates into songs pleasnter on the ear.I've heard people talk about Cantonese as sounding like a machine gun on the ear. 

And, how do Cantopop artists deal with music piracy? 
 

 Cantopop artists deal with piracy using the same technique as European or American artists, i.e. virtually nothing they can do!!! 

 But I was under the impression that in HK and Canton, media piracy was much much higher than in Europe or America. But there still are Cantopop artists. Are the economic models different? Do they resort to corporate patronage? ...  

 Curious: How did you hear that """"height"""" in Cantonese areas?  00:40 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)

You have some of the most popular cantopop stars e.g. Joey Yung and Twins going on TV and saying how poor they are and asking their fans not to steal their livlihoods.And yes they do resort to corporate patronage of a sort.In the Joey Yung interview I was referring to, she claimed that she was making no money on her albums, but that she still had to produce albums to keep herself in the public eye and maintain her fanbase. With a large enough fanbase she can make money on personal appearances and concerts.For example Jade Kwan has recently been booked by a chain of bars, in the mainland, for a dozen or so 20 minute mini-concerts.Furthermore if you are popular enough you can make money through endorsments.There isn't a single reasonably attractive female cantopop singer who isn't e",0

 Is OhInternet a recreation of Encyclopedia Dramatica? 

To tangent from the above topics…

Oh Internet is not Encyopedia Dramatica as the article supposes. 'Encyclopedia Dramatica' is defined as the domain name 'www.encyclopediadramatica.com' and the intellectual property concerned with ED copyright. OhInternet, however is a different project entirely; notable differences: a new XML coding system, logo and form of satire. To use terms in the article: the site was not 'overhauled' but rather 'replaced'. 

To use Silverseren's analogy, if Wikipedia did rename itself, kept most of its higher administration and stopped using Wikimedia software would it still be Wikipedia? The answer is """"No"""". The Wikipedia name and intellectual property becomes inactive, lost. If one were to charge a Wikipedia fork site with copyright violations they would have to give evidence of their ownership of Wikipedia copyright and not that of the new 'OhKnowledge.com', the hypothetical Wikipedia replacement. (Sherrod, however does have evidence, so don't take this as a justification for the .ch). Once a site loses connection with the old name or any registered associated material it ceases to be the same entity. Oh Internet has no parallels to the old site at all. The position that the new site is ED just 'cleaned' should be removed from the article immediately.

Encyclopedia Dramatica, as defined, is dead. OhInternet is a whole new project – a de facto successor, but not 'ED'. The redirect was an attempt to maintain website hits but as many 3rd party websites will show, it didn't quite work out. The vast majority of the volunteer editors did leave. Site activity, growth and edit numbers are much higher at encyopediadramaticia.ch than at OhInternet. OhInternet’s declining popularity should first stabilize before any 'notability' assessment goes underway. 

Understandably the nature of ED.ch is illegal so I don't care for it immediate coverage. I like to think the site will cool down over time.

You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Help:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase.

"""Ekantik, do you believe that Sathya Sai Baba can miraculously transform his genitals? I would appreciate an answer.

I also find it amusing that Ekantik, of all people, is attempting to point out strange beliefs held by Sai Devotees when Ekantik is a Hare Krishna Congregational Member and a Gaudiya Vaishnava who has openly defended his belief that Lord Krishna literally manifested 16,000 seperate human forms, married 16,000 seperate women, copulated with each one of them and generated innumerable offspring. Sanjay also believes that Lord Krishna held an entire mountain aloft on his pinky finger for 7 days and nights and defends scriptures that say the Lord Vishnu (a male) transformed himself into a woman (Mohini Devi). So it appears that Ekantik and Sai Devotees are not really that different as far as strange beliefs and miracle stories are concerned. I can't help to wonder why Ekantik mocks strange beliefs when he holds them himself.

Funny how Ekantik and Andries (critics of Sathya Sai Baba) want to promote """"well sourced"""" stories about gential switch tales and think the aura reference (written by a doctor in a well known Sri Lankan newspaper) is not """"well sourced"""".

"""

I do not """"hate"""" Columbia College; I hate seeing students waste their time. 
Here's a fact: Columbia College is unranked by U.S. News and World Report and by other major publishers of institutional rankings. This is because it is open-admissions. There's nothing wrong with Wikipedia publishing an article on this school. There is something wrong with not mentioning the problems of an open-admissions art school, and there is something even more wrong with the grossly commercial discussion of its gift shop. Wikipedia is not a brochure.  
Being the largest art school in the country is not a mark of distinction. In fact, the fundamental problem with Columbia College is related to the quality it touts: it's big. It's big because it does not limit its enrollments. There is a reason for that. It's not because it warmly and fuzzily and democratically embraces people from all walks of life. If it did, it wouldn't be so expensive. It does not limit its enrollments because it wants as much tuition money as it can get. 
Now, the members of its administration, its PR department, and its faculty are very careful to do everything to avoid this reality: in order to make art, one needs talent. Talent is, by definition, inborn and innate. You don't get it by acquiring skill. You don't get it by purchasing the most expensive camera, or the most expensive education money can buy. You're born with it, and by late adolescence, if you've got it, it will make itself apparent. 
Therefore, any student who actually has talent should strongly consider applying to a closed-admissions art school, one that requires a portfolio or other demonstration of work. These schools are also very expensive, but it's possible to get various kinds of financial aid. Once in the program, the talented painter, photographer, writer, or what have you will be surrounded by other talented students. That creates an entirely different atmosphere, one that keeps the student on his or her toes, as it were, and provides a sense of proportion and a sense that other students might be better. 
You might wonder why such an admission process demonstrates talent. It's because talent does not hide itself: it is apparent to experts in the field. 
There are two ways in which Columbia covers up this fact: by telling students that if they're showing up and willing to pay big bucks, then they're talented. It's easy to pass off that notion on a generation of kidsactually two generationsbrought up on the consumerist notion that he or she (and it's usually a he) who buys the most expensive camera has the most talent. 
The other means at Columbia's disposal is that for the last thirty years, children have been taught that self-esteem is the most important quality they can develop. In a misguided attempt to develop a false sense of self-esteem, schools have simply stopped talking about talent. They might, at times call it merit, but that, too, is a bad word. So an entire generation has grown up thinking that if you have the """"drive to succeed,"""" you'll succeed. The problem: what if you've get the drive to succeed, but reaching down within yourself, you find you've got nothing to express?
If you think Columbia loves you, try falling behind on your tuition. Good luck.""",0

 Troubling aspects of the artiicle as it exists right now 

1) I believe if Eric Altermann is to be accorded the prestige of being associated with msnbc.com, it should be noted that he is a blogger for msnbc.com. I say that because I found conservative columnist and author Michelle Malkin referred to as a blogger in another article and I do believe that's meant to diminish the value of her statement. So, again, yes. We HAVE to see the forest for the trees. No one article in Wikipedia exists in a vaccum. There has to be a baseline standard and I reject any argumentation that suggests implies or directs that if 'I don't like that article, go change it.' Instead, one way or the other (and I don't care which way) liberals and conservatives have to be characterized by the same fair measuring stick.

2) This is new. It's from Conason: """"Conason goes on to point out that Coulter's critical nature is blunted by her pre-assumed opinions, making many of the conclusions she draws irrelevant to the actual nature of her arguments."""" Wow! That seems a little unfair just hanging out there like that. I propose either eliminating it or...and I hate this approach as much as the next guy...scotch-taping a quote after that which refutes this obvious cheap-shot.

3) This is old. The McVeigh section, as should be no surprise to anyone who's followed my work here, is troubling. Let's start with this quote: """" She was willing to characterize members of the Branch Davidians at the Waco compound as """"harmless American citizens"""" [6] even after the survivors of the raid and subsequent immolation of the group by their leader were convicted.""""
Well, some Waco compounders were convicted of something or another. But the fact is that there WERE mostly innocent victims of David Koresh in that compound. It's unbalanced to just add the tag line about conviced Davidians without acknowledging what I GUARANTEE you Ann was referring to, which were the overwhelming number that were innocent. 

This quote is also troubling: """"Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his bombing."""" Well, McVeigh had LOTS of reasons for his bombing. But who cares what a madman thinks? And if you do, then I understand he also had some uncomplimentary things to say about the Bible. Therefore, if we are to include this in Coulter's section, I say we include it's compelement in Bill Maher's article. It would go something like this:
""""Naher has frequently criticized the Bible calling it a 'bunch of fairy tales' and claiming 'God doesn't write books.'  Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his distrust of Christianity, though the Bible has been widely criticized throughout history.""""

Whady'a say?

(Much more on this section later.)

4) Racism is not the same as being anti-Islamic terrorists that want to kill Americans for supporting Israel etc. To title Ann's comments on Islamic Radicals as allegations of racism seems dishonest to me.

5) Did Ann really say that ALL  women are """"not as bright"""" as men'?
Some editor in Wikipedia wants us to think so. I say this quote be taken out until we get confirmation of her whole statement in context. Now, I know for a fact that Ann is only half-joking when she argues women should not be allowed to vote so she is far from imune when it comes to suggesting she holds less-than-boilerplate-feminist views. But this quote supposedly out of H & C seems like it's probably another smear. Again, if proven wrong, I'll gladly man up and stand corrected. But, unitl I'm proven it wrong, it should be excised in my view.

Saedon,

As you know, or at least should know, peer-review has become a very politicized process, not just for I.D., but for all non-mainstream scientific views. Casey Luskin has an excellent articleoutstanding article, heavily burrowed from a paper by physicist Frank Tipler, which details this, including direct quotes from multiple Nobel Prize winners on the deep flaws of the peer-review process. Even if the journal's referees, themselves, would be willing to publish pro-I.D. research, the fear of backlash  even boycotts  directed towards both themselves and their journals, surely prevents them from doing so.

You must understand, when dealing with intelligent design, we're dealing with something that causes nothing less than embarrassing, childish, outrageous, emotional outbursts from its detractors, including many scientists (the Bloggingheads incident comes to mind, where many scientists attempted to boycott Bloggingheads simply because they allowed Michael Behe on to discuss his views). These detractors, of course, include many Wikipedia contributors. I strongly suspect that includes you, which is I why you make such a suspect editor regarding this subject, and why none of my words, as reasonable as they may be, will have any effect on dogmatic thinking.

With all of this said, the Discovery Institute keeps a page archiving the many pro-I.D. articles which have been able to penetrate the politicized wall of orthodoxy that has sullied the peer-review process. The number is currently over 50, and continually growing.

Of course, once the objection that I.D. has no peer-reviewed publications in support of it has been met, the goalposts will be moved to the claim that, (a) they're not good enough, (b) there's not enough, or (c) a combination of a and b. Casey Luskin, again, has fantastic article, entitled """"Answering Objections about Discovery Institute's Peer-Review Page,"""" that addresses some of these goalpost shifts (this is the part where you ignore the arguments and attack Casey Luskin the person).

Let me also add that every paper which further unveils a level of sophistication in the cell, more design principles, function for something once thought to be junk, etc., weighs support to the notion that life was designed, and that the Darwinian view is based on ignorance. A couple of articles which come to mind are James A. Shapiro's Natural Genetic Engineering, which shows that evolution is the programmed result of the brilliantly designed technology located inside the cell, and Michael Sherman's Universal Genome theory, a view which demonstrates that evolution was a front-loaded event (read: evolution was programmed).""",0

Everybody: you're wrong. Everyone here except Bretonbanquet has said that they think that the numbering should continue on side two. This isn't about what anyone thinks; it's about reliable sources - in this case, the label of a vinyl record. It is also about reality - and as usual, people here are trying to make Wikipedia into an alternative universe rather than an encyclopedia. So, in a nutshell, it doesn't really matter what any of you think. If you can produce a copy of this or any album where the numbering on side two is continued from side one, rather than beginning again from track one, by all means, it should be noted in the article, because that would be an accurate representation of how the record was presented to the public, as well as a reliable source. Problem solved. By arbitrarily deciding on a numbering system that is contrary to what actually exists in the real world, you are using original research, which some people here tend to frown upon.

In short, adding proper sources to the plot section is never a bad idea, but there's no need to dig extensively to do so. ( talk )",0

"""""""in the way of God"""" ==

i found some material of relevance in Reuven Firestone's work """"Jihad: The Origin of Holy War in Islam"""" (Oxford University Press) related to this current dispute. i wasn't actually looking for it, but came across it while looking for something else. anyway (p. 17):

The meaning of jihad
The semantic meaning of the Arabic term jihād has no relation to holy war or even war in general. It derives, rather from the root j.h.d., the meaning of which is to strive, exert oneself, or take extraordinary pains. Jihād is a verbal noun of the third Arabic form of the root jahada, which is defined classically as """"exerting one's utmost power, efforts, endeavors, or ability in contending with an object of disapprobation."""" 14 Such an object is often categorized in the literature as deriving from one of three sources: a visible enemy, the devil, and aspects of one's own self. There are, therefore, many kinds of jihād, and most have nothing to do with warfare. """"Jihād of the heart,"""" for example, denotes struggle against one's own sinful inclinations, while """"jihād of the tongue"""" requires speaking on behalf of the good and forbidding evil. 15 ...

(removed large quote from a narration about the varying kinds of jihad)

... Muhammad is also credited with saying: """"The best jihād is [speaking] a word of justice to a tyrannical ruler."""" 17 The qualifying phrase """"in the path of God"""" (fi sabīl Allah) specifically distinguishes the activity of jihād as furthering or promoting God's kingdom on earth. It can be done, for example, by simply striving to behave ethically and by speaking without causing harm to others or by actively defending Islam and propagating the faith. Jihād as religiously grounded warfare, sometimes referred to as """"jihād of the sword"""" (jihād al-sayf), is subsumed under the last two categories of defending Islam and propagating the faith, though these need not be accomplished only through war. When the term is used without qualifiers such as """"of the heart"""" or """"of the tongue,"""" however, it is universally understood as war on behalf of Islam (equivalent to """"jihād of the sword""""), and the merits of engaging in such jihād are described plentifully in the most-respected religious works. 18 Nevertheless, Muslim thinkers, and particularly ascetics and mystics, often differentiate between the """"greater jihād"""" (al-jihād al-akbar) and the """"lesser jihād"""" (al-jihād al-asghar), with the former representing the struggle against the self and only the """"lesser jihād"""" referring to warring in the path of God. 19 

 

Itaqallah, how was my suggested addition from Britannica Encyclopedia on the five types of jihad.  

I have no problem with """"in the way of God"""", since the sentence is phrased as giving jihad's meaning, not its literal meaning. -  

Another problem with the article is that it fails to mention the new interpretations of jihad (on the behalf of some renowned scholars) which disagree with usage of warfare except in defense.  
Too bad those guys weren't around during Muhammad's time.  
One can always fnd some quotes like the two above in a serious book on jihad. However, 99 percent of Firestone's work is about, yes, warfare.  Or

The problem, precisely, is that if you assume that there is an underlying structure [noun] is raining [object], then from the very start you deny the possibility that the pronoun before the verb is in fact meaningless, i. e. a dummy word.

My contention is that (maybe) the verb is really impersonal, i. e. its subject is truly a dummy word, not meant to mean anything but only appearing there to fill a syntactic slot.

The definition given at the start of the article is not sourced appropriately, I know; it just covers what I think are the features of what linguists call """"dummy pronoun"""", based on my amateur experience on the matter.

 Freedom House comment in introduction 

I deleted a paragraph in the opening of the article; this was promptly re-inserted by another user.  The text is: """"Israel is a democratic republic with universal suffrage that operates under the parliamentary system. According to the international data reported by Freedom House, the degree of political rights and civil liberties in Israel makes it the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, consisting of a multi-party system and separation of powers"""" 

I believe I had good reasons for removing it:

(1) The very same text - verbatim - is repeated later in the article.  This is reason enough for deleting it from the opening.  Without citing chapter and verse of Wikipedia policies, obviously a well-written article cannot be repetitious.

(2) A conclusionary statement about civil liberties is ipso facto a value-judgment.    This is obviously going to be endlessly controversial whatever the country involved (see point (3) below).  It is churlish to place this kind of comment right up there in the introduction.  Common/significant views about political rights are much better dealt with (less tersely) under the Government heading. I myself do not seek to contest the view that Israel has a high degree of political freedom, so if you disagree with me, deal with the point I make about the reasonableness of reporting this sort of evaluation in the opening of *any* country article.

(3) Where the very same text appears in the Government section, it is immediately followed by a contrary viewpoint, which the author(s) of this section thought was equally significant: """"Conversely, the research group Minorities at Risk (MAR) characterizes Israel's system ...""""  This gives a nice indication of how controversial the Freedom House opinion is, or at least appears to be to other Wikipedians.  Indeed, I'd like to ask: does the person who reverted my deletion of the same text from the opening think that its stupid to allign the Freedom House statement with opposing viewpoints (maybe because the Freedom House statement is 'incontrovertible', or whatever), and if so why did he/she not remove the 'Minorities at Risk' comment from the Government section?

(4) The text is a quote from Freedom House, which is widely regarded as a US-lead, organisation operating to promote a particular policy programme.  The Times (hardly a fringe opinion) has described it as an """"outpost of American soft power"""": .  Unlike, say, the Human Development Index there is hardly any global consensus support for its reports.  Giving its views such decisive prominence - treating them as the bottom-line on the country's political status by placing them in the opening - seems unencyclopaedic.  

I suggest that unless consensus forms against me on this, I should remove the offending text from the introduction.  There's presumably no objection to the same text being under the Government section (as it currently is - as well).

 There is no link to Disability Alert in Premier Binns' article. There's a link to Disability rights in Prince Edward Island, but that's a legitimate topic altogether separate from his blog. I assume that when the province was founded in 1873, there was at least one person with some form of a disability, and so from then on to 2006 or whenever, the topic is unrelated to Mr. Pate's unorthodox measures.

 I've removed the see also link, but the words """"to Islanders with disabilities"""" now point to this article.

 Yes, I do realise that it's all a one-man operation. I've repeatedly questioned him on the topic, with no response otherwise.

"The solution without a reference 

  //  Y1+
  //  =/=N0      
 M1

N0 never produces an output. The algorithm always produces a “M1” result when the answer is “Yes” from the oracle queried, and never produces a result when the answer is “N0” even to the other possible phrasings of the same query. It is striking how easy it is to miss the ingenuity of our programmers here. Most of the solution was already present as much as the pioneers and experts in the field surmised and asserted possible. Particularly, the comment on Fermat’s Last Theorem is relevantly applicable, such deep theories are in many instances required to solve largely thought unsolvable problems, especially in cases when most of the solution and the proof in the word was already known to the experts in the field.

The algorithm answers “Yes” with “M1” when the output produced from a correctly asked question produces never a “No” (written as N0) result, but only a “Yes” result. Incorrectly stated questions are they that cannot be resolved because they result in a “N” or “No” output never producing m by the computer given an incorrectly asked question. Given a correctly asked question, the computer will always return a “M” output eventually. But given the complexity of the question and the known variables the time required to solve an NP-Complete problem depends entirely on the specific incidence and construction of this algorithm. To illustrate the functions here is a clear example:

Question correctly asked: “Does the remote control not need new batteries?”

ALGORITHM says check the button function, if it changes the channel on the TV or the volume of the TV the computer monitoring the remote control produces a “M” result. The conclusion is output: Yes means no.

Incorrectly asked question seeking an NP-Complete problem: “Does the remote control have new batteries?” 

If the check of the remote control does reveal a failure of the button to change the channel or volume of the TV the answer is the conclusion is never output because this would be a “No” or “N” response.50.20.186.81  I Jesus, leave it as a proof to all life. It is not the most elegantly stated, so please forgive my not being more concise, but the solution is air tight. I promise you, children.",0
"So you find that a right-wing and left wing unreliable source agree and assume they must both be correct.  There has been considerable study of Marx and there is no reason that we need to use popular books as sources.  The only reason one would use them is that they contain claims that have not been accepted by mainstream historians.  Also, they lead us into discussions about what really happened which is a misuse of other editors' time.  We have an unsubstantiated claim by Jenny Marx made years after the event that her husband provided money for workers to buy weapons.  We do not by the way have any reliable sources that these workers obtained or used weapons in Belgium in 1848.  Reliable sources state that the French government supplied unemployed Belgian workers with weapons in Paris and these workers then returned to Belgium in an attempt to overthrow the government.  We know that Marx was arrested on suspicion of carrying arms and was ejected from the country, but in fact the accusation was false.  The types of additional sources that Martintg has provided are unreliable.  Boris Nicolaevsky for example was a communist activist (writing in 1933), not a mainstream historian.  Wheen and Muravchick are neoconservatives writing outside the academic mainstream.  We just do not know what Marx did with the 6,000 francs he received.",0

Space disposal
I've been on a rampage today, looking for stuff that needs to be completely redone. So I rewrote the section on space disposal. It no longer contains any speculation on the feasibility of space disposal using technology that hasn't been created yet. More importantly, it now refers to a reliable source. I hope I haven't hurt anyone's feelings but it really needed to go.   
Thanks. These are people who nearly had seizures when we launched Cassini at Saturn with a few kg of Pu-238 in it. Even if we had a magical propulsion system for launching actinides into space for free, I doubt that politically people would tolerate the booster failure risk rate. If 1% of these things are going to fail and go into the ocean, why not just include the other 99% as well, while we're at it? ;). At least if you pick your spot, you can drop casks into ocean crustal subduction zones (which has been suggested).

Just like the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the NATO said they destroyed about 400 or 200 Armored Assault vehicles. But the truth is, that they destroyed only 22 or less vehicles. The Yugoslav had Volunteers from Russia, Greece, and I believe Yugoslav volunteers. NATO was involved, but had about six Aircraft (B-2 1, F-16 2, and AC-130 2), I believe the aircraft in the parenthesis are the ones that were used, but didn't inflict casualties, but for the F-16, I believe inflicted casualties 8.

7. A new version of the article Raz Nadav:
Raz Nadav (born January 7, 1976) is an Israeli Writer.

Raz Nadav was born and raised in Tel Aviv, Israel. Inspired by the peace activist Abie Nathan, he started writing short stories in his boyhood and also joined and supported Nathan's activities as a member of the humanitarian organization Abie's Angels.
In his early 20's Nadav moved to the USA. He first lived in New York and then in Seattle. Few years later Nadav returned to Israel and started writing his books.
Between 2003 and 2006   Nadav has published two Hebrew books: The first titled """"ha-Lev Ha –ro`eh"""" (The seeing heart). It is a collection of short stories, some of which written in the magic realism genre touching on science fiction in its content.
The second book is """"ha-blondiniyot  ha `atsuvot shel hayai"""" (The sad blondes of my life). The novel follows a wild and reckless radio DJ involved in delusional and destructive relationships with three depressed blondes.

 Stub sorting guidelines 
I sincerely believe that we really need to lay down the law in stub sorting, and really provide a guideline.  I believe that we should all attempt to reach a general consensus by April 2, 2005 in a set of rules that we can follow.  Once we have built a set of guidelines, we can formally create a policy out of those guidelines.  We need to define what a specialized topic stub is, how many articles it should cover, when is it appropriate to create it, what defines its need for its creation, what defines its need for deletion, what criteria it should follow, what are the general steps should one take when sorting a stub, whether or not to start using subst: for all templates, whether or not use subst: for all templates created by the meta-templates, and any other matters that may come up in consideration.  I thank  for initially creating the subpage for the project at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  Even though they have been discussed, I feel that we really need to confirm everything.  For that, we should discuss each issue with its own sections, and raise a list of issues that we need to nail down before really continuing on.  The English Wikipedia is nearly at 500k articles.  Either the MediaWiki software needs to handle stubs such that they can be found with a simple union of categories, or the sorting is done manually by Wikipedians.  Personally, I think the latter is less taxing on the server load, especially when we use subst:, which I think would help the Wikipedia out, performance wise.  Please make your comments at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  I apologize for making this somewhat of a spam notice, but since the project has more members, the project can finally decide on these important issues at hand.  (talk) 23:23, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

That thing you did
‘’Hi Gadfium - a while back I was having trouble with some geography stubs, and (via the Village Pump) you found out for me that they'd been created twice, and fixed them. What did you do?’’
Just delete and restore the article which is appearing more than once. If that doesn't seem to work, try refreshing the category that they're in (edit the category page and then change the URL to say refresh instead of edit), and as a last resort, make a trivial change to the duplicated article to force a change to the database.  01:47, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

 changing geo-stub 

this is bordering on the absurd.  I have ended a number of my articles and stubs with Oceania-geo-stub, and someone has changed them to just plain stubs, so now I make it just a stub, and someone comes in behind me and changes it first to a geo-stub and then to an Oceania-geo-stub.  07:09, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)
Nuthin' to do with me - and anyone involved in the Stub sorting project should know to leave it as a oceania-geo-stub. Which articles do you mean? |hello? 
I don't even know precisely which articles they are anymore...most of my recent edits have had to do with the islands of French Polynesia and the Cook Islands.  I haven't bothered to look at who's changing the stubs, or if perhaps it's a problem with the db (I've had on occasion to submit several times...)   07:46, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)
The db may be the culprit. These stubs are very heavily used and the system does seem to slow down a bit with them. Not sure why that would result in the multile template changes though. As to an overhaul of the names, that would mean changing 50+ different regional stubs which between them are used on close to 10,000 articles. It's simply not practical. |hello?

I wonder what kind of format the table should have, and what info should it contain? There are three kinds of important info about equipment: 1) which systems the combatant had, 2) how many of those systems they had, 3) which systems were deployed to the theatre or used during the war, 4) how many systems were lost during the war.

Would it be possible to have all that info in one table, or should we make multiple tables, or would that be too much?",0

"vCard & wikiengine 
I where reading Tom Limoncelli Time Management for System Administrators where he mentioned about using wikiengine as a registry for contact information. Then I started to wonder in my small round head about contact format.

vCard sounds quite natural way to save this kind of information. Which leads simply to question how hard it could be to make some notation for contact information when there is way to say this is name, this field is phone number of that previously mentioned name being and so on. If there is notation how to express something then it is quite simple to output vCard, hCard or html table etc. Contact information should be reusable from many different wiki page. I mean that if there's article about HP computer and other about HP printers contact to HP should be single HP contact object.

Unfortunately I don't have glue how code extensions to wiki. I also don't know how much there is contact information in wikipedia, most likely only some. If there would be notation for addresses, phone number etc would anyone use it. Impossible to say. There is also other side of coin. It might be that implementation of contact information notation is just what everybody needed but did not realize needing it. There is also possibility that this idea was completely stupid (actually my ideas usually are not so bright than I self think they are).

Since this is not an article, but a sandbox draft, I don't know what to edit. I'll edit it here:

Note: You *almost got it right* but, the subject of the article is not the term, but the myth (or, shall we say controversy) about the term. The *argument* should be the subject.

""""Democrat Party"""" is a term used in the United States instead of """"Democratic Party"""" when referring to the Democratic National Committee. http://www.democrats.org/about/faq.html There is an ongoing dispute about the origins of this shorthand term, whether it is a natural shorthand expression, or whether it is derogatory to the party. A 1984 New York Times article suggested Republicans began to use the term when Democrats used their party name to infer """"they are the only true adherents of democracy.""""[1] New Yorker commentator Hendrik Hertzberg wrote that the term """"is a slur intended to ... express contempt.""""[2] He also stated that polling however indicated only """"deeply committed"""" Democrats found the term offensive.[2] Political analyst Charlie Cook attributed use of the term to force of habit rather than a deliberate epithet by Republicans.[3] Ruth Marcus stated that Republicans likely only continue to employ the term because Democrats dislike it.[2] Hertzberg and Marcus both state the use of the term is """"trivial"""".[2][3] [4]

History of usage
The earliest known use of the term, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was by a London stock-market analyst, who wrote in 1890, """"Whether a little farmer from South Carolina named Tillman is going to rule the Democrat Party in America – yet it is this, and not output, on which the proximate value of silver depends.""""[5]

William Safire in [year] wrote about the use of the term, understood as a derogatory reference, and attributed it to Thomas Dewey who he credits with this usage.[6] The term gained popularity during the 1940 presidential campaign of Wendell Wilkie. Wilkie's campaign manager Harold Stassen said, regarding his use in the 1940s, that because the Democratic Party was controlled """"by Hague in New Jersey, Pendergast in Missouri and Kelly-Nash in Chicago, [it] should not be called a 'Democratic Party.' It should be called the 'Democrat Party.'""""[7]

Do you see the difference? All the way through, the dispute about the term should be the subject of the article, not whether it *really* means one thing or another.

I don't know if you listened to this one already, but there are some very good comments about Hartman in the second commentary (the one involving Conan) for Marge vs. the Monorail (it starts about six minutes in and goes on for a bit). Conan says some very nice things about him, and you might be able to use them. Groening also mentions that Hartman insisted on auditioning for the part of Zapp Branigan.  0422 

Just an update, the Movie lost the Environmental Media Award, you may want to add that. On a side note, Marge is proving immensely difficult to write a voice section about, Julie Kavner is notoriously shy, rarely gives interviews and when she does, she refuses to talk about her techniques and usually steers away from The Simpsons.  0422

Yes, but the backlog gets horrible in part because half of the pages there are mistagged. It's a vicious circle we have there. And I understand your view of the criteria but I don't think it's correct because, and that is what I said to Keegan on your RFA as well, admins do not decide whether something is worthy of inclusion. A7 for example is just about whether it may possibly be worthy of inclusion, not if they are worthy. When you gain adminship, you have to remember that your personal views of what is worthy of inclusion and what not are completely irrelevant to your work handling pages where there is doubt (there is an ArbCom case at the moment because one admin decided to delete pages he deemed unencyclopedic outside policy). So carefulness is to be advised in such situations and I am glad you are willing to be more careful.

There are some sketchy things going on with this talk page. All this text recommending deletion was mysteriously archived a few days after it was posted - while everything else on the talk page remained there for nine months. I cut and pasted it again here last week, and -voila!- the same text recommending deletion was archived again today! Hmmm... Anyway, these above entries are nice reports, though unfortunately they do not add much to the questions on notability. The concept of notability must be established through certain types of references (regardless of a person's opinion of the individual). The question is why/how does these references establish notability? If he's interviewed about something, that establishes the notability of the subject of the interview. Rather than saying """"this seems to me to [this or that]"""" - responses on this topic need to be """"this reference establishes/fails to establish notability because..."""" The further one reads into the wiki explanations about notability for people, these cites for Raymond do not have material that is even close:
The person has received a well-known and significant award or honor, or has been nominated for one several times. The person has made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in his or her specific field. Generally, a person who is """"part of the enduring historical record"""" will have been written about, in depth, independently in multiple history books on that field, by historians. A politician who has received """"significant press coverage"""" has been written about, in depth, independently in multiple news feature articles, by journalists. An actor who has been featured in magazines has been written about, in depth, independently in multiple magazine feature articles, by magazine article writers. An actor or TV personality who has """"an independent biography"""" has been written about, in depth, in a book, by an independent biographer. 
This Raymond page is obviously someone's baby, and someone who's account was removed due to sockpuppeting was posting on this talk page last year.

 Power Station Vandalism 

I am writing to question you of your suspected involvement in a vandalism attack on a local power station in Reading, England. We have reason to believe you are the ring leader of a vandal street gang known as the 'Purple Unity and Red Jack's' that are localised to southern Reading. On Thursday 21st April 2011, upon the residents of the area witnessing the attack, in which seven vandals caused costly damage to the structure and it's fences as well as many surrounding trees, a cardboard banner was attached to the fence reading """"Under orders of Gwern"""".

This is not the only occasion in which your Wikipedia account has been referenced. On Saturday January 1st 2011, the same gang was seen attempting to transport themselves onto the Madejski Stadium roof using cannons to release a banner over the East Stand reading """"We will never bow to hatred; we will never fall to society, we will never rest for fear of our mission failing - All Hail Gwern"""". The initial aim failed, they never were able to reach the roof; however, their banner was slung over a nearby house for all to see.

Also, on 12th December 2010, a middle-aged man was seen sprinting away from elderly people with several teenagers following and aiding him. On his shirt, he was revealed to be sporting the words """"Gwern"""". 

Now, we have strong suspicions that you are this Gwern person, and we have every intention of arriving at the truth. We will be in contact if we arrive at any more information. Thankyou for your time.

 Alawis 
hello im new to this and dont quite no how i would send you a message through this? 
but how would we be able to discuss the Alawi page? 
i found some things that you were tryin to explain be incorrect. Every Alawi person i no Woships the Imam Ali in the Shia way, and worship all of the Prophet Mohammads family, and the we worship both the Prophet Mohammad and the Imam Ali, and follow both their teaching, we do not just follow the Imam Ali teachings, we follow the Prophets as well. Alawi int he past 50 years have become closer to Shia, and do not celebrate Christmas. Or any other Christian Eids. I know from me and my family we celebrate all Shia Eids, and for Ramadan nearly every year we choose to fast. And yes our teachings are kept private (not secrete) —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)   
Well, we should probably discuss this on the talk page on the Alawi article, but anyway, I believe the Alawite beliefs vary quite a bit, my family do for example celebrate Christmas and other Christian festivals, but they are Lebanese, so they may have retained more of the original Alawite beliefs than the ones in Syria, who try harder to be accepted as true Muslims, so that the validity of Bashar Assad's presidency isn't questioned.    

My family is Alawi, and we celebrate the Shia Eids. We dont celebrate Christmas how can we, when we dont believe the story of the 3 wise men, ad we dont believe in Joseph, to Muslims Marry wasnt married and God had sent """"Zacaria"""" to guard her.et c 
The part about How we Worship the Imam Al, to Alawi we follow both Teachings of the Imam Ali and the Prophet Mohammad. None of them come first, in your case your kinda saying that Ali comes first before the prophet. Alawi only have the Quran and their own scriputres as Islamic text. And iv read from other websites that Aparantly Alawi worship the Imam ALi like a God, when we dont. When you are trying to Explain the Trinity thing, your as basicly saying that we belive Ali is God, in 3 forms, which complely contridicts the point of us being Muslim. That there is no one but Allah and there is only One god, and he has no sons etc. And we believe in Rencarnation as is. And your should say that when the boys study the Alawi text, you should say after 15/16 boys can choose to go deeper into the relgion and study more, or choose not to study more. i no from my grandfather he went deep into the relgion and spent his whole life studying it. Where as my dad stoped when he got married and had kids (so around 22). 
Well, I didn't write the article, and I'm not sure who added the trinity stuff, but if it isn't sourced, it probably shouldn't be there. As for beliefs, well, as I mentioned before, the Alawites in Syria have changed their beliefs to become more like mainstream Muslims, so many of the older traditions might not be practiced there. It's different in Lebanon though, where the Syrian government is unable to regulate the sects like in Syria.

Guys, gals... We're going to go round and round forever here. For a section that is designed to merely state the very simple concept of a Hasse diagram, it might as well be a section about which religion is the true one for all the controversy it has stirred!

 Now the square is """"naughty"""" because it's regular and self dual, not to mention its number of vertices and edges is a perfect square and the first non-composite. Okay, we could use my example of an amorphic polyhedron, but then we're back to rather complex and unintuitive diagrams. 

 Frankly I really don't care for clickable popups. If it's necessary for the concept, it should be there all the time. If it's not, why clutter the article?

We don't have to (and nor should we wish to) teach all there is to know about AP's in a single section, and in fact Queen Elizabeth looks likely to become Britain's longest-reigning monarch.

 Bot automation at Wikipedia:Today's articles for improvement 

Over the past two weeks, there has been extensive discussion on introducing bot automation to assist with maintenance of the Today's Articles for Improvement project. A  has now been approved for trial and will carry out the weekly duties. The bots first run will occur around ' (midnight on Sunday).If you have been assisting any of the weekly maintenance tasks, please refrain from doing so this week. The bot needs to be tested and proven it can do the job, and it only gets one chance per week. The tasks will include:
 Adding the new scheduled article to Wikipedia talk:Today's articles for improvement and removing the entry from Wikipedia:Articles for improvement
 Set up the schedule pages for the new TAFI, except the adding of an image and caption
 Adding  to the new article for improvement, remove  from last week's article and add  to the talk page
 Notify relevant WikiProjects that the new TAFI is within their scope
 Send a mass message to everyone on the notification list of the new TAFI selection

Updating the accomplishments and archiving selections is still done manually, along with daily' tasks such as adding approved entries to the articles for improvement page. These will become automated in the near future.

We hope the bot proves to serve well, and by carrying out the routine housekeeping tasks we can boost the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the project.  thanks you for your service in helping with the weekly tasks in the past, and for your cooperation during this trial period )

Errr...Joanot, who told you that you have binding authority to establish votings which by-pass wikipedia policies and, not happy with that, fixing deadlines etc? Did you see yourself like a neutral editor or an administrator taking care of this page? Because you are not either, are you?

You can organize as many polls as you want, establish very strict deadlines, limiting the answers to YES or NO, etc. All very impressive. But you just can't by-pass the wikipedia policies nor the consensus we had reached here over the months just because you would like to rewrite the article in each and every contentious points (about the rest, you never cared in the slightest). All like if many different editors wouldnt have worked on that (including you) and like if all the work and agreements were, all of a sudden, worthless just because you think so. It doesnt work like that, Mr.

There are two very clear policy guidelines below in the last """"Once Again"""" thread which you havent bothered to reply, didnt you notice them? or maybe is it so much more fun to organize a poll and email everybody and their grandmother from ca:wiki which you think will support your point of view rather than stickign to boring policy rules?. Or maybe you noticed these two policies but, since you are a smart guy, you looked the other way and made like if they werent there because they are definite and crystal clear, even if you dont like them (at least I agree with you in that polls are definitely much more entertaining than wikipedia policies, but life is life and there are some rules to abide, even if you dont like them)

In any case, whether you like them or not, policies are binding, and, fortunately they are clear enough in this case.

As for polls, do you know this other policy? WP:DEMOCRACY? let me quote it for you just in case, because it seems made for you:

Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy or any other political system. Its primary method of determining consensus is through editing and discussion, not voting. Although editors occasionally use straw polls in an attempt to test for consensus, polls or surveys may actually impede rather than assist discussion. They should be used with caution, if at all, and will not be treated as binding.

So now we have three policies against your wishes to rewrite this article the way you would like it. Three policies against nothing but a lot noise and a massive attack to the existing consensus which generally works well for everybody, except for you. Let's see how this ends and then we will meet you again next Christmas, I presume. Can't wait. MOUNTOLIVE  fedeli alla linea """,0

I thought you might like to know that the Awards Center page has been deleted, along with its newsletter.  (

So, where do we go from here?

To new and even more interesting projects, of course!

As announced in the newsletter, I've been preparing to co-coordinate a large collaboration/competition called Around the World.  It was going to be run at the Awards Center, but since that no longer exists, the collaboration will be hosted somewhere else.

Around the World will begin July 15th as planned - it's location will be announced soon.  

It'll be a blast.  In the competition, participants will be helping to develop over 200 pages (drafts, which will be moved to article space once they are ready), using advanced tools to edit every single one of them!

This is going to be interesting.

And the event shall have awards which are being created specifically for it as we speak!

If you would like me to keep you informed of this and other interesting collaborations I'll be working on and/or organizing in the future, please drop me a note on my talk page, and I'll be happy to keep you in the know.

A hypothesis of distant genetic relationship

Asia; it holds that Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic
(Manchu-Tungusic), together comprising some forty
languages, are genetically related. More extended
versions of the Altaic hypothesis would include Korean
and Japanese, sometimes also Ainu. Various scholars in
the early and mid 1800s proposed classifications that
would group some or all of the ‘Altaic’ languages
together, but typically these were included in larger, more
poorly defined proposed affiliations, such as the now
abandoned Ural-Altaic hypothesis.(p.7)

Now abandoned is Ural-Altaic relation which was replaced with , not Altaic.

Ainu, Nivkh, Chukotian and Eskimo–Aleut as members
of a very large ‘linguistic stock’. While there is considerable
overlap in the putative members of Eurasiatic and
Nostratic there are also significant differences. Eurasiatic
has been sharply criticized and is largely rejected by

 Balancing Ross, Krakaeur et al with FLDS sites...and Knoll. A redux 

(The following is chiefly excerpted from commentary above.) External links are many. Should readers follow the link to Bannking on Heaven, they'll quickly size up it's journalistic expose by Jon Kraukaeur and Ruth Cooke, featuring Elaine Jeffs, Carolyn Jessop, and Penny Peterson; should they click over to Rick Ross Institute, that they're at a Christian apologetic anti-heresy site; and should they end up at FLDS 101, that they're at an anon blog by a highly informed partisan giving his take, albeit much more dispassionately in many aspects than either of the two alternate sources I just mentioned. 

Anyways, a fundamentalist Latter Day Saint (at least generically by culture and or belief, although obviously not currently beholden to the Jeffs-led, specifically FLDS faith) is in the process of blogging a veritable compendium of FLDS doctrines and beliefs known as FLDS 101, blogging under the psuedonym Berry Knoll, in which he quotes extensively from the lectures of Warren Steed Jeffs and from excerpts of interviews with current and former members of the polygamous splinter group. (Insiders would recognize Berry Knoll as the """"juniper-covered hill south of town"""" (Colorado City, Arizona/Hildale, Utah...)

As the FLDS leadership continued to prophesy that the end of the world was quickly approaching, they taught the people that wickedness needed to be purged from their society. Jeffs taught, 'One or two covenant breakers can cause the Lord to stop blessing this people. As long as we have evil doers among us, the Lord's blessings will be withheld. Zion must be pure. We can't have evil people among the priesthood for the Lord to appear and bless us like He would like to. Be this a warning.' (W.S.J. 12/26/95) Jeffs laid the doctrinal groundwork to justify a cleansing of the FLDS. Their theology teaches that an ancient city lead by a prophet named Enoch, was taken up into heaven because of their righteousness. The FLDS believe they can be taken up too as the wicked world is destroyed.""""[... ... """"Yearning for Zion,"""" a hymn by W.S.

One source for most of the firms is a blog and the other source for the Mérida Casuals Crew is the firms own website, which again is not a reliable source as it has to be an independent source. This is not saying that there is doubt as to whether these firms exist, just that the sources need to be things like online newspaper articles (preferrably in English or at least with a translation in English as this is the English wikipedia) or other similar sites.

"""This needs an additional citation for the first part ([2] only refers to him now being labelled a cheat). Henry has never been a fair footballer, the match has just brought to light the foul play he has ALWAYS used to get an upper hand (even the biased french and arsenal fans realise). Furthermore, the quote by Wenger that """"he is one of the fairest players I have managed"""" holds no weight since:

1) It is a biased view from a man who managed Henry for years.

2) It is a view from a man who has managed a great number of cheating players during many years at Arsenal so saying Henry is one of the fairest isn't saying much. 

In summary I think that the line should be changed to:

The RfC I was referring to was the informal one on the article talk page; I notice no one has responded to it but we have all chosen the threaded discussion instead. I'm all for an outside discussion, but I'm thinking you may not approve of the Denialism category itself, which is a whole 'nuther argument. Have you checked it out to see what's in it? 
I think you may have missed what we are saying is being deniedevolution. We are not saying that to believe in God is denialism or that God is a fairy tale. I believe in God (Elohim, Jehovah, El Shaddai). We're saying that denying evolution is denialism of the accepted scientific theory. You wrote, """"While some editors have argued that this refers to ID's alleged denial of evolution. . ."""" Why """"alleged""""? I quoted Behe to you from the DI's website: """"Darwinism is false."""" That is patent denial of evolution. 
I agree with Cla88's post of 00:57, 28 February 2012. The first paragraph of the lede is deeply flawed, and probably the tone of the whole article is dismissive editorializing rather than objective presentation of the concept. I haven't read the whole thing at one sitting for a long time, so I'm not sure of that. The first paragraph is very confusing on the identity of the designer, which should not even be brought up there. (ID proponents, though, are themselves two-faced about this point.) This subject is very contentious and I despair of ever seeing a fully objective article. When I'm in Wiki-land, I do as the Wikipedians doadhere to the 5 pillars.
Also, I hope you've caught on that the specific variety of intelligent design of which this particular article treats is the ID of the Discovery Institute and its affiliates and sympathizers. (Can't think of a better word than sympathizerfollower, maybe; those who agree with and may promote the idea without actually being affiliated. The community church on the corner, for example.)

 Explanation of blocks 
Blocking is a serious matter. The community expects that blocks will be made with good reasons only, based upon reviewable evidence and reasonable judgment, and that all factors that support a block are subject to independent peer review if requested. 

 Notifying the blocked user 
Administrators must supply a clear and specific block reason which indicates why a user was blocked. Block reasons should avoid the use of jargon as much as possible so that blocked users may better understand them. Administrators should also notify users when blocking them by leaving a message on their user talk page unless they have a good reason not to. It is often easier to explain the reason for a block at the time than it is to explain a block well after the fact.

When implementing a block, a number of pro forma block reasons are available in a drop-down menu; other or additional reasons can also be added. Users can be notified of blocks and block reasons using a number of convenient template messages—see Category:User block templates and Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace.",0

It would be difficult to classify tools based on both their intended and unintended purpose, but at the same time screw drivers are very frequently misused to pry open containers of paint.
I haven't found any source classifying (or even defining well enough to make a category) tools either. I think we might be best off creating our own definitionnot in the sense of original research, but purely for the purpose of better organizing the encyclopedia. Here's a thought (just a rudimentary idea): let's say there are passive and active tools. Passive tools create no tangible effectthese are measuring devices, ladders, flashlights, stools, clamps (unless they are used for crushing), jacks, beakers, tape recorders(?). Active tools have a tangible effect: drills, pencils, hammers, nail clippers, spatulas, shovels. In general tools act on a material (although not necessarily a specific material, like a flashlight will act on most things): pencils act on paper, egg beaters act on eggs, saws on wood or metal, caulk guns on caulk, paint brushes on paint, beakers on chemicals. So consider a container of correction fluid: the little brush on the inside of the lid is the active tool, the container is the passive tool and the whiteout is the material.

 This smacks of political revisionism of the worst kind; what is known in English as the Arabic Numerals are the Arabic Western Numerals, not even the Arabic Eastern Numerals. Yes, they are derived from ancient Indian numerals but nonetheless they are the Arabic Numerals. Look here, the norm is that when people in English say Arabic Numerals they are referring to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, those are the Arabic (Western) Numerals, they are not referring to १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८, ९, and other varities of Indian numerals, modern or ancient. They are known in English as the Arabic Numerals, that's a fact, I will not accept a revisionist statement that counters a fact so early on in the text the article, the article must start with the factual. I'll accept it under a revisionism section much later on, but it must be balanced there with opinions counter to it (counter to the counterfactual). 

 """"... what are known in English as """"Arabic numerals"""" were neither invented nor widely used by the Arabs."""", """"In the Arab World—until modern times—the Arabic numeral system was used only by mathematicians. Muslim scientists used the Babylonian numeral system, and merchants used a numeral system similar to the Greek numeral system and the Hebrew numeral system. Therefore, it was not until Fibonacci that the Arabic numeral system was used by a large population.""""
 What reliable sources do you have that they were not widely used by the Arabs? Why don't you cite reliable sources? Here's evidence that they were  The numerals though were already in wide use throughout the Arab empire, as Avicenna who was born in 980 tells in his autobiography that he learnt them, as a child, from a humble vegetable seller. He also tells that when his father, in Bukhara, was visited by scholars from Egypt in 997, including Abu Abdullah al-Natili, they taught him more about them. J J O'Connor and E F Robertson point out: He also tells of being taught Indian calculation and algebra by a seller of vegetables. All this shows that by the beginning of the eleventh century calculation with the Indian symbols was fairly widespread and, quite significantly, was known to a vegetable trader.

 """"The first inscriptions using 0 in India have been traced to approximately 200 CE.""""
 Why don't you cite reliable sources?! Here, I'll cite some: According to Professor EF Robertson and DR JJ O'Connor, """"The first record of the Indian use of zero which is dated and agreed by all to be genuine was written in 876"""" on the Gwalior tablet stone. This is also verified by Professor Lam Lay Yong, an an Effective Member of the International Academy of the History of Science """"the earliest appearance in India of a symbol for zero in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is found in an inscription at Gwalior which is dated 870 AD"""". According to Menninger (p. 400): """"This long journey begins with the Indian inscription which contains the earliest true zero known thus far (Fig. 226). This famous text, inscribed on the wall of a small temple in the vicinity of Gvalior (near Lashkar in Central India) first gives the date 933 (A.D. 870 in our reckoning) in words and in Brahmi numerals. Then it goes on to list four gifts to a temple, including a tract of land """"270 royal hastas long and 187 wide, for a flower-garden."""" Here, in the number 270 the zero first appears as a small circle (fourth line in the Figure); in the twentieth line of the inscription it appears once more in the expression """"50 wreaths of flowers"""" which the gardeners promise to give in perpetuity to honor the divinity."""" The Encyclopaedia Britannica says, """"Hindu literature gives evidence that the zero may have been known before the birth of Christ, but no inscription has been found with such a symbol before the 9th century."""" I'll accept mention prior to the Gwalior tablet, in fact, the article needs it and I'm planning on doing it once I'm no longer distracted by your nonsense, but such mention must be well-phrased so as not to mislead and contradict scientific consensus, and the phrasing must be limited to the exact intent of verifiable and reliable sources.

I don't disagree with your point, except that I'm not exactly trying to appease here (I guess it sounded that way though) - I actually think both points of view have merit which is why I'd go with the Anglo-Australian type of construction (and maybe drop the Manx in the first sentence). As I said, if you had asked me before this discussion started where the Bee Gees were from, I would have said Australia, based on how I recall them being promoted in the 60s, and I also totally see the logic of considering them English so the dual wording does make sense to me.   I've looked a bit and haven't come up with anything on the web to answer that question yet - maybe you'll have more luck.   

By the way, Olivia Newton-John may be relevant here:  she is considered Australian as well, and her WIki article calls her """"English-born Australian"""" or words to that effect.  Her bio says she was born in England, moved to Australia at age 5 and moved back to England at 16 where she began recording - a pretty similar story to the BeeGees, and she's listed as Australian which might be how she self-identifies, I don't know.  But on a quick read it appears she only lived there for about 10 years, like them.

As for whether this editing is personal, I have no idea and don't want to get into it.  I do know that I  am trying to reach consensus among different points of view, on this exceedingly minor point - and as I have said, there was some fussing about it a couple of months ago and it settled down with the awkward wording, because it is accurate.  So I hope we can drop this quickly and move on to something more substantive.    """,0

 'Self-immolation' article 

I have experienced all manner of wikilawyering, hostility and disruption possible at the Falun Gong pages, which has turned me away as a potential sympathiser. I have officially retired from editing those articles, having concluded that it is pointless for me to continue there - Wikipedia seems all too tolerant of conflicted-out editors and disruptive point-pushers, by not banning  indefinitely. As I was the leading editor which got the 'self-immolation' article to FA, I felt closer to that article and thus decided to revisit it recently; I reserve my continue to do so from time to time, without feeling that I have violated any self-imposed 'retirement'. However, I do not intend on contributing to the ongoing discussion there. I hope that you will abide by my wish not copy my post across.

The fundamental problem I see is that the FLG practitioners appear to exist in a rarefied atmosphere of their alternate paradigm - like many Chinese, they subscribe to fatalism that everything is intended or planned by powerful forces. They cannot accept that independent acts of free will can occur, nor can they accept that any PRC source can be legitimately cited, because they are not reliable. The table which is currently subject to debate has been the target of removal by Dilip some time in the past, on the grounds that it was propaganda. By my reckoning, the table is carefully cited and attributed, and all the information therein belongs there. Just apply the same benchmark to any other piece of information there (such as name and occupation), and you will see that the practitioners' wanting to remove mentions that they may have been practitioners is wholly inconsistent bullshit, and an attempt at censorship. 

I believe the article was, at the time it was declared FA, materially compliant with WP:NPOV. It was in a very delicate state of balance, with neither side having the overall conclusion or last word, and with the readers being more or less able to decide for themselves what probably occurred. It has already been knocked off balance by those SPAs, who cannot tolerate any possibility, however remote, that practitioners may have been involved. What those editors want, IMHO, is completely at odds with the fundamental tenets of WP. They will work tirelessly to chip away at all those bits of text they find objectionable, so that a one-sided article exonerating Falun Gong will emerge over a period of time if vigilant editors like you are not around to challenge what they are doing - using a loose definition of the word. I just know I'm mentally exhausted from fighting them over the years.  ¡digame! """,0

Nevertheless, what I was trying to accomplish with the Moline page was to take a wikipedia entry that was woefully lacking and add some real value to it  I had added the the Moline page a """"location"""", """"air travel"""", """"major interstate highways"""", """"sports"""", """"gambling"""", and """"landmarks; and notable bridges"""" sections.  Additionally, I completely revamped the schools section into an """"education"""" section that provided internal and external links to every school mentioned.  You removed all of that.  BTW, I tried to document all of my efforts in the Discussion page, so anyone could see what I was trying to do: make the Moline page better.

Narayana Guru and Atheism

I disagree with the text in this section. Associating Narayana Guru with atheism clearly shows the lack of knowledge of the originating author on the Guru's philosophical and metaphysical works and perspective and reasoning of the Universe. Proclaimed atheists being associated with an individual in social reform initiatives does not by itself make the individual an atheist.

Also there is a clear distinction between rationalists and atheists.

This section needs to be edited.

Narayana Guru and Sahodran Ayyappan

Narayana Guru had disagreed with Sahodaran Ayyappan when the latter tried to corrupt Guru's teachings with Atheism.In fact Ayyappan requested Guru's permission to modify the slogan  'Oru Jati , Oru Matham, Oru Daivam Manushyanu' as 'Jati Venda, Matham Venda, Daivam Venda'. However, Guru ridiculed him by asking """" If Ayyappan wants to collect Rs.1 from each person to set up a library,  you will ask ' Give One Rupee,Give One Rupee,Give One Rupee'. Does that mean ' No Rupee,No Rupee,No Rupee """" ?

This 'Sahodaran' kept quiet at that time.However, he renewed his Atheist activities after the samadhi of Guru, thereby corrupting Guru's ideology. Vested interests fully exploited this confusion to corrupt Guru's teachings by projecting this 'Sahodaran' even above Guru.

Clarification on Atheism

No where in the article did I say that Naryanaguru was an atheist. What I wrote was “his attitude towards the existence of a personal god is considered quite ambivalent” and that many of his followers had considered him an atheist.  Can somebody point out which sentence of the article gives such an impression that he was an atheist?  It goes to the credit of Sri Narayanaguru that in spite of being a theist, he openly accepted even atheists as his core desciples. The importance of this can be guaged only if one consideres the period in which he lived.

One also has to be clear about the kind of thiesm Narayana Guru adovocated. It definitely was not the one associated with the brahaminical/casteist Hiduism.

I find it bit difficult to comprehend why this section on atheism and atheist followers of Narayanaguru should be edited out.  A discussion/debate on the philosophy of Narayanaguru is thoroughly understandable but I find it puzzling that the followers of Narayanaguru are getting overly agitated on hearing the word atheism. Pity indeed! 

And I agree with Aaroamal that there is a distintion between rationalist and atheist. That is precisely why I assert in my user page of wikipedia that I am both an atheist and rationalist.

 Clarification on Atheism 

Manoj, True, you did not explicitly write that Narayana Guru was an atheist. However, you implicitly structured a (misinformed and incomplete) statement as follows:

 “When Sahodaran Ayyappan modified Narayana Guru's famous catchphrase, Oru Jati, Oru Matham, Oru Daivam Manushyanu (One Caste, One Religion, One God for Humanbeing) and re-written it as Jati Venda, Matham Venda, Daivam Venda Manushyanu…the latter did not protest”. 

Obviously by stating that “…the latter did not protest”, here you are clearly implying that Narayana Guru accepted Sahodaran Ayyappan’s atheistic view as amendment to the famous catchphrase. I am sorry to say that this is absolutely false!

Everybody appreciates that Narayana Guru was tolerant of atheists because he respected an individual’s fundamental right and freedom to belief, or disbelief, in the exitence of God. That tolerant attitude however should not be misinterpreted to imply otherwise.

As Krishnan has already pointed out, Narayana Guru’s reaction to Sahodaran Ayyappan’s revised version of the slogan was a clear protest, so it is not true to say …”the latter did not protest”.

Please could you explain what you mean by saying, “his attitude towards the existence of a personal god is considered quite ambivalent”; are you referring to any of Narayana Guru’s writings, if so which one? Which serious scholar of Narayana Guru has so commented? Also, in what context is that statement being included under the heading “Narayana Guru and Atheism”.

Hi, I've edited the China/Temp page:

 restored the table per the WikiProject Countries page

Although I have rewritten some of the text, I think I have not really touched it's contents. Roadrunner, Fred, what do you think?  00:52 Aug 3, 2002 (PDT)

It's less objectionable, but I still have a small problem with it.  The basic problem is that is seems to imply the the PRC """"owns"""" say the history of Tang Dynasty.  Also,
it doesn't really take into account current events.  One of
the things that the PRC government has been doing in the past year has been to """"delink"""" the concept of the PRC from the concept of China.  You can see this in the response to Chen Shuibian that was issued today where the PRC was
went out of its way to avoid identifying the PRC with China.

I'll probably drop out of the discussion for a few days and
let other people comment (as well as try to articulate better what still bothers me about the page).

 User:Roadrunner

 Ok, we're moving towards a solution, so that's good. As for the Tang dynasty (though I think you mean it more genral), I think that Taiwan did not form part of the Tang empire. Anyway, there's nothing against mentioning the Tang dynasty at Taiwan as well.

 We may indeed specifically include (in the history? header? """"disclaimer""""?) that the PRC avoids linking its name to China. Then again, it may de-link it formally, but all those people around the world will continue to associate the two. 

 I'll await your remaining problems with the contents, confident we'll end up with an article that satisfies the both of us (and, hopefully, """"everybody else"""").  13:07 Aug 5, 2002 (PDT)

Guys, after reading this tedious list of conversation, my sugguestion of the best way out of the naming convention of China is using those by native speakers of Chinese. As a native speaker of several dialects of Chinese, I make the following table which should help: 

How native Chinese speakers refer to:
Speakers from
Mainland China
Taiwan
HongKong
Macau

Referring to China (Mainland)
China
Mainland (daliu)
Mainland or Zhongguo Daliu (chong-gua-da-lok in Cantonese)
Mainland

Taiwan
Taiwan or Taiwan Province (the more official tone)
Taiwan
Taiwan
Taiwan

China (the culture etc., non-political issue
China
China
China
China

Most Chinese, regardless of where they are from, care less about the naming convention but some Taiwanese (like my buddy who is gonna marry next month) DO NOT WANT Mainland China to annex Taiwan and had bad impression on Chen Shuibian.

 Knowing what the Chinese call it is certainly interesting, but what is important is what the English-language people call it. 

I'm with Jeronimo. I also thought all of this already had been resolved  China should be the main article of the PRoC. It doesn't matter what they officially call it or want it to be called. English speakers call it China in overwhelming numbers. This is also the conventional short form used by the CIA and the UN and we have decided that that is what we will use for country names here. If we don't stick to that then we are expressly taking sides in political naming issues. The fact that the PRoC is currently trying to dissociate their government from """"China"""" (which seems counter intuitive for a totalitarian regime..) is an interesting thing to mention in the article on the PRoC at China. If we change the name of the article to follow political correctness of the PRoC that is an express act of support for their policy. I for one say we defer such naming matters to higher authorities such as the CIA Factbook, the UN and especially what is most commonly used by English speakers. True they are POV institutions but transcribing what they use is a passive and not express act of POV. Wikipedia is not in the business to decide what the names of nations are  other institutions are far better suited at this highly charged topic. I also think the disclaimer is way too long and bold should be replaced by italics. Any article on the PRoC sho",0

Rather than state what you had done, you gave the vague description, removed contrarian remark.  This was a terrible edit on your part because not only is it absolute truth that the equations to be solved are not equations for a hyperbola, it is extremely important that the readers be told this fact.  The reason for this is because there is much discussion relating to hyperbolas in the section which is quite likely to mislead the reader into believing that the equations to be solved are equations for a hyperbola.

"The only thing that was a bit thick was my prose.  The old criticism is that if the pedigree were true, then two children of AEthelred II would be marrying two descendants of AEthelric, the first one generation down, the second 4 generations down.  Hart basically rejected this as absurd on its face, that you could have such a 3 generation difference - Edward marrying his brother-in-law's great-grandniece. Kelley argues that Edward was a generation younger than his half-sister, so the three generation difference becomes two.  Eadric at 40 could have married a 18-year old daughter of AEthelred, meaning the generation difference is now only 1.  Edward could have married an Eadgyth a half-generation or more younger than he was, and Eadric could have been a half-generation younger than his brother AEthelmaer, completely removing the chronological problem.  He was basically saying that, as ridiculous as the difference in generations appears on first glance, it is not as unlikely as it might seem. 
 As to why he is explaining away the AEthelric pedigree, one of the earlier authors had accepted the descend from Wulfric to AEthelmaer, and then suggested that Florence (recte John) had been confused between two AEthelmaers, and that Eadric was not brother of AEthelmaer the Stout.  Kelley is simply saying that this need not be the case, that Eadric could have been brother of AEthelmaer the Stout, that the siblings shown by John of W could all be the children of AEthelweard.  He suggests three possible explanations: A) that one pedigree showing Godwin son of Wulfnoth son of AEthelmaer was mistakenly or fraudulently linked into a second that showed Eadric Streona as son of AEthelric, B) there was an mistaken exchanging two names, such that the authentic pedigree originally showed Eadric, AEthelmaer and an AEthelric as sons of AEthelweard, and somewhere along the lines this was transposed as Eadric, AEthelmaer and AEthelweard as children of AEthelric, or C) that the authentic original pedigree showed the same brothers as sons of AEthel-weard, son of Ead-ric, and a mistaken contraction of these two generations resulted in them simply becoming AEthel-ric. Kelley favors explanation B.",0

"Indeed, you're probably on to something. I think the Fourth Generation fighter page has really helped clear up things and added some much needed depth. If it is something that could be agreed on by the whole 'community' than perhaps there could be a seperate page for each generation of fighter jet linked from the main fighter aircraft page(and perhaps prop fighters as well). Until then though there isn't really any sort of guidline as to this specific page other for the sake of completeness. It is in my opinion that until seperate pages are created for Third, Second and First generation fighter jets then I don't really think the addition of one aircraft will really cause a lot of problem until such action is undertaken. Especially given that pretty much every single jet fighter is already on the list. The days of where nearly every country could create their own fighter like in WWII are long gone. Perhaps to at least organise the clutter, rather than listing aircraft vertically, it could be done horizontally like with the inter-war aircraft to at least make the page 'shorter'.

Bolsheviks? Are you suggesting that i shouldn't forcefully challenge the proposed introduction of the topic of Bolsheviks into this article??? That's roughly equivalent to the old red-baiting practice of calling union organizers commies.

But that's just one of the obvious examples, and therefore easy to challenge. An example of the more subtle bias that has crept in  the article has been edited to claim,

Union Busting is a term used by labor organizations and trade unions to describe the activities that may be undertaken by employers, their proxies, workers and in certain instances states and governments usually triggered by events such as picketing, card check, organizing, and strike actions...

In other words, the workers begin to organize, or the union takes some sort of concrete action, and there is a response.

Well, (the reader may conclude,) if the union advocates would just go away, everything would be peachy-keen.

But that doesn't hint at the reality faced by some of my friends and family who have worked at Wal-Mart, where even a vague rumor brings a special visit (together with their indoctrination program) the suits from their corporate union busting division. And they eavesdrop on phone and email conversations of their employees to pick out any such rumor. They've even used high tech bugs, and infiltrators to police their employees for any suggestion of concerted activity.

Or how about my nephew who worked as a chef for a major hotel chain; when a new corporate conglomerate bought out the chain, they issued an edict which they claimed was for """"the privacy of associates."""" Anyone employed at the hotel chain was no longer allowed to use the last name of any other employee, under any circumstances, except when required for official business. My nephew (who has never been a union activist) says it was an obvious new rule aimed at making it more difficult for employees to communicate with each other outside of their place of employment. He described it as pre-emptive union busting. Not in any sense a reaction to """"events such as picketing, card check, organizing, and strike actions..."""" 

In brief, this article used to be pretty well focused on the issue of union busting. But in some places it has been edited to create a false impression about the reality of union busting. I won't say the editors are biased, but the edits sure the heck are. Others may draw their own conclusions.   """,0

If I sticked to that rule, I would need to start an investigation on this faked block and its violation resulting in a sanction against you, but this just would be another skirmish that would distract the original need - to free this article of biased and one-sided passages. A prime example is the Discovery section that actually consist of pointing out unpreparedness and to say in a roundabout way that Scott would be the only one to blame for that, no mention that he wasn't even involved in all aspects of the preparation and that contemporaries like Hugh Robert Mill, librarian of the Royal Geographical Society said Scott""""if anyone, could bring order out of the chaos which had overtaken the plans and preparations"""".. Concealing positive statements like this and only pointing out things diminuishing Scott's achievements is not only embezzling to the reader but greatly contradicts the requirements of neutrality in a encyclopaedic context. The same goes for the embarassingly biased and ashamedly one-sided Controversies article (that deliberately tells not even half of the whole story and intentionally conceals all arguments from the other side of the spectrum...). This article hadn't been linked for ages, and out of some emotional situation, he recently just added it to the Main Scott article, despite its violations of neutrality and biasedness. The most logic thing to not let this article's neutrality be further undermined, I removed the link. Ruhrfisch fought tooth and nails to prevent me from doing this (which once again shows that he's not interested in adding any positive aspects concerning the person Robert Falcon Scott whatsoever and tries with a vengeance to prevent anyone from doing so. It is no accident that from my edits, which included mentioning aspects of misfortune like the extraordinarily base character of some of the ponies, comments about the man-hauling or statements from contemorary explorers, all of these have been removed by this single user!

The article is almost certainly made up, so I will assume that. Interesting theory, but I believe you have it backwards, at least in terms of notability. The conflicts between an epic hero and their nemesis came first, and are considerably more discussed in literature, so the essay should be written to explain and show that bosses are a similar plot device, etc, as the epic conflicts, not the other way around. 
Finally, in the event that the article is made up, such is not suitable for inclusion on WP. That is WP's loss, if you ask me, and you may, but no one at WP will ask me, and that's the point.

As they have now played their first gig with new members (Feb. 6), the band should be considered active again. Alternatively, they could be considered active again when an official statement is made revealing new members. So, options:
Wolfmother are active from 2000–present;
Wolfmother are active from 2000–2008 (Aug.), (Feb.) 2009–present; or

 Corrections to discussion about sky glow in LP page and in main sky glow page. 

1. Light is scattered by molecules (Rayleigh scattering) and aerosols - not """"refracted.""""
2. Aerosol scattering dominates in most places - in """"clear ir"""" (see Garstang, 1986, PASP), the total scattering from aerosols is ~10x that from molecules.
3. Aerosol scattering has almost no wavelength dependence, reducing the dominance of blue light influence below that expected from pure Rayleigh scattering and the RSI of Keith.
4. But, the Purkinje effect makes the eye more sensitive to white/blue rich light when dark adapted (most relevant when looking at/adapted to sky glow; only marginally relevant when looking at/adapted to outdoor night lighting levels), increasing again the dominance of white/blue-rich sources.
5. The Bortle scale has made very little or no penetration into professional astronomy - astronomers, when they characterize skyglow at all, still use mag/arcsec2.  Bortle scale is being used by amateurs and is being investigated in some detail by US National Park Service as a useful scale to characterize night sky quality.  Finally, the Bortle scale uses much more than just sky glow to characterize skies.

Jayjg, is there any edit to this article you would accept? What are your objections to clarifying ethnic vs. religious definitions of """"Jews""""? The article is currently confusing as to which is which, and it would help to clarify that JfJ means ethnic Jews. I think in the case Mackan points out, """"many"""" is appropriately used-many Jewish groups do see JfJ that way, but certainly not all (I would imagine there are plenty of Jewish groups without any official position on JfJ.) Also, most religions are rather fluid and change over time, and there is often debate over interpretation. It is, therefore, not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact (Jews don't believe in Jesus as Messiah? What about Messianic Judaism?) Of course, religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism (""""my way is the correct one"""" type of thinking), so sometimes it's difficult to see debates to that as valid. WP:WEASEL does not object to ever using """"many"""" or """"most"""" or the like as qualifiers, it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing. What we have here is a lot of sourcing, which does not, however, show that all Jews object to JfJ (as I explained above, that would be effectively impossible). It does, of course, show that """"many"""" do (I wouldn't even object to """"almost all"""" or """"most""""), but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of WP:NPOV (JfJ's assertion that it is Jewish must be treated as plausible), it is impossible that all Jewish organizations disagree-as JfJ doesn't!

Hey Octopus, first and foremost, awesome work on creating a table of notability for football clubs and comps. Much appreciated by all, I'm sure. =)

I'm writing this to see about . A previous user messaged you about adding the old and proposed national cups in late 2012. Since then, two major changes have occurred in Australian Football. The first is not-surprisingly the development of the FFA Cup from a proposal, to a legitimate tournament. The second change is a little more subtle, but still extremely notable. The alignment of 8 of the 9 State Leagues into a national second division.

The updated version I'm suggesting is for the A-League (1), National Soccer League (1), National Premier Leagues (8) to be deemed notable. Your previous list also mentions the Brisbane Premier League (a third division) as notable.

I was also wondering if the following third division leagues (all containing promotion spots to the National Premier Leagues competitions) could also be deemed notable:
National Premier Leagues NSW 2 (12/12 clubs within this league have articles) (Note: This is the most prestigious third division competition in Australia).
National Premier Leagues Victoria 1 (20/20 clubs within this league have articles)
National Premier Leagues State League (16/16 clubs within this league have articles)

H_1 infinite means there's a non-separating surface; irrreduciblity means it can't be a sphere.  Compressing the surface gives a pi_1-injective surface, so the 3-manifold group contains a surface subgroup, which can't be the case if it's the integers (since the sphere is excluded).

Actually, the conclusion that the manifold fibers implies that the group contains a surface subgroup.  The surface can't be a sphere (because of irreducibility), so we have a more complicated surface whose fundamental group injects into the fundamental group of the 3-manifold.",0

I thought you might find it useful to have some information about  references (refs) on wikipedia. These are important to validate your writing and inform the reader. Any editor can remove unreferenced material; and unsubstantiated articles may end up getting deleted, so when you add something to an article, it's highly advisable to also include a reference to say where it came from. Referencing may look daunting, but it's easy enough to do. Here's a guide to getting started. If you need any assistance, let me know.  '''''''' 

Good references

A reference must be accurate, i.e. it must prove the statement in the text. To validate """"Mike Brown climbed Everest"""", it's no good linking to a page about Everest, if Mike Brown isn't mentioned, nor to one on Mike Brown, if it doesn't say that he climbed Everest. You have to link to a source that proves his achievement is true. You must use reliable sources, such as published books, mainstream press, and authorised web sites. Blogs, Myspace, Youtube, fan sites and extreme minority texts are not usually acceptable, nor is original research (e.g. your own unpublished, or self-published, essay or research), or another wikipedia article.

Inserting a reference

The first thing you have to do is to create a """"Notes and references"""" section (unless it already exists). This goes towards the bottom of the page, below the """"See also"""" section and above the """"External links"""" section. Enter this code:

==Notes and references==
{{reflist}}

The next step is to put a reference in the text. Here is the code to do that. It goes at the end of the relevant term, phrase, sentence, or paragraph to which the note refers, and after punctuation such as a full stop, without a space (to prevent separation through line wrap):

             

Whatever text you put in between these two tags will become visible  in the """"Notes and references"""" section as your reference.

Test it out

Open the edit box for this page, copy the following text (inserting your own text where indicated), paste it at the bottom of the page  and save the page:

==Reference test==

This is the text which you are going to verify with a reference.Reference details go here

==Notes and references==

{{reflist}}

(End of text to copy and paste.)

It should appear like this:

Reference test

This is the text which you are going to verify with a reference.Reference details go here

Notes and references

Information to include

You need to include the information to enable the reader to find your source. For an online newspaper source, it might look like this:

Plunkett, John.  [http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1601858,00.html """"Sorrell accuses Murdoch of panic buying""""], ''[[The Guardian]]'',  2005-10-27. Retrieved on 2005-10-27.

When uploaded, it appears as:
Plunkett, John. """"Sorrell accuses Murdoch of panic buying"""", The Guardian'',  2005-10-27. Retrieved on 2005-10-27.

Note the single square brackets around the URL and the article title. The format is:
[http://URL """"Title of article""""]
Make sure there is a space between the URL and the Title. This code results in the URL being hidden and the title showing as a link.  Use double apostrophes for the article title (it is quoted text), and two single quote marks either side of",0

"I got your message regarding boorishness

Dear Mark,

There came a point where I believed that certain non-BSF people  were going to whittle down and mischaracterize the BSF position and could not be reasoned with.  It comes from watching atheist/Christian boards where atheist of the militant atheist variety cannot be reasoned with and are quite hostile.  

At that point, I mocked and taunted certain non-BSF people for censorship (which they were engaging in) and mocked sources/links like Farrell Till that the non-BSF side was offering.   I do realize that I was very probably breaking Wikipedia rules there.  I also recognize that asking Duncharris to prove he was sincere by actions and rebuffing what I thought was a faux friendship letter was somewhat premature.  I should have made greater attempts to see if it was sincere.  

I will tell you what I will do.  I will send duncharris and MickWest a peace offering letter.  If it works then fine.  If not, nothing lost.

"Un-Deleting Ex Wife Wedding Dress Article 

Hello Bearcat,

Thank you for taking the time to take a look at our page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cotter_(My_Ex-Wifes_Wedding_Dress)

We are not trying to create spam or blatant advertising. We are simply trying to add to the valuable content of wikipedia.

Kevin Cotter has become well known for his blog http://myexwifesweddingdress.com/ and is now having his book published. The many references from media sites like the Today Show and the Huffington Post should show why this article should be included in wikipedia.

I thought that putting the blog name in the title would be helpful for people looking for him or his blog instead of spammy, maybe i should create another page for his popular blog.

Looking at your experience as a wikipedia admin i know we have a lot to benefit from your help and guidance.

Please let me know what we can do to get this page created.

Thank you for your time",0

Malfunctioning archive bot and improper archive page creations?

I do not know why there have been three additional archive pages for my talk page created, none of which is full, since yesterday.  I just saw this comment of Sept. 10, 2008, because someone or something placed it in an archive page (25) that did not exist last night or even early this morning.  I almost didn't see it at all.  Everyone who posts in Wikipedia is a real person; we use log-in identities to protect our privacy and our private identities.  If someone uses his or her real name in Wikipedia, it is published in this version of Wikipedia and all over the internet.  I have no control over others' practices in choosing Wikipedia identities, and I am not aware of anything that I have done that violates WP:AGF, WP:CIVIL, Wikipedia:Etiquette in my comments in either of the AN/I situations.  Although I have continually posted my concerns in good faith, I have been continually set upon as if I have not.  I assure you that since first contributing to Wikipedia as """"NYScholar"""" in June 2005, I have done my best to learn about and to follow Wikipedia's obviously-convoluted and often contradictory editing policies and guidelines, which are frequently edited and changed by those editing Wikipedia, and often vandalized.  I have done my best to contribute to Wikipedia in good faith and yet be forced (demanded) to respond to in my own view entirely-unfounded and false charges that I have not been editing in good faith.  Despite my requests for compassion and understanding because I have other important non-Wikipedia work to do (which have been in the """"N.B."""" above and were only edited out in the past two days in response to Shell's comments about the """"N.B."""" section), I was continually being forced by administrators and others to reply to them in what I increasingly regard as a dysfunctional AN/I based on both misunderstandings and violations of the AN/I instructions by the user who posted it and by the continual references to a previous AN/I by others, including administrators, extending it when it should have been expunged.

If posting new comments, please do so in my current talk page and do not create or add new archive pages.  The bot may be misfunctioning again.  Perhaps the code needs to be checked again.  When I revised the """"N.B."""" at Shell's request (above), I moved down the template.  Perhaps some is wrong again in it now.  I am manually going to move the comments mis-archived into the current talk page if that is where they belong, and I will move what should have been archived (if anything) into archive 22, which is not """"full"""" as it states in my """"contributors"""" history.  To repeat: I did not create archive pages 23, 24, and 25. I don't know how or why they began to exist.    """,0

if i had smoked myself stupid and that was the deepest level i could insult you on, i would send fuck you emails to you all day long. i can take time out of my day, as much as i have better things to do, to give you shit because you are a pathetic, insecure, power hungry piece of shit, weilding you wikipedia administrator status like a trident against everyone that hates you, when really you more than likely were dropped as a child/feel unloved/were bullied in school/have a small dick and feel you have to be a complete social recluse and hide behind a screen.

i hope you do write back. please do. oh my, please write back. i would love to listen to your self-reichous shit, thinking you can make 'quirky' little quips and rhetorts to distance yourself from what people say about you, and feel you have re-established yourself as superior.

Hi again dear

yes I strongly support independence of """"south Azerbaijan"""" from Iran, If Green movement could change somethings, probably I would change my idea, but I dont want to be under Islamic rejim anymore and I support the changing of destiny of Azerbaijani people.

And about """"Azerbaijanis are Turks or not"""". Despite you are talking about Persian theory of the roots of Turkish people, we all know that Turks started to migrate here circa 1000 ad when Saljuk Turks of west branch(Oghuz)started to come, but infact it is not important when they came here. The important thing is """"EVERY ONE"""" in Azerbaijan feel themselves as Azerbaijani( and not Azeri which is an invented word by Persians) Turks and believe that they r Turks and speak Turkish lang. as same as Turks of Turkey. You can come here and ask yourself one by one, you will see. It is so irrarational to say to some one that:"""" No, you r not Turk, you dont know who you are! I know! you r Azeri and Azeris are indoeuropean."""" Pls dont tell us who we r! let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a Turk whatever others like or not. 

About Aran, as I know we didnt have """"Eyalat Aran"""" in the Qajar era. We had """"Eyalat Azarbaijan"""" and both Azerbaijan rep. and Armenia was part of this big Eyalat as well as south Azerbaijan. Aran was part of this big land. But the important thing is, the name of land is not important here as well, the important thing is the people who live in Azerbaijan rep.( former Aran as you called) are of my race and we r same nation. You may call there Azerbaijan or Aran but the important thing is: """"here a nation live which called themselves Azerbaijani Turks!"""". You may call them whatever you want as well as their land, the important thing is what they call themselves. If they change the name of their republic, will you satisfy? what about next? will you ask them to call themselves """"Arani"""" and start to speak """"Aranian"""" language! which does not exist! 

Ok let's think Azerbaijanis r not Turk, so what they r? Azeri? Ok, let's call them Azeri, what is the next step? You will ask them to forget to speak in Turkish language and start to speak Persian? Or not, speak Azeri lang.? So what is Azeri lang.? where is it? Can you learn it to about 32 million people? let's thing pragmatic as well as rational. Even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically, you cant ask them to speak neither a lang. of 1000 years ago nor Persian.

Also I dont rely neither to researches of Kasravi nor Zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments. One was Paniranist other was Panturkist. Some of their researches looks really funny!

About the names of Turkish places and cities, I guess you have never ever travell to Azerbaijan. If you were here, you'll see that Iranian government has changed the names during Pahlavi era! Some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us. for example Tabriz has a suburb in Western part of the city called """"Akhmagaya"""" which in Turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place, do u know what is its official name? """"Ahmagiyyeh!"""" the lands of stupid people! All of the Turkish names tried to change to a Persian words which looks verbally simmilar them! The fact is Persian never have been to Azerbaijan. Most of the Azerbaijani names have Armenian or Tat roots not Persian. My believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like Tats, Armenians, and other caucasian tribes lived here and then Turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called Azerbaijani Turks nowadays. They have their own culture, music, dance, cuisine etc. which seperate them form Persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of Turks of Anatolia which believes that they r 100 percent Turk! I told you history is not important than today, the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a Turk. I dont know what they want us to feel in Tehran!

The name of Azar abade gan looks wrong as well. This word cant change to Azarbaijan during history. I guess the word was """"Azar pay gan"""" (maybe) which zoroastrian Persians called, not Azar abad gan which Ferdowsi mentioned in Shahnameh and everyone got to accept it now!

I had a look to your files about vote frauding which I still believe is correct as well. The diagrams of those .pdf pages show that people of Iran will give their votes to Ahmadinezhad when that company asked them before election, but you know there is unwrittenable rules in Iran which every one know. Whenever some one come and ask me in person that """"do u like Islamic republic, Ali khameni and bla bla bla"""" I will answer """"YES""""! cos I dont want to lose my life! We dont have life guaranty",0

Image Tagging Image:Brooke-Little at Clayesmore.jpg

 This media may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Brooke-Little at Clayesmore.jpg. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

"Its worth quoting this extract from  here:
A series of publications has focused on the effects of exposure to low frequency (<500 Hz) high intensity (>90 dB) noise, a range of structural lung changes having been reported mainly in rats12 but also in humans.13 These data suggest that low frequency high intensity noise may lead to structural and functional changes in the airways, pleural mesothelium, and lung parenchyma. With frequencies from commercial loud speakers typically in the range of 30 Hz to 20 kHz, it is the lower frequency band of 30–150 Hz which is usually boosted in big music venues for enhanced effect. These low frequencies could indeed be particularly damaging to the lung parenchyma if they coincide with its natural frequency of around 128 Hz.14 Furthermore, Mahagnah and Gavriely15 showed that, in normal humans, the lung acts as a low pass filter with flat transmitted energy up to 100 Hz or 300 Hz. In view of these experimental results, the most compelling observation in our four patients is that the lower frequency band, which tends to be boosted in the kind of music they listen to, corresponds with those frequencies, thereby ensuring maximal acoustic energy transfer to the lungs.",0

Bismillah any foundation presupposes faith in it.  To be neutral since Wikipedia rejected-refused to admit the purity of Islam even so much on the issue of pictures of Muhammad by obscurantism for anybody can take a cultural-archeological find from syncretism and be incorrect in their interpretation when it is outside the framework of custom then logically it must either delete in totality the reference on Muhammad or the position of neutrality of Wikipedia. One deliberate misrepresentation of Muhammad in word or fact is your seated choice in the domain with its range of fire.  On Islam any is free to express that history in point and counterpoint.  

syncretism |ˈsi ng krəˌtizəm|

The last quoted reference according to the Guardian newspaper. So it's not your mere """"one source""""  as claimed. Despite these 3 references however, bizarrely, none of these well referenced facts are to be seen in the introduction of this article.

Lastly, on a practical standpoint, say for example you were looking for a new book on the types of birds/wildlife in general for the region, you'd be hard pressed to find any such modern books with """"British Isles"""" in the title. Why? Because """"Britain and Ireland"""" has become the """"preferred official usage"""". See ->

"WP:MOSMED is the Manual of Style for articles that come under any of the Medical categories. All medical-related articles have to comply to reach Good Article (GA) or above (hehe - I only found out about it at the second GA Review!).
Try typing 'Paul Bert' into the search box in the left column of any page and click the 'Search' button (rather than pressing Enter or clicking the Go button). You'll get the search results - the article Paul Bert is first, and Oxygen toxicity is fourth. If you click the Go button instead, you go direct to the article if it exists, otherwise you get the search results as before. Try the same test searching for 'Paul Bert effect'.
There is an article on Decompression sickness - we plan to tackle that after we have finished getting Nitrogen narcosis to GA. No need to mention those in Oxygen toxicity - although all of them are summarised in Scuba diving#Effects_of_breathing_high_pressure_gas.
The partial pressure of oxygen is the trigger for OxTox: that is found by multiplying the fraction of oxygen by the ambient pressure at the depth you're at. For example, air is 21% oxygen and the pressure at 50 metres is 6 bar. So you have a partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2) of 0.21 x 6 = 1.26 bar. That's safe from CNS OxTox as it's never been observed at less than 1.3 bar. Divers may use gas mixtures different from air, however - take a look at Nitrox for more information.
It's my pleasure to try to explain where I can. I must admit it was a little mischievous of me to throw you in at the deep end on Oxygen toxicity . But believe me, the discipline needed to meet all the style requirements is a great learning experience and worth the effort.

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh",1

Attn. Ukrainian and Polish editors: I find the following passage non-neutral and reflecting only Polish POV (inadmissable wording italisized):

In the former eastern territories of the Second Polish Republic, attached to the Ukrainian and Belarusian Soviet Republics after Soviet invasion of Poland, the organization and the operations of the Soviet partisans were similar to that in the Ukrainian and Belarusian territories.

next is Electoral district of Mundingburra here he says """"The seat is one of four within the Townsville-Thuringowa urban centre in North Queensland"""" and this is not it is in Townsville and has nothing to do with Thuringowa city.
the next one is of the most concern to me as it is misleading Electoral district of Thuringowa here he says """"The division encompasses suburbs of the City of Thuringowa on the western edge of the Townsville–Thuringowa urban centre"""" if you have a look back at the edits I tried to do you will see that I made a good point as his ref is from a reporters POV and mine is from the Gov's website Thuringowa is a city (LGA) and has it's own voting system we don't vote for Townsville so Townsville should not be listed here but I will leave it up to you.
the next page is Electoral district of Townsville again he has """"The seat is one of four within the Townsville-Thuringowa urban centre"""" as with the others the urban area is what he says is the """"city"""" but the Electoral district also is rural so it is not just part of the urban area so I feel that on the Townsville one it should have Thuringowa removed and on the Townsville one have Thuringowa removed (please see my edits and you will know what I mean)...you will also see that he has said on the Townsville one that the """"Townsville Electorate is bordered by the Hinchinbrook (North), Burdekin (South), Mundingburra (South and West) and Thuringowa (West) Electorates."""" but yet he has put Townsville-Thuringowa on all the pages.
also please see the list of pages below as he has put Townsville/Thuringowa on them and it should read Townsville and Thuringowa due to the page being about places in both cities or the places in Thuringowa should be removed from this page or changed to Townsville and Thuringowa,

 Bridge to Teribithia 

Now that this anon has deigned to explain the removal of text, I've checked, and he or she is right; there is no mention of Young at IMDb, the film's page, or her own homepage. That User:Shelbyyoung has added this to the page on Shelby Young suggests strongly that she's not Shelby Young; moreover, if she were, she shouldn't be editing the article on herself. Mel Etitis (Talk)  

I haven't taken a stance on the role dispute (Shelby says that she performed the role and is uncredited, and IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors I believe). My comment was geared more toward User:Shelbyyoung's user page with the picture of her holding a notepad with her user name to prove her identity. This IP address shouldn't be removing that. Leebo T/C  

IMDb lists uncredited actors if they are given the information and some sort of verification; so if the real Young did appear in the film, it would be easy for her to get that credit added to her IMDb listing (heck, even my kid is in the IMDb, and her scene only appears as an """"alternate ending""""). That's got little to do with the impersonation question.Orange Mike  

1. Leebo is correct, IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors (only on special occasions, in fact. See the case of Owen Wilson in """"Night at the Museum"""". No onscreen credit, therefore no IMDB credit. It was only after users complained that Wilson had received credit in commercials, his credit was added. 
2. Regarding the film page, the page only lists the main actors involved in the film. It's not going to list a voice-over actress.

3. Shelbyyoung.com has not been updated since 2004-2005, so no credit after that would appear on the site, and is therefore, an invalid source.

4. Many people have edited articles on themselves here. To suggest that Shelbyyoung is not Shelby Young solely on the basis of the fact that she is editing her own article is faulty logic. I don't know how many people remember the case of the user juliannarosemauriello, who claimed to be the real thing, then went on to edit articles clearly not geared toward a (then) 14-year-old. To my mind, the fact that Shelbyyoung has only edited with regard to herself, and the photo, which 69.132.199.100 claims is photoshopped (and what a lovely trick that would be), proves Shelbyyoung's identity. 69.132.199.100 claims that the photo is a """"popular"""" one that has been photoshopped. If so, where is it? I see no evidence of a photo looking remotely like that doing any sort of image search. Ispy1981

It is somewhat difficult to respond to your statement due to the length of it and the huge poutpouri of points you make, but I will try.  

I want to stay focused and make, specifically, a case for the inclusion of a reference to the desolate state of urban Detroit in the introduction to this article.  First of all, though I hate to flash credentials, let me point out that I am not some urban partisan of one city or another: I am a graduate student in urban studies, and my goal both on Wikipedia and in my academic career is to understand and describe urban processes.  I agree with you in as much as most articles on cities on Wikipedia are exaggeratedly positive: alas, but boosters have their way on these topics.  Most major city articles could use to be more critical.  The Detroit one is simply one glaring example of the difference between real life and its presentation here.

You contradict yourself multiple times in your response (and, for the love of god, stop tinkering with it!  It distorts the appearance of our conversation).  How can you claim that New York City is """"five cities"""" (only two of the boroughs were incorporated as cities before joining into a single city in 1898; today, they are tightly bound by transit and employment patterns) and yet demand that the unfocused, sprawling Detroit metropolitan area be considered one city?  How can you stick to an arbitrary statistic about the wealth of Oakland county, and yet deny the significance of the fact that most statistics (even those that address metropolitan areas and not just urban municipalities) place Detroit near the top of the list of the most dangerous? 

The point that this article needs to make is obviously not that the Detroit metropolitan area is poor or that it is deteriorated; both of those statements are obviously false.  Rather, it needs to make it abundantly clear that the metropolitan area contains inside of it a vast segment of abandonment and crime that continues to be in decline for over five decades.  The existence of upper middle class suburbs of relative wealth and low crime do nothing to make the deterioration of the urban core less notable; neither does the recent redevelopment of a piece of that core.  

I must point out your focus on New York City is rather misguded  its deterioration and crime are now of a historical character; if Wikipedia had existed twenty years ago, one can only hope that it would have focused on NYC's urban wasteland character more.  In response to your other points, I would like to invite you to join me in patrolling the self-promotion of all city articles on Wikipedia.  You are certainly right, many of them do deserve to be less positive.  Let's start with this one.  

But, alas, I doubt that you will accept my invitation.  The history of your edits shows you spending much of your day chiseling away at the language of this page to make it more favorable towards its subject; are you paid to do this by the city's tourist bureau?  In any case, I can only hope that the casual reader would know to pay this page same kind of attention they direct to the boosterist propaganda spread by local town publications.""",0

Can Lesotho together with Swaziland, which is landlocked and completely surrounded by South Africa, be considered as a bantustan (homeland)?  22:54, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Does anyone know exactly how Lesotho got it's border?

Yes, In 1818, Moshoeshoe I consolidated various Basotho groupings and became their King. During Moshoeshoe's reign (1823-1870), a series of wars with South Africa (1856-68) resulted in the loss of extensive Basotho land, now known as the """"Lost Territory."""" In order to protect his people, Moshoeshoe appealed to Queen Victoria for assistance, and in 1868 the land that is present-day Lesotho was placed under British protection.  """,0

Speech is the saying of the words (i.e. a transmitter), but in no way implies that the listener (reciever) has actually gotten anything out of it. That is how UDP protocol is structured.

Talk is also used when talking to other people, in Standard English you would say """"i am talking to someone"""" However this varies when we look at Australian, South African or Estuary English. This is due to changes in dialect. In Standard Australian English, one would say 'I'm talkin' to someone darl'"""" and in South African one would say, """"I'm talking to someone, yis?"""" and in Estuary English one would say, """"Can't yoow see im talkin' to someone love?

He seems to have no proper reason as to why he is omitting the information other than he believes Korea is better than Japan (I've read his user page and looked at his previous edits and he seems to be doing anything he can to promote Korea over Japan). Does he not realise that in these games, even Chang and Kim (from KOF) speak in the Japanese language and have never even uttered a Korean word? We need a vote or something to put him right. Thanks.

 Health Issues 

==Is the National Inquirer considered a valid source on Wiki??

On May 28, 2014, The National Enquirer reported that James Garner's health was failing rapidly and that he was battling severe depression in addition to the aftermath of his previous strokes. The article cited a source claiming that Garner had been scheduled to make a cameo appearance in a Rockford Files remake, starring Vince Vaughn, but that Garner was """"too ill to take part in the show"""""""" and that Garner felt he had """"nothing left to live for"""".

It is Talbot & Eaton who come up with the """"theory"""" that the Nayaks had revised their own history as if they needed to in order to liberate their own country from foreigners.

 When I have received even an opinion on the merits to my proposal above, then we can continue this interaction, since you both have been making bad faith edits without consensus and have now reverted my own edit.

Now that I know why we weren't told, I don't have a problem with that part.

I'll read over the current proposal sometime today. I didn't respond to your comments at WP:MK because the previous discussion of the MK template split (which I was involved in) raised issues brought up in your proposal (that's how we were told).

Other WP:MK members may still share this opinion, have other issues, or are not bothered. That's why I've asked you to discuss your plans for the MK template with (the rest of) us before you proceed.

Personally, I agree with the aesthetic changes you're proposing, but I disagree with the severe limit on links in the template.

Perhaps. Generally, if something is commonly known as exactly """"Dallas"""", that should be listed on the disambiguation page. People (or characters) with the given name or surname may be moved to a separate page as they are partial title matches. That would suggest that Dallas (Alien) should remain on the disambiguation page. But the page could perhaps be reorganized to make it easier to use. Perhaps a section for == People and character == with entries for Dallas (name) and Dallas (Alien) (sometimes a hiddden comment is added to remind editors to only add an entry if it is known as exactly the term being disambiguated).  ≠ wiser

I merely said she lies.  This happens to be true and is one of the many reasons SlimVirgin was  voted """"wikipedia's most abusive admin"""".

Hello - I noticed your edits to EMF-related articles, which were brought up on the adminstrators' noticeboard. I don't disagree with the core of your assertions, nor with the need to present prevailing scientific opinion as such and minority views as minority views. However, your approach is raising some hackles. I'd suggest discussing your concerns further on the article talk pages and trying to reach some sort of consensus about how to better present the mainstream view of EMF-related health issues. Tirades, however justified they may feel, are counterproductive in the long run. Although it often doesn't feel like it, reasonableness will eventually win out here if you're able to cool off and explain your position calmly. Making rapid-fire edits to the pages in question while a controversy is unsettled on the talk page is not a good idea.

The """"Se"""" in """"Sesotho"""" does not mean """"language."""" It is a noun class marker which is an inalienable part of the morphology of the word. That's simply the way the word looks.

For example, """"education"""" is derived from """"educate"""" through a change in morphology. The change implies that the word is a noun, but it is not valid to simply use the root without the suffix.

""""-sotho"""" is a root, which is made meaningful with class markers (Sesotho, Basotho, Lesotho, etc).

The """"Se-"""" marker in this case does indicate language, but the class has many other types of nouns.

Yes, the money quote is that I'm fucking pissed off at the insistence of Richard James continually harrassing me, refusing to stop identifying my personal info.

I have vandalized nothing but to take a letter or two off of my personal name and words that lead to my personal info. in the slanderous and libelous and defaming posts of richard james. I don't give a shit that my project is not listed here. I found the whole process interesting and hilarious, though quite hypocritical. WHo can take the piss out of who here. THe article was about an art project, not me. I don't care that it's not there. It doesn't exist, nor does Bigfoot! His compromise was on day two of the original posting of the project article, a one man band who decides fist down who gets what and when, like a fascist pig. I could have campaigned for votes, but what the fuck...Before final vote and deletion, Richard James posted an article about me without my desire nor consent, and then deleted it in a violent fit of rage when I jokingly said the first article is dead at another's insistence that it should be deleted then at seven days. He's had the same hard-on ever since. As I said, I don't give a shit but that his posts are defaming, slanderous, libelous and outright insidious. His high and mighty accusational tone is what is weird and strange. All I have done in the past two days is to delete letters of my name and project, and the old username that I was attempting to expunge. Why?

Your Eminences and Excellencies in the Field Of Prophecy 

The Prophecy list known as of Saint Malachy refers to the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church 
Tarcisio Pietro Evasio Bertone named Pietro and born in Romano, thus Peter the Roman.

Tarcisio Pietro Evasio Bertone, in the absence of a Pope was thus and in fact fulfilling in the Office of  “Pope in Charge”, and now to some extent he Tarcisio Pietro Evasio Bertone along with another office in the Vatican hold more power than the actual Pope, thus his Office is of a more intricate and hands on job of power, than that of a Pope.

In relation to what is referred to the destruction of Rome and the Terrible Judge.

This part of the Prophecy is yet to come, and we are in the momentum of the early days of such events.

 Final Words 
Hi original proposer here. I see there's pretty much no way of winning this one and bow to the overwhelming concensus. I almost give up. I like Kevlar67's suggestion regarding the spelling in articles about the NHL or any other US-centric ice hockey article. I checked around, and the spellings are """"defencemen"""" in the NHL article and probably many other places that might have a better arguement for it there. I will raise the question again in the future after I find out how """"Defens/ceman"""" is spelled (or if it is) in the inscription on the James Norris Memorial Trophy.

Any argument you might have that their 'name appears to be that of a female/woman' is invalid, as you have no idea if that is their name, last name, middle name.. etc.  It could even be a reference to the male comicbook character Blade, who had the name of Daywalker given to him by others in the comic book.— dαlus Contribs

If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like """"Mr."""" or """"Ms."""" Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion.

Since the person uses wide range of IPs, it is virtually impossible to stop him by blocking. In the past he's been blocked numerous times but each time returned with a new IP. That's why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages (some of them more than once).

Rovoam started his actions in Wikipedia from introducing nationalistic POV edits in Nagorno-Karabakh yet back in February 2005. His aggressive discussion behaviour, unilateral un-agreed changes to the entry, and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors, with myself being his major opponent. 

The conflict was formally decided after Arbitration committee placed him under one-year revert limitation and personal attack parole . However, this decision made Rovoam even more radical and obsessive, as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt Wikipedia, perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me (?for exposing him and proving him wrong?..). 

This person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. He is not the usual sort of vandal, but is rather knowledgeable in what he's dealing with. He could have been very valuable for Wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms. Rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means. His edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious. 

As I have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to User:Tony Sidaway, User:Codex Sinaiticus, User:Isomorphic, User:Who, User:Dbachmann, the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms. Only then will he understand the whole senselessness of his actions.

"4. Lancaster, PA, September 1777, for only one day?
5. York, PA, September 1777, to use Susquehanna river as defense against British
6. Princeton, NJ
7. Annapolis, MD
8. Trenton, NJ
9. New York, NY
10. Philadelphia
11. Washington, D.C.

I think these are all the places that have any claim of being a capital of the United States.  Of these, New York City and Philadelphia have the strongest claims of being the first capital.  One question to answer is what constitutes being the first capital.  Do we start the clock at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Article of Confederation, or the Constitution.  I think that the Constitution would be the key event because before that, America was really a group of independent colonies rather than a nation.

Also, I believe that New York City did not have the physical infrastructure (buildings, etc.) in place to be an actual capital for the newly formed government.  I think it acted more as a temporary meeting place.  Philadelphia did have a lot of infrastructure for the federal government because it was trying to woe the government into making Philly the permanent capital.

In my opinion, Philly should be considered the first capital of the U.S. because it had actual capital buildings that were used by the government after the signing of the Constitution.  The fact that Philly was also used as the first capital of the colonies is not relevent in my opinion.

However, I am not a historian or an expert in early American history, so I don't want to update the article myself.  Also, from my research, there seems to be a lot of contention about which city is the first capital.  Would a historian or professor of history please comment on this issue and update the page.

First of all, reverting your edit wasn't a challenge to whether or not the information was correct. It was purely based on the lack of a citation. Wikilinks are not acceptable substitutions for inline citations. Each article must be able to stand on its own set of references and not rely on a wikilink to another article's reference. Refer to WP:CITE for more information. Secondly, comparing the flags and drawing a conclusion – no matter how reasonable and obvious it might be – can be considered a form of original research which is not permitted on Wikipedia. Citing a reliable source that supports the analogy alleviates the concern. It also helps us establish the significance of the information as it relates to the topic. Without that verification, it may be a trivial observation that doesn't necessarily belong in this article (see WP:DUE). As for your """"sky is blue"""" analogy, it's an apples-to-oranges comparison. Take for example the statement that """"the Eiffel Tower is in Paris"""". This is widely accepted fact that doesn't require research, and therefore doesn't require a citation. However, the statement that """"Gustave Eiffel designed the Eiffel Tower"""" would need a citation, although it is easily verifiable. It may be hard to see the difference, but the rule of thumb is when you think it may be challenged, it's best to err on the side of caution and include a citation.   """,0

 Restricted biotech a characeristic of nanopunk?! 

The 2nd sentence in the article reads the following:
""""The genre is similar to biopunk, but describes the world where the use of biotechnologies are limited or prohibited, so only nanites and nanotechnologies are widely use (while in biopunk, bio- and nanotechnologies often coexist)""""
I'm really doubting the truth content of it. Basically I don't think that it's a characteristic of nanopunk that biotech is limited or prohibited even if some novels feature that. Additionally I'd rather say that this is a characteristic of biopunk with which a contrast is seeked here. Also """"so only nanites and nanotechnologies are widely in use"""" is a non sequitur - it's not a logical conclusion that """"only nanites"""" and nanotechnologies are widely in use because biotech is limited. Furthermore what's the """"only"""" referring to? Only in which area of life - medical? social? every?! Also I don't think it's not impossible for biotech to coexist in nanotech even though it probably (and eventually that might be a core characteristic) plays a subordinate role.

 Mention of The Gun  

The Sandman's gun was considered to be an unusual and ground breaking invention in the 1960s when the book was published and has had possible influences on Judge Dredd (see above).

I mentioned this in a section entitled The Gun but another editor removed it citing that it was trivial.

I disagree as the main plot of the novel in both this book and the sequel Logan's World, focuses on how terrified Runners are of this weapon and in particular the threat of being shot at with a Homer. 

The Gun provides key plot elements in the novel (e.g. Logan killing the tiger towards the end, his inability to kill Jessica with it at the novel's close, the Gun going """"wild"""" as they race for Sanctuary and Logan using the power cell to find a way out of the cave they are trapped in). 

The Gun is also something that saves his life on many occasions and on two separate instances alerts other people to who he really is (Doc in The New You and Jessica when he kills the Cub Scouts).

I believe such a crucial backbone to the novel deserves its own sub section, especially when it has as much impact on the story as Logan, Jessica or Ballard/ Francis do.""",0

WP:COI concerns and solutions for this article
User:Lordradish asked a question about my possible conflict of interest - WP:COI.  First, always look at Wikipedia policies if you think there is an issue, don't just go away angry. I know that I'm still learning Wikipedia policies and just reading the above I can see that in 2007-2008 period I was somewhat confused about a couple of them. The longer you are here, the more sensitive you become to all of them through experience.

Re: COI questions, usually its better to start that on a talk page per WP: """"The first approach should be direct discussion of the issue with the editor, referring to this guideline."""" Actually, I thought this issue explicitly had been dealt with here before, but reading through I see I evidently confused it with a related COI question elsewhere. Anyway, I'll respond in interest of full disclosure, outline questions I think have to be asked on the talk page of any editor here who gives any indication of being familiar with the issue, and suggest some possible ways of dealing with WP:COI issues here.

My possible WP:COI
To answer Lordradish's question, I have contributed 43 blog entries to the secessionist blog Vermont Commons over the last 38 months. I have not been paid.  My blog entries have been more generally related to the topic of secession and occasionally make passing references to Vermont and its secession issues, including in comments on others' entries. I don’t live in Vermont and don't intend to. I don't consider myself a member of any Vermont Secession group. As far as I remember, I only have corresponded with the Vermont Commons editor, and that by email. I get some irregular Vermont Commons email and mailings and occasional Second Vermont Republic snail mails. 
I also have suffered a couple years of vicious and even libelous off wiki attacks from the anonymous blogger who does vermontsecession.blogspot, including because I edited this page, and including at another blogspot page he set up just to ridicule me with incredible sexist ire. Therefore I have come to know far more about what types of individuals may be making very POV and COI edits to this article than I would have otherwise.
I do feel I have sufficient COI to make sure I declare it, as I now have, and to be very careful of my edits per WP:COI#Editors_who_may_have_a_conflict_of_interest. 

Possible WP:COI of other editors 
In the 2007-2008 period there was some extreme POV editing of this article by individuals who I believe had very strong personal and financial connections to Vermont organizations and individuals, far stronger than mine. They are strongly motivated to trash or downplay the significance of Second Vermont Republic and don't care much about Wikipedia policies.  Therefore here are some questions that might have to be asked on such suspected persons' talk pages (or here, but guidance on that appreciated). And I hope it’s ok to outline these general questions given the track record of this particular article.

General questions include: are you the anonymous blogger who does vermontsecession.blogspot.com which, while using some information from reliable sources, has a track record of unrelenting nasty, exaggerated and unprofessional attacks on individuals, often with little or even contrary evidence presented; is that person a close personal associate?; do you work for or with that person in some other capacity, such as at a publication or a blog or a sometimes paid campaign staffer?; are you a Democratic or Republican Party activist or contractor or potential contractor who fears that secession candidates running in 2012 might take votes away from Democratic Party candidates and throw the election to a Republican. (According to official returns the candidate Pete Garritano mentioned in th is article got 3.7% of the returns, something not yet in the article.)  Depending on whether a candidate was a more right or left winging secessionist, such a 2012 candidate could away enough votes to sway an election to the opponent of someone support by the editor.

If other editors who seem to be too pro-Vermont Secession arise, obviously relevant questions could be asked of them on their talk page or here.

Dealing with special WP:COI concerns of this article
Given the problems described above, I can think of possible solutions:
 I am going to ask some neutral editors - those who have not been active opining on the secession topic or me - to look at this section and opine.
 If Wikipedia:Pending changes is implemented, this article may need to be put on the list.
 In the interim, any time individuals who may have COIs make questionable edits, perhaps a trul",0

 Vincent Lefèvre Crap 

He insistently replaces simple illustration (it was asked above), which says that floating the point is equivalent to choosing scale (micro- vs. kilo- vs. giga-), which you do every day, with opposite statement """"floating point allows to measure both astronomical and atomic scales using single measurement unit"""". You do not measure galactic distances with millimetres. Vincent Lefèvre is idiot. He also eliminates further illustration which reminded that scale selection corresponds to discarding least significant bits and ten-bit exponent can denote discarding of hundreds of bits of """"single unit of measurement"""" (when you pass from mm to light years you discard hundreds of least significant digits in fact and, thus, pass, to a different unit), which is real idea behind introducing the floating point (exponent), disliked by Vincent Lefèvre. It is difficult to say what Vincent had in mind in his """"clarification"""" edit. I cannot find any sense in it. Did he just wanted to repeat the that trivial idea that fp enables huge range one more time? Why should this take over much more insightful illustration, which explains much more, the idea and mechanics which stand behind the trick and provided the sense of compression achieved.

According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy.

Reply Remove Incorrect Libelous Comment By Media Lawyer 

a)Incorrect. Richie Ramone did not say such he would sue them for 20 years. That did not happen Source please?

b)Incorrect. Richie Ramone did not say he would """"sue and reap millions"""" There are no interviews with Richie Ramone about his lawsuit. Only statements from his lawyers.Sources please?

c)Incorrect. Most do not say Richie Ramone was """"embittered"""" that he left. Tommy left, CJ left, Dee Dee left. End Of The Century actually advances the case that it was an impossible situation to be in the Ramones. That is public record. Source please?

d) The band did not continue to be successful. Source please? The band was never financially successful, as far as album sales, and it got worse after Richie left. They were dropped by Sire Records that same year. The band deteriorated, due to Dee Dee's quitting in 1989. Most sourced information is that they were on a downhill slide from then. According to USA today, they sold most of their albums after Joey's death in 2001. To date, Ramones CDs with Somebody Put Something In My Drink have sold more than 1.3 million copies. Smash You was released as the title track to Loud Fast Ramones. 

e)Richie Ramone did not sue his """"dead band mates"""". He sued the Estate of Johnny Ramone as well as Ramones Productions. He did not sue the Estate of Joey Ramone, nor the Estate of Dee Dee Ramone, nor has he sued the wives and relatives of Joey Ramone and Dee Dee Ramone. Source is the lawsuit. He did not sue Joey's brother Mickey Leigh, Dee Dee's wife Barbara, nor Joey's truly execptional mother Charlotte Lesher. 

First Media Lawyer says the band continued to be successful, and then it's that they have no money. Fact is, Ramones productions is a very lucrative business. Again, USA Today reported in 2002 that the band sold millions of units since Joey Ramone's death. That is according to Soundscan. Paper Magazine and others have reported on the big business of marketing Ramones since the sad passing of Joey Ramone. Media Lawyer's statement that the Ramones are in """"hardship"""" is not sourced. 

Request: Please remove what we believe is libelous incorrect TALK comment by Media Lawyer, unless Media Lawyer can produce reliable sources. At the very least, none of it is sourced.
