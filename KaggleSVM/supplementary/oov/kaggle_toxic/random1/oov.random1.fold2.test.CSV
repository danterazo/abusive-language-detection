Buddhipriya's buddhi seems to be declining!
Anyways how can you say Shivaram Apte's dictionary provides proper meaning.When it says """"The sign of gender"""" how can it be only male penetrating organ where is female gone.Then u tell yoni and put one over the other and say this is India's genesis.Mother  India would be so proud to have you as her offspring. There is no need for you to be so nice to westerner's theories which demean Indian core ideologies.This topic is not so easy to be kept inside a dictionary and used off.This has evolution in it energy in it and any constrictions would be insensitivity.
About sexuality you seem to have removed all obligations about sex.Well even it is a part of Sanathana which is defeated time and again and hence popularly it is told to be conserved duly as it should be.I think you can write about Britney more than this topic.
Don't you read all the discussions above and understand.Don't u have that maturity.
It has reaches into human civilisation and spirituality from idolism to non idolism to meditation.
You seem to one who is trying to be smooth and friendly with English.They aren't ur friends in these matters to come to an agreement .It is people like you who have brought India into such tatters.Making agreements ,making fornications and alliances and defying the own motherland - its all weak ones like you who starting from East India company till partition of India have prostituted the land.
Why don't you go and ask all the Archakas of temples listed in the articles.Get the information.They are the ones who have got knowledge passed the Indian way through Gurukula.There is no original book for Mahabharata or dictionary or websites for Indian topics as they can be malignated by weak ones like you but are passed from Guru to Shishya.
There are somethings which are mystical and remain mystical to commoner and Sanathana tries to explore it.
This same attitude had also lead to tussles between shaiva and vaishnava theories which has created some misunderstanding between Vishnu and Shiva and people like you add more fuel to it.
I would like you to learn and reshape the article with the things in proper places.

"""Listing """"well-known"""" intentional communities==
It seems that many folks want to list their favorite intentional community in the sections entitled """"Some well-known intentional communities"""" and """"Some Christian intentional communities"""" (this dispite the fact that there is a List of intentional communities in the """"See also"""" section where they can list any intentional community).

Bradford City Hall
Hi.  Thanks for your question.  I'm ashamed to say I've never been to Bradford City Hall, even though I wrote the article on it.  I'd love to go.  I did speak to a local journo who said that it was OK to take photos in there, though.  (Some town halls are a bit weird about photos; no-one has told them about panoramafreiheit.)  Anyway, what I could do for you is to phone Bradford Council tomorrow and if I'm lucky I'll get some bored employee who would just love to leave their desk and look at the windows.  People never look at anything, and you can bet your life someone is working beneath your window day in, day out, and hasn't noticed it.  If I forget, keep reminding me until I do it.  It would be a fun job to go and photograph it.  I need to do a winter photo of Bradford Industrial Museum, anyway - you can't see the jolly thing for trees in summer.  
 Update: I rang Bradford City Hall, and they had not heard of any such memorial window.  Someone kindly investigated for me, and they rang back today and said that it's a mistake, and there is no architectural feature such as a memorial window dedicated to this lady.  There is a movable installation within the building, incorporating a display dedicated to her and to other local heroes.  I'm told that this is in a public place and that I can visit it.  I shall photograph that for you when I can - hopefully during the next couple of weeks - but I'm sorry there is no window to photograph. I guess that there is a slight possibility that there may be a memorial window in a church somewhere, and that could explain the error, but I don't know how to investigate that.  
 Thanks for your reply.  I've just heard that I may be able to visit the City Hall tomorrow.  I'll see what I can do.  
 Update: Just letting you know that because Coronation Street is filming in the building for the next two weeks, it will not be permissible for me to get into the building to see the display which includes B.J. Harrison. The staff have tried to fix it for me today, but cannot.  I'll try to do it in two or three weeks' time, though.  If I appear to be delaying or forgetting, please kindly give me a reminder.  Thanks.

 Tudeley and treacle 

Hi there.

The problem with the treacle mine entry is that although it is amusing it does not add much to the general content of the page.

If you were to expand the Tudeley article to include a lot more information about the place, and then add your (quite amusing) treacle mine ref for good measure I would have no problem.

But when the article is just 120-odd words in length, to devote 10% of them to treacle mines seems disproportionate to me.

Best wishes

Hiya,

No, I didn't..what a time to be on holiday and not see the 'frickin' article on BBC!  Thankfully they've posted the piece on the web.  As far as I know, they think, with some justification, that it's a D017, but there doesn't appear to be a definite identification of it being THE D017 in my article, although the circumstantial evidence seems strong. Being local, I'm hoping to talk to the guys featured and see if I can find out some specifics. I'll pass on what I can but as this would constitute original research, I guess I can only point interested readers to other external content like the BBC Kent page -( Bummer!

Now, I can understand that Hall might have been wilfully deceiving von Rintelen; however, there is no evidence that this is the case nor does Hall seem to have immediately apparent motive of hostility towards his former adversary. In fact, strange to say, there is primary evidence that after the war, Admiral Hall and von Rintelen were the complete opposite of enemies but close and mutually trusting family friends.

Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view demands both stories side by side
That means both the terror terror story and that what actually happened. This also means there is no need to continue the debate about terror, as it is much more important to get the whole secondary explanation on the page.

Wikipedia:Cite_sources
Any material that is challenged and for which no source is provided may be removed by any editor. So we don't need a poll, all we need is to remove a lot of things from the page. It needs to be rewritten having both published versions, the scientific one and the warmongering story.

Here are some references:

[]
Why the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories Won't Go Away makes it clear there are 2 mainstream views that should be displayed side by side attributing as much hardcoded quotations as possible. 

[]
We don't believe that 19 hijackers and a few others in a cave in Afghanistan pulled this off acting alone,"""" says Jones. """"We challenge this official conspiracy theory and, by God, we're going to get to the bottom of this.

[]
Around 75 top professors and leading scientists believe the attacks were puppeteered by war mongers in the White House to justify the invasion and the occupation of oil-rich Arab countries.

William Rodríguez RICO lawsuit
In October 2004, Rodríguez filed a civil RICO lawsuit directed against George W. Bush, Richard B. Cheney, Donald H. Rumsfeld and others, including a total of 100 defendants, together with Ellen Mariani and lawyer Phil Berg. The government filed a motion to dismiss, or at least transfer, the case on grounds of national security. is worthy of it's own paragraph.

no Osama means no Muslims
[FBI says]: The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 thus the word Muslim may only be quoted at best.

The use of the word terrorist
Similarities between the Reichstag fire and The September 11 Attacks are as striking as those between the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Patriot act there is no need to use the word terrorist to explain the event, I do think a separate paragraph dedicated to the media calling it a Muslim terrorist attack would be appropriate. Wikipedia:Avoid_peacock_terms Let the facts speak for themselves..

Wikipedia:No original research

As long as it's not in a peer review journal kerosene cant melt reinforced steel. 
Structural failure
In a well-designed system, a localized failure should not cause immediate or even progressive collapse of the entire structure.

Which makes this pseudoscience: September_11_attacks#The_attacks: Three buildings in the World Trade Center Complex collapsed due to structural failure on the day of the attack. Because that is not what the structural failure of well designed systems works like in any previous historical event. Here the standards of wikipedia go far beyond those of the mainstream media. The buildings where blown up.

Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words
Avoid phrases such as """"some people say"""" without sources.. 
Hiding all the evidence incriminates the Bush administration. Further evidence of anything is just weasel wording. Hijackers, fires, explosions, demolition all perfectly good to describe the story.

"""{{Unblock|I'll make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks. But of course I do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage, as you might well imagine:

1. Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you """"admins"""" tend to lean towards the side of someone who's editing with an account over someone who's editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as """"personal attacks"""" or """"harassment"""" when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?

2. For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of """"ebaY"""" logo to go next to the current one, """"ebay,"""" in the lead, is """"because I wanted it in there,"""" even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly """"not okay"""" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?

3. Here's another one: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him and """"smiley girl"""" there to falsely accuse my edits of being """"vandalism"""" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a """"personal attack"""" just because I'm an IP-only editor?

4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with """"Oh, you can't do that 'cause that's a 'personal attack',"""" or """"Oh, that's bad because that's 'harassment' """"?

5. Oh yeah, here's one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn't even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that """" 'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring' is no defense""""? Well then doesn't that apply to meeting some so-called """"consensus"""" too (since some things aren't cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called """"consensus"""" wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) """"consensus"""" wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who's against your exclusive """"consensus,"""" do the same thing, it's """"edit-warring"""" even though it was the same thing as what smiley's doing (remember the """"being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense"""" rule)?

Jack-A-Roe, thank you for responding.  That article says, """"Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation.""""  That raises a question:  In writing the article, I paraphrased the Material (well, some of it).  It seems to me that paraphrasing is necessary when conveying information  I mean, Seth/Roberts published 20 books; and when they discussed a topic, it was discussed in depth.  So my question is:  Is paraphrasing considered to be """"interpretation""""?  To me it is not interpretation, but others might say it is.

It would seem that Verbal thinks I am interpreting instead of paraphrasing.  But since he isn't a knowledgeable editor  meaning an editor with knowledge of the subject matter  I don't see how he can know that.  Verbal, acting on the assumption that I have been interpreting instead of paraphrasing, has been trying to block any new primary sources that I might add.

Now, the article also says that primary sources must be used """"with care"""", but it doesn't say that they can't be used in abundance.  In a case like this, I don't see why the sections that describe the Material can't be abundantly sourced to the Seth books.

I really do have a handicap when it comes to finding secondary sources (what I've been calling """"third-party"""" sources up to now).  I have always been interested in the Seth material, not metaphysics in general.  Thus, I have almost all the Seth books, but few other books on metaphysical subjects where references to Seth/Roberts might occur.  (I do have many Cayce and Casteneda books, but they don't say a thing about Seth.)  Finding more secondary sources is difficult for me because my town has a small library and (you'll be amazed by this) I don't have a car to drive to the nearest city.  However, it seems to me that, given the sale of 8 million books and the secondary references that are already in the article, notability has already been established.

Because I was the only person here who was able to keep reverting Verbal's cuts to the article, I am now being accused of edit-warring.  There's the possibility that I won't be around to prevent Verbal from chop-chop-chopping at the article.  That being the case, I hope you'll stick around.  """,0

 comment ter vs tre 
Hi, Loved your essay.  I have had some thoughts in this direction my self.  My goal was not only to unify English spelling, but to make it more consistent and easier. I like the ideas you have here as beginning that.  

I do have one thing I'd like to comment on: ter vs tre.   As in center vs centre.  Everytime I see tre I want to pronounce the """"lettres"""" in the order they appear. -)  As used in outré.  So I end up with sen-tray for centre and sen-ter for center.  I agree it would be better to have just one unified way to spell the """"r"""" sound. 
I understand your point about etymology, but I'm seeing eventual confusion of people over centres and lettres, bettres, wettres (letters, betters, wetters ). There are many more words that end in er in Commonwealth English, (CE) than ones that end in """"re"""".  Its a smaller change to have all words with the """"r"""" sound at the end in """"er"""" form, then changing them all to  the """"re"""" form.  This reflects the idea that simpler, more internally consistent spelling is best, and it still provides a path to the Unified spelling that is your goal.   

P.S - have you seen Mark Twain's ideas for fixing English Spelling?  http://web.archive.org/web/20030629161605/http://users.telerama.com/~joseph/simple.html. Funny and True!""",0

Fair use rationale for Image:Losmejorescd.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Losmejorescd.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

Bewafai is a Hindi film starring the First Superstar of Indian Cinema Rajesh Khanna[2][3][4][5][6] and the Superstar of Tamil film industry Rajnikanth together for the very first time[7].The film was directed by R. Thyagaarrajan.During the making of the Rajesh Khanna starrer super-hit film Haathi Mere Saathi(1971),the producer Dhandayuthapani was part of the crew of the film as the office administrator and R.Thyagarajan was the editor of the film.Later in the mid seventies R.Thyagarajan became a very successful director in Tamil cinema with every film directed by him becoming big hits and all those films had Rajnikanth[8] in it as the lead hero.The producer and the director duo could not get much success in Hindi cinema with their films becoming duds at the box office until this film released.The duo then decided to direct a movie in Hindi in 1985 and made a casting coup of sorts by casting Rajesh Khanna and Rajnikanth in the lead roles[9].Dhandayuthapani produced only four films[10] in Hindi with Bewafai being the most successful of them.

Whatever one calls it ...

ALL energy available to man other than nuclear (fission or fusion, fission includes geothermal) ultimately derives from the sun, currently or in the (distant) past.

"Irving quote 

Re: Authoritive statements of Irving in [Battle of Britain] article.

You have re-wrote the section as following:

Historian David Irving states that part of this reason was due to the totally inadequate production levels, with 250 single-engined and 64 twin-engined fighter aircraft produced on avarage per month during early 1941Irving 1974, p. 163., and that as a result, the number of German front line aircraft were declining, and this problem would not be improved until the spring of 1942, with a huge effort to expand production, reaching 1,200 by March/April 1942.Irving 1974, p. 142.

In fact, however, Irving does not make these statements. If you read the book  (which has been linked in free pdf format), here is what he writes on page 163:
On Milch’s desk there were already the most alarming reports not only of the gathering RAF bomber strength but of bomber production in America too. To him, air defence rested primarily on the fighter squadrons, but at present the Air Staff was calling for only  fighter aircraft to be produced a month. Fighter production had averaged  single- and  twin-engined aircraft a month during . Milch and his new planning chief von Gablenz wanted far greater numbers, and with more bombers as well  not only the  He s but  Ju s of the latest type as well.⁴⁰

etc.

Ie. Irving does not state 'totally inadequate production levels' (and even less, mentions bombers), this is the addition of one editor to the Irving book, which has been described as 'Milchs diary' (which is it not, either)",0

I'm still learning the ways of wikipedia, didn't realize I needed to have a confirmation e-mail sent directly before posting!  Also I would appreciate it if you could send me the deleted post or repost it because I do not have an archived copy with all of the external news links I put in to show its notoriety.  Thanks!

  
Apologies for the delay in replying, I only just noticed your post. Essentially, there are a number of problems with the article besides the copyright infringement. The article had a promotional tone and feel, largely as a result of copying the material form the association's website. With WP articles we try to maintain a neutral point of view so it may be a better idea to write the content in your own words. The article alo didn't cite reliable sources for much of its content in order to help support the claim that the association is notable. What I'd encourage you to do is rewrite the article, in your own words, using the information from the various sources to guide you and having very little dependency on the association's own website. If you feel you still need the deleted material for this please let me know and I'll strip out the references and provide them to you. If there's anything else you feel you need, or if youb have any questions, please let me know. Many thanks, moff 

 Oxford Wikimania 2010 and Wikimedia UK v2.0 Notice 

Hi,

As a regularly contributing UK Wikipedian, we were wondering if you wanted to contribute to the Oxford bid to host the 2010 Wikimania conference. Please see here for details of how to get involved, we need all the help we can get if we are to put in a compelling bid.

We are also in the process of forming a new UK Wikimedia chapter to replace the soon to be folded old one. If you are interested in helping shape our plans, showing your support or becoming a future member or board member, please head over to the Wikimedia UK v2.0 page and let us know. We plan on holding an election in the next month to find the initial board, who will oversee the process of founding the company and accepting membership applications. They will then call an AGM to formally elect a new board who after obtaining charitable status will start the fund raising, promotion and active support for the UK Wikimedian community for which the chapter is being founded.

You may also wish to attend the next London meet-up at which both of these issues will be discussed. If you can't attend this meetup, you may want to watch Wikipedia:Meetup, for updates on future meets.

We look forward to hearing from you soon, and we send our apologies for this automated intrusion onto your talk page!

 I agree with you that adult-child sex and sexual contact is likely to enrage almost anyone... but the news tells a different story. How often do you hear """"Jim Brown (generic name) was arrested today for allegedly having sex with one of the girls at his day camp"""" and then they interview people who say things like """"but he's a really good person, even if he did this, I still see him as a hero"""" or, after a court conviction even, """"he's always been a role model to the whole community... he should be released or probation...why send this nice man to prison?"""" I have heard things like that and it sickens me more than anything! People are so... fickle. And clueless sometimes.
 I agree with monitored. But I also don't think a 20-y/o who was convicted of having sex with a 17.5-y/o (yes, this happened) should be classified a top-priority sex offender for their whole life. Kida ridiculous. Now a 20-y/o with a 10-y/o? Absolutely! Let their monitor fall off after the heat of hell melts it...
 I disagree that Wikipedia is """"soft"""" on pedophiles. In fact, pedophiles are the only people not allowed to edit the """"encyclopedia that everyone can edit""""; that's a simple fact. I don't think we give anyone """"enormous sympathy"""" (and certainly you don't!). Do we treat them fairly and as legitimate people? Yes, Should we? Absolutely. """"All men are created equal"""", right? Remember, we do not have Thought Police. Hitler tried that... (I hate bringing that name back up... apologies...)
 By the way, though the very incarnation of evil, Hitler was a masterful, brilliant leader. Most of the most notorious bad guys in history were. That's part of how they could accomplish so much and still be so evil. Kinda sad when you think about it...

In the first instance, it was more than one incident, involving more than one other editor, but also, and more importantly, when your actions were criticised, you persisted in your unconstructive attitude, and, even when given more than enough opportunities to cool down, you chose to continue being defiant, uncivil, and contentious.

It is more likely to protect the project in the long run to let you learn that such behaviour will lead to a block which will stick, as that may perhaps encourage you to stop and think before the situation reaches the point of a block.

""":::::::BTW, I should note that the Little papers contain that subsection of work that comments on the use of SIMS to support nuclear heavy metal transmutation that I tried to include in the 'Criticisms' section of the CF Wiki article, and which Pcarbonn block deleted.  

I have to plead guilty about putting technical discussions on these pages, but that was brought about because Pcarbonn wanted to argue every detail I tried to add.  Some discussion was necessary anyway because I assumed the article should be written for an 'average' user not familiar with the field, and some of the quoted comments needed some explaining for those readers.  

In agreement with the comments above, the article always was too biased towards the 'reality' of cold fusion, and I tried to make it less so, with the result that I was opposed at every step by Pcarbonn.  The general state of affairs regarding cold fusion today, as observed by myself as a worker in the field of the materials claimed to show CF, is that the average scientist thinks the issue was setled c. 1994, with CF being declared 'bad science' (or pathological or pseudoscience, they don't tend to distinguish between these various terms).  Almost universally (including me), these scientists when presented with current CF papers or statements say """"What? I thought that was over.""""  A very few are aware it is not, most of them are somewhat incensed that CF is NOT dead, and, at this point, only one (me) has actually studied the field and published conventional explanations (the other, W. B. Clarke, passed away).  This situation has allowed the CF die-hards to experience a resurgence of their view in the popular press, since not enough informed scientists are available to stop them (which is not a nefarious plot, they just do lousy science and rarely make it through a good peer review) and they actively suppress mention of the outstanding criticisms of their work.

Guidance on notability
Hi Ayo Oshunremi,

Wikipedia has its own guidance for notability that may not be the same as your intuitive sense of what is notable. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia of general knowledge rather than an index of profiles of companies and people. Each article needs several independent reliable sources to show significant impact on the historical record. The guidance for organizations is given at WP:ORG and for biographies WP:BIO applies.

If the articles you are creating have reliable sources to support the criteria defined in that guidance then you may have a reason to keep the articles from being deleted which you are welcome to raise on the article talk page or on any linked deletion discussion. If you are associated with the organization, person or product the article is about then you must follow the conflict of interest guidelines and avoid editing the article yourself but you are free to suggest and discuss changes.

Rather than starting """"live"""" articles, you can create a draft first which allows you to get your article properly sourced before risking speedy deletion - see Userspace draft and Userfication.

If you would like some independent help you can ask one of the noticeboards at WP:Requests or try chatting with other Wikipedians on .

Thanks,   """,0

"Progressive Conservative Party still exists

According to your Rump section, there are still Progressive Conservatives who sit in parliament. So the party is not dead. See the extract below.   

Rump PC caucus
Following the merger, a rump Progressive Conservative caucus remained in Parliament, consisting of individuals who declined to join the new Conservative Party. In the House of Commons, Joe Clark, André Bachand and John Herron sat as PC members.

In the 2004 election, Bachand and Clark did not to run for re-election, and Herron ran as a Liberal, losing to Rob Moore in his riding of Fundy—Royal. Scott Brison, who had joined the Liberal caucus immediately upon departing the Conservative Party, was reelected as a Liberal in the 2004 election.

In the Senate, William Doody, Lowell Murray and Norman Atkins also declined to join the new party, and continue to sit as Progressive Conservative senators. On March 24, 2005, Prime Minister Paul Martin appointed nine new senators, two of whom, Nancy Ruth and Elaine McCoy, were designated as Progressive Conservatives. Thus there may be Progressive Conservative senators until 2021 when McCoy, the youngest of the five, attains the mandatory retirement age of 75, or later if subsequent senators designate themselves Progressive Conservatives. Nancy Ruth has since left to sit with the Conservative Party. Adding the death of Senator Doody on December 27, 2005, this reduced the number of PC Senators to three.",0

 IRWolfie's question 

Kozima wrote, """"The products of cold fusion phenomenon (CFP) observed by Miley et al. [Miley and Patterson 1996] are tabulated in Table C6.1"""". That table lists the kinds of atoms that Miley and Patterson reported finding in microspheres that had been used in a Patterson Power Cell. At the top of Kozima's page 148 he uses the abbreviation TNCF and he defines that term on page page 192 as """"trapped neutron catalyzed fusion"""".

Using TNCF to refer to the transmutation of nickel into copper seems appropriate because the nickel is being transmuted into a heavier element (copper) and that is an example of nuclear fusion. However, using TNCF to refer to the transmutation of nickel into lighter elements is a bit misleading because such transmutations are actually examples of nuclear fission, not fusion. In contrast, Miley has used the term """"fissfus"""" to describe the transmutation of nickel into a heavier element (copper) and lighter elements (chromium, manganese, iron, and cobalt). The term """"fissfus"""" is derived by combining the """"fiss"""" from fission with the """"fus"""" from fusion.   """,0

This block is even more outrageous and illegitimate than the first. You didn't even allow me to say anything; that alone makes this charade illegitimate and unacceptable. The whole essence of Dougweller's argument over the last few weeks has been that article talk pages can and should be viewed in isolation when addressing a dispute. Bbb23 and JamesBWatson agreed with him in this regard and that was the main basis for punishing me for the recent conflict that was started by Mzilikazi1939. Therefore my actions of yesterday constitute complete compliance with the rules and the comments from these two administrators. As was made crystal clear on Talk:Aesop yesterday, Mzilikazi and his friends never complied with the rules set out in WP:ERA in their latest attempt to change the article Aesop. I already tried merely correcting their illegal actions and explaining it in edit summaries and personal talk pages but they continued ramming through their illegal changes, so yesterday, even though corrections of rule breaches should not require discussion, I made the peace-making effort of explaining the matter on the talk page Talk:Aesop.

I went above and beyond what was required in order to see a peaceful resolution to Mzilikazi's edit war and I fully complied with both the Wikipedia rules and the wishes of the two administrators who had judged on the issue. If I broke the rules by obeying those administrators then the first block was obviously not valid and therefore an indefinite block now is not allowed. In fact, any punishment now would not be allowed because the alleged rule breach was entirely due to the directions given by Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, i.e. that article talk pages, as asserted by Dougweller, are meant to be viewed in isolation from other talk pages. My peace-making efforts yesterday were most certainly not a """"diatribe""""; it was a clearly and thoughtfully written explanation of what the issue was, how Mzilikazi's actions breached the rules and even how to resolve the matter. Unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi and Dougweller consistently, I included no personal attacks in my efforts of yesterday. Bb23 made the dubious accusation that I had used personal attacks in recent weeks but I reject that entirely; I never called anyone names and I never tried to rely on ad hominem arguments to """"justify"""" my position, unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi in particular. Yesterday's edit was completely free from personal attacks; that's undisputable.

The very fact that Bbb23 would describe yesterday's tactful, eloquent, peace-making effort as """"diatribe"""", an extremely strong word, is more than enough proof that he has strong feelings about the issue and, as per WP:INVOLVED is therefore ineligible to participate in an administrative capacity here. This is a breach of the same policy that User:EncycloPetey broke when he banned me years ago, causing him to be stripped of his administrator status. I was already wondering how Bbb23 could block me the first time with that non-sensical, contradictory excuse for an explanation.

If article talk pages aren't meant to be viewed in isolation then both Aesop's Fables and Aesop are meant to be using the standard English style of dates. That is what I originally insisted but for that I was blocked by Bbb23. However, if, as asserted by Dougweller and agreed to in the rulings of Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, article talk pages are meant to be viewed in isolation then Aesop's Fables is a lost cause and Mzilikazi has got away with his change there but Aesop is still meant to remain in the BC/AD state. Yesterday's edit is in complete compliance with that ruling and I even made the additional effort of explaining it on the talk page to ensure that I could not be successfully accused of making trouble. For anyone who reads what I wrote at Talk:Aesop yesterday, there can be no doubt that not only did I comply with the rules yesterday, but I even went out of my way to work towards ending Mzilikazi's conflict peacefully and in accordance with the proper procedures.(  )""",0

There is a need of education among Nonmuslim nations especially cristians who have no path to live, in tension they are running here and there to get shelter but, let us see in next 2 decades they are building such a mountain for them which they cant handle. THE Discussion is to long and i have lot more points, i dont want any one to opt the orders but to """"DO LISTEN"""" and think a way out.

"""

(deindent) Sorry for kibitzing, but I wanted to be fair to all points of view, even those of the dualists. so I tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.

The thought experiment is this:

 you have one observer
 The observer gets cloned into copy 1 and copy 2 (either Hubert/Yorick or star-trek style)
 The copies diverge, either because of internal noise, or because of the environment

From a third person point of view, this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system, there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on- one observer becomes two. If probed, each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. But viewed from the inside, if you are the observer getting cloned, there is a very natural question you can ask: Am I going to end up being copy 1 or am I going to be copy 2? This question cannot even be formulated from the outside, so it has no objective answer, but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.

This scenario is Dennett's (and to some extent Everett's). Since the question doesn't even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective, the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. You might conclude that this question doesn't make any sense. But, in any case, the answer to this question is 1 bit of subjective information which both copy 1 and copy 2 know, and which the original observer does not. In the objective third person view, there is no information gained- you know that copy 1 will say """"I am copy 1"""" and copy 2 will say """"I am copy 2"""".

To give an example of actual OR and SYNTH, I'll go beyond Dennett's example: suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely, so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. Then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer, from the first person perspective. For example, take a star-trek duplicator, and duplicate the observer, and then duplicate each duplicate, but add a twist: the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks, and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later, and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. And then it does so again forty years later, then sixty years later. What is the subjective experience? From a naive counting perspective, I should predict that I would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point, because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. On the other hand, the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. So perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice, rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. Even worse, how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? (Boltzmann's brain is a similar idea).  """,0

Genocide is the deliberate killing of a certain religious, ethnic, or national group. The Vietnam War was never a deliberate and systematic killing of any religious, ethnic or national group.

I don't mind being mentored, however, Robert is the only person who stood by me. The last two came and go. I will admit, that I have some maturing to do if not a lot... however, Wikipedia is a community of people coming together to create a comprehensive site for information.

I hope I can come back, I know that my English isn't the best even though I am a native speaker. Not everyone is perfect, and everyone has a strength... my strength is expanding Selena articles. While growing up with a family who had loved her before she was murdered and growing up with my mother who continued to play her songs, I grew to become very intelligent in Selena information. So its very easy to me to expand articles based on her. While away, I was working on several articles on the Simple Wikipedia.

"Rajarata was abundant due to regular wars for the Rajarata land. Sinhalese kings tried to re established Rajarata, but they weren't allowed by Pandyan empire. They had full control of the Sri Lanka in 1450. They got real opportunity after 235 years from the Tamil invasion. That time people adjusted to wet zone so it is possible that descendants of the engineering families didn't had the practical knowledge to rebuild the dry zone hydraulic system. It wasn't that much simple. Even British couldn't understand how the system works. 
So clear major reason is they were adjusted to a another system. Also non existence of expert knowledge to rebuild the system could help to not to go to dry zone again.  But clearly it is not enviornmental issues. It was run more than 15 centuries.
I don't see Magha is irrelavant here. Magha doesn't mean only Magha. He couldn't do all the things alone. He was supported by his army.
Even king didn't had child army had children. Those are the people who came to Jaffna.   

 pre History of Jaffna kingdom 

Jaffna was part of Rajarata before the collapse of Rajarata. Some people trying to say there was independent kingdom (convergence) Jaffna. But how there can be a kingdom without people ? People came with Magha's army. So due to what it could survive from the power of Rajarata ?   

 Starting point of Rajarata 
Magha is not the one who established Jaffna kingdom. Magha is the last king of Rajarata. People accept Magha as king as they couldn't find any royal blood at that time and Magha was Nissanka Malla relative. Also sinhalese power was very weak at that time due to regular providing of strong armies to assist Pandyan to servile from Cholas. Due to this Veera Pandyan a Pandyan prince who get help from Sinhalese and couldn't servive chola powers invaded weak (unstable due to internal conflicts for kingship) Pollonnaruwa. Then Kalinga Magha (Sinha) invaded Rajarata with army of Tamils. There was a battle Magha defeated Veera Pandyan. Magha was accepted as the king. But it wasn't sure whether Magha was controlled by his army chiefs. Armies destroyed Buddhist stupas (may be to find treasures). Also there wasn't way to feed large number of army. Therefore they expelled Sinhalese from north.
People go against the king (as they did to Mahasen) and fight against king. Magha had to abandon the Rajarata. This army wasn't big as previous chola armies. Previous occasions Rajarata rulers completely expelled previous chola invaders and those who wished to join  king was also allowed ( vellakkara group). But Magha's army had good support from Pandyan (It is not clear why Pandyan betrayed Sinhalese as Sinhalese regularly provided armies to survive from Cholas). Pandyan was just near Jaffna and able to respond very quickly. After repulse of Sinhalese Magha's descenders had to accept they obey Pandyan King. Pandyan ruled/assist jaffna with military family called as Aryachakravarthi. But in 1323 powerful Muslim empire destroyed Pandyan capital and captured the king. After Pandyan was ruled by Muslims. They didn't care to assist Jaffna. At this point Aryachkravarthi him self made as the king of Jaffna. 
It is not right to say Magha as the establisher of Jaffna kingdom. He was the king of Pollonnaruwa but after his death and tamil forces was expelled from Rajarata core areas to Jaffna they were under protection of the Pandyan king. So Arachakravarthi established the Jaffna Kingdom",0

"I agree with you 
Wikipedia does need to make a review of its policies and role it wants to serve as a web 2.0 encyclopedia. Here was something I said in the talk page of the 'a more perfect union'.

(I believe that most of time the argument is about this main issue of 'Is Wikipedia is being used for publicity?' and NOT an argument about whether it is just an 'Encyclopedia of important events or topics occuring or occured'. I am sure once the presidential race is over, there would be no such argument of the deletion of this article whatsoever, and people discussing about this speech would be doing so solely because of its content, its linguistic delivery, and other reasons solely for historical and educational reasons. Most of the times people are forgotten but what they have done or said makes them remembered. Today there are 350 million google hits for the 'I Have a Dream' speech [3] and 20 million for 'Martin Luther King' [4] but only 2.3 million hits for 'I Have a Dream Martin Luther King' search, [5], suggesting that many people especially in non-American countries perhaps would know the speech but not even knowing who said it in the first place. By contrast there are only 1 million hits for 'A More Perfect Union Barack Obama' [6] 722 thousand hits for 'Barack Obama Speech on Race' [7], but 30 million hits for 'Barack Obama' [8]. My argument is that I implore Wikipedia users to please let go of this dilemna and constant debate of trying to keep Wikipedia non publicity and solely information, because by deleting articles some Wikipedia editors find is adding publicty to one person named Barack Obama, they are also deleting something which is so much potentially informational for many other billions of people who just want information on this particular speech. I say let the people decide how they filter their information, because the election only objectively affects 300 million Americans [9], but the race-issue affects everybody on the planet, and this speech IS a key speech on that matter.Msethisuwan (talk) )",0

"Parishan, the claim indeed is true and you are actually not saying the truth, the evidence above gives examples of dozens of articles, not one. And your claim of double standards was being brought which you failed to address convincingly. The Azeri term is the Turkic term; Jerusalem’s foreign names are there for a reason. All Persian, Urdu and Hindi qualify as such because they are relevant and present in several historic documents, maps and manuscripts influencing other languages words for the place. There is no proper Azeri distinct term for the place, it is the official Islamic term and the variants are either Turkish or Persian. We can write Jerusalem in Zulu language too, it doesn’t mean it has any historic or notable value. The evidence above documents that the edit happened in a period when you have found various articles where Armenian terms were present and added Azeri terms when it was not relevant. It was explained to you that the Armenian term for Jerusalem was present because there is an Armenian Quarter in Old Jerusalem and there are manuscripts dating back to a millennium and a half. As for the notability, if you’d have taken the time to read others concerns, you will actually remember one example, in which it was asked to you to provide another source while you were stuck to one article in Azerbaijani admitting to have nothing else. You’ve been contributing here for a very significant period of time and should have by now known what qualifies as notable. According to your standards, any college teacher would qualify. We have enough problems here to have to go through your articles’ creation and bring the notability issue.

Also, Parishan, don’t you think that your consistent justifications questioning that it was retaliation are a little bit old? Are you trying to insult our intelligence? You’ve retaliated on various circumstances on various cases and this was brought to you on many occasions. Do you feel the need to have your memory refreshed? You deleted Andranikpasha and expended the other article, much like you have added the entry of Armenia in the anti-Semitism article in the past as retaliation, or worked on a NAZI person as retaliation to Vartan’s point which you misinterpreted. Or when you retaliated to one article where an Armenian term was added by adding Azeri term in a dozen articles. This was all I had to say about the issue and if you won’t come clean and admit any wrongdoings then you are in no position to talk about any other contributor’s misbehaving. -",0

"Two Clements Conflated? 

I got to this page from a link in the following paragraph in the Soissons article:

In 744 the Synod of Soissons met at the instigation of Pippin III, and Saint Boniface, the Pope's missionary to pagan Germany, secured the condemnation of the Frankish bishop Adalbert and the Irish missionary Clement.

The Clement referred to in the Soissons article appears to be the same Clement discussed in the last paragraph of this article; however, the rest of this article discusses a Clement who was born circa 750 and died in 818. How can a person born in 750 have been condemned by the Synod of Soissons in 744? And how can a person born in 750 have been the subject of a letter from Boniface written in 745?

 Clarification needed - Run in with Tom Pettigrew after shooting her brother 

According to the Wiki article, under """"Brother's shooting"""": """"...later pointing the weapon at a moving vehicle on the adjacent road, trying to get into the vehicle....""""

Does the above have anything to do with this?  It doesn't seem so to me.  Here's a snippet of the article:

Carrying a shotgun by her side, a 21-year-old Bishop walked intently across a car lot into the adjacent storefront, where she began searching for car keys. Coming down from the second floor, she was heading toward the garage when she ran into Tom Pettigrew and a friend, who had spotted her in the parking lot and came to investigate.  """"Her gun hit me in the chest,"""" Pettigrew, 45, recalled from his Quincy apartment. """"I yelled, 'What are you doing?' and she screamed at me to put my hands up. So I put my hands up.""""

But the Braintree police chief has cast doubt on that conclusion [that she accidentally killed her brother], and the armed confrontation at the garage provides new insight into her state of mind after her brother's death. The Boston Herald first reported Pettigrew's account of the events today.  Only minutes after that shooting, according to Pettigrew, Bishop frantically told workers at the garage she had been in an argument with her husband and needed a car to escape, nervously scanning the premises as she kept the gun pointed at their backs.

So, my question is did this Pettigrew incident happen before or after she pointed the weapon at a moving vehicle?  In other words, what's the time line?  Thanks.    """,0

Political question?
I not sure if this is """"political;"""" and in fact, I'm hoping it is not ....  

At WP:AN/I, you suggested a """"fresh start"""" in the context of a discussion I have not followed.  My interest is only in that term  where did it come from?  This term does not appear to be associated with any Wikipedia conventions.  Fresh start (an anti-Maastricht Treaty group within the British Conservative Party opposed to the Maastricht Treaty) and Fresh Start (detergent) (a  Colgate-Palmolive laundry product) are unrelated.  If it's just a term you've introduced in this unique setting and nowhere else, fine.  I just wondered.

I attempted to use a similar concept in a military-related setting  at Talk:Hyūga helicopter destroyer#RESET, but it fell on deaf ears.  In retrospect, it seems likely that it would have made no difference if there had been a pre-existing link to Reset (military term); but perhaps it may make a difference in future.  

The political question has to do with this military term.  How do """"depoliticize"""" the article I'm about to create.  It seems likely that there may be numbers of editors and users for whom American military terminology becomes a priori political before it's even possible to reach the content threshold which implies something like your """"fresh start?""""  

As a general rule, most of the new Wikipedia articles I've created have to do with pre-Meiji Japan, and this odd, overly-sensitive hesitation simply doesn't arise.  However, I'm not unaware of those critical voices on the francophone internet decrying the American bias in the World Wide Web; and I've noticed similar comments across a range of English-language Wikipedia articles.  Other than searching for British and Commonwealth military specialists in an effort to discover a congruent British and commonwealth term, can you think of something off-hand which might be relevant in creating an article which would have broader usefulness in Wikipedia contexts like you yourself created?

A further point: I really like the term """"fresh start""""  not as much as """"reset"""".  Can you foresee any reason why I shouldn't re-name the article about the British activists in the 80's as Fresh Start (British politics).  This would leave something like """"your"""" fresh start in the primary position.  

Final question: When I noticed your sub-heading, my first-blush plan was to create """"Fresh start"""" as a re-direct page; but now that I think about it, maybe the perceived """"political"""" problems with an article about an American military term would be diminished if the article itself were entitled """"Fresh start""""  with """"Reset"""" as a re-direct page?

 Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park) 

Hi there, in regards to Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park), please do not re-insert that information into the article, as it fails verification. The source which was used states:

The rape of Germany left a bitter legacy. It contributed to the unpopularity of the East German communist regime and its consequent reliance on the Stasi secret police. The victims themselves were permanently traumatised: women of the wartime generation still refer to the Red Army war memorial in Berlin as """"the Tomb of the Unknown Rapist"""".

It does not state WHICH memorial, and the inclusion in this article represents original research. As a Berliner, you know there are 3 Soviet war memorials, and throwing random epitaphs into articles based upon ones guess is not encyclopaedic. There is also evidence that people have not cited the other sources, and if they keep pushing the line that they have cited the material, and reinsert it into the article, I will present evidence which proves that 1) they have not read the material at all or 2) have blatantly falsified the references for inclusion into the article, and I will be asking for sanctions against anyone who reinserts it. This has been raised on the talk page, and editors have refused to provide cites from those sources. As there is also evidence of some of these editors also engaging in original research by placing into articles things which are not mentioned in those sources, this is egregious original research, and given the nature of the information inserted, it can be seen as a blatant breach of WP:DIGWUREN. I would suggest that you not re-insert, as you will not want to get caught up in this. The next person to re-insert it will be reported to WP:AE.  Dialogue """,0

Pictures and Copyright
Hey, . I really appreciate the excellent work you have done expanding Cuisine of Cambodia. The article looks much better now than it did a couple of weeks ago. I just wanted to tell you a couple of things. The beautiful image of num bachok, that you have been trying to add to the article is taken from this site . If you look at the bottom of that page, you can see the the website is copyright. This means that Wikipedia cannot use the image in the Encyclopedia without getting in trouble. If you have a picture of num bachok that you have taken and would like to allow Wikipedia to use freely you can upload it here . Then see Wikipedia:Picture tutorial for instructions on how to add your image to the article.

The second thing is that I've edited out two lines from the article about people in Phnom Penh. your text said:
""""Many of the Khmers who knew how to cook authentic Khmer cuisine before the civil war were killed during the Khmer Rouge Regime. Very few Cambodians know how to cook real Khmer cuisine. If you visit Phnom Penh today, the Khmer 'food' now tastes more like Thai because the people of Phnom Penh came from refugee camps so did not know the real features of authentic of Khmer cuisine.""""

The first part maybe true - because so many people were killed during the KR regime. However, the next two lines are only an opinion (and probably not true) so, I have removed them. If you can find a reliable source that says those things then you should add the text back to the article with a reference to the source.

Thanks again for expanding the article with so much good information about tasty Khmer food - I love it too!    """,0

Hmm. I'm not sure about this one. I think that Guy's addition is similar to the allowed example from WP:SELF - """"the name of the alleged victim is not being included in this article or at this time."""" It said, """"The purpose of the list is to help readers who wish to..."""". I think in whatever reproduction, in whatever medium, it is still going to be identified as a 'list', and it will still have 'readers' (although that may be doubtful in an audio format). I think the doubt comes over the next part of the sentence, """"...to know more about these scientists' views..."""". I agree with that, but we have an RFC going on above partly to determine exactly what is the purpose of this list. In short, I think that the use of Wikipedia's voice to state the purpose of the list is legitimate under WP:SELF (and may be required under WP:STAND), but that the actual purpose of the list is what needs discussion and agreement before we can state it definitively.

Several times now, I've moved this image from the infobox to the section to which it is appropriate. One or more anonymous IPs keep pushing it to the infobox, and I've reverted each time. There's several reasons. First, the rationale for the image says """"To display iconic image in relevant context"""" for the purpose.

Bosnian article: The common base (vocabulary, grammar and syntax) of what are today officially four national standards is sometimes subsumed under the term """"Serbo-Croatian"""" in English; dating from the 19th century, this term was modeled on both Croatian and Serbian nationalists of the time and is today controversial for native speakers[7]

Tag on the discussion page of Bosnian language: Use of that term in English, which dates back at least to 1864 and was modeled on both Croatian and Serbian nationalists of the time, is not a political endorsement of Yugoslavia, but is simply a label.

Croatian article: These four dialects, and the four national standards, are sometimes subsumed under the term """"Serbo-Croatian"""" in English, though this term is controversial for native speakers[7] and paraphrases such as """"Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian"""" are therefore sometimes used instead, especially in diplomatic circles.

Bosnian article: As result, paraphrases such as """"Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (BCS)"""" are instead used increasingly, especially in official context.

Serbo-Croatian article  Prior to the 19th century, they were called """"Illyric"""", """"Slavic"""", """"Slavonian"""", """"Bosnian"""", """"Dalmatian"""", """"Serbian"""" or """"Croatian""""[34]

"You do not address, however, the question of why, when a pro-council site link is allowed, an anti-council (or at least, if you look at the site, a pro-rate-payers) site is not allowed. Demiurge has decided, apparently by fiat, that my link to a forum on the subject of Bangor is not allowed. He has attemped to explain this as being a commercial site (if it was I think it would be a damn sight better looking!) or a site of my personal creation. This latter is not only reliant on Demiurge's psychic powers to determine, but is also wrong.

I can see no reason to remove the link and leave the council one intact. I would prefer removal of both to removal of either. To leave one side of the story represented and not the other is censorship, no matter what rationalisation Demiurge tries to place on it. There is a great deal of unhappiness in Bangor at the moment about the council's actions and accountability. It is not material which could be covered in a NPOV entry but I believe it certainly deserves a simple link to enable those people who are interested in the town to see that there is a forum for their grievances.

This is all the more important since the local newpaper has been threatened with legal action by officers of the council for even printing the URL which I have linked in. Thus, there is a real freedom of speech issue here. I have not attempted to force this view into the article, part of which I wrote as well as taking and gifting one of the photographs for, but instead simply placed a link in the place put aside for links to Bangor-related sites.

I require that some better defence of the removal of that link than Demiurge's personal opinion be presented. If it is not, then I will simply keep adding it via proxies for the forseeable future.",0

Don't listen to AO. The correct way to edit the main page is simple. To edit the main page you need to follow these steps:
Take off all your clothes
Get a friend, parent or whatever to take a photo of you editing wikipedia naked. This photo must be at least 1500x1000 pixels. (Editing the page Naked will extend your editing capability by 1 minutes but any other page is fine)
Upload said found to the wikimedia commons under a license of you choice
Go to the sandbox and put your photo there
Repeat the above step 12 times when the photo gets changed
Once you've done this, come back and click on view source. You will see a message on your screen for about 1 second. It will give you the name of a page you must edit. If you productively edit this page within 5 seconds you will now be able to edit the main page! If you miss either of this you will have to start all over again from step one (including a new photo)
Be aware that if at any time you vandalise wikipedia or try to pass off a photo of someone else as you, you will be banned from editing the main page for life x 100
Good luck!

 Penmon, Anglesey 

Hi there.  You may have noticed that I've been adding to the excellent article you created here - a few extra refs and some photographs, plus an infobox as suggested by a reviewer.  (Oh, and I renamed it too!) Can you think of anything else that can be added at the moment?  I would be interested in nominating it for an assessment for Good Article status - I haven't done this before, but it seems to comply with the criteria (or to be nearly there, anyway).  What do you think?   

You baked the cake, I just added the icing!  Fingers crossed...  

 Oh dear... 

This might interest you.  

 Re: (WP:HD) TOTD 

I was wondering about that, too. Wikipedia talk:Tip of the day would be the appropriate place to bring this up, but I don't think it's very active. Other than that, the admin's noticeboard or miscellanious Village Pump may be places to bring it up that would get a faster response.  15:59, 18 May 2007 (TC)

 Penmon revisited 

Hello again.  The GA review picked up various points, some easy to fix, some not.  Anyway, I've had a go and fixing things and I think it could do with your further attention to see whether you can spot anything that I've missed, particularly points 1, 5 and 7.  Then perhaps it'll get its GA badge!  

Great work.  I've renominated it and left a message for our previous reviewer, as he offered to look at it again if nobody else did whilst he was away.   

Good news! I think that means that you and I are entitled to display this  as a reward for our hard work.  Right, where's next?!

Vandalism warning
One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

 Verifiability 
I noticed you deleted all of my contribution yet again. It would be more helpful, not to mention a show of good faith, if you would participate in the process and edit my contributions instead of completely deleting them!

Now that you have removed the link to the powerbasic forums, and elected to not sanction the description of """"official"""" Powerbasic forum, perhaps some other relevant links would be appropriate. I agree with you that they are in fact """"user to user"""" forums and will reword my contribution accordingly. I also agree with your wording """"this forum is not a source of official support."""" Additionally, Your own website states: """"Should your request goes beyond the intent of the technical support and resources we offer for free you will be advised there will be a $49 per incident charge if you would like us to proceed with your request."""" So I am not sure why you deleted that too?

As I indicated, the last remnants of company support suddenly left the powerbasic forums with Lance in July 2004 as confirmed in the thread you quoted. As another member put it """"you may indeed be correct. lance's last post was july 5, 2004 and the last post that indicated he was powerbasic support was june 25... also, between march 6 and march 7 of this year lance changed his title from """"administrator"""" to """"member"""". if he is indeed gone i wish him a lot of luck!"""" It seems pretty clear that no one at the time had any idea what happened. But this is irrelevant and I only mention it because Lance provided technical support via the forums (as can be seen by any casual search of his posts). The current levels of participation in the forum by powerbasic staff cannot under any stretch of the imagination be considered support.

Because 30 support posts of any real value in SIX MONTHS cannot be considered support, and there is no eveidence of alleged """"email support"""", my statement that """"little if any real support is offered"""" is valid. Support is a key issue to novice developers and should be clearly represented in the wikipedia entry.

Thank you for helping with the wording of """"there were 8508 total posts, not 8508 requests for help"""". This is perhaps a more accurate statement and as I have said all along I welcome your input. Since we agree on this number, perhaps you can justify your statement of """"18,771 messages in support of PowerBASIC customers""""?

The numbers I quoted are easily verifyable from your search engine. simply type in any of the historical support staff names like """"Steve Rossell"""" or """"Bob Zale"""" under """"User Name:"""", highlight the five forums in which users confine thier posts for help:
PowerBasic Console Compiler

PowerBasic for DOS

PowerBasic for Windows

Programming

Programming the Internet 

then hit search. If you look at page two you will see that posts in the last six months immediatly dry up. 
A grand total of 32 posts from Mr Rossel and 48 posts from Mr Zale.

A quick review of these posts shows that in fact Mr Rossel contributed 18 posts of any significant help and Mr Zale only 12 (leaving aside Mr Zale's recent spurt of enthusaism).

This is a verifyable FACT. Anyone can verify these numbers. This is not my opinion. Even if we include every post made in that timeframe as real """"support"""" we are still only talking about 80 out of 8500, thats still less than one percent! This is a relevant verifyable fact.

Your point 5 contains no references or even vague offers of proof. You mention Microsoft Visual Basic, seem to assert that Visual Basic users should be entitled to support from powerbasic staff etc etc. I am unclear how any of this is relevant? 

It is interesting to note that you use an internet archive to support your arguments about historical posts when is suits you, yet have so far to acknowledge that the post relating to the incompatability of unsigned integers was targeted and deleted. If you statement """"The truth is, we welcome criticism, as it's a key element in the evolution of our products"""" is true, then cite an example from your forums of criticism that has been embraced.

""":I'm not sure what all the issues have been with your edits and the rest of the community. As best as I can determine, the issues are 1) use of code share in lead & 2) changing tense """"is"""" to """"was"""" (based on this edit). In regards to Wikipedia:AVINAME, the guideline is the following (abridged for clarity): 
""""Where an aviation incident article...begins with the opening sentence: Airline Flight XYZ...., it should go on to immediately describe the notability of the incident in as few as words as possible. For this reason, it is not necessary in the opening line to clarify that the flight number may still be in use, or where it is normally scheduled to fly - this is because the normal flight or flight number is not the subject of the article...For example: Madeup Airway Flight 123 was a passenger flight from Somewhere to Somewhere Else, that on such and such a day, failed/crashed/blew up/was hijacked. [correct]"""" 
I think the important part of the guideline is what I italicized. I think the code share is important, especially given the media coverage focusing on the men traveling on stolen passports. Whether or not that belongs in the lead doesn't matter to me...it could be a separate sentence or mentioned in the """"incident"""" section. Take a look at the example given in the guideline—Air Florida Flight 90—and the recent high-profile, highly-edited article Air France flight 447. Both use two sentences, first being to state the origin/destination and the second stating the aircraft & what happened. I don't think there needs to be a reference to the men using stolen passports, as officials do not believe they have links to terrorism. It's also difficult to write about the significance of the flight without referencing it as """"crashed"""", per Wikipedia policies. Taking into account what I said, here is a proposal for the lead:

If an official would just refer to the plane as """"presumed crashed"""", then the following could be added as a second paragraph in the lead:

I think I can help with some explanation here, as metamaterials are not fringe or pseudo science but hard science on the cutting edge of our understanding of chemistry, quantum physics, and engineering. The doppler effect is difficult to understand in terms of metamaterials as it requires one to think in ways which we are not used to. The viewer is stationary, yes, but the photons of light or phonons of sound are moving, and moving though a medium with unique refractive properties.  This means that the wave itself will be curved in bizare ways. One of the effects of this is that the apparent wavelength of the photon or phonon will appear to lower as it approaches, and rise as it recedes from, a viewer.  The infinite inertia refers to the fact that a metamaterial can, in precise circumstances, temporarily halt light by trapping it in the lattice of electromagentic fields within the material or within the particles themselves as a quantum spin state charge. Another way to phrase this would be infintite internal inertia. Such effects have been thoroughly demonstrated, and you can see the article slow light for more information. You are correct in saying that very little in science is infinite, but the catch in a metamaterial is that it is not 'infinite' infinite inertia. The infinite inertia is an induced effect that lasts only as long as the proper conditions remain, whether that be an external current applied to the metamaterial, a temperature to which the material is raised or lowered, or internal quantum state which can be thrown off balance. At the point that these conditions end, the light trapped within the metamaterial is freed from its electromagnetic 'cage' and re-emmited. I hope that I have cleared up some of the misunderstandings about the properties of these materials. rant """,0

Wikipedia:WikiProject_Drugs
I need to start a project that automates factual changes/insertions (like rambot).  A lot of incorrect information exists in or basic factual information is missing from drug related articles.  This is stuff that can be easily looked up online and are basic scientific facts for which there is no argument over.  The information can be found from several online drug databases including rxlist.com, medlineplus.gov, the official websites of drug manufacturers (they have free, detailed information sheets) and other various websites.

I plan on writing a bot which can automatically 'rip' factual information (which is non-copyrightable due to its factual nature) and create an off-site database.  I will offer this database for free for people to download, so both they and I can work on bots that can integrate the information in articles.

This would require considerable collaboration with the drugs wikiproject people to provide a standard format for all drugs articles beyond the simplistic efforts taken so far so that I can ensure the bot will behave properly and insert information only in a correct manner.

For clarity, this is information regarding side effects, [bio]chemistry, routes of administration, drug names (brand name and genericmy bot will autmoatically look up International Nonproprietary Name, USAN, BAN and other names) as well as other clearly factual things.

A question needs to be raised regarding drug pages, how should they be organized?  The full information sheets on drugs are very large and rather complicated from a lay person's perspective, perhaps it would make sense to integrate full infomration (including the results of studies on it) on a separate """"full information"""" page while keeping the main page a summary?
Wikipedia:WikiProject U.S. Supreme Court cases
Some of the SCOTUS articles (Lawrence v. Texas, Bowers v. Hardwick) have caught my interest and I may decide to do some bot automation with them also, but I'm not sure what yet.  There are various large legal database websites available which I can legally rip information from in the same manner as with the drug project above.

 Why will Gwen Gale not read the sources? 

On 01:27, 5 August 2010 I posted a section on """"Talk: Death of Adolf Hitler"""" titled “Random Questions” which started “I am not a scholar, I read Wiki but would not think of editing it. But I was disappointed in this article, and many points in the discussion, so I am asking some questions. Perhaps someone else will read and address them.” The section went on with several rethoritical questions, and ended with “As to sources, the last books I have read are The Murder of Adolph Hitler by Hugh Thomas (sort of shaky) and The Last Days of Hitler by Anton Joachimsthaler (English translation, I buy much of this).”

Gwen Gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator, because at  she replied with: ”As the article lead says,...This said, this talk page isn't a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic, it's meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. I say this because the article seems to already cover, with thorough citations, most if not all of what you've brought up...dodgy. Gwen Gale (talk)”

By this reply it appears that Gwen Gale is NOT FAMILIAR with the work of Joachimsthaler, who I have just referenced, and thinks that I am asking a personal question, not a rhetorical one. At that time I apologized, tried to explain myself, and restate my questions.

At  I posted” If I had read Kershaw's Nemesis Chapter 17 note 156 and Epilogue note 1 I wouldn't have wasted your time. You can't get much clearer than that. Should be required reading. Perhaps someone else should read them, and possibly edit the article. Thank you for your time.99.41.251.5 (talk)”

At  I posted “I would like to direct people to the work of Ian Kershaw Hitler, 1939-1945: Nemesis ISBN 0393322521. Chapter 17 and the epilogue relate to this article. Please pay attention to his notes and sources. Be warned, his book Hitler: a Biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....The source Joachimsthaler is basically an English translation of a German's analysis of 1950's post-Soviet interviews of bunker survivors. The original transcripts must be available somewhere. There are many other bunker interviews, some with questionable intent, and not all agree. Wm5200 (talk)“

Since those posts I have posted a huge amount on the talk page, virtually all of which Gwen Gale has disputed. Much of the material I have posted I have later deleted, often because I felt that the endless conflict between Gwen Gale and myself is counterproductive to the article.

Anyone who is Wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. Was I sometimes rude and argumentative? Absolutely. Was I making legitimate points which related to the article? I thought so. Did I receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? I think not, but you judge.

My main point was that Joachimsthaler had reviewed the information, and had made a solid case for positions which Kershaw backed. I repeatedly begged anyone, especially Gwen Gale, to read Joachimsthaler and Kershaw, specifically, two footnotes, I even told the pages of the footnotes. Gwen Gale clearly had not read either source.

 I posted, under the heading “Question for Gwen Gale” , the following: ”I lost you, but I’m confused myself. It appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.

The U.S. is big on free press, and it works. My very low budget suburb is in a system which serves 225,000 people with 4 MILLION titles (numbers approximate, thanks Carol). That’s on the next shuttle van. Most of the rest of the assets of a state with 12 million people are a couple of days away by mail. The specialty stuff on AE from Radcliffe took maybe a week. And I am an amateur. Dan, you are over three million people higher in the food chain, you must be “world class”. Kierzek has clearly read and analyzed everything, reviewed most of it, and as far as I can tell, every word he says is accurate and informed.

Kershaw, Joachimsthaler, Thomas, Trevor-Roper, Beevor, Shirer, Ryan, Toland, Eberle/Uhl, Lehmann/Carroll, O’Donnell, Victor, Petrova/Watson. (Vinogradov hit a snag, reordered). These are books which I have had in my possession and read parts of since Aug 2010. I can understand if others do not have access to the same resources, but I think that should be addressed. If someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion, that also should be addressed...I know that this is P.O.V., and that I am personally involved.

 Hs Khalsa Recommendations 

I have several suggestions for how the Sikhism page can be improved.  I plan to list them below, one at a time, allowing time for comment on them before making the relevant changes.  After a suggestion has been considered and approved or rejected, I will move on to my next suggestion.

1)  """"The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the Ten Sikh Gurus and the select works of fifteen earlier bhagats as scripted in the Gurū Granth Sahib.""""

Problem: I feel this sentence is misleading.  As you know, the writings of only six Gurus are included in Guru Granth Sahib.  Perhaps this sentence is not meant to suggest that all ten Gurus are included.  However, a second issue arises because there are more authors than just fifteen bhagats included in Guru Granth Sahib as implied by the second part of the sentence.  

Solution:  """"The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten (lowercase 'T') Sikh Gurus, as well as (no 'the') Guru Granth Sahib which includes select works of numerous authors from diverse backgrounds.""""

If this is not detailed enough, perhaps all relevant authors could be listed.  In any case, just stating """"fifteen earlier bhagats"""" is factually incorrect.  Further, the emphasis of the Gurus was not on the background of the authors, but on what they had to say about God.

I also propose removing 'the' from in front of Guru Granth Sahib.  Guru Granth Sahib is not a thing.  It is not acceptable or appropriate to call Guru Nanak Dev - the Guru Nanak, or to call Guru Gobind Singh - the Guru Gobind.  Similarly, Guru Granth Sahib is a Guru of equal stature.  I know writing """"the Guru Granth Sahib"""" is extremely prevalent all over the Web, but we at Wikipedia should consider the merits of the case and hold ourselves to higher standards rather than just going with what is most popular.

The person who is subject of that article (Oktay Sinanoglu) published autobiographical book in 2001 in Turkey by using the fake titles of the “World’s Youngest Professor”, “Lord of U.S.A”, “at the peak point of science in U.S.A”, “The Turkish Einsten” etc. so he gained a lot of prestige in Turkey and a few million Turkish student accepted him as their idol and having been believed the fake titles of Sinanoglu are exactly true they occured the “Sinanoglu Youth Movement”. The last ten year (2001 – 2011) Sinanoglu became the “Hero of People” by using these fake titles that he published them in his bestseller autobiographical book. Today, by contributing a few million college student, the “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” was like the superracist “Hitler Youth Movement” in Turkey and Sinanoglu became the icon of the """"Turk Superracism"""" everywhere. By reading the autobiographical book of Sinanoglu, large amount of college students became “superracist Turks” under the influence of Sinanoglu’s megalomanic and fake titles. So, they are conducting the election campaign: “Sinanoglu must be the President of The Republic of Turkey!” Eight years ago, the first edition of this article was written by some members of “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” as the summary of Sinanoglu’s autobiographical book and this Wikipedia article was used by them in Turkey as the proof that the titles of Sinanoglu had been accepted as exactly true by whole world, so every Turk must believe that this titles of Sinanoglu was exactly true. That was the begining and the developing of the """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" in Turkey.

As a result, the some members of the superracist """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" cleaned the all words of the article which is writen by me and they provided to put blockage to my editings by showing themselves advocates of the Wikipedia Five Pillars.

Those who subscribe to the definition of rock and roll as the melding of country music with rhythm and blues believe that it is Haley's version of the song, not the Turner/Brenston original, that is the first rock and roll record. No matter which version deserves the accolade, """"Rocket 88"""" is seen as a prototype rock and roll song in musical style and lineup, not to mention its lyrical theme, in which an automobile serves as a metaphor for romantic prowess.

 Question 

Sarah, there is something that I've wondered about for a long time that is related to COI editing.  One need look no further than my user page where I quote Chris Hedges: """"They control our systems of information."""" and add: Surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporate-approved encyclopedia.  At a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easily-led, lame-brained, losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy.  What, if anything, is presently being done?  I'm aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to """"prove"""" that he had no COI related to the articles he edits, and I've heard of this incident dozens of times since, where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest.  Many times I've wondered how Wikipedia went about finding this so-called proof. If I put myself in a position in which I was editing for pay but denied it, how could it be proven that I was?  I mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have WP give him/her the WP Stamp of Approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please.  They can now proudly display their badge of approval and anyone who questions them is now seen as a disgruntled editor in need of a reality check.    """,0

"NOT BEING NEUTRAL & CONFLICT OF INTEREST

Blackpearl14 does not understand what vandalism is, and wrongly calls anyone who contributes per the polices of wikipedia a vandal.  She is not neutral and is in complete conflict of interest.  Based on Blackpearl4's own posting comments about herself, she believes Wikipedia is her forum and that she is owner and controller of anything to do with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.  When you complain about her actions, she wrongly calls you things, like saying you are attacking her and such.  

NOTE: Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She  celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages?   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral.  Sorry if your feelings are hurt,  but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.",0

The oldest and best boxing news websites, www.boxingtalk.com and www.fightnews.com, have the titles in lower case. (a minority of freelance fightnews.com contributors wrongly use caps)

boxrec.com uses all lower case for titles in their record tables for Christ's sake.

TheShadowCrow = OWNED. OWNED AND DESTROYED.

The only query I have is that Boxing News uses a hyphen in the new weight divisions; """"light-welterweight"""" etc. Some boxing books type them they same way also.

TheShadowCrow's argument for the WBC not using caps was that it's not an English speaking org, when his example, the diabolical WBA, isn't either. What an absolute idiot.

TheShadowTard comes along making a complete mess of these records and pages, then after I revert his clumsy edits, he comes sniveling to the admins' talk pages claiming it's ME who's attacking the pages. What a complete and utter lying hypocritical spastic. He knows nothing about boxing.

If you know what's good for you, and for wikipedia, you'll all realize your embarrassing errors and revert every bit of vandalism you've all done in making a complete mess of the following boxing pages;

Juan Manuel Marquez

 Query 

I suppose I should have taken the point better when you made it here. This is neither a challenge, a complaint, nor a whine, or an attempt to """"gotcha"""" but a ood–faith question and a related comment on which I'd like your observations.
Question: John Bapst Memorial High School 2005 was nominated — not by me — and subsequently deleted yesterday under A7. (I think that's the one, not being a sysop — ahem () — I can't go back to look to make sure.) The entire text of the article was something like, """"Composed of people born in 1986 and 1987. Said to be the best class to ever graduate from this school."""" As I understand from the discussions at Talk:CSD, an indication of importance or significance is credible if it is plausible, even if it is vague and unsupported. That school's class of 2005 could, in fact, have been the best to graduate from that school in many different ways: highest GPA, most athletic championships, fewest teenage pregnancies, or in a 5–year retrospect, most graduates to be admitted to Ivy League schools. None of that is, of course, probably what the creator meant, which was probably nothing more than chauvinistic chest–thumping (but we must AGF). Was that an indication of importance or significance such that the article should not have been A7 nominated or deleted on that basis?
Comment: If I were to start declining A7 speedy noms by strictly applying the criteria you set out at my RfA nomination, viz """"A7 simply does not apply if there is any credible indication of importance or significance"""", then I have the suspicion that at my next RfA nomination, if I choose to try again (and your responses here may help me decide whether or not I will do so), that I may have a hoard of opposers claiming that I'm perverting the CSD process by glibly dismissing valid CSD nominations. I'm concerned that by working on CSD nominations at all that I'm stuck between the battle lines drawn by the deletionists and the inclusionists. If I have any remaining desire for the mop, wouldn't it be better to just avoid CSD altogether?

 Japanese city naming 

Hi - I've revised my post at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (Japan-related articles) since, based on your response, I see I was not being clear at all.

 Srebrenica massacre 

Here's the situation. The Serbian media has made much fuss about the """"3000"""" Serbs killed by the ABiH (Bosniaks) in the Srebrenica region. After that video of 6 Bosniaks came out, the Serbian media (among other things) released a list of names of these 3000 Serbs. However, the Hague has stated that the majority of these aren't considered """"victims"""" (as they were portrayed by the Serbian media) because among these 3000 are a large number of military police officers and Serbian soldiers killed in combat with Bosnian troops. According to data provided by Republika Srpska's Comission on War Crimes, in the Srebrenica region there were 995 Serb civilian victims. All of this was what I was trying to sum up. I hope I've made myself a bit more clear. ¨- Asim Led

 Jitse Niesen has made a logical fallacy 

I would like to remind Jitse Niesen who claimed the facts below that he has made a logical falacy called """"Appeal To Widespread Belief"""" http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#bandwagon

For example, in the 1800's there was a widespread belief that bloodletting cured sickness. Now we know it to be wrong. Thus, whether it be institutions such as NATO, the Red Sross, or individuals, their mere opinions about an issue cary little force when it comes to making a logical argument. In fact, the use of this falacy in an argument renders the arguemnt invalid; the author who uses Appeal To Widespread Belief is never taken seriously.

I agree that it is indeed a logical fallacy to conclude the truth of some statement from the fact that most (or even everybody) think it is true. However, I don't see where I have committed this mistake. In the second sentence of the fragment quoted to above, I say that the """"Bosnian/NATO point of view"""" is far more widespread than the Serbian one, which implies that it should get more attention since """"[i]f we are to represent the dispute fairly, we should present competing views in proportion to their representation among experts on the subject, or among the concerned parties"""" (quoting from WP:NPOV). What I do believe to be the case, though I am not saying above, is that widespread belief strongly suggests truth.    

 The Truth

Yes I do. I'll send you some articles on that topic when I have time, because I'm occupied preparing for some exams right now. Also you may take a look at www.ogrish.com, it you have membership credentials. I have some video materials too, showing the torture and death of Serbian civilians but have no way how to send you, but what I can do is to gather, or to write, something on Serbian history and culture that may change views because Serbs are often considered as """"occupators"""" of the Bosnia, but the fact is that they are natives there and the """"Bosniaks"""" are not a nation as they try to represent themselves today. They are merely Serb or Croats converted to Islam during the period of Ottoman Empire reign on the Balkan. Their language is Serbian. But as I said, the picture we have today is a result of politics and lobbying. The same thing is with Kosovo today.

"Endless edit/revert cycling on Half Dome
Dear anonymous editor: you are adding material to the Half Dome article that does not follow the guidelines for Wikipedia editing, hence is constantly being reverted. It doesn't matter that you believe going off the cables is safer. It does not matter that Will and I believe this to be false. The important thing about Wikipedia is that the articles are verifiable (that is, any fact can be traced to a reliable source, such as a book or newspaper), and written in a neutral point of view (i.e., does not favor a particular set of opinions).

If you wish to have your material stay in the Half Dome article, you have to come up with a reference that states that it is safer off the cables - you cannot rely on your own knowledge or intuition: you have to prove it to the rest of us. Further, if it is a controversial assertion (which this one is), then you need to phrase it as such. For example, if some association is favoring leaving the cables, then we could add:

Association X claims that leaving the cable is safer than waiting, while the National Park Service wants people to stay on the cable for safety.

Notice that this sort of phrasing does not talk about the absolute truth of whether it is safer or not: it reports who believes it to be safer and who does not. These should be official organizations or well-known experts - we can't cite random people in blogs, for example. Again, both of these assertions should be backed up with references. We can help you format the references, don't worry.

I would urge you to find a reputable source that recommends leaving the cables. Until you do so, I predict that the unsourced assertion is so controversial that it will probably just be reverted on sight.

Feel free to ask any more questions on Talk:Half Dome. Thanks!",0

Yes it definitely isn't an ideal source, but unfortunately since these events took place in a very secretive, distant battlefield (Mike Spann was the first US casualty in the War in Afghanistan), the fine details of the event are limited to only a few sources, thankfully an experienced and respected English-speaking journalist was there shortly after events to record them. And yes unfortunately I know way more about this subject than I ever intended to. There were MANY previous edit wars, although I say more towards vandalism, which were mainly just people reverting edits on bias (same types of information  anything negative towards Lindh  was only thing removed) and saying the cites weren't right and making me have to go through sometimes hundreds of pages of documents (like the AR15 field investigation) and find the page number, paragraph, and line for them to prove the integrity of the cite to get them to stop.

"""== Next Good Article candidate? ==

So what's the next article you want to work up to GA status? I actually LIKE writing footnotes, and finding sources for stuff. I enjoyed finding citations and sources for the stuff in the Horse article last night. Might as well add my services to whatever you're working on next...  | Talk 

Well, given your area of interest, why not American Quarter Horse?  Dlh-Stablelignts has been doing some tremendously good work on Gelding also, and so while the veterinary sections are pretty good, the rest of it could benefit from some additional sourcing, though I did a lot of updating and fixing of what was there originally.  That might be another possibility.  Morgan horse could get there with some SERIOUS work.  Have you looked over the criteria yet?   

 Briefly, I looked them over. I recall that they need lots of citations, in depth and with enough pictures/diagrams to make things easy to understand for the non-initiate. I'm sure there is a lot more. I've got books on the vet or training side of things, but not as many as on horse bloodlines and breed history. You've obviously been working hard on things with the horses, and I figured I'd rather work with you, than have everyone sorta scattered all over working on sixteen different articles. Concentrating on a couple would probably make the work easier and quicker, I would think. Of course, I'm still new at this, but I know my editing is helped when someone else checks over it. Quarter horse might be a bit TOO much, honestly. I'd have to fight hard to not put in all sorts of tidbits on the older horses from before the registry formed... and the history of the controversies behind the registry, and .. well you get the idea. Oddly enough, given my Quarter horse interests, I own Arabians (grins) so I'd love to see the Arabian article make Featured.... but I'm scared to ask how much work that would take! Anyway, now that I've babbled, I'm more than happy to watch you work and help however I can. Certainly don't want to work at cross-purposes.  | Talk 

The internet is my friend on a lot of breed stuff, most """"generic"""" horse books actually are quite poor sources with huge inaccuracies.  The breed registry web sites are often much better (though they aren't above POV, at least four different breeds claim to be the descendants of Bucephalus, which is a wholly unverifiable claim! .  You want an easy job, go to List of horse breeds and take a red link to make a new article.  Most in there are stubs, and need expansion, some are red links that aren't even real breeds (For example, you don't want to see the can of whoopa I open when people start claiming that the """"Egyptian Arabian"""" is a different breed, BTW(grin)) so checking the horse stubs is always a way to find new mischief.  (Somehow I got drug into editing on Marwari horse, don't ask me how.)  I got [{Arabian horse]] pretty much to GA status singlehandedly, but it took awhile, editing it from a disaster of anti-Arabian POV to GA status over a period of several months, learning all the way.  My panic about putting it up for FA (I actually think it's almost there) is more the vandalism patrolling it will entail and the things that the wider world of wiki editors might take issue with (for example, the controversies section, almost all parts of it were inserted to settle some kind of edit war or POV discussion.  It's needed.).  I'm not sure I am ready to put  the energy into watchdogging it so that some idiot doesn't totally screw it up or, worse yet, restart battles that were settled a long time ago.  Equine nutrition is one I started from scratch, and after an initial panic when an admin felt I overdid the copy and paste and slapped a copyviol on it without warning (which gave me a really bad couple of days scrambling to get it finished), I basically had it ready for GA in about a week, with a few contributions from some other editors like

A yuga, or mahā-yuga, consists of 4,320,000 years, and one thousand such mahā-yugas constitute one kalpa. The author of Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta says that if one does not take advantage of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he cannot be delivered for millions of such kalpas.""""

However, you are lucky:
Q.    Can Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata be distributed to the common people before they have read the Gita and Bhagavatam?

 

A.    Yes, Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata can be distributed along with the Gita even before Bhagavatam according to Shrila Prabhupada’s purport on Cc Adi 8.36. In the first part of the purport he explains that Shrimad-Bhagavatam is difficult to understand for the common man due to four reasons:

 

(1)  It is very elaborate due to it being the commentary on the the highly condensed Vedanta-sutra and it is in Sanskrit which is a very difficult language to understand for the common man thus few men can understand its purport.

(2)   Professional reciters have created the impression that Shrimad-Bhagavatam deals only with Krishna’s rasa-lila and thus presented Krishna as a great woman-hunter.

(3)  Professional reciters have introduced bhagavata-saptaha, or seven-day readings of the Bhagavatam.

 

Then Prabhupada explains that under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s Chaitanya-bhagavata, for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Krishna, Lord Chaitanya and Nityananda. Due to misunderstanding Shrimad-Bhagavatam, people are misled regarding the science of Krishna. However, by reading Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s book one can very easily understand this science.

          

So it is pretty clear that Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is a great book to introduce to the common people who normally may not have the required intelligence & patience to understand the most elaborate Shrimad-Bhagavatam

        

Also Shrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has said said that Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important than Chaitanya-charitamrita for the common man because it is a lila-grantha. Without describing so much about philosophy, it describes the lila of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and is therefore easy for the common man to follow and understand the philosophy. Even though Sarasvati Thakura himself mostly explained philosophy, he said that philosophy is only for the greatly learned people, and for the common men Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important. So he said, """"Read Chaitanya Bhagavata from time to time."""" If anyone came to him he would ask them if they had read Chaitanya Bhagavata. He often asked people this, including non-devotees. He recommended that for ordinary people, the first Vaishnava literature they read be Chaitanya Bhagavata.

 

Q.Then why did not Shrila Prabhupada explicitly tell us to read this book and distribute it in mass quantities?

 

A.    One immediate answer is because Shrila Prabhupada had not translated the book. Shrila Prabhupada did give great importance to Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s pastimes that is proved by the fact that he left the translation of the Bhagavatam in middle to complete Shri Chaitanya-charitamrita. So actually he did’nt have time to translate Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata. Although Prabhupada has said that his books are enough, he did say that reading Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata will be a great aid for the common man, that one should read this book if he has to preach the gospel of Lord Chaitanya, that readers will profit much by going through Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata (SB Intro). So I would say that it is not against the teachings of Prabhupada to introduce this book with the original Bengali verses & translation to the common people.

 

Q.   But the translation is not done by Prabhupada. So how will we know whether it is bona-fide?

 

A.    Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is full of very simple but very sweet Bengali verses which are very easy to translate into any language if the devotee translator is  little intelligent and has a little knowledge of Bengali (which is very easy to get). There are very few Sanskrit verses in the whole book and some of them are from the Bhagavatam. For example, translation into Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Telugu etc. is very eas",0

"""==Name==
I've been studying Satmar for a good bit, and I've been to Kiryas Joel. I've never heard it called """"Sakmer"""". Are we sure about this?  
I've been around many Hasidim for a long, long time too, and I have never heard of Sakmer either, so it may just be baloney and that word should be removed.  
there is a street in KJ called Sakmer

also: look at this http://tovrent.com/satmar/85.jpg

The reason some call it Sakmer is because the name Satmer is based on Satu Mare which remotely referes Saint Mary [NOTE - not true, Satu Mare means simply """"Large Village"""" in Romanian!]. Hassidic Jews have always refrained from sanctifying Christian saints and therefore have created alternative names for quite a few cities. Izak love, when you don't know something, that does not make it balony.   PS, I haven't been """"studying"""" Satmer - I am one, and my maternal grandfather referes to his birthplace as Sakmer (AKA Satu Mare). PPS There is no KJ street called Sakmer. The photo you attached clearly dubbs the Satmar Rabbi """"The Rav of Sakmer"""". For those who study Satmer but have no knowledge of the script which the Satmers use, the word is the one at the lower left corner looking something like this: סאקמער. The third letter from the right carries the K sound. Cheers.

I recently heard in regular chatting from an acquaintence that an ancestor (great-grandfather?) of his called Satmar Sakmer. Why do they not utilize that term anymore? And, I'm done with my hardcore pshat study of different Hasidic groups.  

It's total nonsense, the 'saint mary' story. Satu Mare means 'large town'. My father has been there many times. Wikipedia (yes yes) also says that Satu Mare means 'large town', and that 'saint mary' is something else entirely in Hungarian/Romanian.  
I revised the opening paragraph by indicating the Satmars are one of the largest hasidic groups - it is widely thought there are about 200,000 Lubavitchers, but since none of the hasidic groups keeps a formal membership role, this is all conjecture - it would be incorrect for any group to claim they are the largest, there is no way of knowing. 

About Satmar and NETUREI KARTA. THe Cherem bit is incorrect, as is the bit of a denunciation. Also the part of asking Reb Yoilish to meet with Yasser Arrafat. It's all myth. Yasser Arafat and the PLO were not the public face of the Palestinian cause before Reb Yoilish had his stroke, so it doesn't make sense. I actually asked a chaver of the Satmar Beis Din about the Cherem, and he said it's nonsense. The Beis DIn has not publicly issued a cherem against a person or group of people since its formation in the United States. No denunciation was issued either. It's a made up propaganda piece by the Kakhnik radio station Arutz Sheva. It never happened. No such thing ever appeared in Der Yid, which is the official newspaper.

 Etymology 

with Satu coming from the same root as """"city"""" (civitas)

Actually, it's not like this. In Romanian, """"satu"""" is derived from Latin """"fossatum"""" and it originally meant a village encircled by a moat (in Latin """"fossa""""). """"Cetate"""" is the Romanian word derived from """"civitas"""".  | Talk

You can also write this as M*(1+r)*(1+p), where r is the real interest rate and p is the rate of inflation.  Then you get the first equality for r.  It reduces to i - p when p is small, or if the rates are measured instantaneously (something that probably only a mathematicians would do). -",0

And, perhaps most importantly, he clearly didn’t catch how Susan treated individuals who accused Bush of being Hitler just several years ago.[] Obviously I don’t intend for that video to go up in the article, but I include it to demonstrate that Xeno’s Hitler-related argument is, to be charitable, a laughing matter.

That article is ok I guess, the Androgyny section could use a better explanation, but meh. I dumped some stuff into the section about docking to dead ships/stations, cause it was just so crap and WRONG. Needs some polish now, as I didn't delete anything, just added a nice read which could be trimmed, but that article is very short and could use some meat on it's bones. Anyhow """"the Shenzhou spacecraft could to dock at the International Space Station if it becomes politically feasible in the future"""" still isn't too bad because it's correct. Even if the docking adapters never existed in the first place, the statement is still true. Even if there was no USOS, the statement is still true. You see what I mean ? It could happen, doesn't mean it will, it doesn't rule out or rule in any possibilities, sure we could endlessly qualify it like """"the Shenzhou spacecraft could to dock at the International Space Station if it becomes politically feasible in the future, so long as the station is not deorbited first, or has it's budget cut, or the APAS's are covered, mangled, sold, ejected, stolen by Ivan Ivanovich, america doesn't declare war on china, ESA doesn't declare martial law on columbus"""" and so forth. It's just that it's a correct statement as is, plus, short and sweet. I'm very happy that what you are saying is correct, and belongs somewhere with other future maybe plans, however it has little to do with china because the docking is already tenuous at best, and so not going to happen in the next few years, and if it does, they will need to prepare anyway. So where is the article that outlines a hypothetical docking to the ISS to tell us where it is or isn't ? It's pretty much all speculation and too far out on a limb to outline such hypothetical within the China section, better to just mention the hypothetical possibility of docking as a point of interest and move on with the now and is. The location of the hypothetical docking would be subject to political pressures, like if ESA and RSA forced america to agree, by no longer provisioning services like transport, then it would be ROS docking, but if the US and China made up it would be an american module docking, and so forth, hardware would be provisioned to reflect the nature of the political decision.

"""RfC: controversial multi-page move ==

 Summary by 89.101.221.42  

The issue is a recurring one. Proponents wanted:
 Ireland → Ireland (island) (or a variation)
 Republic of Ireland → Ireland (state) (or a variation)
 Ireland (disambiguation) → Ireland (or a variation)

Several different polls were opened simultaneously on (old page names):
 Ireland
 Ireland (disambiguation)
 Ireland disambiguation task force

A related poll had been run exactly one month earlier at (old page name):
 Republic of Ireland

And one month before then again also at (old page name):
 Republic of Ireland (archive)

Participation at the Ireland page was widest and consensus was against the move. Participation on two (recent) polls at the Republic of Ireland page also had wide participation and fell heavily against the move (both were closed). Participation at the disambiguation and task force pages were limited, but consensus in those polls came down (weakly) in favour of the move.

On this occasion the closing admin was:
 

Initially, Tariqabjotu performed the move request in error - having only seen the request at the task force page. When this was brought to his attention, he posted a response on this talk page. His decision was to maintain the move against consensus as consensus had arrived at """"an illogical conclusion"""" (which he linked to Wikipedia:Polling is not a substitute for discussion). Later, he would comment that he had not read the discussions because, """"There's so much stuff to wade through..."""".

Issues believed to be at play:
 Forum shopping
 Vote stacking
 Consensus
 Polling is not a substitute for discussion

(Some) issues at play during the discussion:
 Disambiguation: Is there a primary topic?
 Naming convetions: Controversial names

OBJECTION: What kind of 'summary' is this? The """"propenents wanted.."""" section above is selective.. where are the non-forked 'Ireland' options that opened the WP:IDTF taskforce? (ie Ireland as either state or island, but not both and not part of a dual state situation with Republic of Ireland??) The IP has ignored all the many main issues, and all the problems that have got us here, too.  Why are we letting this particular IP do this? I propose archiving this section, as it is clearly disrupting (and made to disrupt) the discussion and progress being made above it. He is spamming it all over Wikpedia too.

It is odd that China, socialist country, does not guarantee health care for all its citizens. It does for many, but not for all.

A Few Things I Wanted to Say
I don't understand why everyone thinks Cockney can only be spoken on the East End.  It seems to be much more of a working or lower class accent found all over London (maybe not """"all over"""", but certainly not just the East End).  If you listen to sound clip for example, you'll hear a man from Peckham.  Peckham is not in the East End, instead it is in South London, and yet he is more Cockney than anyone I have heard in my life.  It says in this article as well that most characters on the sitcom Only Fools and Horses are Cockneys, and yet that takes place where else but in Peckham.  This article also says that Snatch contains Cockney accents and yet Jason Statham who plays one of the main characters in that film and seems to speak with one of those accents, is actually from Sydenham, in south-east London.    

What are some differences between the so-called """"South London"""" (south of the Thames) accent and """"North London"""" accent?  I just find it annoying that locals claim to be able hear differences between the two and yet they never can describe those differences when asked.  It makes one doubt whether such differences even exist.  It's kind of like how New Yorkers claim to be able to distinguish between Bronx accents and Brooklyn accents, Irish New York accents and Italian New York accents, etc., but when asked what those differences are, they can't give you an answer.  It's all b.s. if you ask me.   """,0

"UNBLOCK - the question of integrity is not an issue for moderators?

Regardless of the WP:TRUTH that you seem to think you hold, Wikipedia works on a) WP:CONSENSUS, b) reliable sources, and c) a collegial editing environment. Your edits clearly show you're harassing an editor that you disagree with. You will not be permitted to continue that way. Please also note: stop typing in ALL CAPS - it's considered to be shouting, and that doesn't go over well on the internet (talk→ BWilkins ←track) 

Regardless of the WP:TRUTH that you seem to think you hold -  No, those rules are from WIKIPEDIA not me. What i dont see is you addressing the blatent biased opinion, synthesis, on an article which is viewed by others.

Please tell me does wikipedia allow ADMINS to hold a biased one sided opinion? When SIKH HISTORY admin have openly declared adherence to a strict orthodox viewpoint, you as MOD should really be enforcing wikipedias own rules on your own admin. You unblocking me is secondry to the blatent disregard for wikipedia rules on diet in sikhism. So its NOT MY truth that i hold, its wikikpedia rules that i hold, which YOU disregard. Now you have barred me, because you deem me argument on integrity an attack on ADMIN, when i have repeated over and over again, its an ISSUE of an article which is purely one sided. Now does wikipedia allow blatant disregard of rules from their own ADMIN? 

From the same scholar, same book, same ISBN NUMBER, one rejected and one accepted, the accepted statement fits in with the ADMINS own orthodox stance which he has openly declared on his Wikipedia page. 

1.QUOTE FROM ARTICLE - Gobind Singh Mansukhani states how vegetarianism and meat-eating has been left to the individual Sikh. 2.QUOTE FROM DELETED PASSAGE -scholars hold a view that Sikhism has an ambivalent view on diet, yet some accept that there are, 

“passages against meat eating”. REF for both 1 and 2. Gobind Singh Mansukhani, Introduction to Sikhism, Delhi: Hemkunt Press, ISBN 81-7010-181-6, “There are passages against meat, in the Adi Granth”. Both references from the SAME scholar, yet one is accepted which is favor of an ambivalent view towards diet, while another assessment from the same scholar admitting their are passages against meat eating, is not accepted. Why the Double standards? 

Why does the ADMIN on sikhhistory, blatantly support their own ideological stance, to the point of synthesis, and selectively using texts and passages, from authors who they cite, and then reject the same authors when going against their position? 

How can you adressing harassment, yet make no attempt on addressing the issue of BIAS in your articles? Do you only protect the Orthodox Sunni islamic view? and the unorthodox shia view?...IF that is not the case, then please can you tell me why sikhhistory ADMIN have taken the biased stance of only abiding by an orthodox POV.

I dont think these questions im asking is harassment, but if my objection is avoided time and again, and the same allegations being made towards the same ADMIN for being one sided, you again have AVOIDED the issue at hand, which is a biased article protected by ADMIN to support their own beleifs, i think that is a greater offense than my trying to get some sense from the ADMIN in question. lol.",0

Likewise, Catt's """"electromagnetism"""" does not pass muster. """"Displacement Current (and how to get rid of it)"""" throws up quite enough problems.

Since """"displacement current"""" is the prediction that a changing electric field causes a magnetic field, the only way to disprove the concept is to disprove the existence of the effect. Catt et al didn't even try to do this. It would appear that they think that because they can get to the end of the calculation without introducing """"displacement current"""" that they can say that it doesn't exist. They are in total denial of the fact that their mathematics works because it has the equations that describe a capacitor built into it. Catt has quoted Davidson as (in effect) calling the Telegrapher's Equations """"absurd"""" because they model a TL as a capacitor, when Catt & Davidson know that a capacitor is a TL. [Electromagnetics ch6]. Although Catt would undoubtedly claim that the equations describing the TL are based on experiment they are, in fact, derived from the Telegrapher's Equations in the first place.

Also, everything you linked to Dennis Brown, was quite obviously meant as humor. """"ALL I DID WAS TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT COAL WITH SOURCES. Those who blocked me ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG COAL AND I EXPOSED THEIR NEFARIOUS plots. Please FREE KINGSHOWMAN!"""" 

Don't Wikipedia editors catch obvious attempts at humour? Perhaps you didn't find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called """"Coal Wars"""". I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coal's Health and Environmental Effects. I wasn't taking an unreasonable position, and you will now see, that thanks to my tireless, thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia, that information is now in the lead on Coal. (not through reverts by me, but by others who agreed with my position.) I have not edited coal since my block, so I'm not quite sure how it makes sense to blocvk me again for something that I haven't gone back to doing.

Also, I did not harrass Flyer22. She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events,  which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her """"Happiness"""" article under the section """"Philsoophy of Happiness."""" Arguably (as other editors agreed) Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsche's moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn't perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness. Flyer22 reverted my edit, giving a basically spurious reason: """"Unsourced"""" as I recall. But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the SEP. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.

Then, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me """"ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR."""" I thought this was rather rude and ignorant, especfially as she saw fit to specifically attack my Hume edits (when Hume was not under discussion) telling me """"your edits on Hume largely consit of such (read=poor) edits and I'm tempted to revert them."""" Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks. She was the one who harrassed me, and I thought we were done with this sordid little episode until she popped back up, eager to participate in the latest round of mob justice.   Kingshowman""",1

 User:Varsovian 

Instead of keeping a low profile for awhile he immediately inserted himself into a discussion on WikiProject about the Nazi collaborator Anthony Sawoniuk. The nationality of Anthony Sawoniuk is yet determined, the only source which says his mother was Polish is a newspaper article. In a provocative style Varsovian started to compare the Nazi collaborator and war criminal Sawoniuk with Frederic Chopin(!).  """"That makes him more Polish than Chopin!"""", """"If Sawoniuk isn't Polish, neither is Chopin"""". I have asked him what has Chopin to do with Sawoniuk and reply was this:  """"if he isn't Polish, neither is Chopin"""", """"Unless we can find a source which says that Sawoniuk's father was a nationality other than Polish, Sawoniuk is purely Polish"""". This is crazy, he should provide sources that Sawoniuk and his father is Polish not others that he is not. Not happy enough that he needlessly dragged Chopin's name into the discuss on a Nazi collaborator, he opened a new section titled Chopin vs Sawoniuk. . I asked him to provide sources:  and the reply was this:  no sources provided and more comparisons between F.Chopin and Sawoniuk. He also accused me that I am """"trying to distract attention from yet another warning you this week received despite being under a DIRWIGEN official caution"""". I am most certainly not trying to distract attention from anything but I have a problem when somebody compares a Nazi collaborator of uncertain nationality with Frederic Chopin. I request you review if Varsovian's conduct is not in violation of the standards expected in the EE area.

Robert Seymour (illustrator) v. Seymour Controversy 

REF: Fribbler. 19th September 2008. EDIT: (It's not """"the"""" Jane Seymour. It was his wife.) 

The fact of Robert’s wife ( and daughter ) named Jane Seymour, in comparison with “the” Jane Seymour, must be considered when analyzing evidences, motives and causations of Robert’s death. 

“The” Jane Seymour wife of Henry VIII was mother to the last English King Edward VI. (English law forbade matrilineal succession) As determined in the will of Henry VIII, Edward Seymour, Lord Beauchamp (b.1561), his 3 sons; 3 daughters and brother, were all named as successors to the English Throne, (then again after Elizabeth I, and James I.) 

The 1st evidence of a Seymour (Beauchamp) ancestry being usurped* occurred in the German 1st reign (matrilineal descent) of King George 1st. His Prime Minister; Walpole ('his' crest representing the House of Wettin – Queen Victoria) usurped the confiscated McDermott – Beauchamp Arms (Chevron; Cross Crosslet, and motto Dieu et mon Droit.) 

During the childless reign of King William IV, Robert Seymour’s suicide verdict literally determined him as a felon, and for his crime, his properties were forfeited to William IV, for the German 2nd reign (Victoria’s matrilineal descent) of her Sax Coburg-Gotha heirs. 

Thus, the (Seymour) succession of Edward VI; went to (Sax Coburg-Gotha) Edward VII. 24 September 2008 (UTC)

Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)

(EDIT: Opposition to the oath)

Parliamentary Opposition: An Early Day Motion (12th June 2008) to change the Oath of Allegiance, was brought before the British Parliament by 22 parliamentarians, representing over 1.45 million; English, Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh (British) constituents. This EDM arguement was widely reported in the international medium on 8th August 2008.

 Suggesion for a more compact grid 

I'd like to propose a new grid format for the income inequality list. I've uploaded a screenshot here. By combining the UN/CIA """"R/P 10%"""" columns and the World Bank/CIA/GPI """"Gini index"""" columns, and by writing the years directly besides the values, we can make this grid much more readable. Of course, one could not sort by year anymore, but I don't think this is such an issue. Whichever source (UN, CIA, WB, GPI) has the latest value, that source's data should be displayed. I don't see a need for displaying different sources, since they probably all calculate those indices using the same data.

"""Well, I do interpret that as """"apology"""" that is not entirely, not quite; though, maybe, nearly.

You have put extensive effort into it however, which might indicate some sincerity, even if I feel further  insulted.

So, as another problem w/ this website, you might just not comprehend many features of what I have been saying about the website's features.

Or, maybe you like having me typewrite f/ several hours extra, as I've already proclaimed that it's excruciating.

This may not be accurate; but, very little of what you,  many of you, say about me is anywhere close to accurate:  I feel as if I, me, am fighting from w/in my disabilities, on the largest website, aside from  searchengines, against several thousand members of an  oligarch   plutocrat   overclass, with the wealth to purchase a new machine, w/ the best programming, every time a new  television commercial  flashes.

Again, that may not be accurate; but, that is how it seems.

Through nearly two years, I've fought through many misperceptions.  Several of you have insisted on """"brain damaged"""".  One  aqua  has insisted that I'm too European, something that it had found on another website about France, Italy.

Now, role has insisted that I'm too American, despite what I've written about  bbcamerica, & that I do not comprehend a clock, nor a  calendar.

You've deleted my response to those attacks; you've deleted my plea for more description of the wings.   Your deletion converted role's attacks into libel.  Minor, virtually insignificant libel; but, libel  nonetheless.

&, with all of the other libel that you, all of you, have attacked me with, for two years, how else might I stop it?

As long as you insist that you were correct all along, that  obviates all  apology:

  I would urge you not to remove other's {others'} comments with a summary of """"libel"""" unless they really are. I still don't see any libel in them.

That sentence means that you assert the right to  label, including  libel.  That is not apology.

First you have me too European, then too American, both as insults,..... libel.

If someone offers an apology, then virtually completely contradicts it, well, what is that?

When I had heard  Peter_Burkill's name, I had input his name, immediately, on this website.  That brought me to that page.  I had recalled another crash long ago.  I'd, eventually, confirmed the name, through some searches,  Alfred_Haynes.  I wanted to assert a connection there, & honor them.

You can clearly see when I'd learned of  Eric_Moody,  John_Coward.  Each of those names are rather ironic, considering who they are, in reality.

Why does what I've said of the wings  offend you such that you cannot even acknowledge that I've said it many, many times over?

Well, I know, factually, that I've read several messages, pining f/ a way, to trick me off, force me off, otherwise get rid of,.....

Well, one specific method to reduce the time that I have to scribe on this website would also be positive: if I could figure how to start one, or more, of my own.  It is obvious that many of you do not prefer positive  modi operandi.  But, however, maybe one of you, @ least one, is truly positive, & sufficiently  knowledgeable.

If any of you are positive, yet approximately as  ignorant  as I am, I would accept, welcome, your assistance anyhow.

I do hope to improve this  disambiguation:

"Thanks a lot. Before I thought wiki stores only diff's between versions. As we can think that the most simple compression method is saving the diff sections For example, in order to save 
{1000, 1003, 1005, 1021, 1240, 1241} we only needed to save {1000, 3+, 2+, 16+, 1240, 1+}, and
this is indentical to the basic of image compression like jpeg, or motion compression like mpeg.
In order to save motion pictures, mpeg used I frame, P frame, P frame, ..., I frame, P frame, ....,
so I was suprised to hear that wiki saves all the verion in full text format. Anyway thanks.

in detail how the wikipedia saves its every pages of every version in detail and how the editing warrings (edit battle?) effects on the storage usage and how a single character addition effects on the storage usage, etc. If you had some authority on wiki and knew the stroge mechanism of wiki, how about to edit that page?

There are other definitions of 'false' than 'not true'.  For example: """"Deliberately untrue"""", """"Arising from mistaken ideas"""" and """"Intentionally deceptive"""".   The 'false' in 'false skeptic' is more likely one of these, describing people behaving as if skeptical even tho they're not (whether deliberately or not).  Pointing out that some people behave like this (backed up with reliable reports of such behavour) seems to be a valid part of this article, even if the label 'false skeptic' is confusing.  (edits) 

1.In your view and others yes. But there are others who view false as the opposite of truth as it is meant to be. Granted """" Nothing can be so completly itself that it does not contain something of its opposite."""" -Lao Tzu For the sake of argument false is not true. You are all opinion, though ultimately we all are. Either way, the majority opinion of """"false"""" is """"not true""""; pseudo. Therefore, to claim someone is a false skeptic is impossible since you can't prove if your view, let alone theres, is 100% and knows what """"true"""" skepticism is.= The logicians call this quite often the """"TRUE SCOTSMAN FALLACY"""". 2. We could all form websites, talk bs, and then use it or our friends as """"sources"""". The trouble is not in the getting of the source, but in the quality therein. Your view and sources lack quality and are not worthy of Wiki...particularly when applied to such a grand and ancient pylosophical view as Skepticism. For example; """"I know more than the average man in that I know that I know nothing.""""-Socrates . I believe he is saying that one can't know anything for certain and that this truth is the only real knowledge he has thus giving him an advantage that may not be there; a lovely paradox. Most view this statement to be that there is too much knowledge for one to know and that knowing this paradoxilly makes him wiser in his lack of wisdom. HOWEVER, you don't see me going to the page on Socrates, finding bs sources that support my rare view, and forcing hundreds of viewers in the future to be subject to my minority and severly lacking of analysis viewpoint, do you? I deleted it because it is unsalvageable. If you all persist in bringing it back after I delete it again then to hell with it. You can have this page.

 An except of analysis from the """"supposed"""" unreliable source

IT IS A RELIABLE SOURCE. Here is the analysis which I was simply trying to source from the page itself. Some of this is already in UON could I source that instead for the EXACT SAME CHANGE? My site, which is my lifes work as a master was deemed unreliable by non-chess players. Here is the analysis in regards to the pinksi line.

 Government Opinion: Australia - wording

The unanimous opinion of that Court was that Scientology is a religion.
The cited source is http://www.austlii.edu.au//cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/40.html?query=Church%20of%20the%20New%20Faith%20v%20Commissioner%20of%20Pay-Roll

This document states (Section 5):
The question whether Scientology is a religion cannot be answered, for there seem to be important, perhaps critically important, tenets of Scientology which the parties left without full examination. The question which can be answered is whether the beliefs, practices and observances which were established by the affidavits and oral evidence as the set of beliefs, practices and observances accepted by Scientologists are properly to be described as a religion.

Thanks for your comment.  I don't get much feedback about my translations.  I think the problem you have identified may be something other than a translation problem.  I have simply done a literal translation of the German text.  The comparison is with classification type A.  An R class loco will have been engineered to be able to go around corners faster than its A class equivalent.  So, eg, an Re 6/6 (bogie type Bo-Bo-Bo) loco will have a higher maximum cornering speed than an Ae 6/6 (bogie type Co-Co - less flexible).  The difference is particularly important on the Gotthardbahn, which is a very busy line with sharp curves.  This point is not made very clearly in the de.wiki article, perhaps because German speakers are likely to be much more familiar than English speakers with the Gotthardbahn.  Also, the first table in both articles is not as clear as the second table.  I would be happy to alter the first table in the en.wiki article a bit if you think that's appropriate.  Also, the word """"higher"""" may be a less confusing word to use than """"increased"""", even though the two words have slightly different meanings, and the latter is a more correct translation.

 Explanation 

Hi, I thought I'd explain why the pages keep getting deleted. The long and short is that we're really not quite sure what you are trying to do. The pages are given extremely unwieldy titles that are written like sentences, which makes them an unlikely search term. The pages also didn't assert how Razin was notable. 

I think that you were likely trying to write about Stepan Razin, as he was part of the Solovetsky Monastery Uprising. However I don't see anything on his page to show that he was an artist. You commented somewhere that there were paintings of his on eBay, which makes it unlikely that these two Razins are the same person. It's possible, but extremely unlikely. I think that the Razin that's a painter is probably a far more recent person since a search for """"S Razin"""" (the name that comes up in the eBay auctions) shows that he's from the 21st century, not from the 1600s.

That is, why not say:

If true, that lets somebody know exactly what a Coxeter group is without knowing what the word """"presentation"""" means, or (worse) having to know or accept on faith any theorems about presentations.

Then the stuff about m_ij and so on could be presented as consequences of the definition.  And those who know about presentations could then say """"Ah, yes, and in fact the class of Coxeter groups can be defined via presentations"""".

I think in general definitions should involve just as little apparatus as possible, and only involve extra machinery when that significantly shortens and simplifies what is being defined.

An easier definition should never depend on a harder definition.

Of course, if i'm wrong and this is not what a Coxeter group is, somebody please explain and give a counterexample, and thanks in advance.

 Factual error and substitution of opinion for fact concerning reconstruction of infratructure

The introduction to the article makes the following claim: 

""""Beginning with the invasion in 2003, a Multinational coalition of forces, mainly American and British, has occupied Iraq. The invasion has led to increased civil violence, political breakdown, the removal and execution of former president Saddam Hussein, and national problems in the development of political balance, economy, infrastructure, and use of the country's massive reserves of oil.""""

The inference about problems in infrastructure is factually inaccurate. There is ample documentation available online, at sites such as www.enr.com (site of Engineering News-Record, the world's leading construction and engineering professional journal) and the U. S. Department of Defense news site at http://www.defendamerica.mil/, of the extent of reconstruction and new construction in Iraq, especially in remedying deterioration and neglect dating to the Saddam regime. 

Given the freedoms the Iraqis now have, and have won for themselves, and their liberation from an undeniably tyrannical regime (facts not mentioned in this introduction), the claim that """"these issues have led to major setbacks for Iraq"""" is obviously opinion masquerading as fact.  """,0

 Armenian Genocide 
Peres' denial of the genocide should be noted in this article, failing to do so makes it more of a hagiography than a biography. His shortcomings must also be mentioned in addition to his feats like winning the noble prize. Do you think it'd fit better in political views? In anycase it must, and will, be mentioned somewhere. How about adding this in his political views segment: 

Peres' foreign policy outlook is markedly realist. For example, to placate Turkey, the only significant Muslim country in the region that is friendly towards Israel, Peres has explicity denied the Armenian genocide, which caused an uproar among genocide scholars.(citation)   

Peres made these statements in 2001, when he was foreign minister. Clearly, he was caving in to Turkish pressure. Israel has very few friends and cannot afford to lose them, so basically it is not free to take the position that would seem to mesh with its outlook and history, which is to recognize that the Armenians were murdered en mass. Now he is president, an honorary position, not a political one, and his """"views,"""" whatever they may have been back then, are worth about as much as mine are. I have no problem with mentioning this """"view"""" in the section on his political outlook, but a separate section on this one utterance gives it undue importance and distorts the picture.

Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1970) is a R&B; and pop singer, songwriter, record producer and occasional actress of the 1990s and 2000s. Making her debut in 1990, she became the most successful and best-selling artist of the coming decade according to Billboard magazine and the World Music Awards. In 2000, the World Music Awards show named her the best-selling female recording artist of all time.

Carey is noted for her distinctive singing style that makes frequent use of melismas and other ornamentation, and she possesses a five-octave vocal range. She released a throng of number-one hits while signed to Columbia Records, formerly run by then-husband Tommy Mottola, and several of them broke chart records. By the turn of the millennium, however, Carey's popularity with critics and the public had entered decline, and she was dropped from her new record label following a highly-publicised physical breakdown and an unsuccessful foray into film. In 2005, Carey returned to the forefront of popular music with the release of the multi-platinum The Emancipation of Mimi.

Biography and music career
Early life and discovery
Carey was born in Huntington, New York. She is the third and youngest child of Patricia Hickey, a Catholic opera singer and voice coach of Irish-American descent, and Alfred Roy Carey (né Núñez), an aeronautical engineer of Afro-Venezuelan descent. She was named after the song """"And They Call the Wind Maria"""", from the musical Paint Your Wagon. Carey's siblings include her older sister Alison, and her older brother Morgan. As a multiracial family, the Carey household was met with racial slurs, hostility, and sometimes violence, causing the family to move frequently around the New York area. The strain on the family led to the divorce of Carey's parents when she was three years old. Carey had little contact with her father, and her mother worked several jobs to support the family.

Spending much of her time at home alone, Carey turned to music as an outlet. She began singing at the age of four, and first performed in public at the age of six. She began writing songs while in grade school, and her mother and the members of her opera company were impressed with her talents when Carey hit a cue note that her mother had missed. Carey attended and graduated from Oldfield Middle School and Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, although she was frequently absent due to efforts to break into the music business. After moving to New York City, she eventually landed a role as a backup singer for Brenda K. Starr.

In 1988, Carey met Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola at a party, where Starr gave him a demo tape. Mottola played the tape while leaving the party and was very impressed by what he heard. He returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. Nevertheless, Mottola tracked her down and signed her to a recording contract. This Cinderella-like story became part of the standard publicity surrounding Carey's entrance into the industry.

1990–1992: Early commercial success
Carey's professional music career began with the release of her eponymous debut album, Mariah Carey, in 1990. Carey co-wrote all of the compositions on her debut album with songwriter-producers such as Ric Wake and Rhett Lawrence, and would continue to co-write nearly all of her material for the rest of her career. The album debuted low on t",0

The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not all use metric systems.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, or simply (against all international rules) not available. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Everybody likes to avoid the mistakes others made. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish for many years these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Aviation security and safety is not a joke. Because we are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large, the books become too expensive (especially for third world countries) and after a certain time the publication is no more available. You should appreciate what we do instead of insulting us. You think we make any money out of this? Think about translation costs, not everybody works for free. This way you do not help wikipedia, but you are a stumble block. You are probably some kind of Johnny the Selfkicker.

Coomplaint procedure?

No doubt there is a lot of link spam. But no doubt many contributors of good articles start small and then build the piece in layers. That's completely human and completely understandable. The better recourse would have been to insert that tag about possible deletion, rather than deleting within such a short period of time. I had just created the stub. I am new to Wiki and perceived that I was up against a vandal. Indeed I was. How much more disturbing to learn that the destroyer has some form of administrative rights.

I'm new here, and it's not a paying job, clearly. I'm not sure I want to learn the ropes of Wikipedia politics and egos, as the obvious value of Wikipedia is compelling enough, and the ugliness of personalities warped by power within a volunteer effort is unhealthy to that effort. The impulse to characterize someone who stands up for their contribution as """"nasty"""" or """"threatening"""" ... the see-what-I-mean response to a contributor not aware of the emotional satisfaction some may draw from arbitrary deletions, from deliberately provoked confrontations to assure themselves of their own power, is sad. All my foregoing comments no doubt cements some of you more firmly in your smugness and self-satisfaction. Regardless of the barnacles that cling to its hull, I assert that the Wiki concept is, fortunately, apparently more powerful than the base human dynamics it nurtures  but does not ultimately tolerate.

i am asked to let it drop. I don't claim to be a Wiki expert, but I bet there is a complaint procedure. Anyone care to point me in the right direction? The article stub was summarily deleted three times, but after that, the vandal chose to insert an alert of possible deletion instead. This indicates to me that the proper procedure was not followed the first three times. What's the complaint procedure? My further complaint will be regarding the dynamic of portraying someone who stands up for themselves in a reasoned and civil way as having an attitude problem. That's probably the most corrosive thing to a volunteer effort.""",0

[edit] Armenian Genocide
Peres' denial of the genocide should be noted in this article, failing to do so makes it more of a hagiography than a biography. His shortcomings must also be mentioned in addition to his feats like winning the noble prize. Do you think it'd fit better in political views? In anycase it must, and will, be mentioned somewhere. How about adding this in his political views segment:

Peres' foreign policy outlook is markedly realist. For example, to placate Turkey, the only significant Muslim country in the region that is friendly towards Israel, Peres has explicity denied the Armenian genocide, which caused an uproar among genocide scholars.(citation) E10ddie (talk) 

Peres made these statements in 2001, when he was foreign minister. Clearly, he was caving in to Turkish pressure. Israel has very few friends and cannot afford to lose them, so basically it is not free to take the position that would seem to mesh with its outlook and history, which is to recognize that the Armenians were murdered en mass. Now he is president, an honorary position, not a political one, and his """"views,"""" whatever they may have been back then, are worth about as much as mine are. I have no problem with mentioning this """"view"""" in the section on his political outlook, but a separate section on this one utterance gives it undue importance and distorts the picture. Gilabrand (talk)  

[edit] sumac opening sentence
I don't know what the right wording is, but do you see the problem with """"Sumac (also Rhus) is a genus of approximately 250 species of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae""""? First of all, there is no reason to italicize Sumac. Secondly, it is not accurate to say """"Sumac is a genus"""" because there is no genus called Sumac (but there is one called Rhus).

I may be too steeped in botanical jargon to easily come up with something which is natural to non-plant-people. But we need to figure out something which (a) works whether people get to this page as Sumac or Rhus (currently, the latter is a redirect to the former; policy would have it the other way around), and (b) doesn't mix up scientific names versus common names in a confusing way. Kingdon (talk) 

I am not a botanist and my reason for reading the article was because of the spice, which is used all over the Middle East. I was surprised that the spice didn't rate a mention in the lead. Sumac needs to be the first word in keeping with Wikipedia norms, and the same as the title of the article (i.e., not plural). How about: """"Sumac refers to a variety of shrubs or small trees of the genus Rhus, as well as the purplish spice that is produced from its dried, crushed berries Gilabrand (talk)  
Looks like Richard New Forest (talk · contribs) has solved it for us (I'm happy with his wording). As for """"first word"""", Wikipedia policy isn't quite that strict (""""earliest natural point in the prose"""" at Wikipedia:Lead section#Bold title and I don't know whether a plural fits under """"slightly different form"""" or not). Anyway, enough",0

The first Tudor King, Henry VII, came to the throne by winning the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, which was Tudor vs. York. The next year he married Elizabeth of York which helped legitimise his claim to the throne; but any tensions in the next few years were Tudor vs. York, not Tudor and York vs. """"Plantagenet assemblies.""""

"2004 Bonnie? What about Charley? 

I recall Hurricanes Bonnie and Charley hitting Florida within a day of each other, and both of them passing off the Jersey Shore a few days later.  It was the remnants of Charley, not Bonnie, which brought the heaviest rain to the Jersey Shore on August 15th, 2004. Bonnie might have spread some light rain a day or two earlier, I don't specifically remember, but Charley passed off our coast as a 40 mile per hour tropical storm. I remember this clearly because the most intense wind and rain were far ahead of Charley's center, and when the center was closest, there was no rain or wind to speak of onshore, mostly offshore. Earlier that day, Charley had been a Category One hurricane off of South Carolina, and a day or two before that, a monster Category 4, hitting Punta Gorda, Florida. Later that season, New Jersey got rains from the remnants of Frances, Gaston, Ivan & Jeanne. Jeanne was the strongest, and brought the most intense winds of that season, although Charley was far wetter. I will try to find sources to back this up, but I have followed every New Jersey tropical storm & hurricane since 1976, and work in the Office of Emergency Management. Some of the worst conditions I've ever experienced were during the passage of Tropical Storm Ernesto in 2006, because the wind and rain lasted a long, long time: about two days, with frequent gusts near hurricane force, even over that threshold just south of here..  Floyd, Bertha, Gloria and Belle were  stronger, but they moved faster. My community, Seaside Heights was in the direct center of 70 mph Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999, with a dead calm lasting about an hour, sandwiched between periods very, very wind conditions. Hanna in '08 was the biggest wimp of all these storms: a bit of rain and wind, but mostly hype.

I looked up the history of Bonnie and Charley from the National Hurricane Center.

Bonnie, http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2004bonnie.shtml? passed east of the Jersey Shore, and probably did bring light rain, but it was not memorable

Two days later, on the 15th, Charley, http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2004charley.shtml?  did the same, but in a much more dramatic way.

I am going to add this to the page. Thanks.

There has been other extensive vandalism here by Steinsky, who also removed the very significant piece of information that Sustrans are not a membership organisation.  That is verifiable via the Charity Commission, but a most inconvenient fact for those who want to imply that Sustrans is in some way democratic and accountable.

Hi. It's from the same user who was changing the images before on similar articles. Not to mention that, both images are good resolutions, contrary to what the user says, which is why I don't see the need to change images, delete galleries and remove content. It's unnecessary.

"The article isn't about Christians only, but all of Christianity, and what has been done in its name.  I agree that many of the aid efforts need to be discussed, showing some positive contribution by Christianity (if not in the article, through a link to an article on the Contributions of Christianity), but then it also needs to show what has happened illy in its name.  Al Qaeda would be a destructive force in Islam that most Muslims would reject without a problem, but still such discussion would belong in Islam.  Of course notice must be taken in the aid efforts that many organizations (though not all) require conversion or similar measures to recieve the aid.  That is something that Jesus would also be against, IMO.  We should discuss as much as possible, good article size is 30-50 kb excluding markup, as in the brackets for links, image code, reference markup, etc.  So we have plenty of room to add such things, given Christianity being such a large subject.

The witch hunts are certainly Christian, as are the crusades, though not all Christians supported either.... the Catholic Church, for example, ran the Crusades and the Orthodox city of Constanople was the sole target of one Crusade as the crusaders sacked the city and never actually fulfilled their mission.

"Could someone please make the discussion about comparing medical vs. veterinary school admissions more concise?  I have lived in two states, Michigan, and California.

Is this the result of boards of medicine limiting the numbers?

However, cladistics does not solve the problem, but only transfers it into concepts, erroneously equalizing time with space. The problem (i.e., ambiguity) is actually the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. This statement is extremely difficult to understand, although it is perfectly clear: the problem (i.e., ambiguity) is the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. The problem to understand it may be due to that it is a difference, since a difference is unsolvable. This problem, that is, this fact, is consistently incorporated into concepts in a systematization of the Linnean kind (i.e., categories of categories). It means that the possibility for lumping and splitting is both necessary and unavoidable. An unambiguous conceptualization is simply impossible. The question whether this fact means that reality is ambiguous has to be answered with: yes. There is no way to escape this ambiguity. Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  ]

"SimCopter Shenanigans
Hiya. I originally followed this controversy in PC Gamer (my god, back when printed magazines were worth a shit), so off the top of m yhead I didn't have any sites. 

I remember there being a few Geocities webpages on SimCopter, but by the time I had graphical internet (circa 1998) it was already considered an old school game.

One page I found while googling that mentions the controversy is http://www.langston.com/Fun_People/1996/1996CFM.html  another is http://lists.samurai.com/pipermail/bryans-list/1996-December/001811.html  apparently the programmer who inserted this easter egg was fired. Go figure - and here we have people trying to push the view that the Clinton years were all about tolerance. What a load. 

ANYWAY, before I go off on a political tangent, check out those sites, and I'll try to find some actual SimCopter sites at some point (though I get the feeling this will be a fruitless endeavor)",0

Stone Censors
I don’t know that I’m wrong; in fact, I’m quite certain that you and AuburnPilot are in the wrong. You can censor me and block me all you want – you’ve got the power – but you can’t make me confess to wrongs of which I am innocent. Not yet, anyway. And you can’t make me say that you’re right, when you are as wrong as hell. It’s about time somebody talked back to you.

“If you were to discuss your edits, you won't [sic] be in this position right now.” (Since I had already discussed my edits, physicq’s statement above is a case of “a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood.”)

That’s funny peculiar, because wikicensors with the correct politics somehow never have to “discuss” their “edits.” They just go and censor people with whom they disagree, and then demand that the censees justify the worth of the censored passages or links or footnotes. And guess what? The censees’ explanations, no matter how well-founded and eloquent, are never sufficient to make the censors change their minds. Once an editor realizes that nothing he says will have any positive effect on the censors (or should I say, """"commissars""""?), he would be a fool to waste his time and energy trying to change that which cannot be changed. That the censors continue demanding such arguments is because they have a sadistic glee for wasting other people’s precious time and energy.

In case an open-minded (but perhaps less experienced) reader should suspect that I am just engaging in bluster, I had already made my argument in my previous entry on this page (which AuburnPilot has archived in a handsome tan box at the bottom of User_talk:AuburnPilot under the uncivil category, “spam”) for why the footnotes and links I inserted were legitimate, but physicq aka physicq210 derided those arguments as a “polemic, complete with fallacious personal attacks,” and mocked my criticism of his abuse of authority as “whining.” In one case, I pointed out that the external link that AuburnPilot defamed as “spam” and censored, was a classic magazine article related to the  Racial Profiling Hoax.

(Speaking of which, Wikipedia's Racial profiling article is hopelessly POV through the censors’ deleting of links to articles debunking the hoax, and inserting of links to fraudulent “literature” such as thoroughly debunked work by the ACLU.)

In the case of a footnote that AuburnPilot also defamed as “spam” and censored, he cut the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the  Duke Rape Hoax, which was published by the most brilliant, reliable magazine on the Web, VDARE.

BTW, AuburnPilot asserts that the sources in question are not “reliable” or “verifiable,” and do not maintain “neutrality.” Aside from the fact that thousands of Wikipedia articles are transparent political propaganda, or no more than love or hate letters to certain public figures (particularly entertainers or athletes), AuburnPilot has misrepresented the Wikipedia rule on neutrality. There is no requirement that every source be neutral (as opposed to reliable and verifiable), only that every Wikipedia article be neutral.

WP:NPOV

“All Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by a reliable source. For guidance on how to make an article conform to the neutral point of view, see the NPOV tutorial.”

As for “verifiablilty,” the VDARE source has over 100 hyperlinks to supporting documentation from newspapers, magazines, TV and radio news organizations, and legal filings; if that isn’t “verifiable,” then nothing is.

Now, I ask you. If I have already made my best argument for including the aforementioned links and footnotes, and physicq aka physicq210 responds by misrepresenting what I said, claiming that I have made no attempt at supporting my position, and referring to my defense as “whining,” what possible reason could I have for continuing such a charade?

Plus, why should I be on the defensive? If I were dealing with fair, reasonable people, that might make sense. But fair, reasonable people would not do as AuburnPilot did, and first censor my edits, and then demand I justify their value on the talk pages. (And physicq would not have responded to an edit war by throwing in with AuburnPilot, immediately blocking me, and charging me with “disruptive edits.” That alone is proof of physicq’s unfitness as an administrator.) No, AuburnPilot would not have censored my work, but would have asked me on the talk page why I thought it belonged. No, strike that. He would have hit the links and read the articles in question.

Dear Sir,

First, please do not email Jimmy Wales about Wikipedia issues. We have official
contact addresses for this - Jimmy just forwards misdirected emails to them and
thus contacting him simply increases delays.

We apologize for what happened.

Let me clear some misunderstanding. Wikipedia is operated by volunteers, not by
employees of Jimmy Wales or the Wikimedia Foundation. This may account for some
amount of disorganization. If you expect professional service, then, obviously,
Wikipedia cannot provide it, because it is not a professional organization.

""""Willy on Wheels"""" is/was the name of a very obnoxious user that laid waste on
Wikipedia. He kept on creating accounts with usernames based on 'willy' and 'wheels'.

Because of this, there is a de facto standing order against creating account names
based on 'willy' and 'wheels'.

The simplest solution by far is for you to take an account name that does not
include both 'willy' and 'wheels'.

Yours sincerely,
Bernard Dupre

1.  My intentions after the second ban was not to create another account using Willy and Wheels. I never told you that was what I wanted. I was confused at why I was banned from even commenting and my IP was banned.

2. I don't care what distruction this other person caused, calling someone you do not know bogus as Ohnoitsjamie did should not be tolerated. I was not and am not here to cause trouble.

3. Saying that I am here to harrass and threaten is wrong. I read your incident report. I also read the block you placed on my current IP.  I have not harrassed and I have not threatened. I simply want an apology for what I have deemed bad relations on you and Ohno's part.

4. All I want is a sincere apology for calling me bogus and accusing me of threats and harrassment and then I will go away.  If not, I will forward all messages before and from this point on to Mr. Dupre and what administrator actions need to be taken will be taken. His apology in the second line says it all.

I understand you, but you also should understand me. You shouldn't revert my work. As you can see, I don't disrupt your edits at articles Draza Mihailovic, Josip Broz Tito, or at Template:Yugoslav Axis collaborationism. I realy respect your effort and work there, and I don't revert it. I have no desire to get blocked, or to drag you into another blockade. I want to resolve all this disputes with you. As you can see I already changed Template:Politics of Yugoslavia to a neutral, non-image version. These are my proposals to you:

1) If we put in place your version of the list of Yugoslav Prime Ministers, it will remove Drago Marusic as Prime Minister in 1945, between Ivan Subasic and Tito. If you agree to left him on the list, this dispute is over. If we agree about Marusic, we can also agree about the issue """"Kingdom or DF Yugoslavia"""".

2) Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a complete different state than Serbia and Montenegro. It wasn't like Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and Kingdom of Yugoslavia, or Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 2003, after the adoption of the Constitutional Charter, whole system of government was changed. Even the position of the Prime Minister was abolished, and merged with the position of the President. Those two countries realy need a separate articles. Also, their armies need a separate articles.

3) Articles President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and President of Serbia and Montenegro should remain separate. The last President of FRY was Vojislav Kostunica, from 2000 until 2003 when he was replaced by Svetozar Marovic of SCG (2003-2006). Those two offices was very different (President of FRY wasn't both head of state and head of government, like President of SCG). 

4) Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia wasn't """"Prime Minister of Serbia and Montenegro"""", but of FRY. That article should retain its current name.

5) As you can see, yesterday I changed Template:Politics of Yugoslavia to a neutral, non-image version. I hope that you agree with this version.

That is so interesting and amazing. Besides, I wonder the information on Operating Mode. Is the original IA32e mode a sub-Mode of protected mode or a new mode like it in AMD64? Does the original 32-bit protected OS need to be changed from the scratch or just provides extension support for those new introduced 64-bit instructions? That is most amazing thing for me.

Idea for Further Reading
I am proposing the addition of a further reading section to this article. I have recently come across a book that I think would add more depth and breadth to the topic. It is titled, """"The Discovery of the Bismarck"""" by Robert D. Ballard, who is an authoritative figure on the subject of the German battleship, Bismark, since he was part of the crew that rediscovered the sunken wreck in 1988 and has already written another book already referenced in this article. The book contains an in depth history of the ship Bismarck, from different historical perspectives from all the ships involved in it's sinking, as well as documentation on the methodology and events of the ship that discovered the wreck. 198.189.57.4  """,0

The prejudicial error in using Google as an arbitrator in a situation like this is that any search for 'Yonsei' will also bring results for 'Yonsei University' etc as a partial search results. 

Using it properly, e.g. search for Yonsei minus the word university  provides a far more accurate result for its usage.

The user's final edit was to blank his Talk page with the edit summary """"fuck it.""""  The page blanking was reverted """"because of an active block"""".  The block is no longer active, the user has not returned to Wikipedia, and I think it is pretty clear that """"fuck it"""" is the equivalent of """"I am retiring from Wikipedia.""""  It seems to me that if someone has expressed quite clearly that they don't want to come back to Wikipedia and that they don't want their sad saga displayed on their Talk page for all eternity, that is within their rights.
Also, I question whether the initial reversion of the page blanking was even according to policy.  Show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page, hmmm?  While WP:DRC is merely a guideline, there is a distinct lack of Wikipedia policy limiting what kind of content users can remove from their Talk page.  I happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page (e.g. warnings <24 hours old and active block notices) but as it currently stands there is no such policy, at least not that I can find.  (If I am wrong, please enlighten me!)
If I have to abide by rules I think are dumb, then so does everybody else.  In fact, that is the difference between us and Karaku  Karaku disagreed with the rules so he chose to aggressively break them and call everyone else ignorant.  I disagree with the rules, but I realize they have been formed by community consensus and so I will abide by them as long as they are in place.  And by my interpretation of the current rules, Karaku's blanking of the Talk page should never have been reverted.  
Furthermore, while I recognize that I was using the word """"VANISH"""" imprecisely, it appears to be a longstanding tradition in Wikipedia that if a user wants to just leave and clear out the ugly history of their wrongdoing, they have the right to do that.  Karaku very clearly indicated a desire to do just that (is there really that much difference between putting a banner saying """"Retired"""" at the top of your Talk page vs. blanking the thing with the edit summary """"fuck it""""?).
Anyway, I'm obviously not going to get in an edit war over a retired user's talk page.  I'm just sort of surprised at the insistence to leave all this stuff in place when the user doesn't want it and Wikipedia policy provides no mechanism to override those wishes...   """,0

I think red tape accurately and succinctly communicates the situation you describe, especially given that in a prior version you yourself wrote
Attempts to rectify this situation working through official channels did not work
which it seems to me is the very essence of (extreme) red tape. If you like we can say instead official indifference or unresponsiveness, but I don't see how that better informs the reader.
I also don't see how your wording makes the point you mention re success in decrypting and the importance of that success. Obviously a request for more resources will try to convince the recipient that such will help the writers to better do what they've been tasked to do. To spell out that their desire was """"to achieve the productivity that was possible"""" would be completely superflous  of course that was the goal. And surely no reader needs to be told that better productivity / faster decrypting / etc. meant the entire difference between valuable intelligence and useless retrospective. Your wording doesn't mention any of that stuff anyway.
Further (as I've said before) I also don't see why it matters what specific type of resource was lacking  the important points are: (a) the codebreakers felt that they could not do the best job possible without more resources; (b) Churchill unhesitatingly granted them carte blanche, showing the importance he attached to their work and the breadth of his authority in making such decisions. What doesn't matter is just what it was that was lacking  typists? paperclips? light bulbs?
Some of these elements could be incorporated to enliven the narrative e.g. some kind of """"for want of a nail""""-type angle  """"Look, Prime Minister, you've gathered all these first-class minds here but we can't get anything done because we have to do our own bloody TYPING!""""  if sources lay something like that out.

"Difference between Swedish tomte and Jultomten 

From a Swedish perspective, this article seems to wildly alternate between describing a tomte and Jultomten which are very much two different things (albeit the difference has decreased over the years). Like the Swedish article correctly describes, a tomte is a mythical short grey and bearded creature that took care of the farm if treated nicely (or committed horrible mischief if not). The tomte had however nothing to do with handing out presents and existed long before Julbocken (the yule goat) was replaced by the modern Jultomten (basically a mix between a tomte and the American Santa Claus).",0

It's not that the """"this is not a discussion forum"""" tag is unfairly applied here; most other controversial articles usually have them, or they're applied when enough people have started posting about the subject and not the article.

ST's initiative was geared at editor retention, the way I see it. As he mentioned on his Talk page, he prefers facilitating collaboration than meting out discipline.
Unfortunately, there are problems with COI on Wikipedia, etc, and these issues are not all amenable to touchy-feely solutions. 
Although I haven't broached the possibility before, this case provides the opportunity for a hypothetical scenario. Supposing that the Koch brothers, to whommoney is no object, have some funds allocated in their PR efforts that include Wikipedia. Well, such editors are not going to be amenable to reason, because they would be being paid not to be reasonable.

Hi.  I'm , editor-in-chief of the Wikipedia Signpost.  We're doing candidate profiles for the Board elections.  We publish in a matter of hours, so I hope you can answer them before press time.  The questions we'd like you to answer are below.  Talk to  if you have any questions; he'll be covering the elections this year.  Thanks,   

Hello!

The Wikipedia Signpost, a community-newspaper in the English Wikipedia, is covering the Board of Trustees elections and will be featuring each of the candidates in next week's issue. As such, we would appreciate it if you would take some time to answer a few interview questions. Each candidate will be asked the same questions; by no means, though, feel obligated to answer any (or even) all of them, though we would greatly appreciate it if you did.

Some of the questions may be a bit redundant to the candidate information you have filled out already. This is both for convenience and for giving you the opportunity to expand on some of them a bit. However, we ask that you keep all responses brief, limiting them to no more than one or two paragraphs each.

You may leave replies to my English Wikipedia talk page, or on my meta talk page.

As always, the Signpost reserves the right to re-distribute the questions and replies, shorten any responses if necessary, and take any other editorial action deemed appropriate.

Over four hours??? Guess what I was doing during the four hours between 1:00am and 5:00am last night? Sleeping. Wikipedia is an international website with editors from all over the world; not everyone will have an opportunity to respond to a talk page comment at any given moment. People work. People study. People eat. And, yes, people sleep. Some people will edit every three hours; others will edit every three days. You cannot just say that because no one has commented in four hours a discussion is closed. I'd suggest waiting five to seven days after the conclusion of a conversation before considering it closed. 300 (film) is a very active article and there clearly are a lot of matters that are as of yet unsettled. The fact that a talk page has reached a certain size is not an automatic license to archive the page, particularly when there is unfinished business. Regarding your pending three-revert rule violation, all of your reverts to 300 (film) contribute to the rule unless you are reverting simple vandalism. That is not what you are doing; you are reverting legitimate edits, so clearly """"consensus"""" has not yet been reached.

"Just look at the stuff about David Irving and how many times the author tries to smear this honourable historian, whose book 'Hitlers War' from 1977 was compulsery reading at West Point and Sandhurst. This really says a lot of the extent of authority as Mr. Irving enjoyed (then). He is still widely believed to be one of the greatest authorities on WW2 and of the nature of the Nazi regime. All this still stands, as everyone can witness for himself by reading some of his books, which are available free of charge from his website as Downloads.

However ONE chapter of the aforementioned book was about the holocaust. And because of that David got subjected to a smearing campaign hitherto unseen in scope. Booksellers was pressured not to sell his books (no mention of this on Wikipedia) - that is why he gives them away for free. Whereever he goes in the world he find arrangements cancelled ib short notice, the hotelliers or universities being pressed to pull the event.

I find David irving to be a good and honourable englishman. His father was naval officer who took part in The Battle of Jutland. You cannot find ANY factual fault in his work. If you can David is the first who wants to know - email him.

By the way, he do not deny the holocaust, which is why your Wikipedia entry is so wrong. He find the whole subject boring, but hardpresset he will tell you that it should be spelled with a small h as there were many holocausts, poles,russians,gypsies and others got killed. Civilians allways get caught out in war, but it is undeniable that the Nazi regime was especially brutal.

 To be a folk without a homeland living among a majority is allways a precaurious situation to be in in times of unrest, or so history has proven many times.

David akcnowledges that many jews got killed, but he happen to hold the view that most died from mal-nutrition and diseases, and that aplyes to ALL inmates in concentrationcamps. So you see he is not denying .",0

 Information removed 

I removed the following information that appears to have originated at U2wanderer.org:

Bono supposedly contributes vocals to the track """"Long Black Veil"""" but in a strange twist he is not credited in the album credits.  The information about his involvment comes from various news bits over the years, and mention of this album in discographies published by those who would know, like Niall Stokes.

The lead vocals are by Mick Jagger and The Chieftens.  Originally they were performed by Bono, but were not used.  These had been recorded at Windmill Lane.  Although Bono's vocals were not used, the instrumentals from that session were supposedly used, meaning it may be possible to hear Bono way back in the mix somewhere.

 Background 

The background people keep reverting to, in spite of all discussion, is still absolute Israeli bias.
 
Firstly the version you keep reverting to does not mention the fundamental background to the Israeli-Lebanese conflicts, the existence of Palestinian refugees. Secondly the """"failed to control"""" phrase in the first sentence has connotations far too negative towards Lebanon, and ignores the fact that Lebanon has suffered far more greatly than Israel from militancy within its borders. Thirdly the background mentions that Hizbollah continued to make attacks on Israel after Israeli withdrawal from most of Lebanon (attacks whose frequency have incidentally been greatly exaggerated), yet it doesn't mention that Israel also carried out incursions into Lebanon during this period. Once again I re-iterate, it is those who keep reverting who are not respecting the neutrality of this article, and no-one has has yet explained to me how I in any way am breaching WP:NPOV in this article

By the way, Yandman, are you American? I only ask because a lot of Americans are ignorant of the Arab position in middle-east conflict and instictively pro-Israeli,even when Israel commits the most horrific war crimes, they therefore often misconstrue otherwise lucid neutrality for pro-Muslim bias.

You need either the water to be travelling at a reasonably speed if there is no jet, or you can have a large tube and slow speed if you fit a jet, however, as noted above, pressure energy is converted to velocity head energy as it travels through the jet, with the smaller jet size giving it the speed necessary.

Thanks, that may at least defuse things a little.  

My personal thought is that if this is to get any mention on Ferdinand or Ferry Porsche's page the text should relate to them directly, rather than being the same cut and paste sentence.  

Mentioning that Ferdinand Porsche gets most of the popular credit for a lot of things that were actually as much or more a product of his employees, and pointing out that this is common practice in the design industry  the boss gets the credit  would be a bit more NPOV.  Mentioning Komenda as one of those who gets overlooked in favor of the boss would be OK for me too.

 22:46, 28 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Before I get any further on this subject, I would like clarificaton about the relative roles of Ferdinand and Ferry in this issue.  I would like to see the fact of Ferdinand's univolvement nailed down before I approach the matter of Ferry, or before I try to address the simple revert battle now going on here.

The bulk of the story clearly belongs on the Komenda page.  A one-sentence reference on the Ferry page saying that Ferry's claim is disputed is appropriate, and it should then refer those who want more on the story to the Komenda page.  01:57, 2003 Oct 29 (UTC)

This is the situation that I think is the truth, from my reading.  When Ferdinand Porsche set up an independent engineering consultancy in Germany (in the 30s?) although he was the company founder and head engineer he employed a number of other engineers - the jobs were too big for just one man.  Among the men he employed was Erwin Komenda, who had previously worked for Daimler-Benz and before that Steyr.  Komenda was an expert in auto body construction and the engineering of pressed sheet metal bodywork, that I can determine.  

Ferdinand Porsche's field of expertise seems to have been the mechanical aspects of vehicles, engines and the like, and the overall team direction.  Komenda worked on the bodywork of the KDF-wagen (later to become the Beetle) among others.  Komenda definitely worked on translating ideas for the basic shape into sheet metal and the detail design of the bodywork.  Many of the plans and patent applications from this period are signed by Komenda and applied for with his name on them.  Whether his were the first pencil sketches that were turned into auto bodies I am less sure.  It's certainly possible that they were, though I am sure others in the team including Ferdinand Porsche had a lot of input.

JUST A THOUGHT:

Shouldn't this page consider division into chapters:

(i.e.)
Early Life
WWI
WWII

Porche is a fascinating man with a career so linked with the World Wars  but that almost seems lost and in this bio. His involvement in WWII with the Nazis in both the Racing circuit and in the War effort really shaped his life and that that of the world. He represents a true place in history - so perhaps a chapter insersion could better work here.  Just a suggestion.
DH - 10/16/05
Postwar, Porsche's son Ferry and the other engineers who had worked for Ferdinand during the war came together (initially in Austria) to design cars.  Ferdinand was imprisoned until 1949 for war crimes relating to the use of slave labor in projects he worked on.

Between them, a car was designed that became the Porsche 356.  Komenda played a big part in this.  It would be incorrect to say that he was the designer, per se, because he only worked on the bodywork.  However, its construction was his, and probably much of its styling.  He also worked in a similar capacity for later Porsche cars.

What I think needs to be done is to write more about Ferdinand's consultancy and Ferry's postwar sports car company so Komenda can be placed in his proper context.  WHen part of a larger article it will seem less 'heavy'.

I've noticed that as well. That's actually what confuses me the most: If it really is a single, why can't I buy it anywhere? Honestly, I think that if people write it as a """"single"""", they don't really care if it isn't available separately; simply calling something a single doesn't specify whether it's promo or not. For people trying to cater to consumers, like Billboard.com reviews, if it's a popular hit and/or music video, people know it; it doesn't matter under what technical details it was released. But I think the difference is that since we are able to specify this, we probably should. We should try to reflect the reality. I don't think having a music video and a high placement in charts does anything to change the type of single it is; I've seen music videos for promo singles many times before; even some for album tracks. Isn't it a promo single nevertheless if it's only available separate from the album for promotional purposes? It's not like this is degrading the single in any way either; some artists just don't release subsequent album singles separately for consumers because they'd rather prefer they buy the album.

 Tips for developing country outlines 

Instructions for developing country outlines is located at  

 A note concerning redlinks... 

Many of the entries (and their links) are standard across all of the country outlines, to aid readers, especially young readers, in comparing countries to each other.

So if this country doesn't have any of a particular entry, like navies, please don't delete the entry.  Instead, complete it with """"none"""" (and a brief explanation as to why, for example, """"- x is a landlocked country with no ports"""").  If the explanation exists in an article on Wikipedia, then click on the redlink and create a redirect to that location.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Standard redlinks (article names) were also chosen based on how country coverage tipically expands.  This makes the standard names for these subtopics widely available and easily accessible.  So please do not remove those redlinks, for they will turn blue eventually.  In the meantime, they can be redirected to the section of whatever article has the relevant information, if any.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

"student uprising 1973 

I don't have any research data exactly, but I am an American who was a US Navy dependent wife living in Athens when the Polytechnic uprising occurred. And since I was there, although not directly involved in the uprising (just got caught in some of the crossfire) my perspective is quite different from what has been presented on the pages.  I would like to share with you what my experience was, and perhaps it could lead to some further illumination of what really happened during that month or 2. (It wasn't all over in 2-3 days, as the story indicates) And there were many more killed than the numbers listed, although I have no evidence of this. I personally saw beatings and shooting by police and army at the Polytechnic when I took a friend to deliver food to her brother who was a participant in the uprising. Her name was Litha and his was Vagellis. I no longer recall last names, but could probably find out from some old friends. She came to New York to attend college in the mid to late 1970s.

The question that has always haunted me is why the US government totally ignored the entire situation in spite of the fact that the 6th fleet was anchored at Elyfsis and the AirForce base was fully manned and operational. The American press did not even report the uprising. As I was only 21 at the time, my parents watched carefully for some news of what I had written to them once mail service was restored, and only a short virtually nondescript article from UPS showed up buried in the back pages of the newspapers. It was never even mentioned on television here.

I am still haunted by what I saw, and that was 32 years ago. I chose your user name from the discussion page because of the passion you wrote with in the wording of several of the sections (although they were changed from your original wording).

You're right Milo.  A consensus of scientists in the scientific field of parapsychology.  Only that. Wikipedia follows the scientific consensus in the field. We don't ask psychologists what the conditions are inside a neutron star.  We really don't care what they have to say.  And of course, we would present the viewpoints of the critics of parapsychology, and more so than with other articles on science.  I have absolutely no desire not to accurately present what the critics have to say.

Even if I were pushing parapsychology, I still would not try to censor the critics, because that would only detract from my case- the reader would be able to tell it was a whitewash.

66.185.85.80's rant

Presently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as """"primitive"""" and """"rural"""" (even """"fashist"""") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, """"performed"""" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.
 
Another """"apostle"""" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as """"gusle players"""". 

Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović's book """"Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje"""", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry. 
 
Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić's work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  

In addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. 

Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. 

The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  """"Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West"""" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)

This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)

Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. 

Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre",0

 Bridge to Teribithia 

Now that this anon has deigned to explain the removal of text, I've checked, and he or she is right; there is no mention of Young at IMDb, the film's page, or her own homepage. That User:Shelbyyoung has added this to the page on Shelby Young suggests strongly that she's not Shelby Young; moreover, if she were, she shouldn't be editing the article on herself. Mel Etitis (Talk)  
I haven't taken a stance on the role dispute (Shelby says that she performed the role and is uncredited, and IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors I believe). My comment was geared more toward User:Shelbyyoung's user page with the picture of her holding a notepad with her user name to prove her identity. This IP address shouldn't be removing that. Leebo T/C  
IMDb lists uncredited actors if they are given the information and some sort of verification; so if the real Young did appear in the film, it would be easy for her to get that credit added to her IMDb listing (heck, even my kid is in the IMDb, and her scene only appears as an """"alternate ending""""). That's got little to do with the impersonation question.Orange Mike  
1. Leebo is correct, IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors (only on special occasions, in fact. See the case of Owen Wilson in """"Night at the Museum"""". No onscreen credit, therefore no IMDB credit. It was only after users complained that Wilson had received credit in commercials, his credit was added. 
2. Regarding the film page, the page only lists the main actors involved in the film. It's not going to list a voice-over actress.

3. Shelbyyoung.com has not been updated since 2004-2005, so no credit after that would appear on the site, and is therefore, an invalid source.

4. Many people have edited articles on themselves here. To suggest that Shelbyyoung is not Shelby Young solely on the basis of the fact that she is editing her own article is faulty logic. I don't know how many people remember the case of the user juliannarosemauriello, who claimed to be the real thing, then went on to edit articles clearly not geared toward a (then) 14-year-old. To my mind, the fact that Shelbyyoung has only edited with regard to herself, and the photo, which 69.132.199.100 claims is photoshopped (and what a lovely trick that would be), proves Shelbyyoung's identity. 69.132.199.100 claims that the photo is a """"popular"""" one that has been photoshopped. If so, where is it? I see no evidence of a photo looking remotely like that doing any sort of image search. Ispy1981

To adopt your analogy, Ed Johnston is the systems manager guy in the wikioffice, with seniority, wide knowledge of the way it best functions, and a demonstrated capacity for making judgements all sides accept as neutral, and he's telling a less experienced wikipedian how this peculiar society works.  Most serious, professional writers, scholars and thinkers find this place exasperating and refuse to help out. Some just learn to bite the bullet, wear the bullshit, adapt to suppressing the 'Ah, you fucken dopey arsehole' sort of thought that passes one's article-parsing mind from hour to hour, and write instead, 'you're mistaken' or even 'you screwed up'. Of course there are lots of ignoramuses and liars here, like everywhere in the world and in every sphere of activity.

That looks outrageous, at first glance, but without it, tens of thousands of quite good quality articles on difficult and controversial topics would never have been written.

 strange situation at the Barak Obama talk page 

Recently I added a single reliably-sourced word, """"African,"""" to the list of Barak Obama's mother's ethnic origins near the beginning of the Barak Obama article.  My basic point is that if the article mentions Obama's mother's single Scottish ancestor (who was born 400 years ago), as well as Obama's Irish and Swiss ancestry, then there shouldn't be a problem with an equally-brief mention of her African ancestry. My one-word addition to the article was first modified and then deleted, so I opened a talk page here.  The discussion has taken a disturbing turn, and seems to have hit a nerve of racial discomfort among some wikipedia editors.

Paris RER

Ehm, some comments about your Gare Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 1 RER edits: it's not a good idea to create a new article when there is already an article about the same subject. The naming convention for RER stations is """"X (Paris RER)"""", except when the station is also used by regular trains (Transilien, TER or other), then we use """"Gare de X"""". I just saw that you moved nearly all of the RER stations. Better discuss it before you introduce a new standard name. 

If you're sure that no trains from Charles de Gaulle take the branch line to Robinson, you can change the """"type2"""" field into """"B4"""" instead of """"both"""". But I checked it on the RATP website, and they do. I don't think it's very useful to show all the different options for the RER lines, some trains skip a few stations, or serve only part of the line.

 Secrets from the grave 

This is pure speculation on my part, but I imagine the exhumation of Paula's grave would have been carried out under conditions of great secrecy and with some degree of security. Nonetheless, I wonder if DNA obtained from any remains might yield a clue as to the identity of the grandfather she shared with her infamous brother. Would anyone be interested enough to do the research? It would surely be only of academic interest, but even so...

I also find it a rather odd co-incidence that these mysterious documents have appeared, apparently within weeks of the exhumation. Is there any proof that the documents are genuine? I still recall the fiasco of the so called """"Hitler diaries"""" some years ago. Perhaps the time has come to stop looking.

History and Giving Context for Atlanta Demographics - adding numbers to population chart
While Fulton County did not encompass all of what is in the Atlanta SMSA today, I think it is misleading to provide only Atlanta City population numbers in the mid-19th c. While it was established as a railroad terminus, it didn't exist by itself.

In 1860 Fulton County had a total of 14,427 people.  There were 2955 enslaved African-Americans, 20.5% of the population.  While much of north GA had mostly yeoman farmers, both Cobb and Fulton County also had planters (defined by historians as holding 20 or more slaves), who held slaves for labor on large cotton plantations. 

(I know more about Roswell in Cobb county, than Fulton, but the origins of major planters and the slaves they brought with them are likely similar. Roswell King and planters he invited to join him in his enterprise (at what became Roswell) were from the coast. King brought 36 slaves from his coastal plantation and bought another 42 at Darien, GA, to take with him to work on building his house, the mill, and supporting buildings. Archibald Smith brought 36 slaves with him from his coastal plantations in St. Marys County and created a 300-acre cotton plantation in Roswell. King's idea was to have cotton production AND  processing in the same place. The forced migration of slaves from the coast to north GA meant they brought their unique Geechee culture and language with them.  Where slaves were held in larger numbers on plantations, it's likely they kept their culture and traditions going.) 

Atlanta and Fulton County in fact more than doubled in population from 1860 to 1870. People rushed to rebuild the city.  In a pattern typical of other areas, many newly freed African-Americans left plantations to move to town to work at trades or crafts, to have safety in numbers and to try to set up lives apart from white control.  

By 1870 Fulton County had grown to 33,446 people.  Among them were 15,282 """"colored"""", as defined by the census, 45.7% of the population. 

NOTEWORTHY CITIZENS: Atlanta boasts two Nobel Prize winners: Rev. Martin Luther King, the youngest man to receive the Nobel Prize, and President Jimmy Carter.  Each were awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.

Hi again   I really think the solar sail people are a bit optimistic about its use for interstellar travel.  The reason is just that as the acceleration is slow, you have to wait a long time, and travel a long way, to reach high speed.  At a uniform acceleration a, you reach velocity v after traveling a distance s according to 

 v = sqrt(2as)

in Newtonian approximation, which is applicable at the speeds we could hope to reach.  Then

 s = v2/(2a)

and for a given v, s gets very large if a is small.  But since the intensity of sunlight decreases like 1/s2 with distance from the Sun, a does not remain constant, but drops rapidly, making things very much worse.  Once you get out to well beyond the orbit of Pluto, where the Sun begins to look like a very bright star, the photon drag of the light of other stars begins to become significant, as well as the cosmic background radiation, which has an energy density comparable to that of starlight.  Finally there is the problem that at really high speeds, the light of the Sun would begin to be red shifted, so you lose power from that effect too.  Some of these problems can be solved by beaming light or microwaves out to the ship, with a huge power station (a trillion watts, say) near the Earth, and a large aperture mirror to focus the beam on the ship.  Then, as long as you can maintain the focal spot as small as the ship's sail, you could get constant acceleration.  A calculation I did years ago (which I will not try to reproduce now...) suggested to me that speeds of maybe  0.1c could conceivably be reached in this manner (which is very exciting) — but then, somehow, you have to stop.  

(For example, if I recall, if the aperture of the beaming mirror is R, the ship sail dia r, the distance from the Sun D, and the wavelength λ, then you need 

 λ/R = r/D

and acceleration 10-3g will get you to 0.03c in 30 years, at a distance D of 0.5 light years, 1018/2 cm, which makes the mirror R ~ 50 km in diameter for a sail r 100 km, with a 1 um λ.  NB the mirror needs to be optically perfect to << λ, but the sail does not.)

Of course 0.1c is a useful speed, and you might split the problem between a beamed laser sailer, with a fusion rocket to stop, but the trillion watt figure I remember was for a fairly small ship, 100 or 1000 tons if I recall, and I think a nuclear-electric ship capable of reaching even a few percent of c is going to be much larger than that for a payload of 100 or 1000 tons.  I cannot imagine a decade ship smaller than an aircraft carrier, so it sounds like a pretty tough way to go, though possibly competitive with other approaches.  

What I personally think we need to do is work the problem modestly hard from an engineering standpoint, considering all approaches, producing realistic design mission studies that give us the best trade-off solution with current technology.  Right now the trip time, for a program we could realistically sell to the combined economies of the planet, would probably last a thousand years or more.  So in ten or thirty years we should redo the study, and see how that number has changed due to technological advances.  At some point the curve of reasonable trip times will either get down to the order of the time between studies, or else it will flatten out when we hit the wall of feasible engineering.  Or maybe there will be a huge breakthrough when somebody figures out how to create a wormhole to a nearby star, or something equally revolutionary.  Anyhow, only when the trip time is getting down to the time between studies (which would depend on the rate of technology change) would it be sensible to start a serious program, with what NASA would call a """"Phase A study"""", leading to a program start, then a Preliminary Design Review, and then a Critical Design Review,... which is when you can start cutting metal. 

Solar sailing is probably a competitive way of getting around the Solar System, though I think nuclear-electric ion drives are likely to prove better.  The latter can certainly take us all over the Solar System in the time scales of the great explorations of the 15th and 16th centuries.  Then in 500 years the Solar System will be ours, and we will have a far better idea of exactly what is out there in the dark between the stars, possibly mini-solar systems like Jupiter & its moons.  If such systems are common, we might find useful places to go only 1% as far as Alpha Centauri, which would change everything.  And the human species would be safe at last from the many disasters which threaten us now.

Conflation of the two """"brook"""" homonyms

that crosses between two other bodies of water. This may be US usage but it certainly is not of the UK. (thus """"brooking"""" them) The stream brook derives from Anglo-Saxon broc. The acceptance verb derives from AS brucan. There seems to be little connection. Also the Scottish term for a creek. It is not particularly Scottish. And has to do with creek only in the US usage. ( 08:43, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC))

 RJP was correct that the two brook homonyms were being conflated.  AHD4 says that brook the transitive verb (""""To put up with; tolerate"""") comes from Middle English brouken, from Old English brūcan, """"to use, enjoy"""". (BTW, that's interesting, because today's German verb brauchen can mean """"to use"""". Clearly cognate.)

 Meanwhile, brook the noun (""""stream"""") is a homonymous word coming from a different root, via Middle English, from Old English brōc.

  

Section was missing

is part of the article missing?  the last section is empty.  
thalweg says """"see below"""" but there is nothing there. [alex]

Changes to the article
I propose that the """"Types of water streams"""" section be changed. I have been unable to corroborate the brook definition given. The definition I found most often is a stream smaller in size than a creek. It is also used when the water source is a spring or seep. When """"stream"""" is not used in the generic sense, I've found various definitions. Some have it as being the smallest of all and some have it as just below a river. I guess we can continue only giving the generic definition.   

Better image was wanted

I feel that the first image, of a """"running stream,"""" is not very accurate, given we see water still enough for duckweed to accumulate in large amounts.  I don't doubt that it could be a flowing system, but it is hardly what I picture when I close my eyes and think """"running stream.""""  Nitpicky, yes.  

Looking at the current version of the article, this appears to have been fixed.  

 Categories suggestions 
Suggestion:  Make a category about Daylighting (streams) for neighborhoods (plese see article also—the list is already getting long), sections # Some neighborhoods with daylighting projects and # Other places.  A child article or something will eventually need be spun off.

Since each daylighted stream exists only as an intimate component of the neighborhoods of the watershed, linking the streams and neighborhoods in a category could be very useful.  Various daylighting projects exist all over the world, though so far we have Seattle, San Francisco, and Berkeley.  There exist similar projects restoring natural areas in urban settings, distinct from parks.  One is Union Bay Natural Area, another is a marsh north of San Francisco or in northern California (Eureka?) that is also providing habitat and tertiary sewage treatment, rather than having been drained.  (The most-recognized level is conventional secondary treatment.)

Suggestion:  Make a category of natural areas in urban settings.  This is tangentially related to the Georgia Basin Ecosystem Initiative at Salish Sea.

Comments, discussion?  How to tie into existing, relevant articles?

The Daylighting (streams) article could use more diverse examples

 

Stream is limited to Southern England?
I'm sorry, but the quote 'Stream is limited to Southern England,' in reference to the word 'stream' itself is total nonsense.Only the broadest of Yorkshiremen, for example, use only the word 'beck.' I am not adversed to words like these being mentioned in the stream article, but can people please try to avoid making such sweeping statements about them?

"Here once again is the Wiki position on primary sources:

Primary sources that have been reliably published (for example, by a university press or mainstream newspaper) may be used in Wikipedia, but only with care, because it is easy to misuse them. Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation. Without a secondary source, a primary source may be used only to make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is verifiable by a reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge. For example, an article about a novel may cite passages from the novel to describe the plot, but any interpretation of those passages needs a secondary source.

Do you believe that the primary sources have been reliably published? If so, they may be used in Wikipedia?
Do you believe that I have interpreted the primary source or misrepresented what that source says in a summary? If so, can you supply an example?
Are you able to verify the accuracy of the contents of each of the cells?
Do you believe that there is any actual interpretation in the table? If so where?",0

These four sites reflect the sequence of the four important phases in the protohistory of the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent. The sequence begins with the transition of nomadic herdsmen to settled agriculturists in eastern Baluchistan, continues with the growth of large villages in the Indus valley and the rise of towns, leads to the emergence of the great cities and, finally, ends with their decline. The first stage is exemplified by Mehrgarh in Baluchistan, the second by Amri in the southern Indus valley and the third and fourth by Kalibangan in Rajasthan and by Lothal in Gujarat.  In other words, the language changes when IVC is discussed.

 The Gamergate Conspiracy 

We have discussed at some length above whether Gamergate should be described as a """"controversy,"""" as we do now, or as a """"movement”, as Gamergate supporters apparently prefer.  The sources clearly have a hard time finding the precise language to use here. So do we. Let’s look at all the options.

A movement is “a group of people working together to advance their shared political, social, or artistic ideas.” The members, or the leaders, of a movement are identifiable people, and the shared ideas are typically put forth in a manifesto or platform. Examples include the labor movement, the temperance movement, the Impressionist movement, and the Chautauqua movement. Even the resistance movements of the Second World War were characterized by organization; indeed, organization is what distinguishes an “organized resistance,”  and a resistance necessarily adheres to stated principles.  Gamergate lacks leadership, organization, or a statement of principles. Gamergate is not a movement; nomovement come to mind that lacks either leadership and manifesto.

A controversy is “a dispute, a prolonged public disagreement.” Controversy surrounds Gamergate; indeed, that controversy has made Gamergate notable. Some have argued here at some length that, while controversy surrounds Gamergate, Gamergate is not a controversy. They do have a point: our sources do write of “Gamergate supporters,” but no one writes about “Watergate supporters” or “Tea Pot Dome supporters.”    Our current lede uses “controversy” as a generous fiction: it's not perfect, but it’s been satisfactory for some time and I have no strong objection to maintaining it.

We do have a word that does apply rigorously to Gamergate as it is described by the sources: that word is conspiracy A conspiracy is “a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful,” and this is precisely what our sources describe.  Gamergate’s absence of visible leadership and the lack of expressed principles aren’t compatible with the behaviors of movements but are, of course, quite common in conspiracies from Alcibiades to Cataline and onward.

“Plot” might be an alternative to “conspiracy,” though it is probably even more pejorative. “Scheme” would also work in its American usage, but its use in British English to describe a governmental or institutional programme would cause confusion.  “Crusade” captures the fervor of Gamergate’s supporters and the violence of their sentiments, but crusades have a stated goal. Likewise, Gamergate cannot be a “campaign” or a “drive” as it lacks an objective toward which to it steer. “Cabal” is possible, I suppose.

But “conspiracy” is precise. “Conspiracy” also lets us finesse the problem of Gamergate being said to “claim” to be a movement. Who can credibly assert that claim? Someone might claim that Gamergate is a clam, or a festival, or a joke: how should we judge? If someone claims it’s one thing, and someone else claims it’s not, how do we distinguish?  In two ways: WP:RS and WP:FRINGE.  Following the latter, it’s hard to see that Gamergate can be made to fit the definition of “movement,” but it clearly fits the definition of “conspiracy” perfectly.    """,0
"Question about guardian angels
According to the wiki article on demonology, there are 133,306,668 demons and the bible says
1/3 of the angels fell from heaven and became demons.  Therefore, this would mean that there
are 266,613,336 good angels (i.e. 133,306,668 + 266,613,336 = 399,920,004 total good and bad
angels with the bad angels being 1/3 of 399,920,004)

Given that there are about 6 billion people on the earth currently, this would mean that
a guardian angel would have to have more than one person he/she/it is responsible for.
I assume that God would not assign someone a demon to be his/her guardian angel, so this
makes the number of possible guardian angels at maximum, 266,613,336.  Since the world
population is now 6,542,502,827 this would mean that each guardian angel would have to
be assigned 24 to 25 people.

Does the above really sound reasonable to you guys?

Also, what did those 266 million guardian angels do when there was less than 266 million

 The origins of this dispute are in the complaints, since verified, of longstanding racist ranting and anti-Semitic personal attacks by . That was the first disruption that I responded too, as this editor's rants were a constant disruption of the editing process and his dispicable rants were a flarant violation of WP:TALK

 I filed a new complaint at WP:WQA here documenting the racist rants, and Jew baiting personal attacks by . There I was falsely told by  that there was """"consensus"""" on WQA to """"let it go, even though all there was on WQA was the """"shut the hell up"""" comment"""" and more rants by . This complaint at least resulted in some recognition of the problem with this anti-Semite, and a warning to him.   
 When  continued his disruptive editing and racial/anti-Semitic taunting, including characterizing the Holocaust as the """"Holohoax,"""" I filed another WP:ANI documenting 's continued violations. ultimately this resulted in corroboration once again, and a 3 day block of the racist editor. However, in the course of what should havee beena simple case, given the glaring evidence against , there were disruptions by other editors and harrassment of me in the course of that filing. Among other things I was 
 """"basically attacking him () non-stop for quite some time now"""" with no evidence presented of my """"attacks"""" and in complete disregard of the endless racial taunting I had endured
  Told that my complaints against this vile racist """"looks like a bit of a hit-job, designed to get him blocked for disagreeing"""" This """"blaming the victim is where I questioned why it was that I was being charged with orchestrating a conspiracy (""""hit job"""") against a clearly racist, anti-Semitic editor. Bringing up the latent anti-Semitic undertones in that accusation is not """"harrassmentif anything, the contention that I was somehow conspiring against this editor is harrassment.
 Challenged about my complaint about the use of """"Holohoax"""", when it was quite clear to anyone taking a moment to read that it was being used in a noxious manner by  (and which is now agreed)
 Told that I was somehow violating 's """"free speech"""", when {WP:TALK]]'s first, bold faced advice is Article talk pages should not be used by editors as platforms for their personal views. I questioned if somehow anti-Semitic rants were an exception to this rule, since I was being told I was somehow impinging upon the anti-Semtic editor's rights and free speech. I still question that.
was told by user ''' AGAIN to """"shut the hell up: Can you read, Boodles? This is getting ridiculous. I told you in no uncertain terms to shut up and take the dispute off the wiki about 30 hours ago''' Bizarre complaint about forum shopping, since his first obnoxious rejection is what made it necessary.  has yet to receive any serious actions against him for his nasty personal attacks and flagrant msiuse of WP:ANI, just some pointless wrist slapping.
 Was told by  that I """"dragged most of AN/I into your personal feud"""" as if I am somehow responsible for what they posted, and as if my response to anti-Semitic attacks was """"my personal"""" issue, rather than one that should concern the Wiki community. All they needed to do, if they wished, was to review the evidence and comment.

Hi, don't be confused with WP:CITE. The current state of Germany article already conforms with WP:CITE, that you use Footnote style of citing together with inline citations. So when you simply added the long list of books/publications in a newly created References section and you said that they were copy-pasted from other sub-Germany articles and they were not used in the article, then it is not correct. It should be applied also in other article, such as Canada, but it has been featured, so what can I say? There is WP:FAR for reviewing FA article again, but I guess it is not a fatal mistake in Canada. Probabily, your timing was not right.

 Welcome to visit Obrides Wedding Dress & Evening Dress Factory.

Obrides was born in 2006. Before 2010, Obrides mainly did business with wholesalers from all over the world and didn't produce dresses.

In this case, we decided to set up our own factory, so that we can provide better service and dresses quality. In March, 2010, the New Obrides was born. In the first week of March 2010, first hundreds of wedding dresses has been delivered to our wholesalers, who would like to place more orders to New Obrides.

 Proposed Intervening Section on """"Controversial New York Times Story"""" 

Rather than argue over the title or contents of the disputed second section regarding the pertinence of the controversial petition itself, I propose to insert an intervening section about the controversy stirred up by the appearance of Kenneth Chang's 2006 story in the NY Times, wherein Picard's name is mentioned.  The reason I find it necessary to do this is because some elements of Chang's story, which report claims of the DI have been blithely elevated to facthood, without benefit of a critical examination of the reported claims.

Here is my initial draft for the new section, to appear below the biography and above the discussion of the controversial DI petition.

Controversial New York Times Story

In February 2006, the New York Times ran an investigative story Few Biologists but Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition by Kenneth Chang of the New York Times Science Desk, reporting that the Discovery Institute had launched a new websiteDissent From Darwin to promote their expanded public relations campaign regarding how theories of evolution should be taught in public school.  The new website included a list of signatories to an earlier petition which the Discovery Institute had termed """"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism.""""Signatories of 'A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism' The petition dated back to 2001 when it was first published by the Discovery Institute beneath an ad criticizing a forthcoming PBS series on evolution.2001 """"100 Scientists"""" Ad]  The headline on the Discovery Institute's 2001 ad was also """"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism,"""" although the petition itself, embedded at the bottom of the ad, did not carry that label (it bore no label at all).  The untitled 2001 version of the petition simply read, """"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged."""" 

Chang's story disclosed that Professor Picard's name appeared on the petition cited by the newly launched Dissent From Darwin website, but the Times article did not distinguish which version she signed.  Indeed, Professor Picard's name first appeared on the original 2001 untitled two-sentence petition and her name remained on the subsequent controversially yclept versions, including the most recent one appearing on the new website.  Chang's story neither substantiated nor refuted the claims of the Discovery Institute that the two-sentence petition supported or endorsed DI's slant on its meaning, but the story did include a mixture of quotes from some of the people whose names appeared on the list at different times, including some quotes that cast doubt on the Discovery Institute's characterization of all the petition signers as variously """"dissenters from Darwinism"""" or """"anti-evolution.""""  Chang's story, in conjunction with the Discovery Institute's website and its attached list of petition signers left a wake of confusion over who among the list of signers of the earlier versions of the petition agreed with or consented to the Discovery Institute's characterization of the petition signers as """"anti-evolution"""" """"dissenters"""" who presumably supported the emerging and evolving agenda of the Discovery Institute.  It is at present unknown to what degree, if any, Picard agrees with or supports the Discovery Institute's controversial interpretation of the petition as """"dissent.""""  It is also unknown whether Picard has ever supported any or all of the ongoing political agenda of the Discovery Institute.

The last two sentences of the proposed new section reflect the absence of verifiable published information regarding the attitude of most of the original 103 signers.  So far, Wikipedia has only managed to obtain a reliably sourced comment from Stanley N. Salthe, who disputed DI's characterization and supplied his own salty attitude, """"A plague on both their houses.""""  

Skip Evans of the NSCE similarly casts doubt on the DI's interpretation, saying


The Statement
The signatories appear to attest to a statement about the ability of natural selection to """"account for the complexity of life"""" - in other words, a statement about how evolution t",0

Strange. I was almost sure that Karen Ryan is a pen name of William Mauco, as part of the article Igor Smirnov, Pridnestrovie's Khozyain president from """"Tiraspol Times"""" is copied word-by-word from the article Khozyain from Wikipedia, which was writen by William Mauco. Only after that was discovered started Mauco to write """"officially"""" in TIraspol Times with the name William Maurice. Comparison:

Wikipedia's Khozyain, stub written by Mauco 21 July 2006: Khozyain is a Russian term often used to describe a certain type of political leader. It is rich term which traditionally refers to a leader of a given social domain, a home, a village, an enterprise, or a country. The khozyain of a household is usually the oldest male and is entrusted with the welfare of the group. For someone to merit the title of a real khozyain he must take care of those in his domain. Russians tend to judge leaders, including politicians, on whether they are (or give the impression of being) a real khozyain. They are sometimes hard to classify in a classical political sense since their overriding concerns are not a leftist or rightist political agenda, but the welfare of the group where ideology is less important than pragmatism, strength of character and problem solving skills. A person who displays talents in this direction is called a khozyaistvennik. A khozyain politician can easily be seen as authoritarian in a Western political context. A more accurate description would be to classify him as a father figure. Examples of khozyain politicians: Yuri Luzhkov and Igor Smirnov.

article in Tiraspol Times by Karen Ryan, 11 September 2006, part """"The Khozyain president"""": Khozyain is a Russian term often used to describe a certain type of political leader; the prototype of the style of Igor Smirnov, Pridnestrovie's own """"Khozyain"""" head of state. It is a rich term which traditionally refers to a leader of a given social domain, a home, a village, an enterprise, or a country. The khozyain of a household is usually the oldest male and is entrusted with the welfare of the group. For someone to merit the title of a real khozyain he must take care of those in his domain. Russian voters judge leaders, including politicians, on whether they are (or give the impression of being) a real khozyain. They are sometimes hard to classify in a classical political sense since their overriding concerns are not a leftist or rightist political agenda, but the welfare of the group where ideology is less important than pragmatism, strength of character and problem solving skills. Igor Smirnov and the other founding fathers of the republic have declared on many occasions, from the earliest day of the independence struggle, that what they wanted to create was a society free of """"isms."""" A khozyain politician can easily be seen as authoritarian in a Western political context, and, true to form, Igor Smirnov has been called both a """"strongman"""" and, by the more radical Smirnov-haters in Moldova, a """"dictator"""". A more accurate description, for those who understand the true meaning of the word khozyain, would be to classify him as a father figure.

What is sure is that Mauco is pushing everywhere in Wikipedia Tiraspol Times, not only here but in any Transnistria-related page. In an other article he was against the linking to a Russian press agency, he started edit war to include his beloved TT. Probabily he has good reasons for loving it, but I'm still confused: who is William Mauco, William Maurice or Karen Ryan? """,0

re German Pigeon Club Links
G'day Mate, I guess what I'm trying to say by wanting them footnoted is that """"External links should not normally be used in the body of an article"""" as per that style guideline. Quite frankly it looks bad in an article when they are done like that. In my opinion I think it's better to select/adapt info from the website and link (footnote) to it in the reference section. Otherwise just add the links to the external link section. Actually that would probably be best for the German club main page link to just be added to external links. No need to have two active links in that particular paragraph. It does look terrible per WP:MOS it suggest  looks better. I'd be inclined to use (in German) however. So no ones doubting the veracity or anything like that mate -) Just trying to clean things up is all. So I'm suggesting now we just add the first link (VDT-online main page) to the external links section (delink the text in article) and footnote the second link to a reference section or otherwise use (in German) at the end of the sentence rather than linking the text. In my opinion that would look a whole lot better and fits the Wikipedia guidelines better.  Buzz Me... """,0

I liked Pine's clarification very much. I removed the entire """"treatment"""" section, and the more I think about it the more I think it should stay out.

As a practitioner in this field for over 20 years and editor/author of The Handbook of MultiSource Feedback, I strongly disagree with the statement that 360 cannot succeed as a tool for decision making. Many organizations have and continue to use 360 for decision making, including not only appraisal but also succession planning, high potential selection/development, staffing, and leadership development. The fact is that 360 data, generated under the right conditions (including things like rater training), provides information that is more valid and fair than that created by traditional sources (i.e., supervisor evaluations). Yes, it can be misused and abused, which is true for any tool/process. And it is difficult to do well and to sustain it. But it is overly dogmatic to dismiss it as useful only for development.

Your references DO NOT explicitly provide precise historical significance that punk rock was a result of 60's garage music. All it implies is that it gave it a facelift; not that it was influenced by it at all. And your references come from authors who themsleves have not been emersed in the vein of punk. For example, Roy Shuker (one of the authors you quoted from), is a post-hippie american. So, of course, he's going to credit his hippie origins as much as he can.

Thanks for sharing that.  Sorry if my tone earlier might have offended you.  One of the first things I note, however, is that you were incorrectly assuming that the John W. Brown is a U.S. National Historic Landmark (NHL).  It is not.  It is one of about 85,000 historic sites or objects and historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  There about 2,500 sites and objects and historic districts that are NHLs, including the California Liberty ship SS Jeremiah O'Brien.  Note, the ship is included in a Wikipedia NRHP list for its geographic area, but it is not included in the Wikipedia NHL list for Maryland.  It is understandable that you would not know the distinction.  But, looking for the John W. Brown in search screens for NHLs cannot lead to success.

You did do well to find that Maryland Historical Trust webpage.  I happen to know that is a summary by them of the full NRHP nomination document, from my having gone through detailed comparisons of other such webpages to actual NRHP documents which are available online for some Maryland sites (including the NHL ones), in consultation with editor Pubdog a while back.  Pubdog developed most of the articles about NRHP-listed places in Maryland (indexed here).  I asked Pubdog to comment here on this page, and perhaps that would have helped.

The NHL URL that you reached, http://www.cr.nps.gov/nhl/REGIONS.htm, seems pretty good to me.  It gives you phone numbers to call, and it gives you NHL_info@nps.gov as an email address to send any inquiries.  I confirm that you found a bad link from that page;  when I click on Questions/Answers there i too see that it links to http://www.nps.gov/nhl/QA which just gives an error message.  However you do already have all the phone and email contact info you need to ask about any National Historic Landmark.  I will email NHL_info@nps.gov to tell them that they have a bad link on that page, and I hope they will remove it to reduce anyone else's frustration.

I hope this helps.  I hope you do follow my advice in previous section to get the full NRHP document, since you do seem to genuinely care about developing this article on the SS John W. Brown, and since I believe that is a somewhat useful source for you to use.  Good luck. ncram """,0

 Your meddling immigrant confusion... 

I have a source here that explains the ethnic origins of American Founding Fathers:

http://www.greatseal.com/committees/firstcomm/index.html

(English, Scottish, Irish, French, Dutch/Orangist, German/Holy Roman coats of arms)

That being said, Rhenish Germans were the sort we had in those days.  Prussians and Austrians, as well as their politics, did not constitute part of the Founding Fathers' vision or hope of the future for America.  You'll have an impossible time convincing educated people that the Habsburg or Hohenzollern (except perhaps Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben) politics in any way were an inspiration for Americans of any or all origins, then and now.  We have had emulation of William van Oranje-Nassau and Prince Rupert of the Rhine including his family such as the Winter King and Queen of Bohemia, but that is because they were Rhenish and any other Palatine (Amish etc., like Herbert Hoover and Dwight Eisenhower) culture we pretty much supported always and for all times.  That's different from the East German culture, which has never, ever been a component of Americana and might never be either.  Try to prove otherwise to any academic historian and they will laugh in your face.  You have to put the German issue in context; Benjamin Franklin was hostile to """"Palatine Boors"""" as he called them, but the Quaker establishment which founded Pennsylvania loved him to death.

I've noticed that you have added info that Čedomir Jovanović is of Roma origin.

If you can provide evidence for your claims I would be more than happy to allow it to stay, but since I am from Serbia and know guy quite well I do not believe it, at least without some proof. I have nothing against Roma people but in a same way you can say that he is a Swede. It is baseless. So, I've removed it from an article. I hope you understand.

Again, you disgusting cretin, you accuse my statements of being laughable, yet have no logical basis to believe so. You think I believe my arguments are gospel, eh? So you're the kind of person who believes that if everybody believes something, then you should go along with them? So you're the kind of sick bastard that would've condoned slavery just because everybody you knew did? I do not at all think my arguments are gospel, I just proudly stand by my word until a logical argument will present a sensical contradiction. You're the bastard who has some sort of personal agenda attatched to this and for some reason or another, you refuse to have it changed, like a no-good dirty hippocrite.

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot. Everything I type is extremely intelligible and free-flowing, if you will, yet you seem to interpret it WAY differently than it is obviously stated. My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

If you discerned something other than this, than you are retarded, hands down. I can't understand why you make all these radical interpretations, especially when most of my words are plainly visible. I am in NO WAY contradicting myself here, and if you can't understand this, then I am in NO WAY going to argue with the mentally retarded, for the guilt would prevent me from having peace of mind for quite some time.

About the Standard English, obviously, this article was written by a British person, and is extremely POV, thus is not a valid argument against this issue. That's like basing all your knowledge about drugs on government and anti-drug propaganda.

The Durham County School Board had an integration plan accepted by the Federal District Court in Greensboro in 1968 stating that all high schools and junior high schools would be integrated in the fall of 1969. Due to space limitations and the need to purchase mobile units to accomplish integration at the elementary school level, the Federal District Judge in Greensboro gave a year delay for the integration of the elementary schools.
The principals of Durham County's high schools were all employed during legal segregation. A lot of discussion took place by whites and African Americans in the Durham community about how successful the process of integration would be in Durham County. Many knew there would be problems at Southern High School, because the Southern High School mascot was the Rebel, and the high school used the rebel flag (later changed to the Spartan).

Many scholar refer to them as Serer-Niominka just as Serer-Njegeme, Serer-Siin, etc.  (See:   Dennis Charles Galvan. The state must be our master of fire, p38. Also: Leonardo Alfonso Villalón. Islamic society and state power in Senegal, p51; African economic history, volume 25, University of WisconsinMadison. African Studies Program, p32).  Most of the confusion regarding who should be called Serer is to do with the various cangin languages and Serer Sine.  The Serer people however are not confused and they see themselves as Serer ethnically even if they speak a different dialect or language to other Serers.  It is normally outsiders who tend to divide the Serer into compartments rather than just letting them be.  The Serer Associations of Dakar as well as the Serer community have been trying for years to fight this division of the Serer group by outsiders.  No one is subsuming anyone.  Serer-Niominka culture is recognised and celebrated within the Serer group just like Serer-Sine, Serer-Njegheme etc.  The reason for this is, because it is Serer culture period.

Wrong again.  So far you have only based your claim on a web site.  Iranica does NOT say that Aryanem Vaejo is in Afghanistan, nor does Iranica say that any part of Afghanistan has ever been called Ariana.  If it does, paste the EXACT quote here WITH A LINK to that article.  The association of Afghanistan and """"Ariana"""" for the FIRST TIME IN HISTORY appeared after World War II and this includes the name for their airlines """"Ariana Airlines"""".  You seem to be of the mindset that no matter what, nobody should change what you put in the articles. This is indicative of poor upbringing by your parents. Your parents have produced a foolish Mr. Know It All who is not smart enough to distinguish between the real world and the our-son-is-never-wrong environment of his mommy's house.  This is stupid.  I have offered plenty of serious and verifiable examples that shows what you are forcefully injecting in this article is wrong,  but it seems that you are only interested in a stupid and stubborn childish game of just winning an argument at any cost, no matter what the truth is. Tell me which of the following points is wrong:
1- No reputable scholar has ever claimed that Aryanem Vajo is in Afghanistan.  

2- One scholar, the late Professor Bahram Farahvashi, who dedicated his life to Iranian studies and has several respectable publications, including his award winning Dictionary of Pahlavi Language, has a book by the title of """"Iran Vij"""" which is precisely about Aryanem Vaejo which Zereshk claims to be Afghanistan. According to this book, as well as other scholars, Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Caspian Sea.  Farahvashi also mentions the names of the scholars who think (and gives their reasons as to why they think) that Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Aral Sea.  In no case anybody has suggested it is in Afghanistan.

3- In at least three of the Achaemenids inscriptions (by Darius I and his son Xerxes) where they mention the word Arya  (that is, the Old Persian word Arya) in the SAME INSCRIPTION they also mention Haraiva (modern day Herat which was recorded as """"Aria"""" in Greek texts) as one of the provices under their rule.  The two words are DISTINCLY DIFFERENT words with different spellings.  Only due to the Greek rendering of Haraiva as Aria this confusion exists today (and even then, it surfaces after World War II, because someone found a way to associate Afghanistan with """"Aryan"""" and others picked it up.)

4- Unlike what Zereshk claims, Encyclopedia Iranica DOES NOT say that Afghanistan is the same as Aryanem Vaejo nor does it anywhere say that Afghanistan has EVER been called """"Ariana"""".

5- Show me one authentic source from BEFORE WORLD WAR II, that shows any part of Afghanistan has ever been called """"Ariana"""" or """"Aryana"""".  Just one source would be enough, but it has to be an authentic and academically acceptable source, such a book from antiquity or the like, and NOT afghani web sites from the 21st century.  By repeating that the """"official afghanis website says so"""" you only show how weak your argument is.

5- Last but not least, in your revert message you offered the reason [this is] """"the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan""""  well, that is not good enough.  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not the official website of Afghanistan.  What """"the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"""" is irrelevant here.

JERSEY CITY, NJ - 05/06/2003…Adrienne is often compared to her cousin, Dennis “Lil Pie” Goodson.  His alma mater, New Jersey City University (Jersey City State College) unveiled the newly created Dennis Goodson Memorial Basketball Award, at the Annual Athletic Awards Banquet in 2003.  Dennis competed as a point guard with the school from 1983 to 1987 and was a starter on the school's first Final Four team in 1986. Sadly, he died on June 25, 2002 at the age of 36.  
 
Named in honor of the star point guard, the award is bestowed to either a male or female basketball player at NJCU. The recipient will best exemplify the attributes for which Goodson was known: team loyalty, dedication to the sport of basketball, competitive spirit on the court, knowledge of the fundamentals of basketball, and demonstration of leadership, and sportsmanship.

No, actually, we're not here for the same reason.  I don't have a lot of experience with Wikipedia, and I'm not here to do lots of work on Wikipedia, and I don't read their policies (would take too much time - not really interested - I'm an armchair reader/editor of Wikipedia).  What I find with Wikipedia these days, is, to find out some detail/meat on a subject, one has to go to the edits and look at stuff that has been deleted.  There seems to be a huge effort by people to delete stuff on subjects they know nothing about.  I just got through going around in circles with a guy (I think he was also a Wikipedia administrator) where he deleted all sorts of stuff from the bio of Anthony Senter (a convicted Lucchese/Gambino mobster doing life for multiple murders).  The whole bio was taken from a well-known book called """"Murder Machine"""" and it was referenced at the bottom under """"References"""", but this guy wanted everything deleted if it didn't have a citation at the end of each sentence.  I had to tell him that the entire article came from that one book (and it's a good book, written by a well-known NY crime reporter).  What the guy/administrator should have done is first known the subject matter then edit - that way, he would have known that the whole thing was in fact already referenced at the bottom.  I tried putting in a few links but I couldn't get them to work (somebody else fixed them).  It's really too much work to go around and around in circles with these guys (they seem to be """"busybodies"""") as they delete and delete and delete, when in fact the items are either (1) well known to anybody that knows the subject matter (like Conrad's friendship with Spilotro), or (2) they are very easily found.  The way you are running things here at Wikipedia, the only entries will be made by administrators like yourself who know Wikipedia's syntax, etc.  You will either not get edits from people like me, or, if you do, they will be deleted.

"""==Ugly Personal Attacks - You Approve??==

'''Good Morning, Philippe.  The post above yours, by LoverofArt, is typical of his posts in my direction.  An ugly personal attack, by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization  the National Civilian Community Corps  by posting false and misleading information at the Wikipedia website.

If your / Wikipedia's best idea is that what should happen next is that I enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person, hoping to reason with him/her, while he/she continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes, then your processes leave a great deal to be desired.  A responsible adult  a real Editor  should have interceded long ago.  He/she and the others working over the NCCC text at this time seem to feel that any statement introduced by the phrase """"According to ___,"""" does not belong at Wikipedia.  As I read it, there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation.  Why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims (as if fact) without reference to the source in its text eludes me.  It would give the impression that the encyclopedia had evaluated the statement, which is obviously not the case. 

I appreciate Wikipedia's effort to provide freely accessible information to the public.  I am not impressed, however, by the response to gross errors made at the Wikipedia site.  Your crew is attacking the messenger at least in part because it is the message that it does not like.

A pretty sorry performance, which you seem to be joining by failing to address the issues I raise or the attacks on me.

time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT

the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

every article published in Foreign Affairs is reviewed by other scientists, which is much more than you could say for any “reliable” newspaper or just about every university publication. That should be enough to make sure WP:ATT isn’t a good reason to ban them.

Hi, user Tajik is systematically searching and changing Turkish related articles with wrong and unsourced informations. WikiArticles are not improving because of his/her wrongly editings. He/She is searching 'turk' or """"turkic"""" words in an article and deleting or deforming sentence or changing with 'persian' word in a baseless way. And he generally makes this secretly. He/She is making these changes with 'minor edits'. 
A check to the minor edit box signifies that only superficial differences exist between the current and previous version: typo corrections, formatting and presentational changes, rearranging of text without modifying content, et cetera. A minor edit is a version that the editor believes requires no review and could never be the subject of a dispute.
By contrast, a major edit is a version that should be reviewed to confirm that it is consensual to all concerned editors. Therefore, any change that affects the meaning of an article is not minor, even if the edit is a single word.
However, Tajik's systematically minor editings hardly affects of articles. And he/she always uses this illegal method. Please have a look at his/her contributions;

Speedy deletion of Utrom
 A tag has been placed on Utrom, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate, such as at articles for deletion. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

"Dammit people, at least let me talk. I believe Thrindel is not editing these pages on the interest of creating a neutral page that informs about all aspects of this comic and its creator. By checking his history and that of these pages you can see that he quickly and simply removes any criticism about either. His knowledge of wikipedia's rules seems to be extensive, but then why have they only edited pages relating to CAD? The nature of his edits, as it has been said, smacks of self interest. I really don't see the need for proving that he is who he is, but it is pretty obvious. For example, posting that he is Buckley on his user talk page will get you banned from the cad forums and Buckley's blog. I'll save you some time Tim, you've already banned this IP.  And this isn't hard to believe since he claims to make a living off income from his comic. For example, in this talk page he suggested that the fact that there are CAD gamer pictures available on xbox live. Those cost money, which means someone is making money. This is not article worthy and the thought of using wikipedia for free advertising would just be low. Ask people a million times to buy them on the cad site, but not here. When money is involved it's completely understandable for him to try and quell any criticism within his power, but this is wikipedia, not a fan site, and defiantly not a site to be edited by the creator of the comic. Leave this page to be edited by the rest of the world to edit. In conclusion, I believe there is an obvious user bias here. There is room for both praise and criticism on the page, if you can find good sources of either that is. Here is one thing I have noticed about the latest comic (although I fear it falls under original research and could not be posted): http://images.google.com/images?q=home+depot+shopper (fifth picture) and http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/comic.php?d=20080321 This confirms one thing I already knew: Tim uses blurred images copied hastily off of google image search for his backgrounds.

 Ayers 

He's never been convicted has he? X 
As far as I know, no.  Pretty sure of that.  Why?    
He's never been prosecuted, never been convicted. Calling him a terrorist is OR as well. X 
I mean, it's a BLP issue. There's no proof to it. X 
Where is he called a terrorist?  We just closed an WP:RFC with consensus against doing so, so that can pretty much be summarily reverted if it shows up.  There is some thought that his own statements about terrorism may be included with context as appropriate.    
He admited to setting bombs and being a member of a certified terrorist organization. Ayers is a terrorist.   
You certainly have a right to that opinion.  On Wikipedia we have agreed to not call him one.  Incidentaly, the Weathermen is not """"certified"""" as anything, nor does Ayers agree that he is a terrorist.  There is considerable reason why we don't do that here.  But that's moot.  That's gone up and down through all the available dispute resolution channels so for the moment that decision is final.    
You are wrong. I know it is hard to admit when one is wrong, but you should try. The Weatherman were declared a terrorist organization by the FBI - if that isn't a certified then I don't know what is. If someone belongs to a terrorist organization and sets bombs then they are a terrorist. I mean, you might as well argue that Paul McCartney isn't a singer unless he is declared as such.  
 You must have missed the dozens of reliable sources that Noroton posted at the RfC calling Ayers a terrorist.   
And you must have missed the point. According to the legal system, Ayers has never committed a violent act. X 
 Put down the keyboard.... you really need to find something else to do right now.    
Gentlemen, perhaps you can have a debate over whether Ayers is a terrorist or not on some other page - there are a million pages on Wikipedia, three million really, and I don't really feel like hosting a moot debate on the issue.  On Wikipedia we have decided to not apply that label to him.  There are probably a hundred thousand blog pages, message boards, etc., where you can call him a terrorist to your heart's content.    
Wow, you are a flaming liberal, aren't you?  So, let me get this straight...

In your opinion, someone who builds bombs for use against the U.S. Government and civilian buildings is not a terrorist.  Let us all hope you aren't in a position of leadership in real life.  Simply appalling, really. 75.40.204.26  
No! What don't you fucking get? Nobody is saying """"Ayers isn't a terrorist."""" Just that per Wikipedia policies, he should not and cannot be labeled as such in his biography. X 
And the organization, which he helped found, was classified, by the FBI, as a terrorist organization. What more do you want? Shall we repeal the 5th amendment and waterboard, """"I'm a terrorist"""" out of him?  """,0

Or do you have to be a committed atheist to be """"credible""""?

How can you say that the crop of articles your work on are neutral, when there are many inaccuracies and stereotypes, etc. about politically active Christians found within? 
Christian Reconstructionism is an outgrowth of Calvinist theology, plain an simple. How can you say that I am POV pushing
Does NPOV equal secular Leftism? The Dominionism article is heavily slanted to the Left politically, and I haven't violated any rules by posting a POV tag there. Much of what I have read form people such as Yurica, Bokaer, etc., is nothing but guilt by association.
The edit warring has come from your side from the beginning.

 Hello.  Thanks.  First, if you want to chat with me, please reply at my Talk Page - not at yours.  I check my Talk Page every day and see the new postings.  I certainly do not check your Talk Page every day to see if you posted anything there.  My Talk Page is at this link here > User talk:Joseph A. Spadaro.  Second, per Wikipedia rules, I am not giving any legal advice at all, just trying to answer a semantics question.  Third, remember that the situation and laws are different all over the place.  I am in the USA and answering as such ... I have no idea where you are located, and if it is within or outside the USA.  So, all of that being said ... I can now answer your latest follow-up questions.  Let me address the first part of your question, which states: """"one is free to terminate such a contract for whatever reasons are permitted or not forbidden within that contract.""""  In a one word answer, yes.  But, the way that your follow-up question is worded, it seems like you are mixing apples and oranges  that is, confusing very different things.  I guess I am not sure what you mean by """"terminating"""" a contract?  The contract itself usually has dates within it, such as """"This contract runs from January 1, 2008, and will expire on December 31, 2008.""""  So, you never """"terminate"""" that contract  it just """"dies"""" on December 31, 2008.  If you want to """"break"""" (""""stop"""") the contract before the ending date of December 31, that's a different story - and it would depend on why (what reasons) you want to not finish out the whole year-contract.  As you refer to, some contracts will have explicit terms within them that delineate when/where/how/why the contract may be terminated.  Some contracts have no dates in them, correct.  And, within them, there will be (there should be) certain reasons as to when / how / why either party may """"end"""" the contract.  But, in a one-word simplistic answer ... yes, one is free to terminate such a contract for whatever reasons are permitted or not forbidden within that contract.  Let me address the second part of your question, which states: """"one cannot legitimately accuse the contractee of 'insubordination' ...""""  Again, you are mixing apples and oranges.  So, it is a hard question to answer.  In a simple answer, the answer is ... maybe yes and maybe no.  If any terms of the contract deal with """"insubordination"""", then - yes, one party may certainly accuse the other party of insubordination.  For example, a contract may state: """"If Party A does not report to the work site prior to 9 AM, that will be considered insubordination"""" ... or """"If Party B does not submit the appropriate paper work at the end of the day, that action will be considered insubordination"""" ... or something like that.  So, if the terms of the contract deal with insubordination, then - yes, one party may certainly accuse the other of insubordination.  Now, let's say that the contract does not in any way mention insubordination.  (This is probably the likely case that you are referring to.)  Then, in terms of semantics (that is, language and wording) ... then, no  one party may not accuse the other of insubordination.  But, really, they can accuse the other party of breaching the terms of the contract ... that is, not meeting up with their end of the bargain in the contract.  So, the real and correct words (semantics) would be that one party accuses the other of either: breaching (breaking) the contract ... or ... not complying with the terms and consitions of the contract ... or words like that.  Those essentially mean the same thing as the concept of insubordination (not doing what you are supposed to do and expected to do, when asked to do so).  But, you just would not use the word insubordination.  You would use the word """"violating our contract"""".  But, in spirit, it all means the same thing.  So, if I was the party to the contract .... and the other party accused me of """"insubordination"""" ... and our contract terms never mention insubordination ... then, I would take that to mean that the other party is accusing me of not adhering to the terms of the contract and he is simply using the wrong jargon ... but he may (or may not) be wrong in principal and substance.  In other words, just because the other party used the wrong/incorrect word (he improperly used the incorrect word of insubordination), that doesn't change the fact that maybe, yes, I did do something wrong and I did go against the contract.  I hope this all helps.  Please reply at my Talk Page.  Maybe if you make your question a little more clearer and detailed, I can craft a better answer.  Thanks.  (  )""",0

 Correct name & edit war with Quale 

This is regards to the """"concern"""" of Quale. For the sake of record, I'm one of the early Wikipedians (18th or so) and I was sick at certain times as people were doing """"Google Test"""" and start removing my edits. Then some people came from South India and supported me. I'm not sure if that """"culture"""" still persists here; but that's a big curse of openness and possessive edits.

Regarding the naming, here are the proofs (even if there's no proof, please note that it's a commonsense here in South India):

  That’s right. I’m Anand. My father is Vishwanathan. At some point people assumed that this must be my first name and Anand must be my last name. It’s common in the West. Vishwanathan was unpronounceable for them. Became Vishy.

  But my father is Vishwanathan Krishnamurthy. I am Anand Vishwanathan. Of course, my wife is Aruna Anand. So among the mysteries we have to explain to many people is, though we are married, why we don’t share the same family name. - http://www.indianexpress.com/storyOld.php?storyId=38320&spf;

"""About Asala + Armenian Link ==

I just read a book of Erhan Başyurt, which can be translated as """"Adopted Armenian Orphins - Secret Lives"""" (ISBN 975-6054-26-3). In that book there's a section on relations between these secret Armenians living in Turkey and PKK / Abdullah Öcalan.  Names of some active PKK terrorists of Armenian decent listed as well. 

Some points in that book are interesting, like joint plans of carving Armenia and Kurdistan out of Turkey, PKK's increasing terrorist activities in northern east Anatolia towards old Armenian territories, cooperation for Ağrı and Dersim revolts during 20's and 30's... Support of Lebanese and Syrian Armenians...

I think this aspect of PKK should be added to the article.  Does anybody else has sources on this relationship?   

It should be spelt """"orphans"""" not """"orphins."""" I wouldn't object to having such a section in this article, if the source it comes from is valid, of course.  

 Armenian- PKK connection is partly a lie. Of course Armenia gives support to PKK but it can only be by funding PKK or by giving them political support in the world arena. Nothing more. Aremian PKK theory was created by people that want to show Kurdish minority innocent. They wanted to say """"Look... Kurdish friends don't want to kill us, Armenians want to!"""". Sadly, some Turkish citizens believed in such lies. Nationalist MHP party used this propaganda to gain votes of Kurds too.

 Steve's Biological Parents

 What is the matter with you all? 

Steve did come back as the iCEO!!!!  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 68.198.134.215   

Why are so many of you acting like 8 year olds and ruining what used to be a decent page on Steve Jobs?  

His father was Paul Jobs - what dumb idiot called Justin changed it to Justin Paul Jobs?

He was born in San Francisco - look up the 2006 archives.

The purchase of what was later named Pixar, from Lucas, is fully covered in the archives.  The price, the date etc. From the official sales records.  Are you so lazy that you prefer to make things up rather than do decent research?  You only have to click """"Archives"""" on the discussion page.  What is so taxing about that?

Are there any photos of Steve Jobs not wearing the same black shirt?  I know they span several years, but let's get a little diversity. 66.112.231.137  

 Insulinoma 

So Insulinoma is the most common islet cell tumor of the pancreas.  And 80% of insulinomas have Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.  If he does he is at risk for a whole bunch of other cancers.  Do any sources say anything about this that we could add more information about his cancer.

 Jobs does not have pancreatic cancer 

Steve Jobs has a neuroendocrine tumor """"NET"""" that is located on his pancreas.  As a Carcinoid Cancer/NET survivor and activist, this is a very important distinction. I have neuroendocrine tumors on my liver, but I do not have liver cancer.  For more information on Carcinoid and other NETs, interested readers should go to the Carcinoid Cancer Foundation website at www.carcinoid.org.

I don't know if there is a policy about YouTube not being used, but I tend to replace YouTube links anyway because they are forever removing videos and if something is true and noteworthy, there would be more than just a video source.

For example, the officially sanctioned online site of a rock band has a direct and symmetric relationship to that rock band, and thus should be linked from the rock band's Wikipedia article. An alternative site run by fans is not symmetrically related to the rock band, as the rock band has only indirect connections with that site.
As far as I can see, the site is directly related to the 9/11 attacks.  Hence the name, """"Complete 911 Timeline.""""—

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position.

 Postdoctoral researchers 

Sheldon and Leonard do not appear to be postdoctoral fellows, as they do not seem to be awaiting another position nor is their research supervised. Dr. Eric Gablehauser is their boss, not an advisor. As postdocs, they may have been able to teach the research seminar once, so this is not conclusive. Particularly, Sheldon is a double Ph.D. holder and child prodigy who was a visiting professor at 15, so he would not be in such an appointment. For the most part, they do not appear as postdocs.

It is produced by force-feeding ducks and geese large quantities of food causing the animals' livers to swell up to ten times their normal size.

Several European countries and the state of California have outlawed the practice as cruel.

Now, considering the question, the fact that 94% of respondents had either never eaten the stuff (54% had never even heard of it), can you see that this is the very definition of a push poll? If general indicators are any indication, the fact that a large number of chefs in the Chicago area decided to put or keep foie gras on their menu (some of them had never served foie gras before), and that this eventually led to the repeal of the Chicago ban on foie gras, then the assertion that most chefs do not support the ban of foie gras sounds like a reasonable conclusion.

At Talk:Americans you told me to walk away from the discussion. I offered to walk away and stop editing that article if you would also agree to discontinue editing that article. What's your answer?  (t•c)  
Walk away, as in walk away from the argument. Why would I walk away from an article? That is just silly. See WP:SOAPBOX. Please, stop it.
The consensus that was created allowed both POVs in the lead paragraph, allowing for the statement about non-citizens claiming American identity, which is sourced by a source provided by .
I really don't see what the argument here is. Both POV's are provided due weight. Both views are presented. The content was improved by adding percentages of non-citizens counted by the census.
Therefore, please walk away.  
The introduction consensus is Citizens of the United States are referred to as Americans. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens and expatriates may also claim an American identity."""" 

It places Sparkie82 point of view front and center. What is the rationale for removing """"non-citizen residents, dual citizens and expatriates"""" which other editors sought to include as they are counted by the U.S. census as sourced and included in discussions throughout the literature? To change, there must be a rationale, a counter-source, and context among the preponderance of sources which include more than citizens so as to gain a new consensus on the Talk page.   

@TheVirginiaHistorian I'm fine with what you just said was the consensus, i.e., """"Citizens of the United States are referred to as Americans. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens and expatriates may also claim an American identity."""" That is a compromise version we reached a while ago. However, RightCowLeftCoast keeps changing the first sentence to: """"Americans, or American people, are citizens of the United States of America."""" and then he declares that his version (which he has been defending for years!) is a consensus, which it is not. At this point, I sincerely question his able to act in good faith.  (t•c)  

@RightCowLeftCoast, if you sincerely want to see the article be the best that it can be and you trust the community to tend to the article, and you don't simply want to keep inserting your own version into it, then please stop editing the article. If you do, I will also stop editing it. What is your answer?  (t•c)  
The edit made changed the lead paragraph which was stable for several months, claiming to change it to a consensus version, while not. It failed to provide references for the lead sentence, which the stable version has in spades. Futhermore, the sentence in the stable version remains in the lead paragraph after the second sentence which explaining the multicultural nature of Americans. This sets up for the third sentence. All the content is well cited and, the cite added in the reverted edit by Sparkie82 is a duplicate source from the current third sentence.
The fact that Americans are Citizens of the United States is very well cited in the stable version.
As this is about article content this is better of in the Americans talk page and not my talk page, and kindly ask Sparkie82 to leave me alone.  """,0

Yes you are correct I do beleive that the Arbitration process in Wikipedia is crap. The vast majority of cases these days are just one editor or a group of editors trying to force their way on others. It is no longer about doing the right thing for the project. Regarding helping out at AE, I do wholeheartedly agree it would be good for more admins to get involved and that is true of many areas of WP not just AE. Part of the problem is that most admins are given the toolset because they keep their heads down and do not get involved in these areas. Those that do, much like myself, are too """"untrustworthy"""" or """"lack the proper temperment"""" to be admins. So its a never ending, self perpetuating cycle of promoting the sheep to guard against the wolf. Also, more than one (editor and admin alike) has voiced that they feel that you don't listen to comments at AE and largely do what you want, so why would they help out?   """,0

 Wikipedia's lying liars & their lies...  http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South Americ",0

Speedy deletion of Wei Weiguo
 A tag has been placed on Wei Weiguo requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 Very dubious text 

According many shcolar references I came accross it is clear that Ustashi were a n organization of terrorists, saboteurs and above all - rasists.

For example,

Encyclopedia of Holocaust, Israel Gutman, Volume IV, Editor in Chief, MacMillan Publishing Company NY 1990 Page 1551 states:

They assailed many of their opponents, attacked government installations, sabotaged railway tracks, land explosives in public places, and in 1932 even attempted to create popular uprising in a remote area, Lika

Also a number of references copied from the Ante Pavelic talk pages is quite clear in classifying this organization as a terrorsit and racistt organization

Pages 29-30 By 28 June (1941) Glaise von Horstenau reported that 'according to reliable reports from countless German military and civil observers during the last few weeks the Ustasi have gone raging mad"""" Serbian and Jewish men, women were literary hacked to death. Whole villages were razed to the ground and the people driven into barns to which the Ustasi set fire.

Page 156 One of the Horstenau's reports stated: """" We saw no sign of guerillas but there were plenty of ownerless horses and cattle, not to mention innumerable geese. At Crkveni Bok, an unhappy place where, under the leadership of Ustase lieutenant-colonel, some 500 country folk from 15 to 20 years had met their end, all murdered, the women raped then tortured, the chidren killed. I saw in the River Sava a woman's corpse with the eyes gouged out and a stick showed into the sexual parts. The woman was at most 20 years old when she fell into the hands of these monsters. Anywhere in a corner, the pigs are gorging themselves on an unburied human being. All the houses were looted.

The South Korean was worshiping the electronic gadget made in Japan when South Korea was poor. However, the South Korean enjoys Japanese food and clothes today. 

Appletrees shouted """"Vandallism"""". And, the source was deleted. He doesn't verify the source. 

Case3 Hanbando

JoongAng Ilbo explained the movie Hanbando. """"The end for which Japan apologizes to Korea will satisfy South Korean's anti-
Japanese sentiment.""""

He shouted though this was an article with the signature of Ser Myo-ja.  """"That is not a real """"article"""" written by a reporter. Don' try to fool me again"""" And, the source was concealed.

 Definition for the list 

In light of the above discussions, and the fact that the list is too inclusive to be useful (or unbiased), I propose that a very narrow definition of terrorism be used for this list.

The current list includes a lot of cases that can be (sub)categorized in other ways, such as """"international terrorism"""" (including state-sponsored international terrorism), War Crimes, and Human Rights Violations. Perhaps there could be one list that uses a narrow definition of state terrorism, followed by the more general list.

"I'm not much for online discussion boards these days, so I am not likely to join HDDAudio. The discussion at your link looks vigorous, which is good. I might use some of the ideas from the discussion in the article about powered speakers.
Me, I have more than thirty years in pro audio event production, primarily audio system design and mixing. I worked at McCune 1988 to 1994 which is why I altered that bit about the McCune JM3 active system. Since about 2003, the majority of loudspeakers I encounter in my career are self-powered. It has been a giant shift, one that the article does not adequately describe. I think Meyer has had a very large influence... he basically owned the live sound market in self-powered speakers from 1994 to 1999, and catalyzed a bunch of other companies to produce competing models.
Regarding active loudspeakers for high-end home use, I have no experience. I hope I have represented that market accurately.

To you, perhaps, but then, you had the unambiguous term """"winningest"""" to help you.  | Talk 

Ambiguity
The problem with """"most successful"""" is that it's ambiguous, since """"most successful"""" can, in general, be defined along many metrics: most sold, most manufactured, greatest market share, and, yes, greatest number of races won using the bike. """"Winningest"""" works along one metric  or two, if one is being deliberately obtuse as to what """"winning"""" means in context of a racing bike. So why not pick a perfectly standard word that avoids ANY ambiguity?

And contrary to Skyring's fake usage claims, """"winningest"""" is a perfectly standard word:

 The Grammarist:
Most participial adjectives are made comparative and superlative with more and most. For example, we say more troubling and most sickening instead of troublinger and sickeningest. So, to many English-speakers, the superlative adjective winningest—meaning having the most wins—sounds wrong. And indeed some peevish grammarians hate the word. Yet despite the existence of grammatically unquestionable alternatives (most winning, best), winningest is deeply entrenched in sports commentary and is not going away any time soon. Those who dislike it might as well get used to it.

Google News searches show winningest has been common since the 1940s, and there are scattered examples from earlier. The word has always been confined mainly to American and Canadian publications. (This is also confirmed by Google Ngram)

My copy of the OED 2nd Edition  while it doesn't have usage notes  uses """"winningest"""" in three of their example quotes for the """"winning"""" entry. So the OED editors don't have a problem with it, either. | Talk """,0

 Statement by {Party 1} 
Nothing being presented here is being taken seriously and all I'm receiving are responses that suggest Nightshift36 has already made up his mind that no matter what is presented, nothing will be added, no matter what the source. http://www.theblackdragonfightingsociety.com/frank_dux.html this website lists many sources that verify his claims and they are still being denied. For example, a prior discussion: The whole story of Frank Dux and the Kumite is a fraud. There is no such thing as the """"Kumite"""" tournament.

Does anyone honestly believe that such a world class underground full contact tournament could have gone on, and there would remain no evidence of it beside Dux's testimony? Anyone who could produce evidence of such a thing would have a million dollar story, but no one has. Wouldn't someone eventually come forward, or one or two fighters maybe speak out against it? What about the families of the fighters? Wouldn't they notice that their loved ones come home with broken bones and missing teeth? Dux himself claims that there were fatalities. In that case wouldn't the families of the dead fighters investigate what happened? Dux further claims that there were spectators gambling in the event (as in the movie), then how could they keep the silence of the spectators for all these years? To this day there remains no video, or pictures or anything to substantiate Dux's claims.

Dux further claims that he holds the record for the fastest """"kick with a knockout"""" at 72 mph. This makes no sense whatsoever. Is there a cop with a radar gun next to ring, measuring the speed of every strike? A 72 mph kick seems impossible, as swords don't even swing that fast. Someone wouldn't just """"jump into"""" such an event either, but they would have training partners, and a record of their fighting career. They would have won tournaments, and fought in other full-contact venues (like ones that actually exist), yet their is no footage or evidence of Dux's participation in such events. He is a martial artist, but nothing like he claims.

The only thing that's been knocked out here is Dux's credibility. Soldier of Fortune magazine exposed his lies about his military career. Using the Freedom of information act they showed that the actual years of his service in the military don't match up with his claims. He could have never served in Vietnam, and was never a special op like he claims. They exposed a picture of him in the military as a hoax, by showing that the ribbons and medals on his uniform are inconsistent with his branch of service. His own response to this is that the uniform was a costume that he was wearing on the way to a halloween party. You gotta be kidding me. Dux sued them for libel and lost.

He also sued Jean Claude Van Damme, saying that he (Dux) had come up with the story for the movie """"The Quest"""", and that Van Damme had made a contract with him for royalties that were never paid. Dux failed to produce any evidence of such a contract, and claimed that the missing evidence was destroyed in an earthquake. Van Damme's lawyer ripped Dux's credibility to shreds, showing that Dux's apartment was not damaged like he said it was,",0

 A Floppy Version? 

I deleted the lines in the article which referred to The Dig being released on floppy.  While my recollections of 12+ year old games may be slightly rusty, I am virtually certain that The Dig was only released on CD-ROM.  Given the amount of work (and money) put into the voice acting and pre-rendered cinemas, it would have been insanity to try to make a floppy version. (which would have required even MORE work coming up with static screens to cover the missing movies)

There was a 30-meg or so demo released around 1994 which could have, with compression, probably fit on 12 floppies.  That's likely what the editor was thinking of.  If someone can come up with concrete information on the demo's release, it would be a good addition into the """"release"""" section.

His hypothesis that a rouge IP editor from San Diego mounted a campaign to raise the profile of Geraldine Edwards to the level of Bebe Buell, slander Mary Ambrose, and attach Geraldine Edwards to the creation of Almost Famous is so preposterous as to be laughable.
Other Wikipedia editors who have tried to defend Geraldine Flemming-Mueller against Binksternet's attacks upon her were met with threats leveled by him. His interest in Geraldine Flemming-Mueller is unhealthy and alarming, and it would be in his best interest to step away from this situation altogether, as he fails to maintain a neutral stance, which is one of Wikipedia's precepts, on the subject of her. That being said, Geraldine Edwards is not a 'hoax', she's simply a woman who's living the life she see's fit, and is not interested in being included in Wikipedia articles. And finally, posting any inappropriate, hostile information against a living person that may harm them is clearly being flouted by Binkstenet's many malignant comments posted on Wikipedia's pages regarding Geraldine Edwards, one of the main guiding principles of Wikipedia. It's time for him to stand down.
The San Diego college angle is still quite active with regard to Geraldine Edwards; see User_talk:Zabadu#Geraldine_Edwards_is_not_a_hoax which was started by the IP 130.191.109.76 registered to San Diego State University.[17] This writer said """"Approximately a couple of years ago when Mary Ambrose was visiting San Francisco, she met Binksternet, and they became friendly,"""" a statement that is complete bunk. Nothing in the IP's post is supported by reliable sources.
All of this effort to defame Ambrose and build up Edwards is astonishingly trivial. It is a waste of my time, a waste of Mark's time and a drag on Wikipedia to have to deal with it. As long as there are no reliable sources to back up the allegations, they must stay out of the encyclopedia. Editors who repeatedly disrupt Wikipedia are usually blocked. Binksternet (talk) 
Whatever. Binksternet gives new credence to the phrase """"Legend in his own mind"""". Although I respect many Wikipedia editors for their diligent, accurate and commendable contributions, Binksternet is not numbered among them. In no way will I and many others link his name to veracity and credibility. His deny, deny, deny style reminiscent of certain members of the government is amusing if nothing else. Unfortunately, this diatribe has impressed me with nothing of any value. This matter is settled and over and done with, and this is the last time I will edit on this subject on these pages. Thank you to Mark Arsten for acting in a competent, intelligent and unbiased manner here, and my apologies to him for any potential problems my editing may have caused him regarding this subject.

 Vandalizing 

At first I wasn't even aware that the order of the first three bouts on the mobile version of the website was different from the official version. I found out through him sending me an image of the official website. Since it was only an image, I checked the website just in case and was shocked to find out that that was indeed the order that they had on there. I did not and still do not have any proof that the mobile version of the website is """"outdated"""" as he stated. When I made the edits (prior to my knowledge of mobile being different from the official website) I chose to not change or add a reference because When I clicked on the already present website reference, it automatically took me to the mobile version, being that I was using my mobile device to make the edits. Due to prior research of the fighters involved in the first three bouts and common knowledge of the sport, all common sense and logic led to me believing (like I always did) that the order of the bouts on the mobile version was the correct one. As soon as I found out the mobile version and official version were different I re-edited the page to rearrange the bouts to the most logical order and changed the prior reference from the official site to the mobile. I was never aware that you guys didn't accept mobile versions of websites with more logical information as references until I read his complaint and your response. I apologize if I caused any inconvenience or misunderstanding on your website. My main intentions were to help improve and accurate the content on the page based on my knowledge and common sense.

1) You have failed to explain what the quote does for the article besides trying to say """"Well, they're just theists, so why listen to them?"""" As I said before, the reasoning for keeping the quote would also allow us to find and add quotes along the lines of """"it must be considered that only atheists and those with a grudge against Christianity support this theory"""" - and I doubt that you would so whole-heartedly support such a quote, hmm?
2) Then where is this majority of scholars that are not historians?
Richard Burridge, Graham Gould, Van Voorst, Graham Stanton, R.T. France are heads of theology departments. I can not find whether they were taught in a divinity school, though.
Michael Grant is an atheist and a full-fledged historian.
James Frazer studied myth and religion in general.

An excerpt from online, detailing some of those who oppose the hypothesis:
""""Meier [Meie.MarJ, 23] notes that what we know about Alexander the Great could fit on only a few sheets of paper; yet no one doubts that Alexander existed. Charlesworth has written that """"Jesus did exist; and we know more about him than about almost any Palestinian Jew before 70 C.E."""" [Chars.JesJud, 168-9] Sanders [Sand.HistF, xiv] echoes Grant, saying that """"We know a lot about Jesus, vastly more than about John the Baptist, Theudas, Judas the Galilean, or any of the other figures whose names we have from approximately the same date and place."""" On the Crucifixion, Harvey writes: """"It would be no exaggeration to say that this event is better attested, and supported by a more impressive array of evidence, than any other event of comparable importance of which we have knowledge from the ancient world."""" [Harv.JesC, 11] Dunn [Dunn.EvJ, 29] provides an anecdote similar to the one above regarding Shakespeare. Referring to Wells' thesis, he writes:
 

    The alternative thesis is that within thirty years there had evolved such a coherent and consistent complex of traditions about a non-existent figure such as we have in the sources of the Gospels is just too implausible. It involves too many complex and speculative hypotheses, in contrast to the much simpler explanation that there was a Jesus who said and did more or less what the first three Gospels attribute to him. The fact of Christianity's beginnings and the character of its earliest tradition is such that we could only deny the existence of Jesus by hypothesizing the existence of some other figure who was a sufficient cause of Chrstianity's beginnings - another figure who on careful reflection would probably come out very like Jesus!

Finally, let's seal the coffin on consenus with these words from a hardened skeptic and an Emeritus Professor of History, Morton Smith [Hoff.JesH, 47-8] . Of Wells' work, this historian and skeptic of orthodox Christianity wrote:

""""I don't think the arguments in (Wells') book deserve detailed refutation.""""

""""...he argues mainly from silence.""""

""""...many (of his arguments) are incorrect, far too many to discuss in this space.""""
 

""""(Wells) presents us with a piece of private mythology that I find incredible beyond anything in the Gospels.""""

None of these scholars, we emphasize, are friends of fundamentalism or evangelical Christianity. Contrary to the protestations of the """"Jesus-myth"""" consortium, they make their statements based on evidence, not ideology. Conspiracy and bias exist only in their own imagination.

Again, the fact is is that the complaint isn't relevant. The mainstream historian position, which would hardly be mostly Christian, supports the claim that Jesus was a historical person. All that quote does is try to attack the speaker's instead of the evidence, and it would be blatantly dishonest to try to include it. Provide all the arguments for the claim that you want - but this isn't one of them. Koromon survived intact. """,0

""":* I drafted an different reply to your note above.  But I decided the best course today is to request userification of the article and its talk page.

 The nominator, and a large fraction of those who voiced a """"delete"""" opinion, apparently felt it was appropriate to make extensive excisions to the article  while it was before .  This is what I meant by """"informationectomies and referencectomies"""".  Our policies don't specifically prohibit this behavior, but I think it is a terrible idea, because it is best for the project for those who think the article should be kept to be allowed a free hand to try to address whatever concerns were voiced in the .  

 I think that it is terribly erosive of the general store of collegiality, civility and good will we should all aim to maintain, when those in the delete camp edit war in articles while they are before , and should confine themselves to voicing their concerns in the .  As I wrote in the , even if, for the sake of argument, everyone but those in the keep camp felt the keep case was hopeless, those in the keep camp will feel the  was fatally disrupted by this kind of edit warring.  Whereas, if the delete camp are disciplined enough to refrain from interfering with the efforts of the keep camp, in the actual article.  If they can keep their hands off the article everyone, including those in the keep camp, can't speculate that the article would have been kept, if it hadn't been for the edit warring.

 Anyhow, due to their disruptive efforts, the article, when deleted, was not at its best state, when you closed the discussion.  If you reversed yourself, and restored the article to article space, it would probably be nominated, a second time, almost right away.  If and when it is restored to article space I would prefer to defend a version of the article that shows no echo of the disruptive edits of those in the delete camp.

 Appeal 

I think your treatment of me has been a little unfair. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.
My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).
I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.
Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.
I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.
I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.
I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.
I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.
I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a rea",0

 A barnstar for you! 

  The Civility Barnstar Your recent edits on historical Jesus deserve this star, because you used a novel approach that didn't give civility for it's own sake, but where it was deserved. Many people have tried to edit pages on Jesus, Religion in Nazi Germany, Religious views of Adolf Hitler, etc. and run into the exact situation you described. When they approach it with too much civility they get run off and bullied by teams of Christian editors. It's about time someone approached the situation with the civility that is needed. Brother, I have run into so many dubious sources, and what's worse absolute abominations and interpolations on legit sources. They've been doing it for 2000 years, is it any surprise that Wikipedia wouldn't be a magnet for Christian interpolations? What's worse, if you remove it, it gets reverted by not one, but two or three others and they watch every page religiously.

I removed the importance banner from the Dade Behring entry because I was editing the article.  The only reason that I even started the article is because the company is mentioned in the Emil Adolf von Behring article and I thought that people who read his entry may be interested in the company.  I dont have the time to sit down and write the whole entry so I put up the incomplete banner.  When I read the importance banner and the page that goes with it(that says:""""This Wikipedia article or category is currently inactive and is kept primarily for historical interest."""") I thought that since I was going to edit the article, the banner could come down.  In the next few days I will closely read up on Notability and edit or remove the article.  Thanks for your input.

I dare you to continue denying the facts. Go ahead...   

I note that you and other editors of Gatineau Park material are aviation enthusiasts...

     
 
- Sparks was founder of the park, researcher says,    
- By Dave Rogers, Ottawa Citizen, May 9, 2004, p. A9   
- Mackenzie King is often credited with founding the park, but an ex-journalist says Roderick Percy Sparks was the driving force, Dave Rogers reports.   
- The NCC has hired a pair of Outaouais historians to study the origins of Gatineau Park after it received information that contradicts the popular notion that William Lyon Mackenzie King was the father of the park.   
- The evidence, gathered by Chelsea resident and Senate speechwriter Jean-Paul Murray, suggests Roderick Percy Sparks played a far more influential role than the former prime minister in creating the park.   
- Mr. Sparks dedicated 25 years of his life to the creation of a national park in the Gatineau Hills and for 10 years was chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, a lobby group that encouraged the first government purchase of Gatineau Park.   
- During the 1930s, Mr. Sparks and other members of the league argued there should be a national park in the Gatineau Hills because the widespread cutting of trees for firewood endangered the area's scenic beauty. The government created Gatineau Park in 1938, but it is not a national park and has no legal protection as a park.   
- Mr. Sparks wrote the master plan for development of the park in 1952. The plan recommended that all private property in the area, including his home, be expropriated. Mr. Sparks' vacant house on Meech Lake Road in the park burned under mysterious circumstances in 2001 two months after Mr. Murray, the former managing editor of the federalist Cite libre magazine began asking questions about its owner.   
- There was no electricity or combustible material, other than the building itself, to create a fire risk, nor was there evidence of fire starting from the nearby woods.   
- No cause for the fire was ever made public. The police did not release a report and the report from the fire authorities was almost a blank. There was no cause, no suspects and no investigation.   
- An obituary on Mr. Sparks in the Ottawa Journal of March 30, 1959 called him the “father of the Gatineau Park,” adding that as chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, he “brought about the first purchase by the Dominion government of what is now the Gatineau Park.”   
- Born in 1880, where the Supreme Court of Canada stands today, Percy Sparks was the great grandnephew of Ottawa pioneer Nicholas Sparks. He played a leading role in the customs investigation that led to the King-Byng Affair and to the subsequent defeat of the Liberal government. Mr. Sparks' contemporaries generally acknowledged him as the park's founder.   
- “Percy Sparks was a giant who brought down Mackenzie King's government in 1926,” Mr. Murray said. """"He was the man who did more to create Gatineau Park than anybody else from lobbying to writing the first master plans.   
- Mr. Murray said Mr. King was cautious about the creation of the park. “I found an interesting passage in his diary from 1937, a few months before the park was created, that showed he wasn't enthusiastic about the park because people might think he was trying to improve his property.”   
- “The NCC says that he was one of the major architects of the park, but this disproves it.”   
- Mr. Murray said the NCC never mentioned Mr. Sparks' role in creating the park so people wouldn't be tempted to advocate it",0

"Deletions 

WilliamJE, I wanted to let you know why I've modified some of your edits. While you're to be commended for trying to pare down Notable people lists, the usual procedure for dealing with unsourced material is to tag it first. This gives other editors notice of the issue and provides them with some time to find reliable sources. If, after some time has passed after a {{cn}} was placed, and no one has provided a citation, then the material can be deleted. In several instances you were very quick to delete material that didn't yet have a source. Yet I was able to quite readily find a source for the deleted material. Deleting material without notice may mean that valid information is deleted from an article because other editors weren't given notice of the issue and time to rectify it. So maybe you want to think about tagging unsourced material, rather than just deleting it. 71.139.157.80",0

I'm curious why you removed the following paragraph from the Bay of Pigs Invasion article?

The reaction of some of the American combat pilots when Kennedy canceled the planned air attack can be seen in this quote from the book Nicaragua Betrayed by the former President of Nicaragua Anastasio Somoza Debayle. """"In the meantime, the U.S. aircraft carriers stood off Cuba and never launched their fighters. One fighter squadron, VA-34, known as the 'Blue Blasters,' did get airborne but was prohibited from engaging the enemy. It has been reported that some of those American combat pilots were actually in tears. All was in readiness, but at the last moment, orders came from the White House to cancel fighter support for the invading [exiled] Cubans. Only President Kennedy and his brother, Bobby, knew why this decision was made. It was a U.S.-planned and U.S.-financed operation and, in the end, it was a U.S. decision that led to disaster for the invasion force and permitted Castro to remain in power.""""""",0

Once laver joined in 1963 all 3 had strong fields every year; the absences of hoad say in 1965 from all 3 does not matter. Laver and rosewall won every major from 1963 onwards and were completely dominant. no other pro was ever a legitmate candidate for the top 2 spots. I admit all the sources I have are anglo saxon, but its clear aussies, brits and americans all had the same view - ie wembley and us pro the best.

 If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia regardless of whether it is true or not and regardless of whether you can prove it or not, except perhaps in some ancillary article.

Keep in mind that in determining proper weight we consider a viewpoint's prevalence in reliable sources, not its prevalence among Wikipedia editors.

FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION
Dr Philip Opas (defence lawyer for Ryan, recently deceased) made it public knowledge that he did not, and would never endorse Richards book The Hanged Man, because the facts surrounding Ryan life and case had been manipulated. The book was published 35 years after Ryan's hanging - only after almost every person directly involved in the Ryan case had died, making allegations by Richards impossible to retort or confirm as fact. Richards tried but failed  to bluff Opas to support the book by signing it inside the front cover, """"To Philip and Stella from Mike Richards"""". But it's no surprise that the highly intelligence and most experienced Opas was not easily fooled by anyone. The book became a toilet item.
It's ironic that User:Purrum promotes and contributes to the Ryan article from two books, which not only contradict each other, but have also been exposed to contain lies.

 Re: Patron Saints of Places 

I noticed on the Talk page two separate comments, going back a few years, that the page would be more user-friendly if the listing was according to Place. Accordingly I've been trying to re-sort the entries towards that end. I've been making the changes in what I hope are manageable bits, partly because it's very time-consuming and I don't want to lose anything(particularly the citations), and partly because I've been waiting for someone to object. (I take it from your welcomed feedback that I may proceed.)
As far as the other patron articles: In general, since an article on any individual saint would indicate their various areas of patronage, geographic and otherwise, I think the over-all listings would be better grouped by topic. However, those pages seem somewhat less pressing, because at least they are separated alphabetically, (whereas, I found the Places page a bit confusing ... particularly because a number of the historical """"places"""" are now known as something else). -I am going to see if I can find some images as well (unless there is a rule against images and lists).

Actually, my goal is to make a neutral POV present in these articles, which involves removing the biased edits made by you two users. You have both consistently  made very controversial and unfounded edits in this and similar articles based on your own agenda, yet you accuse others of doin the same without acknowledging your own ridiculous POV edits. I am not denying the link between Iberia and the British Isles but it is the same link shared across western and atlantic Europe and there is no special relationship with regards to those two respective regions. The relationship is only based on the Y-chromosome and Mtdna inheritance shared with all Western European regions. It needs to be reminded that there are subgroups to the r1b Y-chromosome marker and the regions have differential values in both y-chromosomes and mtdna. There is very little to no evidence of autosomal and x-chromosome analysis, and when viewing the y-chrom./mtdna percentages in these populations you need to look at them as a whole. R1b is found across western Europe in high frequencies, but it does not mean the populations are necessarily very related to each other. There is no genetic evidence yet of a Neolithic link between the British Isles and Iberia since R1b traces back to a Paleolithic Iberian refuge. The Neolithic and following periods were quite different between the Iberian and the British Isles and the Neolithic Y/chrom. and Mtdna percentage is much larger in Iberia than in Britain or Ireland. You also must not rely so significantly on references by Sykes or Oppenheimer since they have not brought any new genetic evidence to the subject and only cite studies in their books that have already been out for quite some time and are already found cited in these articles. I've read through both books and they really do make hasty, unfounded and biased conclusions that do not necessarily coincide with the results of the studies they refer so much to. There are also books already out, and also some to be released in the following months, which  contradict and refute many of the """"findings"""" or """"conclusions"""" of Oppenheimer and Sykes. Their views are also a minority among population geneticists and anthropologists because the majority acknoledge that many more studies on all sections of DNA need to be carried out to fully understand the origins of various peoples, let alone declaring any solid conclusions or findings. I do agree that I should discuss my edits when I make them and I will endeavour to do so from now on so it is easier to compromise on the fidings in this article.  """,0

"On Quantification (existential/universal: there exists/for all)

My dear  argues:

You can't use the term some critics when you're listing the same bloke twice ...(my emphasis: heh, it is a 'blockquote' too;-)

As long as the Universe of Discourse contains at least one member with the predicated quality logic tells me I am empowered to use the existential quantifier. In English, that's some.

Now that's to be distinguished from 'several' which is a usual indicator of more than, say, two or three. So to use the word 'several,' in an argument, is to imply, at least more than two.

So when an acquaintance of ours, name of , known to Block and recently given some Wiki admin. priviliges (AP) cites in his AP pleading:

He has been in dispute with several editors ... 

he's padding his case, since Blacketer full well knows that the only folks giving grief were:

Block
Blacketer

This came about because I started adding much more material to the Wiki entry on Natascha Engel and, in my innocence, I sidled-up to the Village Pump to seek advice on the substantiation of some of my contributions. I was particularly perplexed by the problem of my knowing certain facts through my personal correspondence with her.

Extensive source is available on the Talk page for the Engel article about what transpired next.

Well, anyway, Galloglass left the scene pretty quickly, so that left me contending with Block and Blacketer. Now correct me if I'm being stupid, but to me that leaves two. Then, mid-ocean Block jumps ship claiming a syndrome he named 'wikibonked' (I think - I've no idea what it means, but I think I'm getting to the stage where I may have caught a dose;-)

So that left one ... Blacketer. So 'one' is Blacketer's version of 'several.' And then you made him an administrator.

I've brought Blacketer to the stage since he's part of the same story of the 'double-standards' and 'hypocrisy' that I've discovered around here.

Oh, if you get a chance and want a cheap laugh, ask Blacketer what being a 'candidate' connotes ...

"""I removed most of this entry. It was largely a combination of a less than fruitful attempt at a general-purpose definition of """"error"""" and random trivia from a number of disciplines. Some particular comments:

An industry, insurance, has grown up to protect both victims and perpetrators from the baleful effects of error.

Removed this silly claim. Many kinds of insurance are designed not to protect you from error, but from """"acts of God"""", such as fires and floods. Unless you mean to call God and/or """"the Universe"""" a source of """"error"""". Insurance protects you from many things that are not error, including chance and intentional malice.

Errors occur naturally, for example, an error in the replication of genetic material will result in a mutation, probably an unfavorable one. 

Removed. Not NPOV. Whether errors occur """"naturally"""" is entirely a matter of philosophical perspective. There is certainly a perspective from which anything natural is, by definition, free of error. In the case of genetics, you can only regard mutation as an """"error"""" if you take as given that nature """"wants"""" its replication processes to be exact replication processes.

Irrespectively of their inevitability, at law the fiction is maintained that an error is a wrong, negligence, a tort, for which anyone who suffers damage as the result thereof must be compensated by the perpetrator.

That's nice. Why can't this be in an article about law?

 Again, I am very grateful for the encouragement, but the way that EdJohnston has dealt with the matter (see his talk page for my complaint) simply shows me that mods and admins, in general, have a very biased view towards editors who simply wish to improve the quality of articles... present company excepted.
 I read with interest the candidate statements for the latest Arbitration Committee Election and one of them, a very senior Wikipedian, summed it up so aptly... """"We must clean our house, lest those who could advise and assist us dismiss Wikipedia as a nest of boobies. We should treat all editors alike. The best way to avoid being called a flock of juvenile loons is to stop acting like a flock of juvenile loons."""" Sadly, it is clear that prejudice and bias against some classes of contributors exists, and that the level of training, education and the ability to logically examine a conflict is woefully missing. It is inherently skewed.
 Although Ed has suggested referring the matter to the next level, it is clear, reading through all the Help pages, that Wiki has so many layers of arbitration, the complaint simply gets lost in the ensuing debate, and it then comes down to who is who in the Wiki org chart. The strap line that Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia that can be edited by ANYONE is a pie in the sky dream...it simply isn't true, as has been proven here. Looking through the dispute archives, there are tens of thousands of cases. Is it really worth it when more energy is expended in resolving obvious errors, and condoning poor attitude towards newbies, than in improving the site? So no, it can't be edited by anyone, it can only be edited by people who are approved, mates with other mods, or who make up false accusations and allegations against those who stand up to their incoherent and inaccurate edits. Quite sad really, as it could be quite good. But when there are people, like I've just encountered, who show no subject knowledge, logic, reasonableness, tolerance of new editors, and then blatantly lie to mods, to try and dig themselves out of their self-created holes, is it any wonder that people are leaving Wikipedia in droves (reading through complaint articles!)?  I came onto Wiki to contribute a few small lines to an article, about which I know an immense amount (I've been an RCVS patient for thirty plus years and have read the lot). But, the arrogance, unwelcome attitude, and air of """"keep off MY article"""" by a self-proclaimed (but unverified) medical 'expert' does little to encourage collation of information, let alone in the collaborative manner in which it is supposed to develop. At best, the experience of contributing to Wikipedia is eye-opening; at worst it is frankly shocking, and an almost bully-the-newbies-off mentality against anyone new who 'dares' to try and contribute. So, I wish you the best with it, but it is not the sort of self-grandising ego-centric cesspit of nastiness, and unnecessary argument that I wish to be a part. And do feel free to communicate this note to the upper echelons as yet another typical day in the life of a newbie contributor. Maybe, they may take note, but I doubt it very much, after all, too much ego is at stake in a majority of cases. Cheers! )""",0

 Traditional or Simplified Chinese? 

I've moved this to a new section because it has become difficult to continue two topics in the same section. I would like to discuss what should be done about the issue of Traditional and Simplified Chinese in TW related articles (without discussing romanisation methods). My aim is just to get a consensus (either way), and not simply to push my ideas on wiki. I have tried posting similar topics in the HK page as well as the manual of style, but it seems hard to have an active discussion let alone get any real consensus. 

Why are we still including both sets in these articles?

Naturally I support removing simplified Chinese from TW related articles. It is just as misleading to include traditional chinese in the PRC article as it is to include simplified chinese in the ROC article. I am not talking about matters of race or cultural identity, but about de facto usage. Users in the pinyin section have argued (quite well) that hanyu pinyin should be included in ROC articles because it is used de facto, even in TW. So why then can't we eliminate simplified chinese from the TW related articles as TW's de facto standard is traditional chinese only? Wiki is not a chinese dictionary, so is there any reason to include TW and PRC's writing systems in the articles of the other? This doesn't have anything to do with anyone's personal views on """"one china"""" or """"two chinas"""", but rather is an issue of reflecting the language situation in both areas and cleaning up articles.

 that's exactly it, i think.  it's a paradigm difference.  some people see creationism as morally and factually wrong because of their PARADIGM, and others see it as morally and factually right because of THEIR paradigm.  and they're throwing falsifiability and bias and everything else at each other ... but when it comes down to it, it's a PARADIGM difference.  At the same time, however, one, the other, or something else IS factually true.  And so what SCIENCE needs to do is keep as BROAD a paradigm as possible in allowing itself to go through the process of falsification.  A scientific community that ASSUMES Genesis is true will be limited in its ability to falsify itself ... because it will always say, """"well ... we just haven't figuredn out how to justify that assumption yet  but we will!""""  Similarly, a scientific community that ASSUMES God does not exist will say the same thing.  I think what science needs to do is take a position of NEUTRALITY regarding the hypotheses of a creator  and allow falsification to take its course.

 where this leads me is this.  the falsifiable assertions of evolution are: """"Evolution is false where there are clear and distinct boundaries between """"kinds,"""" across which macroevolution cannot occur"""" and """"evolution is false where life, by its very nature, can never arise from non-life.""""  In my opinion, IF the theory is falsified in that way, ID becomes the """"improved theory""""  because it takes ALL the contemporary evidence that is explained by evolution, AND explains abiogenesis and macroevolution  making it that new path integral formulation to F=ma.

However, ID requires the PARADIGM shift that there IS a creator.

 Please take the advice you are being given 

Please calm down and familiarise yourself with how Wikipedia works. Your repeated shrill invocations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are frankly risible, makes you look foolish and shows a clear misunderstanding of what Wikipedia is and what it is not. Simply, talk pages of Wikipedia articles are not vehicles for individuals to impart their own unsupported viewpoints. You must understand this. You do not have the """"freedom"""" to hijack them for another purpose, to express your own view. Talk pages are there to discuss (supportable) improvements to the article, not for debate on the topic. If you intended to do so at Scots language your proposed improvement was not clear. For instance are we to extrapolate that your contention is that the topic doesn't exist, so neither should the article (in which case nominate for deletion)? Was it something else? All that is clear is your own POV, unsupported by any reliable evidence. The appropriate place for this type of postulation is not here on an article talk page - maybe start your own blog or discuss on chat rooms.

You clearly have either not read or not understood WP:NOTFORUM, which you have been directed to by several editors. Speaking of which, your portrayal of being thwarted by one individual is not accurate, though I'm not sure if this is due to you not having the skills to know this because of your newness as an editor. Numerous people have removed your soapboxing.

Now you are taking the inappropriateness of your posts to a bizarre new level by discussing your perceived martyrdom regarding your inadmissable soapboxing on Scots at Talk:Comparison of Norwegian Bokmål and Standard Danish. How on earth does this have any pertinence to improvement of the article on the comparison of Bokmål and Danish? That is why I am going to remove that section from that talk page.

Please also familiarise yourself with what a minor edit is. Adding or removing content, be it from a an article or a talk page is not a minor edit. Again you probably don't know that because you are new.

I hope you do take time to learn about how Wikipedia works and on that basis, and since you haven't been given a WP:WELCOME, I will post one below as it gives some other useful indications about how to edit here.   """,0

Given that the rate of growth of FAs is AFAIK greater then one a day this isn't likely to change anytime soon. TFA is really somewhat seperate from the FA process, the only connection is that TFAs must be FAs of course. Being a TFA should be thought of as a bonus more then anything else and there's nothing intrinsicly different between an FA which has been TFA and one that hasn't; they're all FAs and if they not they should be put up for FAR.

With regard to whether the discovery at the PL-LT Comm article is a notable instance of plagiarism from WP by academics: since the cited website is a collection of papers written by students, and clearly published as such (, authors and tutors on page 10) - even tho the website was sponsored by an academic institution - I don't see it as notable occurence along those lines.

Oppose this proposal. I would support however some sort of guidelines for arbs (and maybe admins) regarding what sort of complaints are clear reason for status change, and what are perhaps valid but less clearcut, and then, if the latter, some sort of discussion, maybe per RfC with a crat closing, regarding the conduct of the individual involved and how to deal with it. Personally, I think the """"us"""" AGK used is potentially problematic, but could just be, potentially, a typo. Arbs are not necessarily required to write all comments like legal briefs, particularly if they themselves are not necessarily lawyers. Of course, if AGK, or any other arb in a potentially similar position, were to resign on their own, should that happen, that might be enough to address that specific situation, but no one should see my saying that as necessarily indicating I think such would necessarily be the way to proceed in this instance, because I don't think the matter necessarily rises to that level.

@Jytdog:  I agree with  that your personal views about how regulation works and how well it works is not relevant at all here, and it is a distraction.  Additionally, your definitions of """"mainstream"""" do not comport with Wikipedia.  Wikipedia defines Mainstream as follows:
Mainstream refers to a current of thought that is presently widespread.  It includes all popular culture and media culture, typically disseminated by mass media.
The mainstream popular majority view is that GMO's are not safe and should be labelled, and with your familiarity with the Genetically modified food controversies article, I'm sure you are well aware of that.  But I'll provide RS anyway.  For example:  [this].  Also, 93% of Americans think GMO's should be labelled according to this New York Times survey.  So the """"mainstream"""" view of GMO's, GMO safety and labeling and adequacy of regulation does not comport with your views of what """"mainstream"""" means.
We all know that Wikipedia is not going to report the mainstream view as if it were a fact, because the public can be wrong and so can the media.  So Wikipedia relies instead on the """"mainstream scholarship"""" WP:VALID or """"mainstream scientists"""" WP:PSCI as experts, not the public and not the views of civil servant regulators, farmers, firefighters or lawyers who are """"in the trenches"""".  This bizarre tangent saying that low level regulators are mainstream """"experts"""" is not helpful to improving the article, because it has nothing to with WP:RS and WP:PAG.
Please let us focus on correcting the """"scientific consensus"""" statement that was not sustained by your RfC and in this section addressing 's proposed statement.  Please provide solid RS to back up your objections and assertions, rather than giving personal opinions and expecting us to trust your views are solidly based on RS, especially when RS is provided that says otherwise.  These tangents are distracting and in my opinion wasting our time, which has the effect of keeping the status quo defective sentence in place.  You have agreed that the sentence needs revision, and you have been asked a number of times to provide an alternative sentence, which you think would gain consensus, and I have yet to see it.

 69.118.94.155 

Thank you for putting that vandalism notice on 69.118.94.155's talkpage. This anon has done this countless times, won't listen to reason, and just vandalized my userpage . Please keep a close eye on him!   

Thank you for the block. He was being quite immature, there.   

 Iloveminun 

Thank you for reverting all of  Rainbow Sneakers 

I requested a check user, and I've found Po132 and Minun132 are the same person and Iloveminun and PokemonFan are the same person. What should I do now?  Rainbow Sneakers 

PokemonFan was used vote in a controversial TfD after Iloveminun (who nominated the template) got told to stop voting delete. PokemonFan also vandalised the user page of the admin taking part in the vote who wouldn't delete it for him. It's more of a larger problem by Iloveminun, who is trying to replace Serebii, a valued and incredibly useful website most of the actually reference, from hundreds of Pokémon articles (first he tried to remove the template that links to it manually, then from the template that produces references in all the Pokémon articles and replace it with his own website, Pokémon Galaxy. Pokémon Galaxy is not at present even finished, but it seems to be pushing it. Which is how I got caught in everything. (Bit odd how I caught the real sockpuppet when I was originally way off) Thanks,  Rainbow Sneakers 

I will. Is Minun132 being abusive? Hmm, I had missed that. Thank you for the offer, I will wait for your return since this is a new situation for me. Thanks again,  Rainbow Sneakers 

Nah, I'm writing I'm just ill. And getting sidetracked. It's nearly done. Cheers,  Rainbow Sneakers 
Is there any particular way to do it? Or do I just note notarize the points and link to the evidence?  Rainbow Sneakers 

Done, you can find it here. Sorry for the wait, I'm feeling bad and Mailer Diablo and I were discussing FAC problems. Cheers,  Rainbow Sneakers 

We did it! Thank you for all the help, I feel slightly embarrassed that someone who has been here a month in so much more knowledgable than I am in certain aspects. If you ever need a hand with something (Fair use, FAC, GA) just drop me a bell. Cheers,  Rainbow Sneakers

Certainly not. The alphabet has been copied """"as is"""" from Swedish, and it has been so since Mikael Agricola began writing Finnish. Fortunately the Swedish alphabet contains enough sounds like Ä and Ö that Finnish speakers didn't have to design any new letters. Then again, unused letters like Q and Å remain. The last changes to Finnish orthography with respect to the alphabet were the changes from 'C' to 'K', 'X' to 'KS', 'TZ' to 'TS' and 'W' to 'V', in the 18th and 19th century. 'C', 'X', 'Z' and 'W' remained in the alphabet but were no longer used.

""":I agree with Yee.  I suggest that the word 'history' does imply a date, even according to Wikipedia itself.  Under wikiarticle 'history', we note
""""Historians limit their study to events that have been recorded since the introduction of the""""

""""Events before then are called prehistory, a period informed by the fields of palaeontology""""

For this reason, that Paleolithic first sentence sounds inconsistent with what we academically and casually define as history.  There are many other indicators that the word 'history' implies a connection with written records or archaeological records: for instance, when we say 'ancient history of china', we don't talk start by talking about its paleolithic era, but instead about state formation in Chou dynasty.

 Tedious 

Look, this courtesy police thing is very tedious Your first warning was in the context of a pretty mild remark, where I happened to use the word """"disingenuous"""" in reference to someone's argument.  In this case, I'm sure I didn't respond particularly appropriately, but the whole thing is irritating.  It's particularly irritating to be informed of things by a bot.  And also irritating to get what are obviously public domain images deleted on the basis of this sourcing nonsense.  I haven't corrected it any further because PD Thor decided to reupload the same image and then orphan it, so I assume it will be deleted, so I'm not going to bother with fixing it, but really the whole thing is absurd.  I notice you say that the image's copyright status cannot be corroborated.  That is obvious nonsense.  PD Thor, the one who noticed its supposed """"unsourcedness"""", managed very easily to find a copy of the same map on the US government website and reupload it.  About two minutes of searching on the US Census website, I think, pretty much brings it up.  It is also identical to 49 or so other county maps present on wikipedia, most of which, I think, are sourced.  So, yeah, this is technically unsourced.  But a little common sense should tell anyone that it's obviously PD, and the right course should really be to find the source information oneself, rather than to threaten deletion and leave people to get obnoxious bot messages about it.  The whole way images are dealt with on Wikipedia is so byzantine and confusing as to be infuriating.  At any rate, any future messages from you on my talk page sternly warning me to be civil will be deleted without further comment.  I'm not interested in hearing from you about this subject, and your intervention does not make me feel particularly inclined to modify my conduct.  I will strive, as always, to avoid personal attacks.  I am sure that, on occasion, my emotions will get the better of me and I will screw up.  If you are concerned about such further instances, feel free to report me to the proper authorities, or what not.  I will add that I don't see how my role as an administrator is at all relevant here.  When I was promoted to administrator, at least, the idea of an administrator was basically someone who had been on wikipedia long enough that they were generally trusted to use the abilities of an administrator in a responsible fashion.  Whether or not I sometimes fly off the handle and use profanities, I am fairly certain that I have never abused my authority as an administrator, which I almost exclusively use to delete pages for moves.  I don't think I have ever inappropriately blocked a user or deleted a page.  There was at least one incident where I was accused of protecting a page inappropriately, but I think that was at least arguably justified.  So I feel like I'm pretty conscientious about my role as an administrator, and try hard not to abuse that power.  The idea that I have to be a model of ideal behavior in every other respect because of said status is a tenet that I do not hold.  Best,   """,0

 Aha! So, it is not about Bessarabia, it is about Soviet demands over Bessarabia. I think this is the core issue of numerous misunderstandings. If we start from analyzing what the Soviets demanded and see that Romania and the west did not made sufficient steps to apease it, we observe insuficient action from the side of Romania (did not organize a referendum), as well as from the west (did not succeed in overthrowing the Reds - to try is not enough). But also we run into Англия, Франция, Италия, Япония и Румыния подписали в Париже т. н. Бессарабский протокол, согласно которому они признали суверенитет Румынии над Бессарабией, и установили, что этот суверенитет """"не может быть поставлен на обсуждение"""", which obviously ties the hands of Romania: whatever you say, it was much more important for Romania to have normal relations with the rest of the world than with Russia.
 But I said from early on, that Bessarabia, not Russia is the center of the issue. It is Bessarabians that chose this or that, not Romania or Russia. Russia had intervened only in 1940, without being invited by a local body or by MPs from Bessarabia, without even a mock support from inside Bessarabia. Why should Russia's demand be treated supperior to Bessarabia's choice (good or bad, it was a choice made in full awareness). The (military) treaty you mention was signed in February, i.e. before 27 March 1918 between two neighboring to Bessarabia countries. It can not possibly tie the hands of Bessarabia itself, by then an independent country.
 About autonomy, as far as I know, after the 27 November, resp. 1 December 1918 union of Bukovina, resp. Transylvania, a government was set for the entire united Romania, led by a Transylvanian politician (Alexandru Vaida-Voevod). He was too liberal for the phanariot-minded politicians that used to govern in Bucharest before. They tolerated """"new Romanians"""" in government only becuse the circumstances made that necessary. Among other things, Vaida started a large campain of land reform, widely supported also by Bukovinians and Bessarabians, but very feared by the old ruling elite in Bucharest (recall the 1907 peasant uprising, still very fresh in mind). They tollerated Vaida's governments (there were 2 or 3 I think) for ca. 1 year, and in early 1920, a """"black coalition"""" was formed, and General Averescu became prime-minister (similar to the one formed in Romania in early 2006 against Basescu, which lamenably failed within 1 month, but dragged the country more into politicianist discourse until last autumn). Land reform was limited and only went as far as to finish what was started. The new Constitution of 1923 was written by these people, who put the word """"unitary"""" everywhere they could fit it into. Thus the autonomy of all three new provinces was not enshrined in the new Constitution. In return that led to a bitter division of the politics: on one side National-Liberal party of Bucharest old politicians, on the other the Transylvanian-dominated National-Ţărănist party. In 1928-1930, the latter started to gain momentum, and to sealed it they brought in Carol II from forced exile. But Carol II turned to be even worse, so they actually shut themselves into leg, so to say. That led some of them to more nationalistic discurse (for example Vaida himself - Dahn even calls him fascist, which is not true, but I don't want to argue with Dahn), others managed to escape this trap (for example Maniu). You see, you have to take into consideration the entire going ons. Bessarabia was left without regional autonomy because no other province got it, which in turn was because the old phanariot-mineded people carried the day in early 1920s. These people lost the grip on power, but it took time. Even in modern Romania you still have the continuation of the same disputes. On one side you have many politicians asking for setting up regions and more local autonomy (again, surprisingly many Transylvanians among them), on the other side you have the command-system-minded partly-communist-foprmed bureaucracy, who fear regionalization (again, surprizingly many Oltenians and other likes of them among). But unlike the interbelic period, it seem that now the movement is strictly oriented in one direction. Regionalization and greater local autonomy is inevitable, whether you bring the EU-standard pretext or not. So, my second part of the answer is: if it were not for the Soviet occupation, the rise of fascism, and WWII, we would have had autonomy for Bessarabia (with a powerful local legislative body) by 1950s. Communism only created a pause, things continue to roll today. \talk """,0

Slpl1, Please!! The situation is NOT """"an exact parallel"""" to the examples you've given, especially the first. In that example you're comparing a matter of hard science to a highly subjective jouranistic description. Basketballs to oranges. We don't have a choice as to what causes AIDS. We can't say, for example, that it is caused by a severe deficiency of Vitamin C because that would simply be false. But in the case of the men's rights movement there are all sorts of descriptions, ones used by """"scholars"""" no less, that would not be false. We could say that the MRM is a countermovement to feminism, a reaction to feminism, a response to feminism, a rebellion against feminism, etc. And, by the way, were we addressing the subject of AIDS, we also wouldn't say """"It is considered to be a caused by the HIV virus"""" would we? Rather, we would say that """"AIDS is caused by the HIV virus"""" or, to more explicitly bring in outside authority, """"AIDS has been determined to be caused by the HIV virus."""" That's because """"is considered to be"""" also brings in a degree of subjectivity to the statement.

Your second example is closer to our situation and, to be honest, it isn't all that obviously unacceptable to me. However, in the case of Holocaust denial we are almost invariably dealing with clear-cut antisemitism and scholars and editors should call a spade a spade. In the case of the MRM, I think that both scholarly and popular literature will reflect that we are not dealing with the same degree of monolithic hatred. Moreover, unlike Holocaust denial, standard issue MRM causes don't reflect a flat-out denial of historical fact.

What I see in the present """"It is considered to be a backlash to the feminist movement"""" wording, are editors taking the most negative description of the movement that they could """"get away with""""  (saving the even less acceptable """"misogynist"""" for a segment of the movement later in the lead) and then framing it in the least subjective manner that they could """"get away with"""": """"It is considered to be"""".

 Negative capability as a social theory 

Negative capability is more fully articulated as a social theory by Roberto Unger in his work on false necessity. It differs slightly from Keats in that he uses it to describe the individual's challenge to an existing social order and the capacity to collapse the distance between a context-preserving routine and a context-transforming challenge. In this way it is less about uncertainty and more about a state of empowering resistance, albeit not necessarily within a stable institutional space. 

I am prepared to add Unger's use of negative capability to this entry, but not sure how to integrate it to what is already here. On the one hand it is much more developed than anything Keats produced, but also done so in a different context. In this manner, relegating Keats to background section of the entry might not work (nor would it really do justice to the legacy of poetry and English litalthough this part of the entry needs to be developed more). So, any suggestions/ideas on how to integrate? Or should we create two separate entries, e.g. """"Negative capacity (poetry)"""" and """"Negative capacity (philosophy/social theory)""""?   """,0

it says """"xenophobia is a phobia""""
it then says """"like all phobias"""" and links to """"phobias""""

this is correct

and xenophobia, like all phobias is an irrational fear.

this article lacks NPOV, and you are simply trying to edit it to suit your political views, which is unacceptable  on Wikipedia.

don't treat me with contempt, I've been editing on Wikipedia longer than you, and I know what the rules are, more to the point, I don't see any evidence that either of you know enough about this subject to edit on it.

the article should be reverted to something resembling my original edit, because the current content is simply inaccurate and politically biased.

The deletion policy is quite limited to what can be unilaterally deleted without discussion. I think it would be beneficial to start an RFC as to whether the essay should be incorporated in to a new CSD category as opposed to using it as a basis for deletion.

"As far as presenting sources are concerned, the book The life and exploits of Alexander the Great  sites much more sources in detail than source, which I think refers to some sources already referred by others. As such it is as credible as its own sources and not whether the Author is researcher of repute and printed by reputed publisher. Its credibility therefore lies in sources which are presented sparsely in the book perhaps, perhaps not. As far as the Author is concerned, in my understanding, he himself suggested that the story of Alexander that originated from Egypt should be considered more authentic than others ( reasons given as ..it is hardly likely that their writers and scribes would hasten to record his history, whereby they would also incidentally describe their own national defeat; to these countries, then, we must not look for the original Alexander story. Similarly, we must not look to the states of Greece for it, because at the death of Alexander the memory of their subjugation and the victorious deeds which he wrought for the glory of Macedon would be too fresh in the minds of their peoples. One country only could be the birthplace of the Alexander story, and that country was Egypt..). I am not sure if the general discussion is driven by this very idea i.e. keeping the Alexander story from Egypt as authentic (which the scholarship of the author has indeed explained so well along with origin of other sources, especially ones from Greece that perhaps dominate current understanding). This according to me, forms one of the essence of the Alexander story, and I hope someone clarifies which story is the Egypt story in the said book which I myself is unsure for I don't have that experience and skill to tell out the exact parts off Egypt origins. At the most I can only hope that someone will research into the Alexander story from Egypt, and not his fanboy fantasies from Greece, to put forth a credible understanding if not already done. Then perhaps someone can put up that as reliable secondary source on the internet and can be referred to here.",0

This edit war (which even I got warned about) is again about how one editor wants things to be listed when a group of editors has already established how that will be discussed.

If you read Simon's posts, he says WWoS lies some 15 minutes away from the resort, which is patently not true. While WWoS is in Osceola County, it is still well within WDW's borders. Hopefully this can be resolved peacefully, going forward ... but somehow I doubt it.",0

Yeah, I think I wrote most of that section some years ago (although I didn't give it the heading """"Summary"""", which makes it sound more definitive than I perhaps meant). I'd write it differently now, with more references for a start. I've just rewritten the Summary to be less OR, although it still needs the references.
The rest is not incredibly straightforward as a lot of the most recent research is not in widely available reliable sources. I think Bane's stuff is fine as far as it goes, especially his summary of other people's research, but it's not a published book. Strickland and Hardy is probably the most authoritative, but it is a little out of date. Having said that, they came to fairly similar conclusions to later writers, if you ignore the outlying Primitive Archer test. Rogers' stuff looking at armour thickness on the limbs is also interesting, but again, it's in an appendix of another work.

Reed for example boasts massive profits made on their page which are extracted from governments around the world with high priced journals that cost 20K a year to subscribe to (not to mention their connections with the arms trade), but re.press, a publisher that releases titles  as open access and give 100% full viewing of all books is some how a COI! We consider re.press to be a serious intervention into publishing as opposed to other companies who are profit driven.",0

 Proposed change to lede 

The current lede states that """" Thermal expansion, which is well-quantified, is currently the primary contributor to sea level rise and is expected to be the primary contributor over the course of the next century.""""

However, while thermal expansion is expected to contribute more than half the increase in the coming century, it isn't the primary contributor currently.

From AR4 page 409, """"Thermal expansion is projected
to contribute more than half of the average rise,..."""" but """"During recent years (1993–2003), for which the observing system is much better, thermal expansion and melting of land ice each account for about half of the observed sea level rise,""""

I propose the following replacement sentence:
At the end of the 20th century, thermal expansion and melting of land ice contributed roughly equally to sea level rise, while thermal expansion is expected to contribute more than half the rise in the upcoming century.

I also intent to remove the subsequent sentence, """"Glacial contributions to sea-level rise are less important, and are more difficult to predict and quantify"""" as it is no longer needed. 

Current footnote 8 doesn't support the claim, or at least I couldn't find it as it is the AR4 chapter on Climate models, not the chapter on Sea Level. I will add the reference to the Sea Level chapter

 It allows opposition leaders not only to avoid authorities pressure themselves, but also to protect their supporters by direct interference in arrests, searches etc. E.g., during the 2001 UBK campaign, the deputies were trying to prevent the mass groundless arrests of youth in Kyiv by breaking into militsiya precincts and vehicles.

I've looked all over but I can't seem to find any protocol for such a situation even though I've encountered it a couple of times. When a user starts making an autobiographical page using their user page, are we supposed to let them make the page on their user page to their heart's content, and put a deletion tag on them only once they try to publish? Or do we nip it at the bud and tag for speedy deletion under db-spam? Can someone please clarify? Sorry, I'm kinda new at this stuff.

"""== Attributing and classifying of personalities == 
Invitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. 
Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. 

My initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. 
We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. 
In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). 
We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).

Page Rebuild

For quite some time, the Alcoholism entry has provided out of date or incorrect information. I'm in the process of rewriting it to meet contemporary scientific standards for the disease. I welcome external review and discussion. 
 Stuart Gitlow MD (Chief, Annenberg Physician Training Program in Addictive Disease, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NYC)

Thanks for your contributions so far.  You may be interested in creating a user account.  Some of the benefits are discussed at this page: Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account%3F  

It greatly reduces the chances people will revert your changes, for one thing. -)  

Good points, and I've created an account as you suggest. See my notes below as well. sg

In response to the commentary at the very, very bottom of this page (dupe social impacts), I've rearranged the content of the page a bit.  I believe that it now better reflects the chronology of how people are impacted by alcoholism, and therefore reflects the order in which this information becomes important to people: definition, effects, diagnoses, treatment, broader issues.

FYI, I renamed the first instance of Social Issues to read """"Societal Issues"""" and moved it into the broader issues area.  I moved the latter one up to become a subheading of the """"Effects"""" category.  After this edit I'm going to go remove the original note of this (because it's no longer germain), so you'll have to look at the next edit in order to read it.  

In looking over the article and the discussion of Stanton Peele's perspective et al, I'm wondering whether some of the ongoing discussion held on this page is about a misconception that alcoholism is equal to """"excessive drinking,"""" whatever that is. Alcoholism doesn't refer to someone who drinks a lot. Many people drink a great deal but aren't alcoholic. Conversely, many alcoholics don't drink very much at all compared against the general population's intake.  

The section on """"terminology"""" that you removed was intended to address exactly this misunderstanding.  Since you seem to think it's important, I'm putting it back in.  

righto 

Despite the difficulties that we've had of late, the entry is coming together nicely. I'm looking over the EFFECTS section, which has a good deal of information on alcohol itself, and the impact of alcohol USE. It is difficult to tease out the effects of alcoholism versus the effects of alcohol. The effects of alcoholism when an alcoholic is in recovery, for example, would be different from the effects of alcoholism while an individual is drinking on a daily basis. (This is similar, of course, to the situation with other diseases - the effects of diabetes when an individual has well-controlled blood glucoses are different from the effects of untreated diabetes). Nevertheless, I wonder whether the entire section would be more appropriately found in the alcohol article rather than here in the alcoholism article. Can we build a consensus regarding this area?  

 Alcoholism vs. Alcohol abuse 

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism make a difference between one and the other. What I found more confusing is that from """"alcohol abuse"""" you're redirected to """"alcoholism"""".

""""Alcoholism, also known as 'alcohol dependence,' is a disease that includes four symptoms: craving, loss of control, physical dependence, and tolerance"""". 

Moreover, """"Alcohol abuse differs from alcoholism in that it does not include an extremely strong craving for alcohol, loss of control over drinking, or physical dependence"""", etc etc.

>> Getting the facts @ NIAAA

 

Response:  Good point.  From one interested perspective, AA literature itself discusses this issue and draws a clear distinction between alcohol abuse and alcoholism. 

I can't make the correction. I'm not that good informed and my english is quite lousy. Could you..?  

How about mentioning something about alcoholism as a form of drug addiction? Correct me if I'm wrong, but alcohol is certainly a hard drug, characterized by intense (and possibly fatal) withdrawals... isn't that addiction?

Nobody is arguing that a candidate with a majority of first preferences is passed-over in favor of a weaker candidate, nor that some valid ballots are simply ignored...yet that is the impression that Abd's choice of words leaves with most readers. His summary of the issue does not capture the thrust of the main claim that exhausted ballots can lead to sub-50% winners, nor even the much rarer claim that candidates with much less core support, but broader secondary support, may get eliminated.

"== Bad faith deletion of new article on Shefa ==
Eliezer (under a new name) is trying to delete articles on real organizations.  The claim he made on the Shefa Network page is false and disingenuous. The Shefa Network''' is a real group within Conservative Judaism, and in fact is already larger than many organizations that Wikipedia already has many articles on.

The Shefa Network already has several hundred members, they have their own journal, their own website, they have already had two major conferences, and two more conferences are planned soon. Yet Eliezer and a friend of his are trying to delete its article?  Eliezer has refused to even discuss the issue on the article's discussion page, despite the fact that I am trying to engage in civil discourse.  Eliezer and his friend haven't even tried to see if the group exists.

Note the timestamps; they tried to delete the article within minutes of its creation.  They obviously didn't even try to read the group's official website, or read its academic journal.  They certainly never went to any of Shefa's conferences!  They also never joined Shefa's e-mail list and asked anyone about the group. Look, attempting to delete a page without even trying to ascertain the facts is clearly against Wikipedia policy.  And doing so while refusing to engage in dialogue is editing in bad faith, by definition''.

 Cleanup 

The constant edit-warring on this short little article has got to stop, so I'd like to bring up the edits by  in the hope of generating some discussion and reaching a long-overdue consensus.

1. The first sentence says tomoi is the result of """"Siamese influence in the area"""" and provides two references. However, this is not in the given citations. These references deal with the history of the Thai community in Kedah, but make no mention of tomoi or kickboxing. Am I wrong?

2. The word tomoi is usually said to be a cognate of dhoi muay rather than a derivative term. Anyone fluent in both Malay and Thai will be aware of the many cognates such as the words for """"lizard"""", """"door"""", """"key"""", and the numerous Sanskrit-derived terms. Muay or moi comes from the Sanskrit mavya, therefore it would be incorrect to say that one derives from the other. They are similar because they come from the same source and because the two countries are neighbours.

3. I wrote in the article that tomoi in the Malay language refers to the local style of kickboxing while tinju is the generic word for any boxing art, particularly the western kind. I sourced a dictionary for this sentence. Yet the sentence has been edited and now defines tomoi as the """"sport of Siamese Kedah"""", while still retaining the given source. In other words, it's not in the citation given, once again.

4. Why is so much emphasis given to Kedah when the art is most often associated with Kelantan? This is consistent with the sources provided since all of them mention Kelantan. A major reason why the sport is not so well-known today is because it was banned in Kelantan where it was most popular. The state government even planned to rename tomoi """"Kelantan boxing"""". Yes it is practiced in Kedah and other states as well, but to state conclusively that tomoi comes from Kedah is simply not supported by any source or even general public opinion.

5. The first few sentences of the history section are atrociously-written and repeat some of the same material which I had already written in and sourced.

6. Language like """"it is a clear fact"""" seems pointy.

7. The first paragraph of the history section does not deal with tomoi or any martial art. Why does it matter how many temples are in Kedah? What does the dominant religion or language of the state have to do with anything? The same two references are provided for the paragraph once again, and neither are relevant to the article. But the sourced paragraph is followed by the sentence """"The art of """"Tomoi"""" or """"ToiMauy""""(ต่อยมวย) were teach and practice among these Siamese communities in Kedah and Kelantan"""" which is unsourced and entirely POV.

8. The origin of Indochinese kickboxing is a disputed topic. Authors like Draeger mention Chinese and Indian influence on muay Thai, which can logically be extended to tomoi, pradal serey, etc. But then there are those (unreliable) sources which claim bokator as the common ancestor. I thought it fair to say that their origin is unclear. Yet the article states very conclusively that tomoi is of Siamese origin and goes on to mention the regional styles of muay boran. Silat Embo (the precursor of tomoi) and Siku 12 (a related style) are not mentioned.

9. """"It is also a clear fact that the system of Tomoi, be the guard,stance,and striking techniques, is identical to Muay Thai."""" This is actually true. And putting aside any modern political boundaries, tomoi is the same as muay Thai and Muay Lao. I can say this from personal experience. However, that doesn't necessarily mean tomoi came from muay Thai. As mentioned before, they may all have their origins in Cambodia or somewhere else.

10. The history section continues by saying that boxers originally wrapped their hands in hemp ropes, and provides an irelevant source which only deals with muay Thai in Thailand. The editor then goes on to say that these hand-wraps did not exist prior to Ayutthaya. First of all, boxers fought bare-fisted before the custom of wrapping the hands. And more importantly, sources like Draeger say the date at which boxers first began wrapping their hands """"cannot be known with certainty"""". And even if the practice does not predate Ayutthaya, that doesn't mean it comes from Ayutthaya. And even if it does, that doesn't mean tomoi comes from Thailand. That's quite a stretch.   """,0

 xenocide against me 

I am the foremost expert in the world on Ho-Chunk mythology, at least outside this N. American Indian tribe. There was a stub on this subject that had a short re-written excerpt from my website, so it occurred to me that since there was essentially nothing there, I could perform a service by writing an overview of Ho-Chunk mythology. I had spent three days carefully writing the first three sections of this with an enormous number of footnotes, when some hobbledehoy put in a section extolling the garbage-like ideas of my bitterest academic enemies. Fortunately, only a very small fraction of what I was going to write was entered. I assumed that if this outsider wanted to intrude in the middle of my project, that it would be alright to remove my part of the contribution and give him free rein to do whatever it was that he wanted in pursuing his competing thesis. It makes no sense to me to have a highly scholarly article riddled with severe inconsistencies. That I can't remove my very own contribution is infuriating. 

However, the good news is that my lawyer thinks that I have a good position on this. I took material out of my copy writted website with the thought that at some point I could say, """"reproduced by permission of the author"""". However, I hadn't yet gotten around to that when my article was destroyed by an ignoramus intruder. That means that almost all of it violates my own copy-write. Therefore, under the present circumstances, I not only may withdraw it, but I must withdraw it according to your own rules. I resisted these attempts to force me to surrender my writing to the encyclopedia by every means that I could think of. Except one, of course: a lawsuit for copy-write infringement. 

I'll make you a deal. I'll accept banishment gladly if you will return to me my own writing out of this STUB (!). 

Please contact me by my own email, as this site is pure chaos to me, and I don't think that I will be able to find your response otherwise.

I was rather intrigued by the addition made by 76.191.230.178, """"that on June 5th, the United States sent Israel ammunition and jet fighters"""", taken from Quigley's """"The Case for Palestine"""" (p. 162). Quigley's book can be viewed on both Google Books and Amazon, where this exact statement appears with a reference to page 216 in Donald Neff's """"Warriors For Jerusalem"""" (1984). I troubled myself to the library and found the relevant paragraphs. In an episode titled """"June 5: Israel Attacks"""", Neff says the following about president Johnson (top of page 216):
""""He also received a message from his friend Arthur Krim. A memorandum to the President that day read: """"Arthur Krim reports that many arms shipments are packed and ready to go to Israel, but are being held up. He thinks it would be most helpful if these could be released.""""
Under the message the President had scribbled: """"1,000 rounds of 105mm artillery shells cleared. 2,000 fuses - availability, Gas masks. New Requests: A-4 jet fighter-bombers Hawk antiaircraft missiles.""""
Before the day was out, Krim was informed that gas masks had already been dispatched to Israel and he left a message for Johnson expressing his appreciation.""""
That's it. The rest of the page deals with various people he met and communicated with, and has nothing to do with arms shipments of any kind. In short, Quigley's assertion that """"on June 5th, the United States sent Israel ammunition and jet fighters"""" is unsupported by the evidence he provides. The only thing documented as sent are gas masks. There's no indication if and when any ammunition had even been dispatched and an Israeli request for jet fighters, possibly made on June 5, somehow becomes jet fighters sent to Israel.

Notability of Basilecom
 A tag has been placed on Basilecom requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

 Attempt at close of old RfC 

That is, the RfC listed on Archive 4 of this talk page, """"RfC: Does the article minimize the centrality of India to the notion of caste?"""" That the discussion wasn't closed earlier is of little surprise: it is long, it is technical, and the older it gets the less appetizing it gets: such discussions are very much not like Parmigiano-Reggiano. In fact, the discussion is so long that you'll have to accept the general conclusions I think I was able to draw without my being able to point at each and every individual comment supporting it. What I, as a non-Hundi-Indian currently middle-class college professor, conclude, are the following points:
Scholarly consensus appears to be that the caste system is still of the greatest importance to Hindu India; vice versa, discussions of the caste system in secondary and tertiary scholarly sources note the centrality of Hindu India to the very concept of """"caste"""".
Scholarly and especially less scholarly discussions on the concept of caste in other societies, esp. those outside SE Asia, mostly seem to use the term in the """"broader"""" sense signaled in various places in the RfCas a convenient shorthand for """"social stratification"""" and such. I note also that the application of the term """"caste"""" to some other cultures, popular until the 1970s and perhaps after, has now come under (academic) scrutiny and criticism.
Considering those two points, I conclude that it is 
The 1 September 2012 version of the article does suffer from OR and some coatracking; the current version is much better in that respect, though far from perfect. Note, for example, the very loose use of the word """"caste"""" in this newspaper article to warrant the inclusion of Cagot. As it turns out, there are sources """"comparing"""" their segregation to that of the Indian caste system: such a comparison is perhaps valid, but does not itself warrant calling them a caste.

Allow me a few observations and suggestions.
""""Caste"""" should (and this is supported in the RfC) include extensive discussion of the situation in India.
Examples from other cultures (some of which well established and verified in the current version of the article and associated main articles) must of course be thoroughly verified; an article from The Independent cannot suffice for what is, after all, an encyclopedic article.
I believe it is imperative (and comments in the RfC and elsewhere in the talk page archives support this) to come to a clarification of terms. The current lead does some of that already, but a separate section is warranted. Etymology should be the least important part of such a section; more important is a history of the usage of the termnot to be able to list every example of its usage, but rather to sketch the attractiveness of the paradigm to scholars of various periods, an attractiveness that has by now lost some of its currency. Parts of the lead of the 1 September 2012 version point to that as well; what's important is to delineate the term and its currency. Fowler&Fowler; cites Balkin in the RfC (""""social stratification in the United States does not really match the technical definition of caste ... caste is at best an effective hyperbole"""") and it's precisely that kind of research and criticism that need to be used here.
Sourcing should continue to be scrutinizedin Caste system in India, I read """"Caste is neither unique to Hindu religion nor to India; caste systems have been observed in other parts of the world, for example, in the Muslim community of Yemen, Christian colonies of Spain, and Japan"""", with one reference possibly very outdated (1972) and another a newspaper article from the New York Times. This is an article in which Wikipedia's crowdsourcing """"hey it's in the paper let's add it"""" needs to be held in check.

In all, I believe this was an interesting discussion in which the participants are perhaps closer to consensus than they thought. It is clear that there is no consensus that the article is redundant to Caste system in India etc.; it's clear also that there is consensus that the article should be much more focused than the 1 September 2012 version was, and that India must occupy a position of great(er) importance. In various places various quantified suggestions were made; I cannot comment on those numbers. I sensed some hesitance at perhaps """"borrowing"""" material from Caste system in Indiawell, if that's where good content on the concept of caste, its history, and its usage can be found, that's where you go.

 Renaissance Capital 

Hi, yesterday you made this edit at the Caesarstone article, removing a reference to Renaissance Capital that was there for verification purposes regarding information relating to Caesarstone's March IPO on the Nasdaq. Renaissance is often cited by the Naz's own online news reports, as well as by Reuters and other prominent outlets. The edit summary said """"WP:RS adsense spam,"""" but I'm uncertain as to what that means and how the reference qualifies as spam when it's there for the purpose of WP:V. I'll thank you to take a few moments to share the reasoning behind that edit with me, especially as my tendency is to revert it as a misidentification as spam of something that's intended as an innocent citation.—  """,0

User:Nishadhi, Yes, it is only natural that you will have to find 'problems' if it doesn't correspond with your way of wanting things to be. And I didn't mean the delay, I did not check this page out since the last time my edit was reverted(somewhat modified by User:JJ, thankfully) and I had no idea I was the one probably asked for such a thing, until I saw it on my talk page. Anyway never mind now that I'am here:

 For the first source Manokaran, which has quite a heck of content, I suggest you probably be looking for pages between 22-50, with special emphasis on p26, thats what the wording on the article is.  

 There seems to be some problem with rgetting to the second source(the link seems to be broken) and anyway I'am unable to access Google Books momentarily. I'll get back sooner on that.

 The third source has content regarding the subject from p247-p260.

Hope that was all expected of me. My apologies for your difficulties and inconvenience that may have been caused. Greetings.  (talk . contr . mail) """,0

There seems to be some kind of disconnect between what I actually wrote above, and what you thought you read.  I didn't just say or imply that Noah's Ark is """"indisputably real""""; on the contrary, I meant this article when I said """"here where the existence of the ship is more controversial"""".  That was also my point, and I think the point of the original poster: since this definitely *isn't* indisputably real, first why don't you try """"mythological"""" on another ship that is indisputably real, like SS Edmund Fitzgerald, or the Mayflower and see how far that gets...  So, are we all reading this the same way yet?  (ውይይት) """,0

"Your stupidity 

As you are aware, anything that i do gets reverted for no reason mainly by you; you use the WP:3RR the WP:SOCK and that stupid conciseness rubbish for your protection when really you know you are just doing it to be difficult and generally annoying. 

As i saw at the top of your page, and i quote from another twit that You are doing nothing to improve the article by constantly reverting - this occuring regularly in the following:

Louise Henriette de Bourbon-Conti - probably the best example of your obsession with having everything that way you want it; 
Henrietta Anne Stuart - i rearranged the page and added the Template:House of Stuart - clearly a tragedy;
Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre‎ - added titles and styles - where are they; i even tried to compromise by removing the stlyes and putting back the titles but once again you must have your way;
Victoire of France‎ - changed the awful layout along with her sister Princess Louise-Marie of France and Princess Marie Adélaïde of France 

Why?

The latter is quite amusing to me proving that you dont even read the article - you simply revert back because I did it - all I did was move the Template:House of Bourbon (France) to a different part of the page! Then you and your chronic arrogance go and revert it under the claim that there are rv excessive, redundant trivia contained in other articles then as always you groan on an on about the usual rubbish with please don't violate WP:3RR or WP:SOCK WHAT IS YOUR POINT ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Shut up!

Where is this claim about the WP:SOCK even from  - another one of your ridiculous  thoughts. I will not back down. 

I have a small bit of advice for you: maybe you should read the WP:OWN article for your own clarification on the matter. You really are a bore; and a selfish one at that.

Sure our paths will meet again - Happy editing",1
