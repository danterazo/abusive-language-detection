According to your logic, reverting vandalism would be disruptive too, and should lead to blocking.  I think the problem here is that, like many admins, you barely contribute to Wikipedia, and care little about its content.  You are mainly a janitor and policeman, and tend to develop a janitor's and a policeman's attitude.  It is an issue of systemic bias.  Ordinary users tend to have an editor's attitude, i.e. their priority is making articles as good as possible, and not accept other people's bad edits.

Your mention of discussion on talk pages is fantasy.  Oh, I do of course discuss matters on talk pages at great length (look at this for example), but I am under no illusions that people like you or Eiorgiomugini will be swayed by any amount of logical argument.  At the end of the day, the only way that editors can make sure that articles have good content and not bad content is by inserting good content and removing bad content.  This is my observation after long examination of Wikipedia.

In the specific case of me versus Eiorgio, your mention of discussion is also a straw man because you are trying to imply that I only discussed in the edit summaries.  In reality, I tried to reason with him on his talk page, but he simply deleted all my comments, showing he had no interest in debating it.

Your mention of sockpuppetry is fantasy and a straw man.  Please do not introduce irrelevant, insulting concepts into the discussion.  With as much validity, I could warn you to make sure that Tawker is not your (good-cop/bad-cop) sockpuppet.

The figure used on this page isn't the number of people who self-identify as """"Black"""", it's the estimated number of people with some degree of African ancestry... in Latin America in general and Venezuela in particular these are very different things - """"black"""" only applies to people who have sole or predominately African ancestry, while people of mixed ancestry generally consider themselves """"Brown"""" (""""Moreno"""") on the census (presumably this is what you are calling """"mestizo""""). If we simply used the """"Black"""" figure from the census we'd be ignoring the large number of people who have mixed African and European/Native American ancestry. We can't use the """"Brown"""" figure either, as this would include many people who have both European and Native American ancestry but no African ancestry. So the census figures are no good for us and we need to find a different source that estimates African ancestry directly without using the """"black""""/""""brown"""" colour labels. The 20-30% estimation comes from an official document from the Venezuelan government (the Embassy in the US) which specifically states this as the number of people with African ancestry, so is a reliable source for our purposes. If you have an equal or better reliable source that gives an alternative figure then please let me know what it is. 
The 100% issue is a red herring - """"mestizo"""" and """"African ancestry"""" are overlapping categories and can't be added together as if they were distinct... """"mestizo"""" in Venezuela means a mixture of European, Native American and/or African ancestry, so some of the people included in """"mestizo"""" are also included in """"African ancestry"""" and you'd be counting them twice if you added the two together. A better check is that we'd expect """"Afican ancestry"""" to be all of the """"Black"""" category plus part of the """"Brown"""" category, so more than 3% and less than 53% - the 20-30% estimate fits this perfectly.

 I reverted it back because I preferred the original version before Rod Ball's edits.  I asked if anyone else agreed with Rod Ball on this issue - having gotten no response, I assumed that other people either didn't care, or like me preferred the original.  In addition, I believe that Pjacobi already reverted these particular edits once.

 So I'll ask again - does anybody agree with Rod Ball on this issue, and actually prefer his version?  I like it the way it is now.  To make it less personal, do people like http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_spaceship_paradox&oldid;=79349924 or http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_spaceship_paradox&oldid;=79587575

 I think that """"a family of paradoxes"""" is more technically accurate, if you re-read the literature section you'll see why Hillman (the originator of this wording) described them this way.  Different authors have analyzed slightly different situations using different means.

 I also think accelerated rods are quite relevant and related (again, I borrowed this from Hillman, though I added the wiki-link to Born rigid motion).  Note that we are currently arguing accelerated motion with Rod Ball.  I would say that the topic is therfore closely related, though not identical.  That's just what the intro says.  Strings and spaceships share much of the same physics as rods and spaceships, in the final analysis.  It's fundamentally about distance.

 I think both versions contain equivalent information in explaining why the paradox, originated by Dewan and Beran, is named after Bell.   """,0

"""== History vs. Pre-history etc ==
Hi, as it stands, the first paragraph begins with

  """"The history of Japan probably started around 100,000 BCE""""

I'd like to point out that perhaps it's not useful or accurate to start a history article with a date 100000 BCE like this...  The reason why, in general, is that the study of history is typically restricted to the era of 'written records', as the Wikipedia article on """"History"""" will even state.  There can be probably some fudging, because written records can date slightly earlier events or have relation to slightly earlier events.  In short, history and pre-history will be divided by written records.

Please take a look at the wikipedia article on History of England, in that, the upper-right table indicates prehistory is before 43 BC, and history in the years after.  This date of 43 BC is generally due to Roman era records.  And again, (somewhere geographicaly closer to Japan) in the article History of China, the article begins by saying that """"The history of China is detailed by historical records dating back to 1500 BC"""". 

I think it's a bit problematic and misleading to state that history began 100,000 years ago, because if by history you mean purely archaeological evidence, then why stop there?  History will blend right into pre-history, and then into archaeology, without any meaningful demarcation.  

There is the more casual usage of the word 'history', of course.  That is, history is just the sequence of all events from beginning to end.  In which case, the history of Japan goes back to the Big Bang and all time afterward.  But as an informative and scholarly Wikipedia entry, I think this article should be amended with something more accurate, more specific, referring to what is canonically defined as """"history"""".

I propose something like 

""""The earliest records of Japan date back to 600 B.C.E., according to the Chinese source commonly known as the  Gishiwajinden, or the Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms.  In the text, the country of Yamataikoku is mentioned, which was said to be ruled by the Queen Himiko.""""

I think this adds to the quality of the article in its specificity, and in exposing the reader to the Himiko story.  Even here, there is lots of controversy as to whether Yamataikoku even existed because of lack of archaeological evidence.  The idea that we have any idea of the specific events of 100,000 BCE, as the word 'history' demands, is somewhat unreasonable.  Any comments?

"No need to apologize.  My editorial comments are sometimes more curt or critical than they should be, and this quite naturally elicits a strong reaction.  

The problem of ground pressure was well-understood by the US Army Ordnance Dept. during WWII. I find it difficult to identify any direct relationship between the T-34's lower ground pressure, and efforts by the US Army Ordnance Dept. to achieve similar results.  In fact, designers of both tanks were simply reacting to the conditions imposed by the European battlefield, and the Russian's worked out the solution while the American's were still getting the M4 ready for battle in the sands of N. Africa. 

Keep in mind that the relatively few engagements involving T-34s and M4s were fought mostly at relatively close ranges.  This helped mask the penetration problems of the 76mm HVAP (It was only marginally better than the AP shot round.), and led to a generalized misunderstanding of the tank's effectiveness against its Russian counterpart. I have not heard of a 90mm Sherman seeing combat in Korea.  In answer to your question about who was responsible for sending us out in undergunned death traps, it was Lt. Gen. Leslie J. McNair.  A long time staffer, McNair was a genius at organization, but demonstrated very little understanding of, or for that matter, any willingness to learn about the actual effectiveness of our tanks and tank destroyers on the battlefield.  Had he died a year earlier, we would have gone ashore in Europe equipped with 250 T26 tanks and possibly even some 90mm Shermans.  It would have made a difference.",0

response to your nasty personal attacks, Blockader and Blah
'You people are unbelievable in your ignorance and the ease to which you get brainwashed by subversive propaganda.
 Learn to read. I said that Paine and Jefferson came up with the ideas for a minarchist government whereby the freedom and equality of the people would  be protected. Have you read Paine and Jefferson? You are attacking the wrong men. If you want to rightfully attack an American forefather attack Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, and others.
 I never said they were anarchists. I do say, though that Jefferson expressed his admiration for anarchism. If he had suggested it at a congressional meeting he probably would have been shot or lynched or they just would have impeached him. (Something that many of them wanted to do anyway.)
 Being patriotic to your country and anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Sounds like you have been reading too much Communist propaganda. Communists just love to subvert governments and China is trying to subvert this one right now. I personally would love to overthrow the fascist-socialist state we're in right now and get back our freedom. But Maoism is not something I would have in mind in the way of freedom.
 Blah and Bockade, since you think you know the ideologies that are best for me, let me find one for you. Hmm, maybe subverting your current government into a dictatorshiptotalitarian state would be appropriate. Or perhaps, as you are incapable of reading comprehension or the most rudimentary thought, working in a convenience store, rather than editing what used to be an encyclopedia would be a good idea for you. Or maybe, how about going and fucking yourself.

The section that I put in yesterday was standard textbook planetary orbital theory. I mentioned Goldstein's.

I can only conclude that most of the editors here are schoolboys who have done the basic circular motion theory and are totally unwilling to examine the general cases of curved path motion such as ellipses and hyperbolae and the role of the radially outward centrifugal force.

I would say that my section was erased yesterday for no other reason than that nobody here could understand it since they have never done planetary orbital theory in advanced applied maths at university.

Also clicking a blue link to a users talkpage which is blank is also a big red flag. Or is it blue flag. Anyway, in this case I look through the page's edit history to find warnings.

My first thought is to merge every specific ETC program into a list in the ETC article. Those systems that have more than one paragraphs of unique information, such as E-ZPass, can retain their own articles. However, perhaps we should do a survey of the articles in the category first. We might find it better to separate the technology and specific applications of that technology. That separation would involve creating a List of electronic toll collection programs to house the programs and maintain the information about the technology, standard procedures, etc., in the Electronic toll collection article.

The Age, November 15, 2006

WHATEVER happened to Zig, the disgraced half of the famous Melbourne clowns? Doug McKenzie, the better half, turned up his curly toes two years ago but Diary has not heard a word about Zig, Jack Perry, until now, although we're none the wiser if he's still with us. Diary had a call from South Melbourne: the Salvos store in Clarendon Street has been selling his stuff. Kitchen chairs, a bedroom dresser with mirror, two bedside cabinets, all optimistically marked: """"heritage"""" and """"Once belonged to Zig the Clown"""".

The lady at the counter said she had never heard of Zig and Zag but the """"men who collected it said that was where it came from"""".

You remember the tragic saga: after four decades of frolicking with the kids, starring in Moomba and on ankle-biter television, Zig and Zag were finally made Moomba monarchs in 1999 but the reign was over before it began. Suddenly it was revealed that, years before, Zig had pleaded guilty to child molestation and he (and, hence, hapless Zag) was dethroned. Zig and Zag never spoke to each other again. If still alive, Zig would be 89 now.

Thanks.  I'm not really that into the crises.  Bishonen and I approach Wikipedia very differently, and we can never understand why the other one doesn't get involved in Crisis X or Y that is so clearly all-important.  I care about policy.  I figure that the principle of the thing is extremely important, and if we get good policies and stick to them until it hurts (and then change them when enough people feel the pain, but only with consideration of the pains we feel and the ones we want to avoid), all will be well.  I think Bishonen cares about people, and particularly people getting stomped on by the bullies of the site.  She helps people.  Anyway, it kind of explains why I'll just drop anchor on some prinicple or another and stay there, no matter what (like listening to what AfD says and not unilaterally undeleting, like rejecting the notion that there are """"expert"""" editors).

And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like """"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved"""". I like the """"problem solved"""" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.

TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her, so much so they forbade users from writting what Belle's eye color is. Notice how Belle's name is missing from the Eye Color tropes colony, while the rest of Disney Princesses have their eye color mentioned. Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?

I noticed she has a Live Journal account. See what she has written. The lack of links speaks for itself. She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote """"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?"""" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.

If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.

My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl. I think it's safe to say the interent is better off without her. She's toxic, she's a nuisance, she's talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her, she lies, she mangles, twists and misrepresents other people's words, and she causes edit wars. Action needs to be taken against people like this.  """,0

 Random Informaton 

Re: Tam Pierce. It's hardly random information. It's the start of an article about a very old and well known folk song. It's also linked to an album by Burl Ives, which in turn is linked to the discography in the Burl Ives entry. I noted that the """"article"""" was a stub; I had planned to come back to it later.  23 January 2007

Re: Copyright. True folk songs are in the public domain. But let's do without the lyrics for now. I can include summaries and links instead. Feel free to add to the content of the articles (i.e., the stubs) to improve them. Deleting is not the only option, you know.  24 January 2007

 Re: Album infobox error 

Very strange, I will check that out and leave another note when found out, thanks for noticing.   
Hmm... well, the explanation is easy (although I can't understand why): the template/MediaWiki is considering a space as album name. In example, """"| Cover = """" (note the space) gives the Cover variable in the template the value """" """" (a single space). If it is written """"| Cover ="""" (note the lack of space) makes the image appear. I will see how to fix this.

Well, there was a hot war going on in the background of TYOLD (the Konfrontasi) - the whole """"Living Dangerously"""" line was based around Sukarno's words ushering in of hot conflict against Malaysia, UK, etc. But on the point of Indonesian Civil War - at least at the beginning of '65, there was indeed some combat between the """"G30S"""" forces and those loyal to Suharto. I'm of the opinion that the period of combat was brief, and that after Jakarta was seized by Nasution-Suharto loyalists the casualties were very lopsided - hence, why the PKI's Central Committee-in exile called it just a """"White Terror."""" 

But of course, however, the same group criticized Aidit for not adhering to Mao's """"People's War"""" doctrine - so one could imagine that there were those sectors of the PKI that were spoiling for a conflict. Hence, I titled it Indonesian Civil War rather than Indonesian White Terror or Indonesian Coup - it keeps things NPOV and open to different scholarly interpretations.

By, I should point out that I have an interesting hard copy """"self critical"""" document the PKI Central Committee published from China detailing what they perceived as their mistakes in '65 and attempts to re-establish the Party. Unfortunately, it is without copyright information printed (this was likely due to attempts to get around import restrictions during the U.S. Cold War).

Using the Droop Quota of 51, neither party reaches the quota, but as they have the same number of first preference votes, neither can be eliminated; and we have a tie anyway.

"""I can't offer an offical document either, that the classical language category was introduced by a constitutional decree, but there are many notifications, that are not published on the internet, like the official notification, that Tamil was declared """"Classical language"""". However, there are newspaper reports, which confirm, that the classical language category was introduced by constitutional decree. So this is enough to prove it:

http://www.deccanherald.com/CONTENT/Aug142008/editpage2008081384442.asp

Also i found a conversation of the Indian parliament, which illustrates the importance of the classical language status for India, where Mr. Shivraj V. Patil compares the status of the scheduled languages to the status of the classical languages:

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: Sir, the demand for declaring Kannada as a classical language is pending before the Government since 2004. The same answer has been given earlier also. My submission before the House is that the Kannada text and recorded history belongs to 252 BC. The first Kannada literary work Kavirajamarga was created in 850 AD and it refers to some writings earlier than that. The 12th Centaury Kannada Bhakti Movement in the form of Vachana or oral expression is unparallel. In contemporary kirtana which subsequently became Karnataka Sangeet is an enduring contribution to Indian music. Sir, the epigraphical material in Kannada, numbering over 25,000 inscriptions in stone and copper, are rich in style and contents, which are not found even in Tamil inscription. The UNESCO records Kannada amongst the prime scripts of the world. Sir, Kannada is among the first living languages of the world in the history of continuous writing system spanning three millennium like Hebrew, Chinese and Tamil.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY (CONTD): Sir, the recognition was given to Tamil. We do not grudge it. Now, Sir, when the world recognises Kannada, in India...

MR. CHAIRMAN: Please, put your question.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: ...step-motherly treatment is being given to Karnataka. Agitations are going on in Karnataka. About three days back, about one lakh people gathered. Everyday, it is going on. Has the Government recognised this? Is the Government going to take any action on this, and by what time?

SHRI SHIVRAJ V. PATIL: Sir, Kannada is a very rich language, ancient language. The matter is before the Committee of Linguistic Experts
constituted by the Ministry of Culture. This matter is now with the Ministry of Culture. They are looking into the matter. There are demands made by one other section of the society with respect to their language. Now, these demands are being looked into by the Expert Committee, and after the Expert Committee comes to any conclusion, the Ministry of Culture will take a decision in the matter.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: Sir, in reply to Unstarred Question No. 1381, it was stated, """"The Ministry of Culture had received presentation from various quarters for declaring Kannada as classical language. A Committee of Linguistic Experts has been constituted to examine the claims of any language classical language status. This Committee will advise the Government in the matter."""" This answer was given on 6.3.2006. Subsequently, to me also, the Minister of Culture has replied saying that it has been referred. Now, the question before the House is as to how long it will go on like this. There is a limit to the patience of the people also. They are losing their patience. You may not believe, but they are condemning and criticising the Parliamentarians and saying that Karnataka M.P.'s are dormant; they are inactive.

MR. CHAIRMAN: Please, ask the question. Don't make a statement.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: How long will the Government take a decision? After being referred to the Expert Committee, there has been a lapse of one year, what action is going to be taken by the Government?

MR. CHAIRMAN: Mr. Poojary, this is a supplementary question. Please, ask the question. Don't make a statement.

SHRI SHIVRAJ V. PATIL: As a matter of fact, this question should have been sent to the Ministry of Culture. But, because, the notice was given to us, and the notice was given at the last moment, the question was accepted and we are replying to it. As a matter of fact, it is only the Ministry of Culture which is in a position to take a decision with respect to this, and I would like to say that the language should unit; language should not divide. Many languages in our country are rich languages and they should be a source of our unity rather than division. So, it would be necessary for all of us to tell our brothers and sisters in the States that on the basis of language, division should not be created. Because the languages are rich; because the languages are ancient; because...(Interruptions).

No, Ketuanan Melayu was NEVER mentioned in the Constitution. It only mentions about """"Hak Keistimewaan orang Melayu"""". This is nothing but just the mentioned """"Aborigin Rights"""" just like most other countries, like Canada and Singapore. """"Ketuanan Melayu"""" was invented, but I'm not sure when is it exactly that it was first being used. One may say it is a derivation from the Article 153, but it has gone too far from beneficial - it has been abused and being used as a tool by Barisan Nasional for their own gain. The rationale behind Hak Keistimewaan Orang Melayu is that what they claimed that Malays are the Aborigins (although I don't really agree with this, the Peranakans has settled in Malacca during the 15th centuries!) - the true Aborigins are none other than Orang Aslis. Let's assume that the fact that Malays are aborigins are true. Article 153 never introduced """"Malays First"""" Policy, but rather the means to protect Malay rights as well as the rights of other races in this country. Article 153 is never controversial, but rather being ABUSED by certain politicians. I hope these makes it clear. The most prominent example that happens in this country right now is the government scholarship. You can read almost everywhere about this. Isn't this already an official discrimination? You can read more like the BTN courses who always refers the Chinese (include Peranakan generations) and Indians as """"pendatang"""", but the fact is that Parameswara himself is a Pendatang, (and also Khir Toyo).

Although Malaysia is not officially an Enthnocracy, but we can see that Malaysia appears to be one. Enthocracy is not limited to particular race in government positions, but it refers also to racial policies and practises. The definition of Ethnocracy includes """"and use them to advance the position of their particular ethnic group(s) to the detriment of others"""". Under the Malays First Policy (NEP, MARA, and many more) this is indeed very clear without further elaboration.

I now turn to other Wikipedia members for additional opinions since JFDWolff has been unreasonably disagreeable in my experiences with him in the past and a single opinion is not sufficient to remove edits.

I mean no more arrogance than this simple mere word - as I've had a good grasp of the whole series, it looks to me like sooner or later, we will need a seperate article for almost every Knight - yes, Phantom, Peta, Rolan, Candice, Chimera, Halloween, Ian or Magical Lou, Kouga, Pinocchio even; though don't start acting upon my words again, earlier it partly resulted in the submission of the Ghost Chess article and I've seen less eyesores - (and team MAR). So I intend to submit the masked images of the Knights in the main Chess Pieces article whenever one of them gets his/her own article, and the unmasked image will be redirected to the personal article. Well, people see the masked face in the main Chess Pieces article, and if they want to know more they read the seperate article with the unmasked face in it - good save of space, don't you think ? So please cease putting both images in each article after you read this - I will be very sorry indeed to remove the masked Phantom image, but I will do it nevertheless if it threatens to mar the face of both articles.

By the way, you've read the manga have you not ? Was Magical Lou really Magical Lou or Magical Roe ?",0

For my records

(== Dispute with Dsmith1usa ==)

Hi Jc.  Just wanted to leave you a quick comment regarding the dispute with User:Dsmith1usa.

Frankly, it's really not worth trying to reason with this guy. I've already tried several times, but all he keeps doing is putting up this really elaborate prose that basically amounts to """"I know you are but what am I?"""" It's very trollish, and I fully support any RFC/U or other action you or any other admin might take in this case.  I haven't followed up on it myself because, frankly, I've had better things to do. — ''''  — 

In this case, ignoring is probably the best course of action in this case so far. And thanks for your perspective on this. I've been doing some reading of my own, and am seeing a bit of a pattern. In any case, perhaps he will actually be true to his word an leave Wikipedia this time. We'll see. -  

Yes, ignoring is probably the best course of action in these cases so far.

Y'all know ... I've been doing some reading of my own, and am seeing a bit of a pattern. In any case, perhaps 'they' will actually be true to their word. Again (sigh):

I will be referring this dispute to a more appropriate forum, and will no longer be involved in the dispute myself. — KieferSkunk (talk) —  

...and leave this 'dispute' - as I keep asking - alone this time. We'll see. 

But you won't leave it will ya? I don't think its in your nature.

 If you're still around, I'd really like for you to explain'' in one small paragraph... that's called 'egging it on' KS.

 'n I take this as code for 'inconvenient truth:'

 (not this drawn-out mess of one-line responses to other people's comments taken out of context).

You, remarkably, when you came on the scene, posed as a 'mediator,' as far as I can see. There are others, outside of me, have asserted that you can pour the equivalent of gas on fires. I have reminded you of this, earlier:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:KieferSkunk#Disruptions_at_Integral

Later, this year, in November, Friends over the UK are meeting in seminars on 'Building Harmony.' You would be most welcome to join us. Perhaps you may see the world as not quite like you appear to want to view it.

Apologies if you find the language 'elaborate.' I call it 'reasoning' and, trust me, I find it just as difficult to reason with y'all ... being partial to Truth m'self.

Now ... am I ... finally ... dismissed ...?

Storm of the month
Hurricane Frank is the storm of the Month.

Tropical Depression Nine-E formed on August 21 south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. It developed into a tropical storm the following morning. On August 23, Frank continued to intensify, but later faced shear and entered a period of weakening. However, on August 24, as shear decreased, it began to reorganize and strengthen again, becoming a hurricane on August 25. Two days later, Frank weakened into a tropical storm. Rapidly weakening overnight, NHC issued that it have been degraded into an remnant low. The area of low pressure associated with Frank was absorbed with another area of disturbed weather which later developed into Tropical Depression Ten-E.

Throughout Central America, Hurricane Frank produced torrential rain that resulted in at least 30 fatalities, most of which took place in Nicaragua and Honduras. In Guatemala alone, damage from the system was estimated to be up to $500 million. In Mexico, six deaths were reported. A total 30 homes were destroyed with 26 others damaged. Two major roads were damaged with another road blocked due to a landslides. Several rivers overflowed their banks as well.  Losses from the storms totaled millions of dollars. Water Currents form a nearby volcano were damaged as well.




Other tropical cyclone activity

Atlantic Ocean– In the Atlantic Ocean, around three storms and one depression formed. Tropical Depression Four early on August 2. Early the next day, the depression strengthened further into a tropical storm and was named """"Colin"""".  Tropical Storm Colin was downgraded to a tropical depression late morning on August 8. Tropical Depression 5 formed on August 10, with no improvement, it dissipated within 24 hours. Tropical Depression Six developed near the Cape Verde Islands on August 21, the first of the series of Cape Verde-type storms. On August 22 the system attained tropical storm status, thus earning the name """"Danielle"""" The next day it attained hurricane status, becoming the second of the season and strengthened further to a Category 2 hurricane. On August 27, Hurricane Danielle strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane, becoming the first major hurricane of the season, and further strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane shortly after.Danielle later weakened to a Category 3, then Category 2 hurricane, and later became a Category 1 Hurricane due to an eyewall replacement cycle, while avoiding land areas. It became extratropical early on August 31 southeast of Newfoundland without having directly impacted land. It was fully absorbed by a larger extratropical low on September 4 over Greenland. On August 25, Tropical Depression 7 formed east of Hurricane Danielle. Later that day it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Earl. On August 29, 2010 Earl strengthened to become the season's third hurricane. Earl then quickly intensified to become the season's second major hurricane on August 30. The hurricane weakened to a Category 3 hurricane after an eyewall replacement cycle before becoming a Category 4 again. Earl made landfall in the Canadian Maritime Provinces, twice in Nova Scotia and once in Prince Edward Island (PEI) at hurricane intensity. On August 30, when gale-force winds and better organization resulted in the development of Tropical Storm Fiona, skipping tropical depression status. It struggled to develop further, however, as it was hindered by hig",0

"""

Right. So we've dealt with the question of Qworty's slander. Let's move on. Here's why you should not be involved in this discussion, Qworty. You have demonstrated - not simply to me; not simply to Wikipedia; but to THE WORLD AT LARGE - that you are incapable of editing in good faith. When the mainstream media characterizes you - Qworty - as a ranting, slanderous, biased editor, then... well, we should take that seriously.  I do hope you've read the Salon article about you? If not, let me quote: your screed was interpreted (rightly) as """"an apoplectic defense by one Wikipedia editor of actions that other Wikipedia editors labeled 'revenge editing.' There’s a lot of anger here (not to mention an unhealthy fixation with excrement!). Call me persnickety, but reading Qworty’s comments did not give me the greatest faith in Wikipedia’s internal process for building an encyclopedia of human knowledge.""""

Those aren't my words, regarding you. They are Salon's. THEY have identified you as an apoplectic, vengeful disgrace, with an unhealthy scatological fixation. So, that's what we're dealing with here: you, Qworty, as the star of an article entitled """"Wikipedia's Shame.""""

Now, Wikipedia requires that we assume good faith in our fellow editors, which I do, until the most extreme (and frankly comical) evidence points out that we're dealing with someone like you. Since we know that you will do everything within your power to sabotage any entry remotely related to Filipacchi, it's a waste of time to discuss matters of policy with you. I'm happy to debate subtle points of epistemology with almost anyone, into the wee hours of the morning - just not with you.  As for Little green rosetta: I've been giving her the benefit of the doubt. Even though she accused me - on the basis of what she termed """"behavioral and technical evidence"""" - of using sock puppets. Even though, when that proved to be false (okay, a lie), she didn't apologize, but instead came here to support your - Qworty's - frivolous snark. Despite all of this, I've given her the benefit of the doubt. Now shall we get back to the tedious matter of editing this article?

(2)I left in the last three paragraphs which you think don't deserve attention, however it is true, and this behavior definitely deserves attention in a """"comments and criticisms"""" section.

Here is the original section I've pulled from-
Personally, I prefer this info to be integrated into the article more seamlessly, but I have accepted """"comments/criticism"""" sections as a necessary part of these types of articles as there tends to be no other way to share this information without damaging the integrity of the article. Insertion of information regarding Hitler's abuse of drugs after his assasination attempt, or Exxon's treatment of the Valdez incident, and subsequent hand wringing over the suit, to all be examples of pertinent info regarding individuals and companies that can easily be perverted to a non-objective position, but are still highly valuable when done correctly.
So this done, let's all take it easy. Those who think it is a poor section please leave it and place in your cite requests. Those who think it deserves to stay can work to find those cites and clean it up. This can and will become a good section if we let it be and allow for the open source machine to work it's magic.

I assume he also didn't explain why ice shelfs are breaking off, etc, but unless there was some noteworthy reason why he didn't field one of those questions, it's not really worth putting.  Sorry I've been so harsh on this article, but in general I think Wikipedia does a great job of staying neutral, and this really jumped out as an exception. -

Stephan, may I borrow this comment and sprinkle it on my lawn to help it grow? Really. I have watched this topic area for years and BLPs of skeptics are absolutely littered with opinions like this. Do some research on skeptic BLPs and notice how much George Monbiot is quoted, and he's not even a scientist!. Editors like you have either ignored the use of such opinions as sources or outright endorsed it, because the opinions supported your POV. Now we have similar opinions from a respected climatologist, published in the Wall Street Journal, and all of a sudden it's a primary source?! Please! Anyone who spends more than 5 minutes examining the histories can see the blatant hypocrisy of your position. In fact, on BLP/N right now there is a debate about Michaels' criticism started by none other than ChrisO  this is the same editor who has, in the last week, edit-warred to include non-notable and weakly-sourced criticism in Chris Monckton's BLP. The hypocrisy of the editors here is absolutely astounding, and I will be shocked if arbcom doesn't deal with it.   20:26",0

Please check that Auriga Logic meets, or at least comes close to meeting some of the WP:CORP guidelines to see whether a Wikipedia article on the company is worthwile in the first place.

Speedy deletion of Desiyou
 A tag has been placed on Desiyou requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

"POV that the story was really true

Cut from article:

Detainees — held there as a part of the ongoing U.S. prosecution of its War on Terror — had earlier made similar complaints but this was the first time a government source had appeared to confirm the story.

This sentence implies that:
 they've been desecrating the Koran all along
 finally, a source more credible than a prisoner came forward

Therefore, the Newsweek story is true - despite its retraction (under government pressure).

I'd like this Wikipedia article to remain scrupulously neutral on the issue of whether the descration story is true.

To do this, we need to separate the timeline from the immediate incident. We also need to ascribe POV to named sources or at least specified / designated anonymous or confidential sources:  NOT using nuance or insinuation within the article text to make the point!!!

Thanks for your reply.

I looked at the WP:EL page, and it seems to be somewhat at odds with what you're saying. According to that page's first paragraph, and expanded upon further down the page with similar language, an external link is ok if it contains """"meaningful, relevant content that is not suitable for inclusion in an article for reasons unrelated to their reliability (such as reviews and interviews)"""".

That's exactly how I would describe the links I'd added. Too opinionated for Wikipedia proper, but highly relevant for people reading the article. They fit all the other criteria on WP:EL too.

But rather than discuss this here, it maybe would be better for me to discuss a possible external link on the article's talk page? )

"Translation

Being exposed to the two traditions, I am unable to decide which one covers best the definition.How we define freedom itself depends upon various factors - culture, education, environment and individuals own understanding on where the voluntary freedom ends and the legal begins.However, let us see how the French definition reads into English.I admit, this falls beyond my area of specialisation and could possibly be literal in places

Freedom is the sense of acting according to one's own will without being restrained by the power of anyone else.It is defined 

negatively as  the absence from submission,servitude,constraint exercised by someone else.

positively as: the autonomy and spontaniety of a rational being;the voluntary human behaviours are based on freedom and qualified as Free

This notion is seen as an abstract and normative value of the human actions and at the same time like a solid reality.These two perspectives are interwoven in many ways and could lead to errors of categorisation.There are, therefore, numerous confusions that can arise with respect to the term Freedom.So,it is necessary to distinguish the different sense of this word.

The Freedom could be taken as an attribute of the Human Being, of his will and be the condition of natural and positive rights, but also his duties;the effective realisation of the voluntary acts has a dimension that could not be possible without the later.These two ideas of Human existence are not necessarily compatible.For example, the existence of Legal Freedoms can be felt, while its reality (existence in our acts) and its essence (its conception that we have) poses problems.  

The first point could be addressed in a Socio-Political research; the second point constitutes its metaphysical base and particularly the Philosophical understanding of Freedom.This article is divided into two parts to facilitate this understanding.The first part covers the Philosophical aspects - treating the metaphysical notions of Freedom and the second part - the Sociological aspects.However one should keep in mind that the two aspects are interrelated.

Though it could be argued that they are not reliable sources, I think they are marginally reliable, there are three of them and each of these articles is written by professional journalist{s}. 

However, when I looking at the sources they do not definitively say Jennie is gay, which is contrary to the way the WP article now reads: The Atlantic says Jennie has been campaigning for her sister and may be a lesbian; Mother Jones says Jennie supports gay rights and lives with a girlfriend; Daily Beast says Wade Richards, a former employee of Christine's organization, SALT, says the O'Donnell has a sister who is gay. Daily Beast also says Christine campaigned against gay rights. Based on all of this, it is not established by RSs that Jennie is gay. So, I will be doing a combination of reverting and re-writing the earlier version of the statement.",0

I've set up pages for each season of the show and moved the episode list data there.

Albania Veneta

Dear Jimbo, 

I appreciate very much what you are doing with your Wikipedia. It is a great gift to all of us. But there are some """"points"""" that need to be improved, as you know. 

One is the presence of nationalistic groups that in a coordinate way want to impose their points of view without regard of what write serious historians. They usually proceed to ask for help from """"friendly to them"""" administrators and so obtain what they want. In Eastern Europe there are many of these groups (mainly ex-communists) and often are associated with hackers. 

What do we have to do with these nationalistic groups? In my case I can pinpoint what is going on with the articles """"Albania Veneta"""", """"Zadar"""", """"Istrian exodus"""", etc., where a group of known nationalistic fanatics (like one nicknamed in the english wikipedia as """"Direktor"""") are erasing and damaging what write others with serious and proven references. They use the typical misinformation with """"political pressure"""" of the Soviets in Eastern Europe. 

May be you have a serious and impartial administrator, who can help? 
Regards. 

This seems to be a dispute about naming conventions and reliable sources. Naming convention disputes should be solved by determining the names most often used by English speakers and using them without regard to ethnic sympathies. Disputes concerning reliable sources should be raised on WP:RSN. When different reliable sources disagree, they should both be represented in the article with a description of the differences in order to satisfy WP:NPOV. It seems likely that both sides of this dispute have relatively equally reliably sources which conflict.  Welcome to the Balkans. ←BenB4 """,0

"Tom, I'm a novice at this, and am just now figuring out how to use my Talk page.  Yes, my view is that Lord Burghley did not take financial advantage of Oxford and other royal wards.  In fact, a book of Lawrence Stone's (as I recall) demonstrates that Lord Burghley put the Earl of Rutland, a royal ward, on his feet again financially through his management of Rutland's affairs during Rutland's wardship (Lord Burghley was a good friend of Rutland's stepmother).  The wardship system was a cash cow for the Tudor monarchy, and although Lord Burghley doubtless profited from his position as Master, he did not take financial advantage of his royal wards.  In particular, since this article is about Oxford, Lord Burghley did not take financial advantage of Oxford during his wardship.  The financial benefit of Oxford's wardship went to Leicester, as I've demonstrated from historical documents in my article in Brief Chronicles. Nina Green205.250.205.73",0

"All of the fuss about Patent Trolls is driving coalitions of technology sector leaders to Washington, D.C. with their support of this year’s Patent Reform Legislation.  With all the fanfare, it is perfect timing for the Original Patent Troll to make his comeback in the recent re-release of The Patents Video.

In 1994, the Patent Troll made his first appearance in The Patents Video.  At its first release, The Patents Video was purchased by hundreds of corporations, universities, governmental entities and law firms.  In The Patents Video, an unsuspecting victim is surprised by the Original Patent Troll who strategically positioned himself to collect patent licensing revenue.

Using dramatic vignettes, entertaining scenarios, humor and expert advice, The Patents Video explains the most commonly misunderstood concepts and the most critical information about patents.  The Patents Video was designed to visually make key messages memorable.  Topics include intellectual property (IP) law basics, domestic and foreign patent bar dates, patenting of ideas, and claim language with respect to patent infringement.  

Engineers, scientists, marketers, managers, executives and corporate attorneys have a lesson in Bar Dates that no one forgets when they watch The Patents Video.   Og, a caveman in a dream, has invented the wheel.  Og and Thak push the wheel through downtown – all in public view.  The Patents Video, an entertaining educational tool, explains how and why Og and Thak have lost their foreign patent filing rights and explains, in detail, how to avoid triggering U.S. and foreign patent Bar Dates.  

A free viewing of a 3.5 minute clip from the 32 minute video is available by visiting www.ogandthak.com.   YouTube viewers give the clip Five Stars.

"Caution to the reader regarding the neutrality of this article 

Recently the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee has declared that significant global warming is an indisputable fact, and has begun banning people from editing this, and other articles, if they insert sources which question the magnitude or severity of anthropogenic climate change.  This is in direct violation of the Wikipedia's own NPOV policy, which requires Wikipedia articles to not endorse specific viewpoints as true, and which requires that all significant perspectives be included in an article.  However, emotions are high on the issue of global warming, and the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee has decided that it is more important for the climate change articles at Wikipedia to reflect their views on climate change, than it is for the climate change articles to be neutral and impartial in their presentation and content.  Because of this, the reader is strongly cautioned regarding the neutrality of this article's content until this situation is remedied.   —  | Talk 9 July 2005 07:41 (UTC)",0

jftr, what the above refers to

Former MPs do have working links in Parliament. If you weren't so eager to smash things rather than fix them, you would have noticed that. And you couldn't even be bothered to let me know there might be a problem. I hope our paths never cross again but I suppose I'll have to watch your contributions in future to make sure you aren't deleting everything I do. What a waste of time. Oh yeah - I'll assume you were smashing in good faith. As if. Thanks for ruining my (formerly) good mood, as I was enjoying making some useful contributions to Wikipedia articles.   
Welcome to Wikipedia. Now, a recap. With this edit you added a link to the current MPs list, for Carter. Problem was it was for David Carter, not John Carter so I removed it. I went to replace it with one for John Carter, but there is none, so I couldn't. You then added another link, but like the first one it too went to the wrong person, this time, Cam Calder. I removed it with the edit summary """"Cannot replace it because Carter is no longer an mp"""". You have responded by inserting a brand new link to Former MPs. I was unaware Carter has been added to that list, but that is beside the point because I was removing links to current MPs. If you intend to edit Wikipedia for a while I suggest you don't shout in your edit summaries as you did with """"Former MPs DO HAVE WORKING LINKS. Wikipedians fix links rather than delete them"""",  and you address the actual issue and don't jump to conclusions.   
Not true! The actual issue was that you deleted ALL the links I added for him. That is the recap. The two other links worked fine, but you deleted them as well in your hurry to smash everything someone else did. In other words, you are the one who jumped to conclusions. Now you're trying to claim you only deleted the one that was a problem. Even your edit summary is wrong. The man's resignation was presented the same day I was adding the links, unknown to me, so it seems the Parliament link was being moved from current to former which caused pointer problems when I clicked on it. Things happen. It only needed to be fixed. I would have thought an Admin would be capable of figuring that out. Nor could you figure out how to leave a message on my Talk page so I could figure it out. You just couldn't wait to smash everything. I only came back to the article because I was going through the non-Cabinet people on the list. Did you fix that list, once you realized this was a former MP? No, you did not. That would have been """"work"""", requiring """"thought"""" and """"effort"""". Same as you mis-corrected the hat note on the other John Carter MP. Based on your arrogance, I thought it likely you were an Admin. What a surprise, I was right. And Jimbo wonders why the numbers of actual contributors are going straight downhill. I have NO intention of continuing to contribute to Wikipedia because you obviously would prefer to do everything yourself. You're not at all welcoming, helpful, polite, assuming good faith, or anything else I was led to believe is part of the Wikipedia ethos. So I leave you to it. You didn't even have the grace to apologize for deleting the other links, you just tried to blame me in this audit trail. Go lecture someone else, because I'm out of here, and you can be sure I won't be encouraging anyone else to participate in what could have been a good project. Your attitude is horrendous, and I'm sure I'm not the first one you've chased out of here. Well, keep it up and you'll soon have the whole thing to yourself. Enjoy. Go brag to your friends that you got rid of another contributor. I'm sure you're very proud of yourself.   """,0

My opinion on these pages is uneducated mods deleted them for invalid reasons with NO DEBATE, a pure Draconian nazi mod behavior.

The 8 Prime Spirals article is a BIG DEAL in math since it puts forth amazing information about a 1995 math theory now being used in real life computer programs to outperform all the prime algorithms wiki has pages on.

So in the world of primality IT IS A BIG DEAL.

To summarize the gross lies of wiki mods, they think a cite to a valid primality test open to debate by real academics at GITHUB is not worthy of a page creation.

This is untrue.  I have not been blocked for the reasons mentioned but rather for entirely different reasons, since the reasons mentioned are not actually true.  It is impossible to """"exhibit a battleground attitude"""" because of many reasons, including the fact that one cannot """"exhibit"""" something unless one is a display engineer at a museum, and it would therefore be impossible to """"exhibit"""" anything let alone a """"battleground attitude,"""" the fact that there is no such thing as a """"battleground attitude,"""" the fact that there is no such thing as an """"attitude"""" in regards to how a human being acts, and the fact that the word """"exhibit"""" is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user (antagonizing me).  Usage of words like """"exhibit"""" and """"attitude"""", and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page, show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person, and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing.  

The second claim is physically possible, but is blatantly false.  I have specifically attempted to PREVENT other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner, as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations, for which I reported him but yet the people at the ALLEGED """"help desk"""" refused to tell me where to report him, and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently.  Having OTHER USERS delete my comments, participate in blatant fradulent..ism, post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me, etc., is hardly """"myself making it difficult to communicate,"""" when in fact as was just demonstrated I did the LITERAL EXACT OPPOSITE of this by LITERALLY ATTEMPTING TO PREVENT OTHER USERS FROM MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE.  ((In addition, if I wish for other users to NOT communicate with me, I also have THAT right, it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so.  Although I personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example ex-spouses from communicating with each other when necessary, the part of the law that refers to STRANGERS such as on Wikipedia or anywhere on the Internet, it is a PERSONAL CHOICE whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and/or post contact information etc.  That is why every message board in existence has an option to """"disable the private messaging system"""".))

There were no personal attacks done by me anywhere, so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim.

""""Refusal to abide by the site's guidelines"""" is impossible since 1) """"guidelines"""" and """"rules"""" are two different thing 2) Wikipedia does not have any rules and 3) All policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous Wikipedia articles which specifically say this.

You have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was """"done in multiple venues,"""" even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events and/or conventions and/or etc.  So that is also impossible.                       """,0
"Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii
Ekadashi, in Vedic (Vaishnava) calendar is a fasting day. This is day of Lord Hari (Vishnu), so one has to dedicate this day to Vishnu, thus one has to do more fasting, especially from crops (beans). In Vedas persons refrain from meat, eggs, flesh/blood 'food' completely, but on this day (Ekadashi) one even refrains from beans/crops like rice, as Kali (material lust) may hide there on Ekadashi day. This day Vishnu has to be satisfied and not our tongue, belly etc.

Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii occurs during the light fortnight (shukla paksha) of the extra, leap year month known as Adhika month. This Adhika month is considered to be very auspicious (adhika = best or greatest), as Vishnu appearing Himself. This month (Adhika Maasa) comes once every two (sometimes three) years, and so also this Ekadashi. Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii'' comes on Purushottam Shukla Paksh'''.

Totally agree with you Direktor, and I am sure that your highly reasonable opinions and facts you are presenting on wikipedia are highly respected and accepted by the waste majority of its readers. Please, if you can, - do your regular check-ups of the articles concerning South Slavic languages and make sure they’re not presenting some misleading information. I would just add to this that although ‘the political reason is the officially maintained distaste of the so-called """"pan-Yugoslav commonness”’, this distaste should be ‘expressed’ in a more civilized manner than creating some non-acceptable partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area, or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system (language) at the templates featured in the articles about South Slavic languages and dialects. And most importantly - that ridiculous ‘pan-Yugo’ distaste which openly sends a message of hatred and separatism, should not, by any mean be reflected in the language area, because it only shows how low and how uncivilized its ‘supporters’ can be, no matter what their ‘not-supported-by anyone-in-scientific-world’ theories they may point out as their sources. 
And, at the end, as an example of a civilized political distaste between nations, here’s the example of Americans and Canadians. Majority of Canadians feel in a different extent, a kind of aversion towards Americans, especially since the start of the ‘George-Bush-era’ in USA. But still, nobody says that Canadians speak a ‘different language’ than Americans, and nobody tries to hide the common history facts and the strong cultural and economical ties that exist between these 2 countries. This is a typical way of overcoming any kind of ‘distaste’ in a human and civilized way, all the other ways are just a shame for humanity.

Firstly, """"fair use"""" does not mean you can just take whatever copyrighted material you like and use it.  Non-free content cannot be used in cases where a free content equivalent, with an acceptable quality sufficient to serve the encyclopedic purpose, is available or could be created.  Lifting a definition from an external source, instead of writing your own, is not an example of fair use.
Secondly, as you seem to think that something can only be redundant if it's an exact copy, let's have a look at the two definitions, piece by piece:
 Wikipedia definition Copied definition Comparison A tax (from the Latin taxo; """"rate"""") is a financial charge or other levy According to Black's Law Dictionary, a tax is a """"pecuniary burden Equivalent in meaningimposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity)laid upon individuals or property owners Equivalent in meaningby a state or the functional equivalent of a stateto support the government [...] a payment exacted by legislative authority.""""  Equivalent in meaningsuch that failure to pay is punishable by law.It """"is not a voluntary payment or donation, but an enforced contribution, exacted pursuant to legislative authority""""  Equivalent in meaningTaxes are also imposed by many administrative divisions. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent.and is """"any contribution imposed by government [...] whether under the name of toll, tribute, tallage, gabel, impost, duty, custom, excise, subsidy, aid, supply, or other name."""" Oooh!  Slightly different.  And how very useful a list of obscure alternative words for """"tax"""" is too.
If you really, desperately need to include the list of obscure alternative words for """"tax"""", the way to do it is to list some of the terms, and cite the source from which they came.  Simple, huh?  The way not to do it is to copy and paste the entire chunk of text verbatim.

If you are not yet sick of history merges, here's one that is a little strange.  This article Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Guns and Robots was developed up to a certain point in Feruary, then the changes pick up with the same editors at Guns and Robots (video game) until a few days ago, and a redirect was created at Guns and Robots pointing to this article.  Then a totally different editor, transferred all of the text to the redirect page and made a redirect out of the page which had been the article.  No reason given on the talk pages.  I personally feel that the pages were correct before the move, but I am not an expert on the conventions of page naming.  In any case, the history of Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Guns and Robots needs to be appended to Guns and Robots (video game), not to Guns and Robots as it would appear from a casual look.

For the reader unfamiliar with the situation, the block was set in response to my repeated use of the phrase """"deletionist vandals"""" on several AfD entries; according to karmafist, I was being an asshole to deletionists (who do indeed disagree with me) by calling them """"vandals"""".

Now, karmafist, you and I both know that there are people who think it is acceptable to replace the contents of Snoopy with, say, """"Snoopy is a shitfaced cockmaster.""""  I disagree with those people, and I'm sure you do, too.  In fact, there are lots of people who doand they refer to the aforementioned individuals as """"vandals"""".  However, they are never blocked for this.  Since, according to you, """"being an asshole to people who disagree with you"""" is a blockable offense, it follows that one of the following must be true:
Calling someone a """"vandal"""" does not constitute being an asshole, in which case I should not have been blocked because by calling deletionists (who disagree with me) """"vandals"""", I was not being an asshole to people who disagree with me.
Your statement that it is unacceptable to be an asshole to people who disagree with me is false, in which case I should not have been blocked because assholery is in fact not unacceptable behavior.

Or perhaps you meant to say that because someone disagrees with you is not ipso facto sufficient reason to be an asshole to him.  Again, one of the following must be true:
Calling someone a """"vandal"""" does constitute assholery, in which case one can infer (from the fact that those who refer to the Snoopy types as """"vandals"""" have never been blocked for that) that it is acceptable to engage in this specific type of assholery towards those who are indeed vandalsand, as I proved on User talk:Aaron Brenneman, deletionists are indeed vandals (you claimed that my proof was """"bullshit"""" and that it did not need refutation, but your assertion does not make it so)
Calling someone a """"vandal"""" does NOT constitute assholery, in which case it's all irrelevant since, as I was not being an asshole, the conditions under which being an asshole is acceptable are not an issue.
Calling someone a """"vandal"""" only constitutes assholery if it is false, in which case see the above-mentioned proof as to why that is not the case here.

Now, which of these alternatives is it?  Alternately, you can show me a fallacy (if I were you, I would try and find a false dichotomyor trichotomy, for that matteras my argument rests on showing you how none of the possible conclusions of your argument justify a block on me; perhaps you will be able to find an alternative I have missed that does indeed justify blocking me) or a mistaken premise and I will gladly concede that my behavior was wrong and was deserving of a block, and will change in the future.

At the same time we had both a surface search radar and a separate Air Search radar installation. From my memories, we had four 10 cylinder F-M Opposed Crank Diesel main engines, two per shaft, and additional 8 cylinder F-M Opposed Crank Diesels coupled to Generators for ships Electric Power.

Vandalism is any addition, removal, or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia. The most common types of vandalism include the addition of obscenities or crude humor, page blanking, or the insertion of nonsense into articles.

Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated. Not all vandalism is obvious, nor are all massive or controversial changes vandalism. Careful attention needs to be given to whether changes made are beneficial, detrimental but well intended, or outright vandalism.

Committing blatant vandalism violates Wikipedia policy. If you find that another user has vandalized Wikipedia, you should revert the changes and warn the user (see below for specific instructions).

I reverted this entry back to the content I posted back in November (making certain modifications since Mills is no longer Insurance Superintendent) because of the following errors and libelous content:

2.  The police department entry was not cited, and I happen to know that the content listed here happened after Mills had left the Town Supervisor post.

3.  Information about his decision to run for office again is not cited, and the quote """"many political observers believe his ethical lapses will be too great a hurdle to overcome in any future bid for elective office"""" is not cited and has no basis in fact.

Be careful with that editor

KDesk,
I appreciate your perception that the image of a man smoking a joint (which Mjpresson says exemplifies the title of the article Cannabis smoking) is inappropriate.  You may wish to follow the controversy further on Talk:Cannabis smoking, on the """"discussion"""" page of Wikipedia:WikiProject cannabis, and at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents/Tokerdesigner banned for one week where User:Tokerdesigner is under consideration for a block because User:Mjpresson proposed the block starting with a false allegation that Tokerdesigner """"threatened"""" Mjpresson.  

At the latter site you may decide to join in and vote to oppose a one-week block against Tokerdesigner especially after going to Mjpresson:Contributions and seeing what that editor has started to do on cannabis-related articles and One-hitter (smoking), seemingly emboldened by the thought that with Tokerdesigner sanctioned, other editors will be intimidated and uneager to try to stop him/her.

My conjecture (which I will be so bold as to share with you here) is that Mj's agenda includes:

"Misrepresenting administrator scope 

Please take care not to misrepresent how administrators are expected to act, or any other policy in the future - administrators do not make content decisions. What you quoted was particular only to discretionary sanctions which are only applicable in certain arbitration cases. You view has therefore been moved again to the talk page.   

Please take care not to engage in misrepresentation - you are not outside of this dispute, and your quote was particular to discretionary sanctions. Administrators do not make content decisions. See below. Please also do not change my view - I suggest you revert your latest edit - failure to do so will result in administrator intervention for deliberate misrepresentation, misuse of the dispute resolution process and vandalism.   
 

You are welcome to your view, but you are not welcome to misrepresent administrator policy or to change my view.   

You have engaged in misrepresentation, perhaps out of misunderstanding. Administrators are only allowed to make discretionary sanctions in arbitration cases where they are explicitly allowed to - Kirill's comment was in relation to discretionary sanctions only (check the context of his comment; the heading under which he made it). FloNight's comment is in relation to administrator enforcement in general, which is why the SAB remedy has been proposed in the homeopathy case.   

It is only disruptive where there is edit-warring - that is, edit-warring against consensus (separate policy on conduct). NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. Would you like arbitrator clarification?   

Did you read what I said above? NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. See also: . 
Discussing content issues at a conduct Rfc is inappropriate - we have a clear distinction between Article Rfc and Rfc on user conduct for that reason. What is acceptable is pointing editors to an Article RFC so editors can comment on content (and hence address content issues), and that is where discussion of those issues belong in the dispute resolution process.   

So please modify your view so that there is no misrepresentation of policy/norms as it has been sanctioned by the Committee in the past (and admins have been sanctioned when using their position to make a ruling on content). Article RFC is where comment is made on the content policies you have quoted - you are welcome to direct a link to the discussion there in your view so that it is dealt with.   

It seems you don't get the point - it's ok if you think it should be enforceable, but it is completely irresponsible to misrepresent policy by saying that it must be enforcible when it is forbidden. Also, it contributes to the confusion editors have about Wikipedia norms and policies, and it is unacceptable. Therefore, I am referring it directly to the Committee.",0

 Position fields in NFL bio infoboxes 

DL, I'm not sure where we are in the merge of Infobox NFL coach into Infobox NFL player, but one thing the coach infobox does somewhat well, which the player infobox doesn't handle well at all for coaches, is position.

I've seem similar cases where that one position field at the top of the infobox is filled out with something like """"Head coach/linebacker"""", which is really goofy.  The coach infobox has separate fields for current position and position, e.g. Wade Phillips.  This is better.   """,0

 Facts 

I think I'm finally starting to get the hang of this Finding of Fact malarkey, Brad.

The scenario: Bishonen has been focusing her energies for the last few weeks on her attempt to get an editor called Nina Green banned from Wikipedia. When Bishonen realises that Nina Green is indeed going to be banned

She posts to the arbcom page in green text: FoF perfectly normal. Arbcom pages are like little rainbows.
At the end of a talk page post about the green text, Bishonen suddenly decides to refer to it as """"dye"""":  FoF Not at all forced or contrived. Lots of people refer to text as dye. Or if they don't, they should do.
Bishonen ends her post with  """"Green dye!"""" which reads as """"Green die!"""": Fof Pure coincidence. Nina Green couldn't have been further from Bishonen's mind when she wrote """"Green dye!"""". Bishonen hadn't though of Nina Green for at least 30 seconds.

FOF: This entire sequence events: Bishonen wants Nina banned, gets what she wants, posts in green text, decides to call text """"dye"""", and ends her post for no apparent reason with """"Green dye!"""" is just a random bubble of billion-to-one-coincidence. Bishonen could just have easily chosen blue text, and it would have made perfect sense to end her post with """"Blue Pigment!"""".

Yep. I think I've got this FoF thing, now. And it certainly makes it a lot easier to understand how arbcom arrives at its decisions.   """,0

Priestley also designed visual study aides for his Lectures on History: A Chart of Biography (1765)[26] and A New Chart of History (1769).[27] According to Priestley, they """"impressed"""" upon students """"a just image of the rise, progress, extent, duration, and contemporary state of all the considerable empires that have ever existed in the world"""".[28] Both charts had accompanying prose descriptions and were popular for decades—A New Chart of History had gone through fifteen editions by 1816.[29] The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the University of Edinburgh to grant him a Doctor of Law degree in 1764.[30]

The Blackest Night

Hey, I'm looking for people to help me out with the creation of this article, care to lend a hand?   
Because the entire run has been building toward this event, there is already a wealth of information through every issue which can be used in the article.   

 Hulk (Comics) 

One note off topic. THANK YOU for the book recommendation. I've been hoping to get Iron Man up to a good GA before the movie, and could NOT get any help sourcing his communist bent. Comic Book nation does that well!   

In library now, will check it out tonight. It's wan on actual Hulk analysis overall, esp. in relation to Grest. Weinberg's science of superheros, or Simcha Weinstein's Up UP and Oy vey, but it'll help, no doubt, with Hulk, and hopefully other articles. I'm also looking at Tales to Astonish, by Ronin Ro, but... it' a bit more history of Marvel than of the characters, and covers most of the major character creations ins a paragraph, LOL - shows that the focus changes the coverage.   

see here.   

 Popular Music Sites 

Hi Wesley,

You mentioned that PureVolume, being a website for bands to host mp3s, is not suitable as a source.  Is this because a source should be a 3rd-party human being who has done original research or synthesis?  I realize that PureVolume (and any site that collects and presents data about usage) can present results that are made inaccurate through sockpuppets, but it still ends up being less slanted and biased than human beings, don't you think?   

 Kitty Pryde 

Hi Wesley.  Thanks for helping out with the page.  I haven't read that issue yet, but I did read an issue summary, so I tried to edit it back to standards.  Thanks for fixing that one, though.  At least that nonsense is over now.  

 Nirvana 

Are you still working on a style and influences section for Nirvana? The article could use some cleanup and more info, especially considering it is a FA. — [Speak the truth!]

 Are you forgetting, Risker, that it was I that embraced Giano's plan to get Vk unblocked and presented it to the community? It was he and I that did most of the work drafting the conditions. It was my continuing interest that helped get him back to a position where he can edit. Vk (and Giano) were more than happy to have my input when he thought it would get him unblocked, but now the conditions are not to Vk's liking - despite what he agreed at the time - suddenly the accusations against me start again. What is really sad is that you seem to buy into it. 
I strongly resent your implication that I want him banned. I supported a ban in the past, true, along with many other editors. But the accusation makes absolutely no sense, considering how was already banned (twice) and both times I worked to get it lifted, this despite some atrocious personal abuse from Vk in the past.  So I'll tell you what, I may not forget how editors responded to me, but I don't hold it against them to the detriment of the project. et """,0

This user has a limited history and is not a registered user, so I am replying here instead of on the talk page, where they sent me a note personally.  

The user mentioned Wikiproject Albums.  However, that project is not relevant to this page, since that policy applies to album articles (this is not) and in actually makes no comment at all about which albums should be included on an artist's article (I just read the page).  The policy that actually applies to this page is WikiProject Musicians, and it does not say anywhere that the article should include """"all albums where Mayer is a primary contributor."""" (or any other artist).  The policy there is rough and incomplete.  Thus, I have been operating on precedent, as well as what makes the most sense and what is most fair to the works.  Works done by a band should be credited to the band as a whole, not an idividual, since that just isn't fair.  Additionally, Wikipedia has a long history of separating the discography of an idividual from that of the musical group they were/are in. Here a few examples: Jack White, John Phillips, David Ruffin, Sly Stone, Larry Graham, Nick Lachey, Brian Wilson, Tina Turner, Nicky Wire, Michelle Williams (singer), Mick Jagger, Agnetha Fältskog, John Entwistle, Vince Neil, Stanley Clarke, Robert Plant, Frank Black, Darren Hayes, Mark Burgess (musician), Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Graham Coxon, John Lennon, Steve Howe (guitarist), Neil Finn, Roger Daltrey, Smokey Robinson, Gladys Knight, Randy Bachman, Robert Wyatt, Biosphere (musician), Individual members of the Beach Boys, James Dean Bradfield, Joey Eppard, Steve Marriott, Grant McLennan, Tony Banks (musician), Sisqó, Alex Chilton, Bob Mould, Jim Capaldi and there are many more.

Many of these discographies have notes that wikilink to the appropriate article for the full band discograhy.  Therefore, in the insterest of consistency, that same model should be applied here. """,0

This isn't about appeasing edit warriors, Tony. For example, I've never known Cookiecaper to be an edit warrior (like me, he has an LDS background), but he stumbled across this and found a need for an alternate version. I didn't strongly advocate this solution here until he did the same thing to the article (albiet with a fork, which was obviously unacceptable). A similar solution was independently derived by a new user on Penis and, apparently, Violetriga. I believe it's a more satisfying (that is, consensus-based) solution than the status quo.

Re. """"Wilderness Diarrhea NRO 

Hope you don't mind this post taking up space here. Just delete the quote if you like. I recently posted a question on NRO notice board and you responded, saying 

It seems to me that something along these lines should be included in the article, and that the sources largely back it up. However, there may be a bit of a problem with conflation of general GI symptoms and diarrhea specifically, especially in the MS&SE; ref. In order to allay the concerns of the other editor and improve the article, there will also need to be some information (just a statement, probably) contextualizing the prevalence of diarrhea caused by strenuous activity relative to the prevalence of diarrhea caused by pathogens. If we can improve it along these lines, I'll be happy to help argue for its inclusion in the article.

Here's my re-write, which I haven't proposed as yet. Does it do the job? I'm afraid it won't be accepted because it may imply that """"Wilderness Diarrhea"""" is a non-existent category... which I think maybe it sortta is....

My larger problem is, that I think the article is based on an overblown view of the subject, even though it's got a couple of sources to the contrary. Thing is, I've got like five good sources directly on the """"overblown"""" side (not the ones below) but they get shunted into """"controversy"""" section, with the implication that they are fringe theories, or simply deleted because they aren't """"peer reviewed"""" or the source doesn't cite a source..or etc.. things like that....It's not that I'm against telling people to treat suspect water, but I think the preponderance of research (apart from """"expert opinion"""" suggests that the concern is highly over-stated, and to simply say that that would be unacceptable.

I've been keeping away from the article for a week. It's the domain currently of a single editor who seems to simply know what's best. Any way here is re-write of the bit, along with some proposed context.

Causes
The most common causes of wilderness diarrhea are Giardia and Cryptosporidium Backer, Howard D. (2007), “Field Water Disinfection”, In: Auerbach, Paul S. (editor), Wilderness Medicine, 5th edition, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Mosby Elsevier, pg 1369., although several other organisms may play a larger role than generally believed [] . Other infectious agents include Campylobacter, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus, enterotoxogenic E. coli, e. coli 0157:H7, Shigella, and various enteric viruses. More rarely, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Cyanobacterium may also cause disease.

The vectors for infectious diarrhea, both within and outside wilderness, are limited to contaminated food, water, and hand-to-mouth transmission. It may be difficult to accurately associate a particular case with a recent wilderness visit, because incubation can vary widely,  up to several weeks or more, while infection outside the wilderness is common. 
Giardia alone may infect up to 10% of Americans at any one time, although most carriers are asymptomatic.

Within any given four-week period, as many as 7.2% of Americans may experience some form of diarrhea. []. The most common causes are viruses, followed by bacteria and parasites including Giardia[]. Other important causes of diarrhea in the U.S. are non-infectious, and include medications, stress, or a change in eating or exercise patterns. [] 

Non-infectious gastrointestinal distress, including diarrhea, is common as a result of strenuous excercise []. A study of 155 men and women who walked an average of 26 miles a day for four days, found 24% of the subjects experienced gastrointestinal symptoms. No relationship was established between symptoms and age, gender, previous training, or walking speed. []  

Factors in diarrhea related to exercise may include dehydration, the diversion of blood from the bowel to the working muscles (gut ischemia), certain foo",0

"Bot tagging 

Greetings,
I have seen your name everywhere already. Thanks for your recent attention to WP:PHILO and the aesthetics dept. I had recently been working on the logic project. I did quite a bit of work on it, and then ran up against some cultural issues.

I wanted to get User:SatyrBot (an apparently wonderful service!!) to automatically tag articles with the new logic banner for the purpose of assessment. I put together a category list, publicized the issue, and then moved forward with no objection. Well the complainers came out of the woodwork! The bot was stopped and at this point most have been untagged. I find all of this quite terrible.

Since then, I have been working on WP:PHILO with all of these task forces. I got the sense that people were a lot less uptight in general over there. I have changed direction a bit and now am advocating that the philosophy project tag incorporate these fields and be placed appropriately, etc. However, there is no real enthusiasm for the auomatic bot tagging proposal. Although there is far less hostility to it!  

I intend to ask the bot to tag just the Aesthetics project and see how things go. I haven't put this proposal out to WP:PHILO yet, I wanted to give you a chance to comment on it. Any advice or support in these goals would be appreciated.",0

This is not an accident 

Some of the sections/articles on Kambojas, as being edited and altered by Debachmann, are getting utterly confusing and more messier, and, I'm afraid, may lead to erroneous conclusions by the readers. As he has started editing/altering them en mass, either he should improve the articles by editing them suitably so as to keep them clear, logical and readable and at the same time, also maintain/keep intact their integrity and factuality (let's us if he can do it), or else, I will have no alternative except to revert them back to their original versions. For example, the article Language and ethnicity of Kambojas, in its current form which he has edited, is utterly terrible. I don't think he and other editors on kamboj articles of his kind are quite familiar with the Kamboj history, so as to render them a justice. Further, please make a note that, none of the information, in any of articles on the Kambojas, is a original-research as Mr Debachmann continues to allege. All the Kamboj information is in the books and only he and other people of his ilk may not be aware of it. I have sent this note to him not with any intention to enter into a futile argument with him, but simply to let him know that all the information on the Kambojas..ancient/mediaval or modern, as inserted in any Kamboj related article here, is well-documented and has been taken from reliable references/sources from notable scholars.

This article is primarily about the World Cricket League and, although the regional competitions are connected to this in the sense that they act as qualification, I think the section could be considerably reduced - particularly now the regional competitions have less impact on new teams entering the league.

I think the Regional Tournament section ought to be vastly cut down, removing the table and leaving an overview of the qualification of teams from regional tournaments, a small table outlining teams that have qualified via this process and an in-text link to the various articles on the regional tournaments. By doing this you remove a great swathe of information that clogs up this article and that can be found elsewhere.

Another improvement to the article could be a rework of the table on previous WCL tournaments and adding an explanatory introduction to make it more comprehensive to the first time viewer.

Here are some suggestions 

Don't use personal pronouns like 'we'.
Don't use sentences with heavily connoted and unverifiable words or phrases like """"...leaflet campaign, which took the city by storm."""" or """"The effect it had on the first IPL match was fascinating"""" Instead, simply say the result of the leaflet campaign (to the extent verifiable by your source) in a neutral voice eg: """"In preparation for the next IPL match, No Dada No KKR used leaflet and sms campaigns, and purchased tickets off would-be match attendants to encourage boycotting and create artificial scarcity which resulted in lower turnout in the cricket match."""" Note that even this sentence has a problem: 'lower turnout' can't be verified by that source because it would be quoting an obviously biased primary source.
Don't say things like """"greatest ever captain"""", sentences like this are clearly expressing an opinion.
Don't use slang like 'kids'.
Don't discuss the future (WP:FUTURE)

I think the reading which would help you the most are WP:WORDS and WP:NPOV for help with the non-neutral tone of your article and WP:N and WP:RS for properly citing and providing evidence of notability of the group.

Current state of this article
This article still needs more work in my view; it is still too dependent on rumors and tabloid journalism sources.  Its sources are in many cases tabloid newspapers that rely on anonymous sources in their reporting and that convey unsupported rumors.

Frequently, when one tries to update this article with reliable third-party published sources, the updated information is being deleted with what appear to me to be explanations that are not supported by Wikipedia's own policies and guidelines for editing.  The current infobox template is an example; one cannot just make up one's own rules and regulations; the descriptions in the template box for the parameters are explicit.  There is no requirement for """"legal"""" meaning of """"Domestic partnership"""" (""""domestic partner(s)"""") in the parameter of that infobox: Template:Infobox actor; it makes clear that the parameter refers to """"romantic relationships"""" in a more general sense.

After all, Mrs Besant lost her own children in a not-dissimilar way to the circumstances under which Krishnamurti's parents lost him.  I met and talked to Krishnamurti in 1969 in connection with a film at his compound in Santa Barbara, California, and brought up the subject of Leadbeater.  He told me in no uncertain terms, and with uncharacteristic ill-temper, that he would never discuss that man.

 Not to worry...jdorney will not be with Wikipedia much longer. 

I have proved time and again that the corrections I make are 100% accurate and verifiable. I have gone out of my way to provide detailed information on sources and where those sources can be located. In contrast the sources quoted by Jdorney are not only dubious, but are not at all supported by the majority of authors and historians. Jdorney uses two main sources...CAIN and Lost Lives. CAIN is a """"estimation"""" at best, and the US State Dept. Jane's Intelligence, British  Human Rights Watch, the Council On Foreign Relations, and various books and articles...all take issue with CAIN's facts and figures. As for Lost Lives, I have the latest edition of that book, and Jdorney completey fabricates the figures. If one reads carefully from 1969-2005, they see the number given as 86, shown as the amount of UDA and UVF members killed by IRA and INLA units. 85% of that number are given credit soley to the IRA. I wonder if jdorney even has the book, since he misquotes it so often. Similar numbers I have provided as to the number and units of British and Irish killed by the IRA is similarly backed up by Lost Lives...if one actually takes the time to read it throughly. I am not going to respond to any more whiney, and childish messages by jdorney. I have informed Wikipedia staff about his biased and unprofessional behavior, and have recieved back that Wikipedia will look into it. It is sad that Wikipedia has to be hampered by a few biased, purposely innacurate Editors, who ignore facts and make up their own...just to support their own one sided views.

PS. Jdorney can leave more messages for me if he wants, but I will not respond to them, and all will be forwarded to Wikipedia staff for review.

I will also continue to monitor the IRA article and this article, to ensure that the correct facts are not continually changed, by a editor, who I doubt will be with Wikipedia much longer:)""",0

 WikiProject Oregon 

About this editI'm sorry you thought being moved to """"inactive"""" status meant that you had to leave the project. Nothing could be further from the truth. In order to make the membership list easy to maintain, we happen to have created some artificial criteria for the active list and although you certainly contribute a lot to Wikipedia in general, at the time, I couldn't find any participation in Oregon-related articles. In the interests of ease of maintenance of the list (most people show no interest in such a thankless task and have no opinion about how it is managed), I never bothered to inform folks when they had been moved, but that was probably a mistake. Needless to say, you are a very active Oregon Wikipedian, especially in the area of the WikiWednesday group and the legislative stuff, and that certainly counts for a lot.

 regarding a wiki writer 

Regarding the writer at http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html and referenced at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_salute please note the following:  Mr. Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page- as Dr. Curry attempted to correct the many errors). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is """"covered up"""" by people, and those people also often refer to it as the """"Nazi-Soviet"""" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as """"Nazis"""" (they did not refer to themselves as """"Nazis"""").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as """"It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!""""  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word """"Nazi"""" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the “Nazi-Soviet pact” page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase """"National Socialist."""" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made by Professor Curry. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment """"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!""""   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name """"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"""" and also uses the term """"Communist"""" instead of using the term """"Socialist.""""  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether salutes dictate particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide including in Germany. 

    Yes, the """"Roman salute"""" page did once contain inaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to blabber with his use of the term """"conspiracy."""" It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.   The John Seigenthaler story from Brian Chase is another notorious example of Wikipedia’s untrustworthiness.  On Wikipedia, the intellectually dishonest administrators block people who tell the truth, so it is specious to say that truth-tellers simply need to correct the articles.

"Stub category names 

You keep saying that, but it flies in the face of facts on the ground in a large number of cases, and especially of all recent trends at SFR and /P.  In fact, if I recall correctly, you seemed perfectly happy with a number of such renames yourself: dare I say, until it started to impinge upon the geo-stubs.

"What gives you the right to control/edit Wikipedia?

Or are you a self-appointed, sad individual who cannot 'make-it' in the real world and feels that you must be the 'big guy' on the internet? You are the epitome of what is wrong with Wikipedia. 

The fact that this comment has been undone and you made threats to 'ban' its author rather proves the point: no comment can be made against the Wikipedia 'Nazis.'

Yes, those are two reverts; however, the 1RR restriction on myself was only in regards to Canadian monarchy articles, and PoC's edits, not to other pages or other editors. Now, though I was technically within my bounds there, having later read MangoJuice's comments to PoC on reverting and entitlement, I realise that the same applies to myself, and would have applied earlier. That second revert was a kneejerk retaliation to a move that was purposefully irritating, and, though technically allowed, was just a continuation of a dispute, rather than an effort to seek resolution.

Wikipedia should not take sides and especially Wikipedia should not say that UNESCO, Britannica etc aree wrong.

If Britannica or UNESCO etc said that they were dialects, then they could be treated as such. No neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. Why should they be treated as such. Every neutral source says that Arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title.

"NIHH Science Update • December 15, 2010

Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore led by Mikhail Pletnikov developed the mouse model used in this study by inserting a gene with a mutation known to be associated in humans with schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. They used a technique that allows them to turn the gene on and off at desired time points during brain development. In earlier research, mice with the gene, mhDISC1 (mutant human disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1) showed effects on social behavior and mood which differed depending on the sex of the mice, and the age at which the gene was active. The study shows brain development is more complex than originally thought and the argument between nature v. nature is not an easy question. The mutated gene has more control than originally thought.

 Lesbian and Dyke (slang) articles  

Hello, Lionhead99. If you have checked the edit history of the Lesbian article before, which I believe that you have, you will see that your edits were reverted twice at that article, once by , with me elaborating on Wikiwind's revert for why your edits were reverted, and now by me. Those edit summaries clearly explain why you were reverted. Waiting a month later to restore most of it does not change the issue with your edit. It's not like most people who were watching an article stop watching it a month later and aren't going to notice what is mostly the same change that they objected to before. 

As I've stated, the lead isn't saying that being lesbian is a choice; it's saying whether or not to identify as lesbian is a choice; sexual identity is not always the same as sexual orientation, which I explained to a different person in September of this year on the Lesbian talk page. Your edits, among other things, removed material that addresses the important ways that the term """"lesbian"""" is used, material that is partly a summary of the Sexuality and lesbian identity section. Per WP:LEAD, the lead is supposed to """"summarize the most important points—including any prominent controversies."""" Partially because """"lesbian"""" is often not consistently defined in the same way by women who use the term to describe their sexuality, it often is not consistently defined in the same way by researchers (see page 22). The Lesbian article is a big article; so it, of course, makes sense that its lead is four paragraphs, which is the advised limit for the lead. Leads may or may not include sources, as what is in the lead should be sourced in the lower body of the article and since sourcing the lead is a case-by-case matter. See Wikipedia:Lead#Citations. And WP:OVERLINKING is not good.

It should also help that  changed the """"About""""/disambiguation tag to identify that this article is not just about sexual orientation: """"This article is about the term Lesbian and female homosexuality. For the sexual orientation in general, see Homosexuality.""""

I also reverted you at the Dyke (slang) article, because, """"The term is not always pejorative anymore, as the lead notes. 'Dyke' is used very often among gay and bisexual-identified women without negative connotation. 'Sissy' or 'faggot' not as much to the same extent by gay men.""""   """,0

That link has interviews with family members who are on record with their real names.  I think that's definitive.

Second, her """"privacy"""" should not be the concern of wikipedia.  For one, as a porn star, she is showing her body to the world; the concept of """"privacy"""" is quaint.  If Wikipedia was so concerned about respecting privacy"""" wishes, and not adding anything at all unless it's 100% certain, then large parts of the Satoshi Nakamoto article should be deleted as well.

Finally, she is only notable because her real name was revealed publicly.  And if Wikipedia is unwilling to reveal her name, then this article has no reason to exist.  Delete it.

You're right that speed cameras and lowered speed limits are an excellent way of taking the glamour out of motoring, and I fully support them for that reason despite the temporary rise in accidents that they cause.  In the long run, as people are made to use sustainable, safer transport, this policy will save far more lives than it costs, and so I can't see how anyone but the most militant, reckless petrolhead would oppose it.

I'm too busy to pool resources for the moment, but I will be adding some pages to my site in the near future about this important topic, and I will announce here when I have done so.  I am also thinking about setting up a separate campaign site to make people aware of this often-overlooked benefit of cameras and other anti-car measures.  But we need to be careful because as you say, it's necessary to operate in """"stealth mode"""" for the moment and pretend that the cameras/limits/etc are for short-term safety in order to stop Daily Wail readers and selfish cagers from moaning about being endangered by them (their deaths would arguably be beneficial to humanity, but that's another discussion).

I would also encourage you to subscribe to uk.rec.cycling.moderated, which has been set up in part to stop cagers from pointing out the dangers presented by cameras (although technically correct, such arguments are disallowed on URCM in the interest of long-term road safety, which is clearly a good thing; it was difficult to oppose those arguments on uk.rec.cycling, which frustrated some of us, hence the need for uk.rec.cycling.moderated in order to suppress them).

Larry Sanger has the same diagnosis that i do. I have more to offer
in terms of how to solve the problem. But not whilst being blocked
by trolls and their pet admins for making the effort.

""""Wikipedia has, to its credit, done something about the most serious trolling and other kinds of abuse: there is an Arbitration Committee that provides a process whereby the most disruptive users of Wikipedia can be ejected from the project. 

But there are myriad abuses and problems that never make it to mediation, let alone arbitration. A few of the project's participants can be, not to put a nice word on it, pretty nasty. And this is tolerated. So, for any person who can and wants to work politely with well-meaning, rational, reasonably well-informed peoplewhich is to say, to be sure, most people working on Wikipediathe constant fighting can be so off-putting as to drive them away from the project. This explains why I am gone; it also explains why many others, including some extremely knowledgeable and helpful people, have left the project. 

The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problemor I, at least, regard it as a problemwhich explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist (which would, in this context, mean excluding the unwashed masses), it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.) 

I need not recount the history of how this nascent policy eventually withered and died. Ultimately, it became very clear that the most active and influential members of the projectbeginning with Jimmy Wales, who hired me to start a free encyclopedia project and who now manages Wikipedia and Wikimediawere decidedly anti-elitist in the above-described sense. 

Consequently, nearly everyone with much expertise but little patience will avoid editing Wikipedia, because they willat least if they are editing articles on articles that are subject to any sort of controversybe forced to defend their edits on article discussion pages against attacks by nonexperts. This is not perhaps so bad in itself. But if the expert should have the gall to complain to the community about the problem, he or she will be shouted down (at worst) or politely asked to """"work with"""" persons who have proven themselves to be unreasonable (at best). 

This lack of respect for expertise explains the first problem, because if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, they would have long since invited a board of academics and researchers to manage a culled version of Wikipedia (one that, I think, would not directly affect the way the main project is run). But because project participants have such a horror of the traditional deference to expertise, this sort of proposal has never been taken very seriously by most Wikipedians leading the project now. And so much the worse for Wikipedia and its reputation. 

This lack of respect for expertise and authority also explains the second problem, because again if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, there would necessarily be very little patience for those who deliberately disrupt the project. This is perhaps not obvious, so let me explain. To attact and retain the participation of experts, there would have to be little patience for those who do not understand or agree with Wikipedia's mission, or even for those pretentious mediocrities who are not able to work with others constructively and recognize when there are holes in their knowledge (collectively, probably the most disruptive group of all). A less tolerant attitude toward disruption would make the project more polite, welcoming, and indeed open to the vast majority of intelligent, well-meaning people on the Internet. As it is, there are far fewer genuine experts involved in the project (though there are some, of course) than there could and should be. 

It will probably be objected by some that, since I am not 100% committed to the most radical sort of openness, I do not understand why the project that I founded works: it works, I will be told, precisely because it is radically openeven anarchical. 

I know, of course, that Wikipedia works because it is radically open. I recognized that as soon as anyone; indeed, it was part of the original plan. But I firmly disagree with the notion that that Wikipedia-fert",0

 Crocus olivieri istanbulensis 

Dear Rivertorch,

This taxon is one on the three subspecies of Crocus olivieri.
Its correct name is Crocus olivieri Gray subsp. istanbulensis B. Mathew. I have corrected it. 

I hope the anonymous user will not change it again.

Best regards,  (To reply) 

Hi Réginald. If you hadn't arrived on the scene, I was going to ping you. I removed the Turkish image and link, since I didn't think they were germane, but I left it to you to fix the taxonomic details. Does Mathew's classification, as it appears in the article, contain all the known species of crocus?   

Hi River,
The page contains all the recorded species, but not the infraspecific taxa (i.e., the numerous subspecies). Originally Crocus olivieri subsp. istanbulensis was for this reason not included. For consistency reason including it required to mention also -as I did- the two other subspecies olivieri and balansae.
The issue is: if we want to be fully consistent we have to mention also all recorded subspecies (with their distribution as for that of C. olivieri?), among others the numerous subspecies of the variable C. biflorus. A niggling work! I am afraid that the page will become too scholastic.
Your advice about this issue?
Best regards,  (To reply) 
PS: You can find a quite complete list of species and their subspecies on the NCBI taxonomy browser. Type """"Crocus"""" in the """"search for"""" bar.  (To reply) 

Thanks for the link—that's a great resource. I don't think we should worry about its being too scholastic. My main concern would be with consistency: I'm not sure if there are comparable articles that also list all subspecies. The information about subspecies certainly should be available on Wikipedia, but should it go in the main article or in the more specific articles about each species (of which there are now only a few). I don't know.   
For consistency reasons I have added the other subspecies reported in the NCBI taxonomy and cited the source. I agree that additional paragraphs or articles should be written for the most representative species, in which a detailed description of their subspecies would then be done (as e.g. I have done in fr:Crocus).  (To reply) 
Okay. I'd be happy to help with creating new articles and refining translations, if you want to go that route. Just remember I don't know what I'm talking about ;-)    

Dear River,
I have removed again the the logo of the Sultanbeyli District Municipality, that User:Terzinator had added again to Crocus, explaining the reason for doing it (see User talk:Terzinator). Hopefully, he/she will not add it again!
Best regards,  (To reply) 
Thanks, Réginald. I don't do edit wars, so I'm glad there's someone else diligently watching the page. I see that the image appears to lack any copyright info or fair-use claims. I try to avoid any involvement with enforcement of image policies, but if it gets added again I will see if it can be deleted on those grounds.

The Battle of Tulifinny 
The date is December 9, 1864, and the place is Tulifinny Creek. Citadel cadets joined with cadets from their sister academy, the Arsenal in Columbia, to form the Battalion of State Cadets. This was different from the Cadet Company. They had been ordered to protect the Tulifinny trestle of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad. The mural depicts the cadets repulsing the attack.

""""Before long, firing sounded in Charlestonthe shots that were to blast in pieces this tenurial Southern existence. Grimmer and blacker for the South, the war years rolled slowly on. And on November 30, 1864, there occurred near Grahamville the battle of Honey Hill. For Beaufort District, it meant the beginning of the end. 
Many stories of this battle have been told and written. An authentic and complete account was written in 1899 by Captain Ben Williams, of Brunson, who was a participant, was then adjutant of his regiment. His articles were published in the News and Courier and in the Hampton County Guardian. 
Outnumbered five to one, a little band of South Carolina cavalry, infantry and Citadel cadets faced a Federal naval expedition which had advanced up Broad River and disembarked at Boyd’s landing (or Salvesberg, the local name). The enemy’s destination was Grahamville Depot; their real objective the destruction of the railway track according to Sherman’s orders. 
With seven guns, a well-built breastwork, and the superb strategy of Colonel Charles Jones Colcock, who commanded the Third Military District of the state, the little Confederate band inflicted on the invaders losses amounting to nearly 8oo in a few action-packed hours. Colonel Colcock was everywhere, according to other officers. He even enlisted a strong, blowing wind on his side, having his men to fire a field of broomstraw, so that the flames were hurled into the faces of the enemy at a critical moment. Reinforcements of Georgia Reserves arrived from Savannah hours later, under General Gustavus W. Smith, but the general refused to take over the actual command from one whose ability and success had proved so outstanding. Tales have been told by many elderly local people of the surrounding roads literally running with Negro blood, because more than half the Federal force was made up of Negro regiments trained at Hilton Head. """"You could walk on dead Negroes for miles,"""" they declared. Old manuscripts tell further of bodies hastily buried in trenches; of later washing rains exposing a gruesome welter of arms and legs. These bodies later received decent burial in the Federal cemetery at Beaufort. 
An interesting side light on this battle is the fact that a local Negro, Allen Orr, participated. (He was proud of his service on the Confederate side). As a teen-age boy he went into this battle in which so many of his race were slain, """"Went with a white friend to take care of the horses."""" He lived until a few years ago. At the age of 100 years-plus, he enjoyed giving a pantomime of the manner in which he dodged behind the breastwork as the bullets were flying. The breastwork is evident for all to see. A number of cannon balls have been excavated at the site.""""""",0

 Any chance of a return to Good Article status? 

Talk:Harley-Davidson/GA1

When this review was done, the reasons for stripping this article of its """"Good Article"""" status were as follows:
Prose quality: Too many orphan sentences and single sentence paragraphs.
MoS compliance: Introduction is too short, see WP:LEAD for more info. Introduction should be a summary of the entire article, and generally should not contain information which is not contained within the body. One of the images contains a watermark for a website. 
Citation of reliable sources where necessary: Large areas of uncited information. Orphan sentences only complicate the issue of finding what comes from which source. Article is littered with tags and rough edits.
 No original research: Uncited information may contain original research.

Since that time, the introduction has been expanded, the offending watermark has been cropped out of the image (which had been donated under the appropriate licence by the site in question), and citations have been added, though maybe not enough.

The peer reviewer tool came up with the following concerns:
Consider adding more links to the article; per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links) and Wikipedia:Build the web, create links to relevant articles.
Per Wikipedia:What is a featured article?, Images should have concise captions.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (numbers), there should be a non-breaking space -   between a number and the unit of measurement. For example, instead of 45 cubic inch, use 45 cubic inch, which when you are editing the page, should look like: 45 cubic inch.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), headings generally do not start with articles ('the', 'a(n)'). For example, if there was a section called ==The Biography==, it should be changed to ==Biography==.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), headings generally should not repeat the title of the article. For example, if the article was Ferdinand Magellan, instead of using the heading ==Magellan's journey==, use ==Journey==.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), avoid using special characters (ex: &+{}[]) in headings.
Per WP:WIAFA, this article's table of contents (ToC) may be too long – consider shrinking it down by merging short sections or using a proper system of daughter pages as per Wikipedia:Summary style.
#The script has spotted the following contractions: Didn't, if these are outside of quotations, they should be expanded. (A search of the article found the use of """"didn't"""" in a quote of a reference.)

We should also keep an eye on WP:SIZERULE, which indicates that we should probably split this article.  Granted, the 91 kB size is a gross figure and the readable prose would be somewhat less, but splitting off and summarizing the History and Engines sections might be advisable.  

The Model Designations section could also use some work.

O.K., folks, are we up to it?

 BUSH AND JFK 

The recent 50th anniversary upsurge in Kennedy assasination interest and the imminent releast of classified information in 2017 has caused many conspiracy theories to be re-examined.  More often GHW Bush's name is linked as a conspirator and funder of the conspiracy.  His favoring of Nixon at the time and his oil interests superficially endorse this theory, as does the depth of Nixon's corrupt and dupklicitous influence on those close to him.

I feel the biog needs to highlight this aspect of GHWB's career, especially as both Bush presidents were such avid war-mongers their financial interests must have relied heavily on the """"military-industrial"""" influence that Eisenhower warned the nation against.  Bush's attitudes to war in the middle east directly reflects the false policies which prolonged the Vietnam war.""",0

 Main page appearance: Henry Cornelius Burnett 

This is a note to let the main editors of Henry Cornelius Burnett know that the article will be appearing as today's featured article on January 20, 2012. You can view the TFA blurb at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/January 20, 2012. If you prefer that the article appear as TFA on a different date, or not at all, please ask featured article director  or his delegate , or start a discussion at Wikipedia talk:Today's featured article/requests. If the previous blurb needs tweaking, you might change it—following the instructions at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/instructions. If this article needs any attention or maintenance, it would be preferable if that could be done before its appearance on the Main Page. The blurb as it stands now is below:

Henry Cornelius Burnett (1825–1866) was a U.S. Representative from the state of Kentucky and a Confederate States Senator. He represented Kentucky's 1st congressional district during the lead-up to the Civil War. This district contained the entire Jackson Purchase region of the state, which was more sympathetic to the Confederate cause than any other area of Kentucky. Burnett promised the voters of his district that he would have President Abraham Lincoln arraigned for treason. Besides championing the Southern cause in Congress, Burnett also worked within Kentucky to bolster the state's support of the Confederacy. He presided over a sovereignty convention in Russellville in 1861 that formed a Confederate government for the state. The delegates to this convention chose Burnett to travel to Richmond, Virginia to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. Burnett also raised a Confederate regiment at Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and briefly served in the Confederate States Army. Burnett's actions were deemed treasonable by his colleagues in Congress, and he was expelled from the House in 1861. After the war, he was indicted for treason, but was never tried. He returned to the practice of law, but died of cholera in 1866 at the age of 40. (more...)

"""==Correct and True Etymology of English words """"Myth, Mythology""""==
Greek μυθολογια """"legend, storytelling"""" is derived from μυθος """"speech, thought, story, myth"""", itself of unknown origin. English mythology is in use since the 15th century, in the meaning """"an exposition of myths"""". The current meaning of """"body of myths"""" itself dates to 1781 (OED). The adjective mythical dates to 1678; English use of myth is later, first attested in 1830, in its original English meaning of """"untrue story"""":

""""These two stories are very good illustrations of the origin of myths, by means of which, even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous history."""" Westminster Review 12:44 (1830)

This is the earliest known usage of """"myth"""" in English. In case anyone didn't know, in 1830 English """"fabulous"""" doesn't mean """"wonderfully aesthetic"""", it is the adjectival form of """"fable"""", that is referring to a fantasy or fairytale.  In 1830 the term """"myth"""" was new, so it carries what we call a gloss, things """"by means of which even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous (i.e., fictional) history."""".  This was not only the original use of the word, but the original academic use of the word, note the source, Westminster Review. That is still the way most all people define """"myth"""" today.  It's for reasons like this, that Wikipedia is so notorious for its mental disconnect with mainstream thought, and its enforced use of its own internal terminology / jargon, or to put it less nicely, doublespeak.  (ውይይት) 

In 2005, a single-purpose account added """"mythology categories"""" to a wide range of articles including Death and Resurrection of Jesus, Virgin Birth, and Transubstantiation, creating a huge uproar.  The outcome of the discussions then was overwhelmingly to reject the categories as imflammatory and inappropriate.  It was agreed at that time that theological and scriptural articles do not fall into the category of """"mythology"""" and today, none of these articles are so categorised, apart from Noah's Ark.  

Just last month, WP:RELIGION undertook to move the article """"Yoruba mythology"""" to Yoruba religion.  This is because the term """"mythology"""" is held to be demeaning, because Yoruba religion is still practised today, and the Yoruba who practice it constitute a significant viewpoint.    It is indeed regrettable that so much resistance is facing the prospect of extending the same consideration to the canonical Book of Genesis.  The Churches have drawn the line by indicating which books they consider canonical, inspired texts.  Genesis is among them with no exceptions as far as I know. What gives Wikipedia the right to draw the line so as to exclude other Biblical Books from """"mythology"""", but include the stories of Genesis?  No books that are considered sacred scripture by ANY large religion of today should be portrayed as """"mythology"""".  That's simple common sense.  We shouldn't call the Quran """"mythology"""" either, we shouldn't call anyone's sacred books widely adhered to today """"mythology"""".    (ውይይት) 

Now things like Hesiod and Orpheus are another story, I think the reason Hesiod and Orpheus have conventionally been referred to as """"mythology"""" for some time is because no significant numbers of people have ever come forward claiming to believe these books to be historical or literally true since the year 400.  At least I will go out on a limb and say I don't know of any, not a single one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's pretty safe to say they have been discarded, and nobody objects to the conventional use of """"mythology"""" for these.  But please realize that this is not the case with Christian, Muslim or Bahai writings, nor indeed the writings of many other living religions.  (ውይይት)

"""::: Cparker, I don't know what you did after 2006, but if anyone else has this kind of issue, I would suggest you consider the lap band instead. It does not require the drastic re-sectioning of your organs that is done in roux en y/gastric bypass. In the surgery, you lose more than a foot of your small intestine that you can't get back and that is necessary if it is connected to the stomach in its normal position; the area where that connection originally occurred is closed off by sutures; the area of your stomach that is stapled creates a bifurcated stomach that cannot be reopened - it is completely irreversible. This is a complete and permanent lifestyle and physiological change that should never be taken lightly. See my comments in other comment sections on this page about about the difference between your pre- and post-surgical life. You will be on a diet for life - you will not be returning to your prior eating habits, and as I mention above, you may not even want to. Your tastebuds will change. Your nutritional needs will be re-prioritized. You still have to actively pursue the weight loss - it isn't that they cut your stomach down and you eat what you want and lose weight - that is not how it works at all. You will be nauseated after the surgery - mine lasted for the two and a half months during which I was on pureed food only - I begged people to pray for me, it was so bad, but once I was back on solid food, it went away. That may have been unique to me. There are many problems that occur with everyone, but some will be unique to you. My program made me do 6 months of supervised 1,500 calorie a day diet and exercise (as much as I could with other conditions hampering me), and prior to that my PCP and I tried a similar program ourselves. So there is no """"trying it out"""" - you are either in the program or not. But I can tell you, after almost a decade of obesity caused by medications I take for other conditions (and to be honest, exacerbated by over-eating for the first time in my life, also a side-effect of those meds), I have lost about 55 lbs. in the 5 months since my surgery. Seeing the scale keep going down and down is a good feeling. With the surgery, it happens quickly at first and then slows down, with the lap band it's just the opposite. Make sure you are totally informed before you make a choice, and choose your surgeon and their program wisely. Do your homework. Plus, they have screening methods, also, to make sure you are not wasting their time. You will be given a psychological evaluation - similar to having plastic surgery - to make sure you understand the risks, the benefits, the amount of involvement you play in your weight loss journey, and if you are ready for it.

Moved here from User talk:208.81.184.4  208.81.184.4   
I'm not asking for an apology for your deletions of my honest, good faith, truthful efforts to contribute to Wikipedia at Mormon blogosphere (I'll just chalk this up to you being a little overbearing and unintentionally a bully.)  Please stop referring me to another article without answering my honest question.  Refusing to provide a simple explanation is harmful to relationships between two honest people and doesn't help anyone involved with a disagreement on WP. Please keep in mind that I am a person with feelings too, and being gang-tackled for a good faith effort on my part causes hurt feelings on the my end as well.  I hope this provides a more clear explanation why a person may lash out when he feels gang-tackled by Wikipedia editors without a quick, clear, concise explanation (should you do this to someone else in the future.)  Once again, I'll chalk this up to poor communications, rather than any malice on your part.    
Really?!? After you said """"Why should I listen to you anyway"""" it was pretty clear you didn't want me to answer you, so others stepped in; now you're blaming me for your behavior and the other people responses, and calling me a bully? All anyone here and your talk page was trying to do was help you. Please don't expect any other communication from me at this time, and stay off of User talk:208.81.184.4, as I'm going to completely wp:DISENGAGE from you.  208.81.184.4  """,0

Maybe you should talk to some GMs and ask about me. The self-agrandizing comment was removed and I did not really think it mattered to credit myself since I am one of the only ones to have analysed it this intensely aside from Wind. Maybe you should have looked at the content rather than judging my personality. Wikipedia is about content and you are not the judge of that. You should look at my site. Look at the beautiful puzzles I created. You should look over the analysis with a computer. You should notice that I am not the only one that points out that the Pinski line is not a refutation. You are afraid of being wrong. The Halloween is sound in practical chess. If god was to play who knows and who cares. But Houdini vs Carlsen and Houdini has the white side and my analysis I will take my analysis any day. That is why coorespondence is usually a good citation. But really look over the puzzles and the analysis. It really is a work of art. If you care about chess you would do it. But I think you care more about not being wrong. You insert POV that it is refuted. This is a lie. A very very obvious lie. I would post this on their talk but I seriously dont care. I care about the beauty of chess and of my own work. If I wanted to be a GM I would have been but its not an ego thrill for me. All I care about is the beauty of the game and I believe my puzzles express just that.,0

Each barangay is headed by a barangay captain (punong barangay) i.e. the district mayor, who leads the barangay council (sangguniang barangay) composed of barangay councilors (kagawad). Every barangay also has a Youth Council (""""Sangguniang Kabataan"""" or """"SK"""") composed of the SK President or Chairman and SK Councilors, who direct the youth-oriented activities, such as basketball leagues and other youth oriented activities, in the barangay.

Historically, a barangay is a relatively small community of around 50 to 100 families. Most villages have only thirty to one hundred houses and the population varies from one hundred to five hundred persons. According to Legazpi, he found communities with twenty to thirty people only. Many coastal villages in the Visayan region consisted of no more than eight to ten houses. The word itself is derived from an ancient Malay boat called a balangay.

Neutrality tag
The tagged section is not only neutral, it is primary verification of what JfJ claim to believe. It would be very odd indeed if the communism article did not reference communist sources for what communists believe. The section states what JfJ believe, it makes no claims about what Wiki believes, nor what the editor who put it there believes, nor what a reader should believe. It is therefore an verifiable NPOV reporting of a group that is itself obviously not neutral. My reading of this article is that although technically neutral in its presentation, it starts by presenting all the negative views of JfJ. That does not seem logical.

You are making a big mistake on Bitcoin: You removed my reliable source.

On the other hand it is also true that there may be many millions of USD (it is a big economy) worth of bitcoins present today in Russia on computers owned by Russians since they bought them from and paid for them in Russian Roubles on exchanges accessible to them outside Russia - and that this practice most probably would continue with an equivalent increase in the number and value of bitcoins inside Russia.

 Official Notice 

I am posting this here, per WP:ADMINABUSE, as evidence that I have taken the step of attempting to resolve the situation by talking directly with the administrator in question. I have been here just under 2 months. I have made well over 1000 good contributions to this project, and until this incident, enjoyed my time here very much. This has been a nightmare, and I very much wish to put it behind me. However, as a matter of principle, I feel I must continue to do what I feel is right, even though it would be much easier to just drop this, and even though I have very little chance of ultimate success. I realize that to err is human. I'm not looking for your head on a platter. I'm not even looking for an apology. I too, am human, and far from perfect. In the time since the incident, I have not conducted myself in the most appropriate manner. The fact is, that while I may very well owe an explanation, and/or apology for some of it, it has nothing to do with the original block. You mentioned the fact that several other administrators declined to unblock me. Without veering off into another topic, as far as why that is only partly true, the fact is that this is not about what any other administrator has or hasn't done. You were the one who blocked me, and it is only you from whom I can request accountability. In earlier comments, you've made it quite clear that you are willing to be held accountable before your fellow administrators. I however, am asking that hold yourself accountable for your actions to me; the common user, who was affected by a decision that you made. It remains my position, as I have said before, that I did not deserve to be blocked. You blocked me for violating WP:3RR. 3RR clearly states that the removal of BLP violations is an exception to the rule. Furthermore, you stated on my talk page, that I """"should have stopped reverting, and attempted to gain consensus"""" on the talk page. WP:BLP states that violations """"should be removed immediately, without waiting for discussion."""" My actions were in line with WP:BLP, and did not violate WP:3RR. Therefore, I am formally, and respectfully, asking that you acknoweledge that although acting in good faith, you erred in judgement when you blocked me. I thank you for your time, and await your response.   """,0

"Re:Mere Rubbish ==
I also think it is mere rubbish but I also think it is not completely rubbish. According to the southeast asian history, most of the ancient rulers of this region are Hindus, some rulers came from Persia (map covered Middle east, Greece, west India - Achaemenid Empire, Seleucid Empire, Parthian Empire and Sassanid Dynasty, please look at the size of the map their conquered). Kedah is a good example where the king from Persia came and eventually he built a kingdom.

In the old days, it was slavery society (no sultanate and no democracy yet), all Hindu rulers belong to higher class, common peoples and the natives belong to inferior slave class. The Hindus rulers came from India and Persia and they ruled most of the southeast asia, they called themselves high class peoples, the rest are merely slaves. Parameswara is a Hindu ruler, he is one of the descendants of the Hindu royal family that belong to higher class of Hinduism.

As for the Macedonian bloodline, this is also not completely rubbish. In the old days, the Persian empire was so big, they are so proud with king Alexander the Great. Also, they ruled some of the southeast asian lands such as the Angkor, Pasai, etc. Parameswara later married Pasai's princess and adopted Persian Shah and claimed as descendant of Alexander the Great, I don't think all this is completely rubbish.

Anyway, please correct me, I may be wrong too.

Please read the relevant guideline, which is WP:EL.  Basically, there is no way to add that link.  We are not a linking site.  The only way that link could possibly appear would be if Dedalo were itself notable enough for an article.  This would only be if Dedalo had been discussed, several times, significantly, in reliable, independent sources.  So, if there are news articles or trade journals that discuss Dedalo (please note that press releases don't count), then we could consider making an article on Dedalo. If Dedalo does not rise to that level of importance, then it's somewhat possible that there could be a discussion of """"software used for ICH"""" in the ICH article.  You should discuss that with other editor's on that articles talk page.  You'll still need at least one reference in a reliable source to include the info, and you will not be able to add a direct link to the Dedalo website.  
Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that Wikipedia articles should have as few links as possible, and those links have to be absolutely critical to the topic at hand.  Sure, many articles violate this rule, but they're not supposed to.   """,0

 Please reconsider taking a break

I really think more progress would be made (in arriving at a community decision supported — and enforced — by ArbCom, as well as in getting the injunction lifted) if the named parties all removed themselves from the situation.

As for my comments about your son, I did NOT mean to imply that his trying out to be a SEAL was important to you and nobody else.  If I'd meant that, I'd have written it that way.  I don't like sarcasm or veiled insults, and prefer the more direct variety.  If I'm not writing mean things to you, then you can be sure I'm not thinking mean thoughts about you when I write whatever I do write.  I think in at least that one aspect of things, we have pretty similar views, and I definitely respect you for being able to shrug off insults.

Sorry, my bad. In response to the query you left on my talk page, some specific (but by no means the only) examples which I found problematic are:
""""However, a significantly smaller group of people know the name and person behind the images. The fame and fortune of artists are notoriously mercurial; Grossman's personal profile is demonstrably due a raise.""""
""""Ceaselessly toiling in the field of illustration since the 1960s, Grossman has amassed an impressive, enormous body of work...""""
""""At a separate website, which may be accessed through his main site, T-shirts bearing Grossman's designs are available.""""
The first and third of those should probably be removed altogether - it isn't the purpose of Wikipedia to raise Grossman's profile, nor to sell his t-shirts. The second could be made more neutral by changing it to:
""""Having worked in the field of illustration since the 1960s, Grossman has amassed an sizeable body of work...""""
Also, several sections of the article (""""Painter"""", """"Sculptor"""", """"These days"""") don't cite any sources, so things like:
""""surveying four decades of Grossman creations, one finds that """"the awkward, early work"""" and the """"tired, later work"""" simply don't exist.""""
have a tendancy to read like your own personal opinions. The article as a whole seems to paint a rosy picture of Grossman, but I don't see much in the way of critical assessment of his work. I would say in general that you need to be wary of WP:NPOV, WP:NOR and WP:V.

"I am a little surprised and shocked at the tone of ALoan's follow-up.  This is a very large discussion and it would be quite surprising if I had succeeded in noticing and replying to every single edit by every single participant.  Now that I do see ALoan's request, however, I do not feel motivated to add a further elaboration.  The observation that Ghirlandajo has been inflicting disruptive behavior on Wikipedians for well over a year is well documented elsewhere (and I suspect that ALoan is aware of this because he refers to the application for arbitration).  The observation that Giano's accusations were absurd and extremely damaging is almost a truism and I've cited those accusations enough to establish the point for those who are capable of agreement with it.

 The idea that I was somehow involved in a dispute of some kind with either Ghirlandajo or Giano is something that they have both pushed very hard, so I'm not surprised that there are people who believe this to be the case.  It is, however, untrue.  I was only involved to the extent that any good administrator attempts to maintain order on the wiki and prevent other editors from disrupting it for their own endsin this case, an apparent vendetta and shrieking campaign against other editors.

 I take no satisfaction in Giano's announcement of his departure, but nor am I responsible for it.  He had clearly made up his mind that some of its day-to-day running was in the hands of people of almost indescribably gross moral turpitude, and he did not shrink from stating this opinion at length.  In the circumstances, his departure was inevitable.  Tony Sidaway",0

 polyandry in Tibet 

Hi there. On 30 September 2005 you made a number of significant additions to this article, which have survived to this day, or would have, save for my undoing them:
Marcus S. Goldstein, whom you introduced to the text by explicit wiwilink as quoted here, as well as further described with his birth and death years in parentheses that followed, is not the Goldstein in question. The correct anthropologist is Melvyn C. Goldstein, born 1938, current co-director of The Center for Research on Tibet at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.
At least your addition of the characterization of polyandry in Tybet as being """"exceedingly rare"""" presently is, I'm sorry to say, unsupported by literature available already in 2001: See the PhD dissertation linked in its entirety from the Center's web archive of publications and other work on polyandry and family. 
I have corrected some of the above and made significant fixes in the Sources section, and  in the Polish-language version I prepared, the factual content reads correctly. The English-language version is still in need of attention, especially the inclusion of text documenting the revival of polyandry in Tibet de facto, which took place after communes fell by the wayside in China, and is blooming today, despite recent campaigns by the Chinese authorities to implement population control in rural Tibet from 1996 on. I'd like to see you redeem some of those earlier unfortunate and long-persisting mistakes of yore by lending a hand in bringing this article to a higher level of quality.

 How to Get the Wiki-Astrology Page Back Online & Honest 

One of the best ways to get the Astrology Page back to good use was mentioned by Chris Brennan, who wisely thought that a Wiki-project on Astrology would help. I agree with Chris. Astrology is most likely the oldest, and best documented science in the history of humankind, leading to the invention of mathematics, medicine, and many other disciplines taken for granted by conventional science. Moreover, the history of astrology is also well-documented, even in the United States, where it must be remembered that it is an historical fact that the Founding Fathers of the U.S. not only practiced astrology, but used its principles to set, and then build Washington D.C., aligning the capital with the fixed stars in the constellation Virgo. The expert astrologers, and those with the knowledge base have worked hard, and seriously to improve the page; however, the arguments that seek to """"debase"""" astrology from a POV has disrupted the Wiki-Astrology page based on the failure to not accept historical facts while promoting a """"pseudo-science"""" viewpoint designed to blot out over 5,000 years of historical and scientific fact. A balance, with facts, surely can proceed, and Chris Brennan's idea of a project would help to combine diversifed views into cohesive subject matter that seeks to enlighten the mind, rather than to darken it. Welcoming views that seek to expand the knowledge base, rather than to shrink it through personal POV, is the best course. """,0

And it was all such a great waste, for when the self-proclaimed tête d'armée was done, France's """"losses were permanent"""" and she """"began to slip from her position as the leading power in Europe to second-class status—that was Bonaparte's true legacy.""""[10]"""".... Please remove.... 

 Please sign your talk posts; and please place new threads at the bottom of the page.
 As to your comment, it is a direct quotation, and therefore not suppposed to be neutral; after all, it is in a section of the article that describes conflicting views about Napoleon. It is an accurate portrayal of one of those conflicting points of view.   (talk) 

Ah, yes, but we probably need a quotation from another view that conflicts it. Would anyone be able to find one? |heru|nar 

Some comments regarding France's utter defeat in the Napoleonic Wars should be part of the article, nonetheless. The fact that France slipped from being the top European power to a secondary level, clearly below Britain's and soon also below Germany's and even Austria's, is hardly contentious. It must be remembered that the Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars came hard on the heels of what appeared to Europe's intellectuals as Britain's final, unavoiding loss of great power status, following the independence of the U.S. (just six years before the assault on the Bastille)  
Actually France was the dominate continental power until the Franco-Prussian war and remains a great power to this day.  

 I must respectfully disagree with this latest assertion, since France was smaller in size and less influential than both Austria and Russia before the Prussian war. Even if one were to concede that it was the main """"continental"""" power, that would imply a loss of status - before the Napoleonic Wars, it was the main European power, including Britain, and had beaten combined enemy armies time and time again. As for keeping great power status to this day, I'm sure that that should come as great surprise to the French, humiliated by Nazi occupation and resolutely defeated both in Vietnam and Algeria. Now, it's true they can veto stuff in the UN - just like the (then) underdeveloped island of Taiwan did until 1973, for whatever that's worth. 
Aussiesta who cares about your stupid POV? you are telling nonsense. nazi humiliation etc, pff. weren't the US humiliated in vietnam, in cuba and now in iraq? so they aren't great anymore then right? didn't the soviet retreated from afghanistan? what about them? the german were defeated and occupied in 1918 and 1945 what about them? what about the old good british? they were wiped by the germans in the campaigns of 1939 (Norway) then 1940 (France) and Dunkirk, a defeat transformed into a great victory, what a joke! actually in indochina and algeria the french had 10 times less casualties than their opponents, is this a defeat? a defeat is supposed to happen when one is loosing a war not when he is winning it. these two decolonization wars were wasted by politics. the very same happened in the overlooked Suez Crisis of 1956. the british surrendered there. they left their french and israeli """"allies"""" without warning. ever heard about the Madagasacar war of independence? no? why? because france smashed the rebellion in a such violent way there are ashamed of. no one knows what happened in madagascar in 1946 so it is not in history books. moreover france is still a great power with remaining overseas territories and a strong nuclear force (the third one in terms of warheads after russia and usa) your beloved austrian and german doesn't have. so watch your tongue. quoting a non neutral POV is just the same as giving your own opinion. who do you think you can fool with your francophobic tricks?

"""SOME HISTORICAL DATA FOR KEMAH, TEXAS

 NATIVE INHABITANTS 

The history of Kemah, Texas goes back more than 180 years. The Karankawa Indians, a group of five nomadic, linguistically related groups including the Cocos, Cujanes, Karankawas proper, Coapites, and Copanos, occupied the area from Galveston Bay to Corpus Christi Bay during the late Spring and Summer months. Evidence of the Karankawas near present-day Kemah was discovered back in the 1890s. This discovery will be discussed later in the article. Indian inhabitants began to leave when European settlers arrived, and most had retreated from the area by 1850.

 THE DISAPPEARING FOUNDER 

The recorded history of Kemah began in the early 1800s, when Texas was still under the Mexican flag. On August 24, 1824, the Mexican government granted a labor (approx. 177 acres) of land to to a settler by the name of Michael Gouldrich. Gouldrich was listed as one of Stephen F. Austin’s first colonists in 1826, a widower over 50 years of age engaged in farming and stockraising. His land was located on the south bank of Clear Creek, where the creek flows into Galveston Bay. Oddly enough, Gouldrich disappeared from historical record after his recorded receipt of the land grant. No historical records or accounts identify him with any development of a settlement, homestead, or right of way at his claim location. Odder still, there is no record of his death. 

 """"FLANDERS GROVE"""" 

Sometime between 1826 and 1830, a man by the name of William Vince of Vince’s Bayou, Harrisburg County, acquired the Clear Creek land. On several early maps of Galveston Bay dating back to that time period, the name “Flanders Grove” or “Flanders Labor” appears in the vicinity of the present day town of Kemah, at the mouth of Clear Lake. The place-name has ties to a New Hampshire native by the name of John Flanders. John was the son of Levi and Mary (Sargent) Flanders and was born in Salisbury, Massachusetts. John had been in business with his father in New Hampshire. No record exists concerning the nature of business John and his father owned, although apparently at least a part of the business they conducted dealt in real estate. In the time immediately prior to John's move to the Texas territory, he and his father had a disagreement over a mortgage held by John on a piece of property owned by a widow. John wished to foreclose and his father opposed it. The disagreement developed into bad feelings and John left home, never communicating with his family thereafter.

John Flanders was issued a passport for six months on December 7, 1830, in Austin’s colony. A notation in Austin’s Register of Families reads, “Flanders is to be included as a colonist although he takes no land.” Flanders, a 32-year-old  single farmer at the time, had arrived in the Galveston Bay region in mid to late December 1930. It is believed that his first place of residence was in Anahuac, Texas, on the northern tip of Galveston Bay. There, he acquired a house and a lot. However, he was not listed on the 1834 census of Anahuac and it is believed that somtime between early 1931 and the time of the 1934 census Flanders made the purchase of William Vince's land. Since the 1934 censuse does not record Flanders' name as a resident of Anahuac, it is reasonable to assume that he was probably living on his Clear Creek property by that time.

Sadly enough, John Flanders was listed among the dead at the Alamo. He was one of thirty-two men, commanded by Captain George Kimball, who entered the Alamo on March 1, from Gonzales. Why he was with the men from Gonzales is unknown. Flanders was a Private under Kimball, 36 years old at the time of the Alamo seige, and still unmarried.

 THE MYSTERY HEIRS 

With John Flander's death came some interesting and mysterious dealings concerning his estate that, of course, included the """"Flanders Grove""""/""""Flanders Labor"""" tract. In 1841, Allen Vince, brother of the now-deceased William Vince and resident of Vince’s Bayou, Harris County, was named administrator of the John Flanders estate. The estate was said to consist of only the labor of land at the mouth of Clear Creek on the Southwest side. A petition for sale of the land, to satisfy debts, was requested May 28, 1844. The deceased Vince owed money for lawyer fees (in the case of Sawyer vs Vince in District Court). The land was appraised at $2.00 per acre and sold to Jonathan D. Waters on July 2, 1844 for $354.00. This transaction leaves open the questions of whether or not Flanders still owed William Vince any monies for the land purchase, and how much legal right Allen Vince had to sell the land and use the revenues to pay of a debt on behalf of his brother's estate, instead of keeping the Flanders estate intact.

Remedies
If you are personally attacked, you should ask the attacker to stop and note this policy. If he or she continues, consider following the dispute resolution process. You might also consider removing particularly clear-cut personal attacks per the guideline WP:RPA; however, you should be very careful not to define """"personally attack"""" too broadly, or to do this too frequently. From a recent arbitration committee finding-of-fact:

The remove personal attacks guideline (and the application thereof) is controversial. It has often been abused by malefactors, and may not have community consensus. It should, at most, be interpreted strictly and used sparingly. [1] 
If you find yourself using this remedy frequently, you should reconsider your definition of """"personal attack."""" When in doubt, follow the dispute resolution process instead.

In extreme cases, an attacker may be blocked under the """"disruption"""" clause of the blocking policy, though the practice is almost always controversial. Personal attacks should be reported at WP:PAIN.

We seem to have a few issues under discussion at the same time here, and I think it would be helpful to separate them.   

Maintaining """"old"""" FAs
As  said (00:14, 11 December 2008), this article was promoted to FA in 2006, when standards were less demanding, so work is needing to keep it close to current FA standard.

Unfortunately the """"committee"""" process advocated by  doesn't work if the """"committee"""" is slow to respond. In Oct 2006 I pointed out some serious scientific errors in Dinosaur, another """"old"""" FA; nothing happened so in Jan 2007 I gave notice of my intention to fix these points; a few days later, after nobody objected, I fixed them; and a few days later the corrections were reverted, so that the article again contained the errors I'd pointed out 3 months earlier.    

Quality of images
This one has the potential to run for a long time. I have no strong objections to the image per se, but I'm not sure the article needs a reconstruction of a juvenile T rex'.   

Selection of images
Wikipedia is not a picture gallery, and images need to be used selectively. IMO if we have have plenty of images, as we appear to for dinosaurs, we  should use those that illustrate the content rather than just providing eye-candy. In many cases diagrams should take priority over pure pictures.   

Size and placement of images
There has been recent disussion of this at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#Forcing Lead image (plus a more general Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style item that's now archived and I can't find it) and at Wikipedia talk:Accessibility#Image position. To sum up my own views:
Images that illustrate specific content should be alongside that content.
Layout of pages that use images has become more difficult as widescreen monitors have become more prevalent, as increasing the text width reduces the height of paragraphs, sections, etc.
I dislike left-floating images, as this makes the text less readable by changing the postion of the start of the next line, so that users have to search for it rather than jump to a familiar X co-ordinate.
The functions of images vary. Sometimes they convey a lot of detailed info, and a larger size than the default is needed. On other occasions they need give only a general impression of what something looks like, and a smaller size than the default is adequate. The majority of readers are unregistered and therefore cannot set preferences for image size or anything else. Hence editors have to pick image sizes that are appropriate for the purpose.
Accessibility to users with poor vision (but not functionally blind) is irrelevant, as they will either have their browsers set permanently on """"zoom in"""" or have software that zooms in for all apps.
 makes ugly gaps in the text and reduces the readability of articles.
IMO all these points indicate that MOS cannot dictate a """"one size fits all"""" solution and editors should be free to set image sizes.   """,0

 The Jayways 

The Jayways. A 5 piece band from the depths of essex. With all five members collaborating with writing songs something new arises repeatedly from the practice studio creating fresh indie songs in a contemporary style with a strong 60's back bone. This comes from the strong influences from bands such as the Beatles and the doors. Their sound has been compared to bands such as the strokes, with elements of the kooks, but the unique soulful voice of the front man (Gerry) gives them a distinctive edge. The band formed in January 2007 and begun recording together at their home based studio almost immediatley. A strong response through myspace rapidly built up and in no time at all there was a buzz around their area and the band. As a result they packed out the grand hotel in leigh-on-sea on there first ever gig. This has snow balled into many of the other southeast venues in which the band play in and have seen them repeatidly asked back to perform again as a result. They have not just played venues all over Essex but also London and Liverpool. The band have recently been recording professionally in a music studio called Sensible Music owned by Jeff Alan. They have been produced by the renound producer Jon Moon who has worked with the likes of Amy Winehouse and The Kooks. This has inspired the band to create a record which is desting for the ears of indie inthusiasts. The first single to be released from The Jayways debut album will be """"Until we get it right.""""""",0

Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland image is dubious

The image depicted of the Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland is ahistorical and a creation by its author based on his interpretation of a coat of arms motif that appears on The Custom House completed in 1791 in Dublin. While a gold harp on a blue shield with a crown surmounting the shield was sometimes used by the government in Ireland, the stonework on this building that portrays the shield of Ireland in a stylistic way with the supporters for England (a lion) and Scotland (a unicorn) is simply heraldic artwork and not a proper coat of arms of the said kingdom. The Kingdom of Ireland created by Henry VIII never had its own unique royal coat of arms. i.e. a full armorial achievement. After 1603 and the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland, the royal arms of James I of England (James VI of Scotland) did include a harp for Ireland in the third quarter. the image in question is loosely based on the current UK royal arms. It was created by simply placing the shield for Ireland as the sole shield and retaining the Order of the Garter collar, St Edward's Crown, supporters and royal motto of the current UK coat of arms (which is not in this depiction in its the full armorial achievement format as it is missing the helm, crest and compartment). It is noteworthy that the creator refers to the crown as the """"imperial crown"""" - which is anachronistic as there was no British Empire during the Kingdom of Ireland period. While I think the creator was sincere in thinking this was indeed the historical coat of arms for the Kingdom of Ireland from 1541 until the Act of Union 1801, Ireland - unlike Scotland - did not have its own royal coat of arms during this period. When the then Anglo-Irish parliament met for the last time before the Union of 1801, it did not request a separate royal coat of arms for use in Ireland as Scotland did almost a century before in the Act of Union 1707. If anyone has evidence to the contrary, I would be most interested to learn about it.   """,0

""":Hi Labongo. Just to clarify a little, the criterion about self-identification as an indigenous people is actually one that is frequently and explicitly used by the major sources and bodies concerned with indigenous peoples' affairs and status. It was paraphrased a little for the article, but if you examine a few of the most-consulted definitions (such as UN, World Bank, ILO, etc) you will see that it's embedded in many of these formulations, with a deliberate intent. See for example the definitional quotes from these organisations, that used to be in the 'definitions' section of this article but now seems to have been split off into Definitions of the term Indigenous. As such, I think the criterion needs to remain mentioned along with the others that appear in the opening paras.

The statement """"Note that even if all the above criteria are fulfilled, some people may either not consider themselves as indigenous or may not be considered as indigenous by governments, organizations or scholars"""" does not quite mean the same thing. While that statement itself is fine as far as it goes, IMO it's not an adequate replacement. Self-identification and recognition is part of the """"set"""" of criteria that are often referred to in indigenous rights contexts.

I can see some rationale in the recent splitting out of the former content of the 'definitions' section into that separate article, however at the same time I think that this present indigenous peoples article does need to devote perhaps more space than we usually do to covering definitions and usage of terms/terminology. It's an area where there's a lot of general misconception and confusion between the common, adjectival and the formal, specific usage of words like indigenous, and even of the concept of indigenous peoples' rights and concerns (a lot of the discourse on this talkpg and others related are along these lines, for eg.) I think we could probably spare a few more paras to cover the most salient points and prominent definitions, so the detail's not all spliced away into a different article. Thoughts?  ʘ TALK

 Gabriel Olutola 

There are some issues with Gabriel Olutola, which I just deleted.

I had previously identified some concerns with this article. You seem to understand that there were issues and agreed to address them. We let some time elapse so you could address them, but you did not make any substantive progress toward resolving the problems.

In addition, you are not communicating in a way that is desirable for editors. You are perfectly free to remove material from your talk page (although archiving is generally considered preferable). However, if you simply remove material and do not respond, it is difficult to understand your thinking. I don't know for example, whether you felt that you cured the copyright problems, or perhaps thought that the source of the text was an acceptable source. If you explain your actions it will be easier to help you.

I recently deleted the article because it had copyright problems and I saw no action by you to address them. I now see that you have restored the article in substantially the same form as the article that was deleted. Again, if you do not communicate I do not know what you are thinking. I don't know whether you thought it was deleted in error, whether you thought you cured the problem, or something else.

I notice that the version you restored is not exactly worded the same way as the source. However, we have seen editors who think that changing a word here or there cures a copyright problem. It does not. Please read the following link for more information: Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing

I also ran a duplication detector which does not pick up close paraphrasing, it only picks up exact matches. Even with this cruder measure the article is problematic. I'll provide the link below so you can see the results. However, I emphasize that changing a word or two here or there to eliminate the exact matches is not the cure.

Duplication Detector

Unfortunately, we have identified other articles with issues. I haven't had a chance to look closely but we may be following up with other articles which need addressing.

I urge you to take this quite seriously. If you are editing with a misunderstanding of policy we can help you understand the rules. If you do understand the rules and ignore them, you may be blocked. Explaining your actions will be the best way to ensure that doesn't happen.(Talk) """,0

"$RiCH$
    To understand where Rich is right now is just half the equation, the other half lies in his history. Much of Rich's music tells the story of that history. Born in Riverside, California at just 15 years old his journey began. It was Rich's deep rooted love and passion for music evolving from a family of musicians, which really allowed him to turn his life around. This turnaround was despite all the trials and tribulations of his youth, while residing in Moreno Valley, California.
 
   Once in Seattle, Washington Rich embraced hip hop and rap music as well as the culture. Rich realized thru listening to the lyrics of others that he could really relate to what these rappers were saying. That is when Rich knew he too could share all that history he had bottled up inside thru his own lyrics. This is when hip hop really took over his life. Rich's level of musical development exploded, so he then channeled all his energy into writing and producing his own music. Rich is a producer and creator of addictive melodies, with beat wizardry that captures his audiences’ attention. They become mesmerized by his verbal versatility with stories, outlining and defining his truly most turbulent times.
 
   In 2003, Rich established a Washington, D.C. Metropolitan based Management, Production and Promotions Company called; HardHead Records. This brings us back to where Rich is today, HardHead Records has now commenced an exceptional business network with key associates in the music industry. Since its inception, Rich has gravitated towards some daunting, precarious projects highlighting the true and reliable nature of the company.
 
   In a time of everyone just being out there for themselves competition; HardHead Records remains committed to sponsoring and promoting local up in coming artists that are committed to something more than that. Artists of the DMV(Dc, Maryland & Virginia) that share a desire for unity amongst other artists. Rich has a vision of his trademark being something above and beyond the rest!
 
   Rich is currently working to create a movement in the DMV, a dynasty of sorts… evolving from the very best of the best. HardHead Records takes pride in preserving Rich's initial vision, which resonates his own virtues and beliefs. Rich strongly believes that in working together, in being unified and remaining true to himself and all those that choose to join the movement that unity will prevail. This prevalence of unity will in fact produce victory for all those that have wisely chosen to be involved.",0

 About Einstein 

My search of any document that might bear Einstein's name - in the League of Nations archive - in between 1930 - 1932 returns no results. See http://biblio-archive.unog.ch/archivplan.aspx.  By reviewing five books dealing with Einstein's work and life - not a single one mentioned this Einstein's support to the Ustase cause. Just one, written in German,

Einstein: Sein Leben by Denis Brian, Christine von Samson-Mark, Wiley-VCH, 2005 page 352

Indem er sich den Angelegenheiten seines eigenen Landes zuwandte, empoerte sich Einstein ueber deutsche Studenten, die fuer die Entlassung eines Professors agitierten, weil dieser ein Pazifist gegen politisch motivierte Todesurteile war. """"Es ist entsertzlich zu sehen, wie die unerfahrene Jugend fehlgeleitet wird"""", schrieb er an das Berliner Tageblatt. """"Wenn dies so weitergeht, werden wir 
nach einer Tyrannei der Faschisten bei einer Herrschaft des Rotten Terrors ankommen."""" Er glaubte, dass eine solche Herrschaft bereits in Jugoslawien ausgeloest worden sei und kritisierte die Landesregierung fuer den Mord an dem kroatischen Fuehrer, Professor Milan Sufflay, der Geschichte an der Universitaet von Zagreb gelehrt hatte.

Reading further this book it is clear that the only information available to Einstein was 'The """"inside story"""" of the Šufflay murder was given by the Croat journalist (Ustase propagandist), Slavko Cihlar, in the Berliner Tageblatt, February 26, 1931.'

So, it is apparent that Einstein fell under spell of the Ustase propaganda. About the same propaganda, see:

Appeal of the Croatian Academicians to the World of Civilisation: How the Croatian Savant, Professor of University, Dr. Milan Sufflay was Murdered by the Serbian Royal Dictatorship
by Croatian University clubs association, Zagreb, 1931 32 pages

which was elaborated by 

""""Blood and Homeland"""": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940
by Marius Turda, Paul Weindling, Central European University Press, 2007 page 107

Shortly afterwards, students from the Croatian University Club Association produced an English language pamphlet, How the Croatian Savant, Professor of University Dr. Milan Šufflay, was Murdered by the Serbian Royal Dictatorship, in which they appealed to European public opinion to recognize that the murder of Šufflay was the result of endeavors to build an absolutist South Slav state. In such a state, the """"European culture"""" of Croatia and the Croatian was to be replaced by Serbian suzerainty, in which """"orthodox, byzantine, oriental-asiatic and oldtuc (sic) political and social traditions"""" had been subsumed into a system """"not only contrary but also odious to European culture""""

Turda also says that """"His murder occasioned international condemnation and outrage from, among others, Albert Einstein and Heinrich Mann of the German League for the Rights of Man"""" (no source was given)

About the Sufflay murderer

Thinking about Yugoslavia: Scholarly Debates about the Yugoslav Breakup and the Wars in Bosnia and Kosovo by Sabrina P. Ramet, Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 254

Goldstein (Croatian historian) leaves the question of agency to the side and writes simply that Šufflay, who, as he notes, was an accomplished observer of Albanian culture, 'was killed on the street in Zagreb. The killers were never found"""" see also: Croatia: A History
by Ivo Goldstein, translated by Nikolina Jovanovic,  McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 1999 - page 125

About the same Sufflay

Women, Gender, and Fascism in Europe, 1919-45: 1919-1945 By Kevin Passmore, Manchester University Press, 2003 page 115, Fascism in Croatia chapter: Ante Starcevic and Milan Šufflay, who used a demonic concept of Serbs as the cornerstone of their ideologies.

Conflicts: Studies in Contemporary History by Lewis Bernstein Namier, Macmillan, 1942 page 49

The racial theories of a Croat writer named Šufflay were taken up since Sufflay had held that the Croats were not Slavs like the Serbs, bu were descendants of a settlement of Goths.

War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945: Occupation and Collaboration by Jozo Tomasevich
Published by Stanford University Press, 2001 page 20:
Sufflay was indicted in 1921 for espionage and connections with Croatian emigres and sentenced to athree year prison term

Take Swift Stern Action against this guy

Hi Sue,

Long time. How are you?

I visit wikipedia only occasionally these days.

I just came across this: 

I think you should give Crossmr a stern warning of NPA and CIVIL on his talk page and I think you should remove that despicable PA and uncivil comment(check out the heading/edit of the comment /edit summary /etc.) from royaa's talk page. Or let me know if I should personally give him that warning and remove that despicable comment myself. I would be happy to do that. Thanks.

It seems that Crossmr is acting with a malicious instigative agenda. He keeps rambling on about old things and keeps repeating himself (and his instigations) about them. It seems that he is unable to move on, and let peace reign, and is hung up on old already-settled bloated issues, not to mention non-issues. He seems to want to live in the past.
And to think that this guy goes around placing warnings of CIVIL and NPA on other user's talk pages. Talk about missing the plank for the speck. Tsk tsk. LOL. He should pay attention to his own Block Log  and history!!!!! lol.

He also needs to learn properly about AGF and pipe down.

His ill-intended comments are obviously malicious and deliberately provocative. But instead of me being provoked, he only serves to amuse me. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. But it has to be made clear to him that his uncivil rants are totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated. I think coming from an admin will make him, a general user, understand better.

Thanks and regards. )

 

PS. If first time newbie issues like first time misinformed """"vandalism"""" are brought up, especially from their IPs, almost everyone on wiki would be """"old vandals"""" because almost no one is expected to know wiki rules when they start editing on a whim via google one fine day. HAHAHAHAHA. BITE, AGF etc. Also was looking to merge those accounts and attribution etc. but never really got around to doing it. Though I think I had already mentioned it on one of the accounts user pages and also the edit histories and everything else is so very obvious!

To repeat what I'd already said at ANI, I am not alleging a topic ban breach, except perhaps under the """"broadly construed"""" wording. I am stating that, based on the manner of this series of reverts on The Automobile Association , followed by this 'rewrite', and based on the fact that HighKing has yet to make any associated comment at Talk:The Automobile Association, instead choosing to treat this as an issue of """"vandalism"""", HighKing has inarguably ignored the warnings Cailil gave him when he re-enacted the BI topic ban about his future conduct. Those can still be seen on his own talk page under the """"Removals of the term British Isles (again)"""" section on HighKing's talk page, so he has no excuse for not remembering them. You're going to have to read that whole thread to get the picture, but it shows quite clearly that Cailil was quite explicit in what he expected from HighKing going forward, in addition to simply adhering to the topic ban: he must stop edit warring and start discussing, he must stop this behaviour of policing terminology on Wikipedia, he must stop introducing (and maintaining by reverts) innacuracies (his altered version of the quote is not in the source, so is clearly innacurate). Basically, he was telling him to just go and find something completely different to do than this, because it is of no benefit to the project. What he has done instead, is just transfer his focus from policing usage of the term 'British Isles' on Wikipeda, to policing the term 'Republic of Ireland', while mainaining the same bad behaviours - edit warring, lack of discussion, misrepresentation of sources, misuse of guidelines/policy, etc, etc. As an administrator, the onus is on you to step in and stop it. Five years is long enough to be still getting away with this sort of WP:TE in the way you have so far allowed him to in this case. You need to block HighKing now until he gives cast iron assurances he understands why Cailil wrote those things on his talk page, and tells you precisely how he proposes to avoid it in future. That's it. As far as evidence goes, short of me pulling out direct quotes of what Cailil said to HighKing, I don't see what more you need to see, to do what is required of you.   """,0

 I will say here that I agree with most of the terms especially the requirement for a source. I will agree with all as I do not think saying """"especially Christianity"""" was absurd.

I had a conflict with Brandon about not sourcing that part where I didn't say source my statement about religion not being mentioned in the cartoon, but I do not think that has to be sourced as most of the members of PCP actually agrees that religion was never metioned.

So such political connotations exist in calling people of the U.S.A.

Sorry, but I'm not here to appease your """"getting offended"""" radar. If you feel offended every single time someone is critical of Jews, such as Kevin MacDonald, you have a serious emotional problem, or, you're probably Jewish. MacDonald has himself to blame? Wrong. MacDonald has written three scholarly books on Jews, Judaism, and Jewish political movements. That's his right to do so if he wants to and he should not get into trouble because of it, since, last I checked, the 1st amendment was still valid in America (or so they say). What next? You want to criminalise political criticism of Jews too? Anyway, this is what the source states:

Ryan White and Elizabeth Glaser put a new face to AIDS, most certainly, but I know of *no one* in the gay community (and as someone who is actually a part of the gay community, I think I would have a better perspective than someone who isn't no matter how close they think they are/were to those in the queer world) who felt """"resentment"""" over the attention AIDS received after their AIDS diagnoses became public knowledge.  If anything, the gay community and those with HIV/AIDS within the gay community were elated that something was now going to be done, while skeptical it might be short-lived and/or selective, yet still quite angry that when it was a """"gay disease"""", it wasn't important enough for the POTUS to acknowledge.

Actually, this is not at all a contentious issue. Don't go by the talk page comments. If you have facts to the contrary you should present them. There are other authors who explicitly says this. They are reputed too. They tick all the boxes of WP:RS. But, they are themselves Yadavs, and others don't have the reputation Rao enjoys. So, I am not sure if i should use those sources. However, you should present something if you think, people have stated anything contrary. In fact, MSA Rao merely compiles what Bhandarkar and others have already established.

"""

 M-hmmmmmm....... 

So, you think that I was ranting, when during the entire article I explicitly noted that I am not, and that this is a serious issue that need not be """"stricken down"""" as hate speech or ranting. Let me rebut all the things you posted on my talk page:

- Ok, """".com"""" stands for commerce, but if you read my post without any bias in mind, that wasn't even my argument. I was just basically pointing out the fact that """".co.uk"""" is explicitly UK, and that """".com"""" can be anything, though it is necessarily NOT explicitely UK, as many of Wiki's articles seem to be.

- Yes, I said I didn't know where to start, meaning I didn't know where to begin addressing the issue, not that I don't know where to start addressing this issue.

- """"Secondly, there is Wiki policy that articles dealing with American topics have American English spellings, and articles about British stuff have British English spellings. If White House has British spellings in it, by all means change them to the US ones.""""
    
 I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to tell me here, but my guess is that you assume that I don't know about the current Wikipolicy, and that you obviously don't understand what I clearly stated. I am arguing that Wikipedia should either have ALL British spelling, or ALL standard English spelling (a.k.a - """"American english), but preferabally standard English because this isn't a British website, and because as an encyclopedia, all the information should be unified under one context and/or dialect.

- My point wasn't """"British are the only people that use British spelling."""" (although in a literal sense, this is a strong point outside of context), it was that """"The majority of the English speaking population use Standard English."""". If I seemed to use the former point, then either the way you interpreted my words was wrong, or I misworded my intentional argument. If I did, then my apologies.

- """"But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds"""" 
Again, you missed a subtle point that changed the entire meaning of my words. See the word generally? What I mean by this, if you can't already comprehend, is that many words in the British spelling include silent letters. Here's an example of one: pAEdophile. If one trys to pronounce this word by the letters, it would sound something like """"PAH-EHD-OH-FILE"""", adding an extra syllable, when it's really pronounced """"PE-DOH-FILE"""", which pretty much follows how the Standard English form is spelled. 

- I'm not very new to Wiki, and if that's a subtle way for you to try to undermind my intelligence, then I resent that statement. And again, do not take my words as rants. Anybody who understands the inherent nature of an encyclopedia understands that this is an important issue. Anyways, the way I worded my post was nowhere near the definition of a rant, please use a dictionary and find out what a rant is for yourself.

Please, if you can't understand the importance of this issue solely based on personal agenda (I understand you are British), then stay out of this. You have no credibility if this is the case since you cannot make a rational decision. If you haven't noticed, everything I posted had rationale behind it.

No thank you,

Zoe, thank you for the kindness of your reply. I can't help wondering if your answer is to the point, however, since my question was about the use of  in articles and the reference you cite is about the talk pages. Moreover, it seems not to discuss comments. DreamGuy cites the use of comments in Wica (see his edit summary). I might add Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans. These examples suggest to me that some use of comments may be appropriate in articles. The Katrina article was edited frequently by many distinct editors. I don't think comments would have been retained without support for their use. 
I wonder if you might be willing to reply to my query regarding the comment wording (and caps use) that I proposed in my previous message?
May I say that I don't agree with the reversion by DreamGuy of your deletion of my comments? My preference is to resolve this matter through discussion and dialogue. Best wishes,  (talk)

As a gesture of good faith, I'm going to put the wording I proposed above into the article in place of my original wording. I think my original might be considered shouting because of use of caps. Zoe and DreamGuy, please show restraint and don't revert my wording for now. Once we've agreed on a final version, one of us can edit the article to suit. Zoe, is there an editor whose judgement you trust that might be willing to take a look at this dispute and comment? Thank you both,  (talk) 

 In fiction and In music consensus 

The consensus (painfully) reached here is that the In fiction and In music sections should contain short representative lists of the most notable instances of chimera in fiction and music (see the article edit history and the arbitration on the article discussion page). These sections should not include every instance since the lists would become so long as to have little or no value and would give the impression that such uses are more important than mythical or scientific uses. Wikipedea is not mere collections of internal links. See what not to put on disambiguation pages, as well.

Consequently, before adding to this section, please take the following steps:
be sure that the article that you are linking mentions chimera. We should not be sending readers that are looking for information about chimera to articles that do not mention the term. 
verify that your addition is at least as notable as the examples already listed and that chimera plays a major, not just a tangential role in the work. 
consider replacing an existing less-notable entry. 
justify your edit on this page.

Finally, if you disagree with my opinion of the consensus, leave your comments here. Please don't edit the article to make your point.  (talk) 

Page move request
To move the page to its classical Latin spelling Chimaera. It is of course a classical creature / concept, which has nothing to do with the US, so why should it be at a recent US variant spelling? -  
I think this is a reasonable argument. On the other hand, the majority modern usage is with the Chimera spelling, I think.  Google finds 3,230,000 (Chimera) v. 1,010,000 (Chimaera). If Google is an indication of use frequency among Internet users, a majority of readers will be searching for Chimera. That is a weak argument; redirects are relatively cheap, or so I think.  (talk) 
Gee, why should it use a recent US spelling? Well, there's Wikipedia:Use English policy, Wikipedia:Naming conventions policy that say we use the most common version, and a conspicuous lack of any policy that says Wikipedia:Use archaic Latin. We spell it the way it's spelled in the real world, it's a little thing called Wikipedia:Use common sense.

""""desire to control""""
The edit which you have reverted on the basis that it is """"Aussie-bashing"""" was certainly not that, and if you look at the article, the previous editor's précis was clearly correct: the quotation is, 'The former Prime Minister also accused the occupying force of """"the desire to control"""". Mr. Sogavare said """"certain elements"""" of the local police force have succumbed to agendas of the occupying force."""" How can it be Aussie-bashing to describe Sogavere's words accurately? It is no secret that Sogavere did not want RAMSI in Solomon Islands or that he was not on good terms with the Australian government; to describe his statement that """"the occupying force"""" had a """"desire to control"""" meant that he accused both RAMSI and the local police of a desire to control is simply to misrepresent the contents of the news item. No doubt Sogavere is guilty of Aussie-bashing; those who quote him without editorialising are certainly not guilty of it.

Josif Stalin IS one of the three worst criminals in the history of mankind, the other two being Hitler and Mao. Mao killed 38 million human beings, Stalin at least 25 million and Hitler at least 20 million. The figures are there on the CIA website.

All of them were equally monsters and the personal cult communism was no differenct from nazism in essence.

You need to be aware that most former eastern bloc countries banned the use and display of the five-pointed red star and the hammer and sickle symbols of communism alongside the swastika and some local fascist sysmbols, because they know from personal experience that the horrors of stalinism were no less than that of nazism. The hungarian law banning all these is the XLV. (45th) law of 1993, titled """"Az önkényuralmi jelképek használatát tiltó törvény"""" and it has been upheld in constitutional court.

 Article Licensing 

Hi, I've  to get users to multi-license all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike  (CC-by-sa) v1.0 and v2.0 Licenses or into the public domain if they prefer.  The CC-by-sa license is a true free documentation license that is similar to Wikipedia's license, the GFDL, but it allows other projects, such as WikiTravel, to use our articles.  Since you are among the top 2000 Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at minimum those on the geographic articles.  Over 90% of people asked have agreed.  For More Information:
Multi-Licensing FAQ - Lots of questions answered
Multi-Licensing Guide

To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" template into their user page, but there are other options at Template messages/User namespace.  The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page:

Option 1
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}
OR
Option 2
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}

Or if you wanted to place your work into the public domain, you could replace """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" with """"{{MultiLicensePD}}"""".  If you only prefer using the GFDL, I would like to know that too.  Please let me know what you think at my talk page.  It's important to know either way so no one keeps asking.    (comment| talk)

 Reason? 

Was there any reason that you removed several links to album reviews?

I thoroughly read your """"ON EXTERNAL LINK REMOVAL"""" and what I don't get is why then have you not removed every link to every review on all of Wikipedia? They are all external links. They all """"tunnel people away from the wikipedia."""" So why then are you singling out a single website and removing all of the links to their reviews?  If you would have actually bothered to visit all the links (which I somehow doubt, as all your reverts were popups-assisted.. whatever that means) you would find actual album reviews that IMO are much better than some of the crap that Pitchfork spits out. 

I'd also like to add that it is people like you who make me not want to contribute to Wikipedia, and the reason I've never joined. Instead of editing pages for the sake of contributing, you've designated yourself as the be-all end-all """"link remover""""  where """"link remover"""" means """"person who removes others' valid contributions to bolster his own self-importance.""""

And if you even bother using """"promotion"""" as a reason that VacantLips' contributions to the reviews lists were """"spam,"""" then I'll have to ask you to remove all of the external links from the """"Reviews"""" sections on all album pages... Unless you have detailed accounts proving that the users who posted the external links weren't simply promoting their own websites.

I appreciate your opinion and that is why I am asking you to justify why we should ignore the sources for alternative names of those people. You are right that these people are known as """"Makedonski Muslimani"""" (more accurately - Makedonci Muslimani) or Torbeši, but there are evidences that there are more alternative names and they aren't outdated. There is external link in the article which isn't added by me. Please, look the text in it - """"Muslims in Macedonia belong to five ethnic groups. These are Albanians, Turks, Roma, Muslim Macedonians ( also known as Torbeshi, Pomaks or Poturs) and Bosnians"""".....""""A Greco-Turkish Convention on the Obligatory Exchange of Populations in 1923 made some 390,00 Muslims mostly Turks, but also some Pomaks (Torbesi)-leave for Turkey (Ortakovski, 1997:133)"""". Is this text is about the same people or it isn't?
The question about the other two names is the same and there is sources from nowadays which proved it. The book by Russian author Dmitriy Labauri is from 2008. The term there is Bulgarian Pomaks. Through the good finding, made by Подпоручикъ we have a reference to Fihret Adanir. The term used by him is Bulgarian Muslims. Between other references there is a book Поп Антов, Христо. Спомени, Скопje 2006 (Pop Antov, Hristo. Memoires, Skopje 2006). The author used consistently the term Pomaks, describing these people, but the editor (Professor Zoran Tododrovski from Republic of Macedonia) have not considered it necessary anywhere in the book to explain what that means (if the term is ineligible) or that this is outdated term.

I believe the following description on the page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor_size is false: """"However, the larger area does not imply a better low-light sensitivity or higher signal-to-noise ratio. While the light collecting area is larger, this is canceled out by the fact that the same total light from the scene is spread out over a larger area, that is, the light flux per square mm is lower, for a fixed aperture diameter. Larger sensors can still be advantageous for low-light applications because typically lenses for them exist with larger apertures than are possible for smaller sensors.""""

The following was my attempt to correct this information:

""""A given lens will provide the same density of light on any sensor at a given aperture. For sensors with the same number of megapixels (MP), a large sensor will have proportionately larger pixels. The pixels on a 10 MP Full-Frame sensor will be more than twice as large as the pixels on an APS-C (2.3 times for Nikon, and 2.6 times for Canon). The larger pixel size is one of the reasons that full frame sensors typically have both superior sensitivity and reduced noise in low light in comparison to smaller sensors.  The smaller sensor is equivalent to a cropped section of the larger sensor but with smaller pixels, therefore much of the light from a full frame lens will fall off the edges of the smaller sensor and is """"wasted."""" Theoretically, a 10 MP (Canon) APS-C sensor should perform the same as a 26.3 MP full frame sensor, all other factors being equal.

Although a given lens will produce the same depth of field (DOF) regardless of the sensor, in practice DOF is also affected by the sensor size. This is because at a given focal length the photographer must stand further away from the subject in order to frame the same shot when using a camera with a smaller sensor. Since the DOF increases with the focal distance (distance between the lens and the subject), a photograph taken with an APS-C camera will have a deeper DOF than the identical photograph taken with a full frame camera using the same lens and aperture setting. The photographer can alternatively select a wider angle lens for the APS-C camera and stand at the same focal distance as with the full frame camera to frame the same shot, however the DOF will be affected in the exact same way since DOF also increases with wider angle (shorter focal length) lenses.""""

However it was deleted with no counter argument or explanation of the facts. I believe my description was clear, but I will leave the false information in place as I see no way to make the explanation any clearer than this.

 Hello there Peter,

 I don't tend watch other users talk pages since my watchlist is already quite stuffed, and because some talk pages receive a lot of (Non to related) traffic that would cause the page to pop up.

 Other editors prefer other methods - some just post a reply on every involved parties talk page. Alternatively you can place the Talkback template on another users page to notify them that you left a response for them on your own page (Which is convenient in its own rights, since you can keep the entire conversation on a single page).

Where sources exist specifically for art-punk these should be in the article, and if bands that have sources to support 'art-punk' as a description also have sources that use these subgenres as descriptions, that would give some legitimacy to associating these genres as part of art punk, but it needs to be demonstrated.

 Re 

So the same goes for the person I insulted?

Let me help you to be just for one day unbiased:

 It is true that there are """"fringe"""" elements that do not believe in evolution.
 However, someone who did not believe in evolution would have a very difficult time getting into graduate school in biology in any respectable accredited school anyplace in the world.
 Aside from a few religious fundamentalists who somehow feel that evolution challenges their beliefs...
 The antievolutionists are in the same camp as people who believe in extraterrestrials abducting people or cows, or in the Loch Ness Monster, or ghosts, or vampires, or avoiding black cats, or any number of other unfounded beliefs that people adopt.
 ...and nonbelievers in evolution
 Should an article on NASA have a big section on UFOs and UFO abduction of farm animals?
 Why would you think otherwise?
 Among those with advanced training, I would expect this number to be far higher.

I am not going to carry on with this list. If this is the way to go about and insult/attack people in this ambiguous, indirect manner, I'd be glad to change to that way. It would be fun to attack people personally by implying things between the lines, like your buddy did (which you didn't warn). I am a very uncivil and aggressive person, so it would be fun to find alternative ways to personally attack those who do not directly insult me or my culture. Actually, I don't give a crap what you people at Wikipedia think. You're all a bunch of evolutionistic mythologists who are trying to force your lame hypotheses down the throats of those who still have the brain capacity to believe the more sensible alternative theories.

I could understand this if Wikipedia were advocating the term """"specific modulus"""", e.g. because it is shorter, or more technical sounding, or whatever.  However my understanding was that Wikipedia was explicitly not in the advocacy business and that its articles should be named with the commonest term.  In this case the commonest term occurs ten times as often as the other two terms.

This name has the further benefit of being self-explanatory, whereas those unfamiliar with either of the other two names would have to consult a dictionary when they encounter it in a text, which may well be why it is by far the commonest term.

I therefore propose moving this article to Stiffness to weight ratio and linking the other two terms to it.  This won't compromise findability in any way, but the choice of name will indicate the most commonly used term.    """,0

Were elements of the play changed from the way he envisaged/first drew it out because of that? How did it change the theme, climax, or emotion of the show? Was it delayed because the people in power (ie. the theatre owners) disagreed with the play he had created (imagine their reaction if it centred around a homosexual relationship back in that day!)? Or was it perhaps the actors who disagreed with the roles they had to take on? Again that leads us into how Shakespeare worked around the writing problems so that the play could, eventually, go forwards. Or perhaps he had financial issues and that delayed aspects of production.

Hello. I understand you do your best to follow Wikipedia policies while editing this article, and several of your edits are useful, but I would still encourage you to be more careful in your editing and maybe stop editing the article and rather make suggestions at the article's talk page. Your edits about the reform may be a bit too detailed and also a bit too """"nice"""". English Wikipedia generally discourages people from editing articles on subjects they are closely related to, and in particular paid editing, like editing from your employee. If you edit the article too much you are at risk that the article may be tagged for Conflict of Interest editing which is not good for publicity. I understand you have good intentions of editing within policies and Wikipedia's policy regarding Conflict of Interest editing gives a bit mixed signals, but the safest thing is not too edit the articles; the second safest is to only add very basic information (change in personel etc.).

Kosovo is the drug-trading hot-spot, and so is Albania. Half of the population of Albania are still farmers, using tools that were used centuries ago. Albania has a large gray economy that may be as large as 50% of official GDP.

"""states, under the direct control of the larger federal sovereign.  

Also, if you look at the U.S. Constitution, both the Preamble and Article II repeatedly and consistently refer to """"the United States of America.""""  From the surrounding wording, it is clear that the Founders were referring to a single legal entity and believed they were constituting such an entity.  So """"the United States of America"""" is the legal name of the federal government.  There are also many sections in the United States Code which refer to """"the United States of America.""""

 20:49, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

 They are referred to in both the Constitution and other documents as """"the United States"""" because before 1787, they were semi-independent.  This is where the Americans clouded the definitions of state and nation that the rest of the world successfully differentiates.  The Constitution was the coming together of states that minted their own currency, engaged in trade wars with each other, refused to extradite criminals just because they happened to cross a state line, etc. into a """"Union"""" hence how they became the """"United.""""  Up until the Civil War (especially in the South) is was thought that a state could easily withdraw if they didn't agree with the direction the Constitution was being torn into.  South Carolina attempted to get out in the 1830s, etc.  The Constitution of the United States of America is named as such simply because at first 13 states came together to agree to it.   This was at time when New England was thinking about leaving the Articles of Confederation and creating an entity from New York to Maine.  When sections of the American contintent west of the Appalachians were planning or trying to start their own little Republics (and some Kingdoms).  If the states hadn't come together and decided to lay down a new document for their confederation, and instead persisted after Annapolis to exist under the """"Articles of Confederation"""" from 1775, most likely the union would have fallen shortly after 1800 (if not sooner) and today we would see maps with other more localized confederations of the 50 states (which who knows if there would even be 50).  Your conceptualization of inter-state relations leading up to the 1787 constitution is limited.  A few delegates getting miffed would have changed the last three centuries of world history in ways we can hardly imagine. — 21:01, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I hold a bachelor's degree in history from the most prestigious public university in the United States.  I am well-aware of all of the facts you just mentioned, especially the delicate fragility of the Union throughout its first century.  I am also familiar with all the diverse what-if scenarios.  

I do not have all day to write on talk pages.  I did not think it was necessary to rehash the convoluted details of two centuries of American history just to explain how we got to our present pigpen of legal fictions and political realities.  But thanks for doing that for me.  

When I said """"wording"""" above, I was referring to the consistent use of the definite article, """"the,"""" rather than the plural demonstrative adjective, """"these,"""" in the Constitution.  But you did clarify something I neglected, the task of explaining why the Constitution has to refer to states which are united, as opposed to, say, """"the United State.""""

 Republicans and religious Jews 

Excuse me.  In the """"Politics"""" section, the following sentence appears:

The Republicans generally receive more funding and support from business groups, religious Christians and Jews, and rural Americans, while the Democratic party receives more support from labor unions and minority ethnic groups.

In the history,  sliced out the phrase """"and Jews"""" and then  promptly reverted it.  Now, I'm a little confused.  Historically, when Jews are considered as a voting bloc, they tend to lean Democratic.  However, this analysis has always considered Jews as a single ethnic class and not separated out religious Jews from non-religious Jews.  Therefore, my question:

Does anyone have evidence that religious Jews tend to vote Republican (or Democratic)?

Two comments on this:
 Berry does not specify which particular encoding of the Booleans you should choose, only that one must be assumed beforehand, which is completely fair, as otherwise you would never know what true would be and what false would be. So, higher-type (whatever that would be in the untyped lambda-calculus) is covered by the theorem.
 There is adifference between (a) parallel execution, which exists for the lambda calculus in the form of parallel reductions, sharing graphs, etc., and (b) a true parallel program which of which POR is the prime example: just start evaluating both arguments and when one eventually evaluates reduces to """"true"""" we don't need to evaluate the other argument any further before we move on to the next part of our """"program""""; Berry's theorem shows that this """"we don't need to evaluate the other argument any further"""" is impossible.

 DMSG again 

The reference to the DMSG, Deutsche Multiple Sklrose Gesselschaft, is problematic. It's a primary source. Is it independent? From what? Organizations form as patient organizations, often, but as they develop, they find sources of funding, often from drug companies, and can end up advocating the interests of drug companies instead of their original constituency. This is not any kind of charge against DMSG directly (maybe someone who can search German sources can tell us more), but such a source does not necessarily stack up well against standard secondary sources, and the Medline article is pretty good and balanced. The headline there is telling: """"Endovascular Treatment of Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency Safe, May Provide Benefit in MS."""" Obviously, Dr. Jung was correct, such a claim is overstated, if taken as proven, the study was inadequate for that.

There are two parts to this article: the alleged syndrome and a proposed treatment which proceeds from the hypothesis regarding the syndrome. They are separate, and, to some extent, the article confuses them.

I can say this about DMSG and CCVI: if I had MS, or someone I loved had MS, I'd be very excited about CVVI and the implications. That is far from saying that I'd jump for invasive surgery, and caution is exactly appropriate. But having MS is no fun, either, and one would think that information about CCVI and the research going on with respect to it would be prominent on the DMSG home page. The link from the article does not go to a specific page about CCVI, it seems that it might be pointing to a video, but I can't see a translation of that. I was unable to find a page on the DMSG site that justifies the claim in the article. Accordingly, I'll be removing it.

However, I did find on the site a forum post that led me to this: [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/180802.php Stanford University Halts CCSVI Treatments After Two Serious Incidents]. Cause for concern, of course. There is [http: //www.examiner.com/x-32750-Lima-Multiple-Sclerosis-Examiner~y2010m1d6-CCSVI-Stanford-University-and-the-University-of-Buffalo CCSVI, Stanford University, University of Buffalo and University of British Columbia], as well, about that Stanford report and more.

It's very important to distinguish between the syndrome hypothesis and any attempted treatment. The problem at Stanford has to do with treatment only.

There is a very clear report from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, dated Feb. 9, 2010. This is also a primary source, but should give a more complete view of a patient advocacy group on CCVI.""",0

If so, I strongly urge you to read WP:Conflict of interest for guidance when editing under these circumstances. I have removed your over-linking to the Stone Records website in the relevant articles. Such a link should be listed only once, either as a reference or as an external link. Which brings me to another problem. Biographical articles require references reliable sources that are completely independent of the subject to establish notability. For guidance please read WP:Identifying reliable sources, WP:Verifiability and WP:Notability (music) + their associated links. Finally, please stop copy-pasting text from other websites into Wikipedia articles. It is a copyright violation and repeated instances of this can get you blocked. Not only that, such material is usually promotional in tone and requires major editing to make it suitable for an encyclopedia. I am adding a welcome template to the top of this page, which has other useful links to help you with your editing. Best wishes,",0

 Please help me end this drama once in for all 

I really do hate to get start making accusations, but I feel as if User:Delicious carbuncle is seriously heading down a road of corruption. It all started over a simple proposal at WP:VILLAGE where I skeptically proposed an idea for a template similar to the Template:Romeo warning for silly vandals apparently belonging to cheerleading squads. DC then started questioning my actions at WP:ABUSE, in which case I appropriately addressed his concerns. However, he seems to possibly have a problem with either my involvement at the project or perhaps even the project as a whole. He posted my real life first name, high school, and high school mascot in an example, in which case I raised concerns of WP:OUTING (note that his previous block for outing is unrelated). He said that it was merely a random name he chose, and I've chosen to WP:AGF in the matter, and you may treat that matter however you so desire. After receiving a comment on his talk page from a blatant IP troll that's been harassing me for over a month, he decided to start looking into the trolls claims about my handling of a repeat offender mainly known here as User:LBHS Cheerleader. He started heatedly questioning my actions, asking for diffs about bans. I had removed a """"suspected sockpuppet"""" template stating that the user might be related to User:Bobabobabo (which I had added over a year ago) and replaced it with a banned template since although I feel it's inappropriate that we were using Boba's ban against LBHSC without evidence, I similiarily felt it was inappropriate to all of a sudden to consider her """"debanned."""" I also added LBHSC to the list of community banned users as it seemed to be a consensus to me. I probably should have discussed this first, but I did not in light of WP:BOLD and WP:DENY (I didn't want to start a thread without absolutely needing to). Per WP:DUCK, it seems pretty obvious that LBHSC and her minions have been vandalizing for quite some time, at least since 2006, probably ban-worthy. However, I gracefully removed the contested templates when Delicious carbuncle started a thread at WP:AN/I in attempt to calmly settle the issue, and even stated that I would voluntarily abandon my efforts to combat LBHSC's disruption (beyond non-controversial reverting of blatant vandalism of course). DC ruthlessly refused to compromise, and I even contemplated retirement if only to save my name """"PCHS-NJROTC."""" Even then DC was not satisfied. Several users argued that LBHSC should indeed be considered banned as she would likely never be unblocked, including highly respected admins. Many editors, administrators, and even members of the WP:ArbCom have expressed their opinion that DC should move on. Even an admin who felt I had acted out of line and should be blocked stated that there's not enough support to keep the discussion going. Although there were those who defended my actions 100%, felt that although that the user should be banned but I should have discussed first, felt that I was being power hungry, and even thought that my actions were abusive, the general consenus of everybody was that I had offered settlement, learned important lessons, and that good faith should be assumed. Despite consensus, DC continued to revive the discussion over and over again, providing nothing new, and basically insisting on action. He has been warned repeatedly by several respected editors. He had stopped, and I had disengaged. I really wish this could have stayed in the past. However, Delicious carbuncle started User:Delicious_carbuncle/PCHS-NJROTC_ban_redux in the dawn of the new year. Considering the edit summary he used when creating the page, I initially thought his intentions were to use that as an arguement against someone who he is in conflict with known as User:Neutralhomer. In desire to not be involved in his conflict, I nominated the page for deletion at WP:MFD. I viewed it simply as an attack page which did not help the encyclopedia. I could have nominated for WP:CSD, but I didn't want to say that he was """"attacking me"""" as I was in favor of disengagement as was recommended at AN/I. In response to the MfD, he indicated that he intends to start yet another ban discussion. I'm not sure if he's wanting a topic ban on vandalism as before (which really isn't even a topic) or an all out ban. I did indicate that I would not stay here if I was topic banned, and that I would just assume be renamed to something unaffiliated with me (i.e. Vandal Fighter Missing in Action) and then be fully banned, but thankfully there's no support for either a topic ban or all out ban. It's clear that disengagement is still prefered based on some comments at the MfD discussion. After the original p",0

 Your claim of possible sockpuppetry in FPC contributions 

I justed wanted to clear something up. Yes, I know that in the Leopard Tortoise candidate voting, I said Oppose with the reasoning """"It looks like an average snapshot to me."""", and that the user Tenio also opposed with pretty much the exact same reason. I want to let you know that Tenio is not a sockpuppet of mine, and here is some information on why I said """"oppose"""". 

User:Muhammad Mahdi Karim sent me a message after seeing my vote, asking me what I meant by """"average shot"""". I wrote back with this:

""""This is what i mean by an 'average shot'. I am a photographer, and I don't really find anything in the photo that would make it anything special from many others. The use of flash rid the turtle of any contrast and washed out the colors while created dark shadows under the shell. The composition is pretty average, all I can say about it is that you centered the turtle. It looks like you just relied on the auto settings on the camera and got lucky. All in all, it's a photo anyone could have taken.""""

It's also on his talk page. I don't have any personal grudge against Muhammed Mahdi Karim and Tenino's vote and reason is only coincidence.

Also on another note, I took bit of offense at your comment in the FPC when you said """"It doesn't mean their votes don't count, just that they need to be treated with caution until they 'prove' themselves. -"""", because you are implying that my vote for some reason should carry less weight than an 'established' user's vote.

"better! 

I'd like to issue a public thank you to the Wikipedia community for their attention to this area.  This article has defiantly shown an improvement and is closer to scientifically accurate after my posts.  It is a big responsibility that Wikipedia has, and that responsibility should be free of cultural bias, even if it may seem to go against what we have been led to believe by American media and culture.

When I first started looking into this topic, the articles I found were woefully inaccurate and defiantly biased.  I still feel that objectively, the definition should clearly state that most cross-breeds lead to a reduction in fitness.  Heterosis can be induced through breeding stragity such as line-breeding but it is a wasteful effort.  Random mixing of genes is similar to random mutation, most of which is deadly and not beneficial to the gene pool.  99% of mutations are deleterious.

Respect of natural selection should be the default position.  There are quantifiable difference between the races which were developed over hundreds of generations and whatever diversity we have managed to achieve should be cherished, what makes us different is what makes us special.  By mixing the races, in one or two generations we can undo the work of hundreds or thousands of years of evolution.",0

""""The situation surrounding his assasination continues to be murky, while he reportedly was assasinated by Nation of Islam officials, he also had many enemies in the United States government. It is widely believed that the government also had a role in the assasination.""""

I am no expert on the man but I have checked several reliable sources (E.g. """"Malcolm X""""  Encyclopedia Britannica.  1990 Ed.) and they don't say anything about a government role. I am not saying that the viewpoint is untenable, but I don't think 'widely believed' is correct.

 Reply to your message about style issues and footnotes/references 

Hi! Just so you know, Template:cite news is the preferred way to cite news sources. Using the template allows us to easily modify references and easily keep all references in the same format. When editing a reference, please do not remove Template:cite news, as you did here. Also, there's no need to name references unless they're used more than once. Thank you.My way of including all references in an article is according to what I've found here and here that's close to the APA style. We are talking about footnotes that are references/citations to sources, right? Was not aware that a specific way to cite only the news, although it's a reference like any other printed source. 

Also, the reference was used twice, with the long version added at the first footnote (for example, such as this reference), and the shortened version used for subsequent mentions of the same citation (for example, such as in this case). If it matters that much for the sake of style and consistency, go ahead and change the format to one for news articles.

 Regarding Greek Muslim Delusional Paranoia Syndrome

Turks are the eternal optimists, I'll give them that, I have never met a Turk who wasn't a Nationalist or an Islamist or a Militirist. The sad thing is Turkey's territorial integrity will eventually collapse in on itself, Turkey is an Eastern Country, yet it tried to have Eastern 'heart', with the Western 'mind', it went for double or nothing and now it will lose everything, you cannot rely on a far right military which despises EU demands to stop persecution of the Kurds to protect your Constitution Turkey, we are entering endgame, and I will be only too glad to gain revenge for what these filth did to my Uncle 31 years ago, I will bathe in your blood Turks, I will burn villages to the ground and pour salt over once fertile land.

Remember how viruses work: They are merely little bits of genetic material that """"hijack"""" the host cell's mechanisms and cause the host cell to start cranking out many, many new copies of the virus. Eventually, the host cell bursts, releasing all the new virions (virus particles) to go infect new hosts. It's simply this rupturing of the host cell's membrane that kills it, and it's pretty-much the same story with any virus, from good old cold viruses (rhinoviruses) to HIV.

On 28 May 2011, actress-director Sondra Locke turned 67 according to Yahoo! News ,  ABC News , the Associated Press , Leigh Valley News , and The Boston Globe ; this directly correlates to her being born on 28 May 1944. Her birthdate is 28 May 1944 according to MSN movies , the Internet Movie Database
,  and the Notable Names Database
. Many
printed publications erroneously list her birth year as 1947. The
Middle Tennessee State University yearbook from 1963 has a photo of
her  appearing in a production of Arthur Miller's play, The
Crucible. If born in 1947, this would make Locke a 16-year-old
university student, an unlikely scenario. Locke's age is stated as 45 in this 1989 People magazine article , correlating to a 1944 birth year. As of August 2011, Locke is 67 years old according to public records ,
correlating to her being born in 1944.

In fact, FIVB rules _require_ two liberos to be designated if a team has more than 12 players on the roster.

FIVB refernce:  http://www.fivb.ch/thegame/TheGame_VolleyballRules.htm
USAV reference: http://usavolleyball.org/news/2011/03/09/usav-rules-commission-meeting-highlights/41322

The article also states that the rule allowing Liberos to serve has trickled down to juniors competitions.  That is not entirely true.  USAV rules do not allow Liberos to serve in any sanctioned event, although AAU Volleyball does allow Liberos to serve.  Many USAV regions allow Liberos to serve in events that do not serve as USAV National qualifiers.

One way to resolve this issue is to have a civil discussion on what would be a suitable title for the subject that has been discussed at length here (I propose 'Tau (circle constant)' then start an article on the subject on that page and then start an AfD.  Alternatively we could have yet another RfC on restoring the page under a different name.",0

I think cutting and pasting from the prior RfC could be allowable, though the policy is silent on that point.  I note this not as an attempt to be obstructive, since I think it would be possible to find support for an RfC on either user.  I also note that any attempts to describe the failure to certify the last RfC as an oversight are disingenuous, since the fact that it had not been certified had been noted on both the Project and Discussion pages of this RfC in some detail.",0

How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

 Article 

Hi Craddock1. Please chill out and take a step back for a moment. I have considered blocking you for a bit to stop the disruption you are causing, but I feel a final plea is a better bet for now. On Wikipedia we have an important guideline of """"Comment on the content, not the editor"""". Your very first contribution to that AFD is to attack the nominator, and it has gone downhill from there. All you are really doing is undermining the AFD in a way which will not benefit you. Take a moment to step back, consider how you could marshal an argument to explain how the article meets Wikipedia's notability criteria, and continue with a reasoned explanation in the deletion discussion. Continuing with your current behaviour will end up with you being blocked. Errant (chat!) 

Hi Errant,

Thanks for your message and sorry if I seemed a bit frustrated,

It seems as if the nominator has tried to sabotage many articles on wikipedia talking to other admins and editors. The whole point is that the ADF should not even be there and yet it remains because the nominator has a 'higher standard within wikipedia' than me - which I find unfair.

If you read the comments in the AFD you will see they are mainly to keep or strong keep the article.

Nevertheless the nominator has tried to make things difficult by issuing a sockpuppet investigation despite me admitting my fault and promising not to do it again.

I hope you can close the AFD so we can move on.

Once again since i'm new to Wikipedia I hope you will not block me but please also see things from my point of view

Best,

Philip, London, UK""",0

This band has emo lyrics, that should be stated somewhere in the article, I would add it myself but I'm probably going to get RV by some sensitive fan.

 Wikiproject proposal 

I've proposed a Panic! at the Disco Wikiproject here, to see how many people would be interested before starting one.

If you think that you'd be reguarly editing these pages, please put your name down at this page so we can see who would be interested in the project. Thanks in advance- '  talk |  

many people believe that the band members may be homosexuals but as they said in one of there interviews on absoluterock they said they confirmed """"none of the band members are gay not that theres anything wrong with it""""-ryan ross

""""emo""""

Wouldn't things just be alot easier if people could all just agree on Panic! being emo? """"Emo"""" is basically this generation's """"grunge"""". Sure, the bands may not sound very similar to each other at all, but did Nirvana sound similar to Pearl Jam? No, not really. So just because Panic! and say, My Chemical Romance might not sound exactly similar that doesn't mean they can't be the same genre. And guess what- just because """"emo"""" bands hate being called that doesn't mean anything. """"Grunge"""" bands hated being called grunge too. 

And there definetly IS an emo sound. There's definetly a particular vocal style, lyrical style, and attitude that emo bands have.

Agreed, Panic! is an emo band, but many fans here seem to have a problem with that. 

A lot of people get really sensitive about things they like being labelled emo, I think it's just because the stereotypical emo isn't really something that a lot of people want to be associated with. I agree that the vocal style especially is emo, and the way they look is also associated with emo- not all songs, but some songs of theirs have 'emo-ish' lyrics, too. I'm fine with the genre being changed, it's just a matter of fans researching them here and becoming offended- instead of discussing it here, it's going to be changed back a lot. However, on the page it's set as emo and alternative rock, which is perfect. '  talk |

Definition

TABIn this proposal, I will discuss why the Wikipedia definition for “Probability,” is not a good, valid definition, and needs to be changed. Probability is something that is used every day. It is what helps us further understand the outcomes of the events in life that are uncertain. However, in order to further our knowledge of probability, we must truly understand the definition of the word first. According to Wikipedia, there is not a clear, valid definition for probability, and I propose to change this.

User:Nparibello-NJITWILL/Summer 2012 | Probability

TABThe given Wikipedia definition is as follows: Probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain.[1] The proposition of interest is usually of the form """"Will a specific event occur?"""" The attitude of mind is of the form """"How certain are we that the event will occur?"""" The certainty we adopt can be described in terms of a numerical measure and this number, between 0 and 1, we call probability.[2] The higher the probability of an event, the more certain we are that the event will occur. Thus, probability in an applied sense is a measure of the confidence a person has that a (random)event will occur.

The opening sentence brings great concern as to what probability really is. It begins with, “Probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain.” The word ordinarily is not only ambiguous, but makes the opening sentence tell us very little about what we are reading about. Aside from the ambiguity, the rest of the sentence is extremely confusing as well. Although I am someone who has studied probability not only for my college degree, but also on my own to further my knowledge, I still had to read that sentence over and over again to understand what the writer meant. I would not consider probability an attitude of mind, because this simply does not make sense. The “proposition of interest” and “attitude of mind” are unnecessary and confusing when defining probability. Probability is the analysis of the outcome of an uncertain event. 
TABThe given Wikipedia definition gives several examples of what probability is, rather than defining it. It states that, “The proposition of interest is usually of the form…” This is not only an example instead of a definition, but it is an extremely poor example. The word usually is very vague, leading the reader to believe that the given example does not apply to probability all of the time. The definition also ends with probability in an applied sense. But what does that really mean? Because there are no other examples of another sense that probability applies to, this makes the definition unclear.
TABThe definition then goes on the describe probability in mathematical terms using the range between 0 and 1. For anyone who has not dealt with probability in a mathematical sense, this definition most likely makes little sense. The way it is written is very vague, but what it is trying to say is that there is a range of outcomes in probability starting from 0 (the event will definitely not occur), to 1 (the event will definitely occur). These ranges are also often written in percent form, 0% to 100%. I believe that by adding the fact that these numbers are percentages, the numbers already start to make a more sense and become more valid. The range between these numbers is the percent of likeliness of an outcome. While this definition gave many examples that do not help the reader to further understand probability, I would perhaps include one common example when dealing with the mathematical sense, even though definitions should not include examples. For example, the probability of a fair coin landing heads after it is tossed is .5, or 50%. This is because there are two possible outcomes, heads or tails, and both are equally likely. If the coin had been unfair with heads on both sides, the probability of landing heads would be 1, or 100%, since there are no other possible outcomes. As stated in the original definition, “The higher the probability of an event, the more certain we are that the event will occur.”

TABTwo good quality sources comes from Richard L. Sheaffer in his book, Introduction to Probability and Its Applications, and Glenn Shaffer in his book Probability and Finance. Both Sheaffer and Shaffer are well known mathematicians whose textbooks are used in a vast majority of colleges, including NJIT. Both of their main mathematical focuses aim a probability, making them two of the best sources for this proposal. From a mathematical standpoint, Richard Sheaffer states that “Probability is a numerically valued function that assigns a number P(A) to every event A so that the following axioms hold: P(A) >= 0, and P(S) = 1.” Glenn Shaffer explains these axioms in a more wordy, les",0

My worry is the number of editors who would scrutinise your every movement. On WikiSource you don't have as much history so there are less people watching you. It would be a much more pressured environment for you. Can you remain calm in these circumstances?   
My perspective on Wikipedia is much different now. I have enjoyed immensely Wikisource where, granted, the atmosphere is much friendlier and encouraging, so my editing energies can safely go there. (I have made close to 9,000 edits there with no problems and certainly no attacks or negative feedback from editors.) I don't intend to get involved in the award culture on Wikipedia such  FAC, FAR or other areas where editors are competitively vested in collecting awards.  My first interest is fixing up articles that I would like to link to Wikisource articles, but are in such bad condition that I don't link. Secondly, I would create articles that are needed for explanations for Wikisource articles. I will stay away from any article that belongs to a vested editor, where an editor lists and article under articles """"I wrote"""" or refers to """"my articles"""" in posts. I will make it a practice to check histories for that kind of editor. Outside the FAC/FAR arena there is not much of a problem, I don't think, if any at all.  I have created over 600 articles in a multitude of subjects, mostly to fill in """"missing links"""" on Wikipedia. I will continue with low key endeavors such as that. However, at the sign of any """"push back"""" I will simply not continue editing the article or dealing with that editor, or even editing Wikipedia for a while. Also, my misery was generated by a small group of editors. I am hoping they will be proscribed from harassing me in an Arcom settlement.   — (Talk)

 Mentmore Towers / Jacobethan / Renaissance Revival 

Before reinstating your claims about Mentmore being based on a design by Serlio, please find a reliable source to back it up. The Renaissance Revival article is a bit of a mess because the term is so all-encompassing (in some poor interpretations) as to be almost meaningless (though as the majority of the examples on that article's page show, it is generally accepted as being a revival of specifically Italian palazzo type models, rather than applying to the revival of any style that was in use anywhere in Europe during any part of the Renaissance). Jacobethan is more specific, is supported by the government's own list description for Mentmore (as shown in the source I have cited), and is more correct in the context of Mentmore than the vague """"Renaissance Revival"""".

"""POV ==

The comments at the end of the article violate the Wikipedia policies on NPOV and verifiability.  In particular:

""""But the party never succeeded in persuading many people that Communism was the answer to these problems."""" -
This statement implies that the CPA was trying to persuade people that Communism was the answer to issues of civil rights, etc.  I doubt that this is the case, and it is not supported by any source that I know of.

""""Against these achievements must be set the party's long history as an apologist for the Soviet Union."""" -
The word """"apologist"""" is highly pejorative, and has no place in an encyclopedia article.  For example, the article on the Liberal Party does not describe them as an apologist for the United States.  In addition, the CPA appears to have been critical of the Soviet Union starting in 1968 (23 years before its dissolution).  It would be reasonable to state that the CPA long supported the Soviet Union, but this would be misleading without mentioning that the party was later critical of the Soviet Union.

""""Disenchantment with the Soviet Union led most of the party's members to leave over time."""" -
There were many factors leading to declining membership, and some people even left due to the CPA's criticism of the Soviet Union.  Although it is likely that disenchantment with the Soviet Union was the primary cause, this statement should be more specific and supported by a source.

Giving positive and negative POV is different to NPOV.  The article should present facts without passing moral judgement.  On its own, listing the issues that the CPA campaigned on is not POV, because it does not pass moral judgement on whether these were good or bad (although the wording does tend to present these campaigns as positive).  However, using the wording """"Against these achievements must be set"""" turns the paragraph into an argument on the merits of the CPA, with the campaigns presented as something positive and support for the Soviet Union presented as something negative.
TABIf this material is included, it should be given in a separate paragraph and give a factual account of the CPA's history of support and criticism of the Soviet Union.

Actually, most of the romance words in English come from Norman French, abit removed from French (especially modern French). Then there is another grouping of Latinate words which came in via the Grammar school boys (Grammar schools of the late medieval being schools which taught latin grammar, and which required students to speak grammar at all times), and the ecclesiastical coinages, from around the same period (late Tudor England onwards). The first lot, the Norman French, had a rather different historical journey from the second lot, the second lot being rather closer to Classical Latin (actually most are Church or Medieval latin, but the difference here is not so great). The Norman French borrowings have a little more fanciness than regular Germanic English because Norman French was the language of the English ruling class (and law etc) for about 300 years. Most the food words come through this path. The second group (borrowed in from about 1400 to 1700) are fancy not so much because they represent the ruling classes, but because they represent learning. Then there's a few other words which come in from other places, like Piano (from Italtian), and others which are similar because they actually come from a common germanic/italic root even a proto-Indo-European root.

I think that it would be worth noting the path of derivation (NF vs Lating vs other).

On a second related point, the Germanic in English comes from several dialects, from both the North Germanic group (Norse) and the West Germanic. Old English had a few differing dialects. Northern English dialects tend to have a little more Norse and a little less Anglo-saxon, than the south-east. There are Norse and Saxon cognates which both made it into English, skirt and shirt being the famous examples. So, again some more information regarding the exact derivation of the Germanic, unless someone wants to go the whole hog and put in the proto-Germanic reconstructions. But that probably cannot be done. 14:17, 15 July 2007",0

 Vitamin B12 

Some edits by User:Mrt3366 lack proper references and are factually incorrect.
The claim that """"Bacteria are the only sources of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]"""" is false, it is produced by a unicelular alga by example, Pleurochrysis Carterae.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11453796

Fortified breakfast cereals don't offer [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12] from plants, they have it added as a supplement. It is recommended for vegans to take supplements as such, as a minimum dosage can be reliably maintained.

""""The human gut also contains B12-synthesizing bacteria, living from the mouth to the anus"""" looks false. The old 1980 reffered study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7354869) only reffered to small bowels and it was falsified since.
http://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-7c.shtml
""""Claims of intestinal B-12 production may be based on insufficient evidence. Albert et al. [1980] is sometimes cited as evidence that B-12 producing bacteria can exist in the small intestine. Sometimes explicit claims are made, e.g., that intestinal bacteria allegedly can produce adequate B-12. Baker [1981] and Nutrition Reviews [1980] are related citations that comment on Albert et al. [1980].
However, a careful reading of Albert et al. [1980] shows that it used bacteriological assays, which are of lower reliability, to measure B-12 levels. Specifically, the most accurate bacteriological assay they used is Ochromonas malhamensis. Note that Ochromonas is the most accurate bacterial assay method for B-12; however, even it may report values for some analogues as part of its """"B-12"""" results [Schneider and Stroinski 1987, Tables 3-2, 5-3 to 5-5, pp. 56-57, 119-123]. Herbert and Das [1994, p. 405] apparently regard all the bacterial assay methods as being less reliable than differential radioassay; also see Herbert et al. [1984] and Herbert [1988] for related information.
Additionally, the data obtained in Albert et al. [1980] comes from isolated bacterial cultures. Therefore, it is unclear whether the bacteria would produce similar amounts of B-12 under the conditions present in the intestines. This point is discussed in Albert et al. [1980], but is sometimes ignored by dietary advocates with an ideological interest in minimizing the requirement for B-12 in the diet. The bottom line in the paper of Albert et al. [1980] is that it shows certain intestinal bacteria might produce B-12, but it is unclear whether/how much might be produced (and absorbed) under actual conditions in the small intestine.""""

The last paragraph contain only straight propaganda from 2 MD personal pages contradicting the necesity of the vitamin, without any reference to reliable sources.

The editor was also part of a dispute on the Vitamin_B12 article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vitamin_B12#POV_issues  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Algae acquire vitamin B12 through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria.

Individually, algae and bacteria make interesting organisms to study. Bacteria are organisms that can be found living in a range of different environments. Besides being organisms capable of causing disease in humans, they are also vital to the cycling of nutrients within the environment.  Algae are organisms capable of fixing carbon through photosynthesis within aquatic systems.  At the same time they are important to study because with increased nutrient loads to bodies of water can cause algal blooms, which can lead to eutrophication. This reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen available for use by fish and other aquatic organisms.

Bacteria and algae can coexist within biofilms.  Biofilms can help reduce the effects of external factors to produce areas that can allow for growth of specific bacterial populations and make conditions favorable for certain bacterially mediated processes such as denitrification.

 Samoa mo Samoa - Mata Usi Wikipedia -  

Samoa (i/səˈmoʊ.ə/; Samoan: Sāmoa, IPA: [ˌsaːˈmoa]), officially the Independent State of Samoa (Samoan: Malo Sa'oloto Tuto'atasi o Sāmoa), formerly known as Western Samoa, is a country encompassing the western part of the Samoan Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. Samoa announced their independence to Aotearoa - New Zealand in 1962. The main island of Samoa is Upolu, and is one of the largest islands in the Polynesian Triangle, next to Savai'i. The capital city, Apia, and Faleolo International Airport are situated on the island of Upolu.

Samoa was admitted to the United Nations on 15 December 1976.[6] The entire island group, inclusive of American Samoa, has been called “Navigators Islands” by late European explorers, who at 3000 years after Polynesia's """"Age of Navigation"""" surged into an era of exploration. Before the 20th century because of the Samoans' seafaring skills, and origins of Polynesian culture,  

History Main article: History of Samoa
Many recent studies into the pre-history of Samoa has been taken up by Asia Pacific Universities, including departments in Aotearoa - New Zealand. In general public education, the Polynesian Expansion is chronologically studied in the range of 3,000 years, leading off at a Lapita site at Mulifanua during the 1970s.[8]

The origins of """"The Samoan Expansions"""" are linked to the Pre-historical waves of Southeast Asian expansions which is a continued study in modern research in various scientific disciplines such as Genetics, Linguistics and Anthropology. Scientific research resides on the results that the Samoans originate from, or of, the ancient lines of Austronesian expansions and predecessors during some of the first waves expansions eastward across Southern Asia and Asia Pacific. The Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia through Melanesia between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE is an on going Anthropological interest.[9] The Samoan origins are currently being thoroughly assessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards.

It's theorized that intimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained in Pre-historical eras between the Polynesian Lapita colonies. Archaeological record supports Samoan oral History and Genealogy that indicate inter-island exploration, war, colonization, and eras of Monarchal ties between ancient Samoans, Tongans, Fijians, and in Eastern Polynesia orders - Ali'i.

Interior of Samoan house, Apia, Urville 1842.At the final arrival of western exploration in the early 18th century. Jacob Roggeveen (1659–1729), a Dutchman, was the first documented to sight the Samoan islands in 1722. This visit was followed by another western explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville (1729–1811), who named them the Navigator Islands in 1768. Contact was limited before the 1830s which is when missionaries and traders began seeking relations with Samoan orders.

Religious missions were cautious in Samoa which began in the late 1830's by John Williams, of the London Missionary Society arriving in Sapapali'i from The Cook Islands and Tahiti.[10] According to Barbara A. West, another western author seeking interests of readers, """"The Samoans were also known to engage in “headhunting,” a practice invoked in ancient Samoan warfare, in which a warrior took the head of his slain opponent to give to his leader, thus taking his Mana.""""[11] By that time, the Samoans had gained a reputation of being savage and warlike from a famously published French journal of the times, which insued panic during that time, and a wonder of Samoan invasion. The violent altercations had occurred between a village of Samoa and a French expedition [La Perouse Expedition], who had lost almost the entire crew leaving the expedition adrift, over a French sailor direspecting a Samoan woman.

Later expeditions by the British, German, and American forces, who by the late nineteenth century understood the invaluble oceanic position of Samoan trade, sought it's cooperation in resupply and refueling for coal-fired shipping and whaling.

=====

The Wikipedia article on Federal Vision shows a strong flavor of bias, because it does not clearly describe Federal Vision's distinctive, and often contested, meanings for various Christian theological words and phrases of long standing; and because it omits an adequately clear summary of the most common criticisms of FV.

The neutrality of the article can be strengthened in at least two ways. One way is clarify the new definitions that certain Federal Visionists have created for certain established theological terms and phrases. For example, the Federal Vision's view of """"covenant objectivity"""" results in a category of person some have called the """"unbelieving Christian"""" or """"unsaved Christian"""", which most evangelicals regard as an oxymoronic statement. 

Federal Visionists assert a belief in election, but subdivide the elect between elect who are granted an additional grace of perseverance and thus persevere in their faith unto eternal life, as opposed to a different category of the elect who are not granted a special grace of perseverance by God, and as a result apostasize from the Christian faith and are eternally condemned to hell. 

The phrase """"obedient faith"""" has been adopted from controversial CRC pastor Rev. Norman Shepherd, and is used to signify that one is justified not by faith alone (that is, faith in Jesus Christ and the Gospel, considered apart from its subjective ethical influences), but by the consequent actions of ethical obedience to God's will which result from faith.

This brings us to a second way to make the Wikipedia article neutral, which is to add a clear section on basic criticisms of Federal Vision. 

The link section addresses some of these, but there ought to be material in the body of the article itself that enumerates and clearly describes the most common criticisms of Federal Vision. E.g., Federal Vision has been criticized as not being properly described as """"evangelical"""" (since """"evangelical"""" denotes a Protestant insistence on the necessity of individual conversion), in light of its teaching of presumptive baptismal regeneration, and continual criticism (and sometimes mockery) of American evangelicalism's emphasis on the encessity of conversion. In this sense, it appears to be more akin to high Anglicanism, which is non-evangelical. The claim that it more faithfully represents the thought of John Calvin is disputed by many familiar with Calvin's theology.

"(ec with Marskell) Ottava, You seem to be very upset about this, and I am really clueless as to why (and why you hold this position about NPOV and consensus). Using your reasoning, we should never be able to oppose on comprehensiveness issues either, because if a consensus of the regular editors of the page says that the article is comprehensive, then it must be. FAC's entire purpose is to try to get a larger perspective on whether the article meets the appropriate policies or guidelines (in other words, consensus can change). I do think that the RCC page suffers sometimes because most of its editors have a very strong POV. That is understandable; people usually work on topics they are passionate about (either for or against). I fully acknowledge (and praise) that they are trying to make the article as NPOV as possible, but when you hold a strong POV sometimes it is hard to recognize where neutral actually is. That is why processes like FAC, GAN, and PR are essential, because then you can get (hopefully) the opinions of people who don't hold a strong POV on the topic. I would encourage you to post at WT:FAC to see what the consensus is for how to review an article - are NPOV and comprehensiveness concerns off-limits?  Or perhaps it would be useful to post at WT:NPOV to see whether there is consensus for your view that NPOV is decided solely by consensus.  Please let me know if you initiate a discussion, as I would like to participate.",0
"""

With regard to Durie I think we've reached consensus to keep it out.

With regard to Breivik - it's a reliable high quality source, it directly supports the text that is being included, it is obviously notable (the fact that breivik used the term and how he used it), and it is relevant. So I really don't see any reason for removal except some kind of WP:IDON'TLIKEIT

With regard to the side bar - the underlying problem is that the very subject of this article, """"Dhimmitude"""" is a POV-loaded term itself, usually used by people with a particular ideology. Part of that ideology/POV is the view that Muslims always and everywhere discriminate against non-Muslims and that this discrimination is captured by this term. But once again - this is just a POV of a particular ideology. If this sidebar was text we could properly attribute it (so and so says that Dhimmitude reflects discrimination etc.) But with a sidebar we cannot do this. Since we cannot properly attribute a sidebar the only recourse is simply to remove it. This is the same as if someone tried to put an """"Apartheid"""" side bar in the article on Israel or something - it'd be POV, just like it is here. In fact, given the generally fringe usage of the term, by fringe folks, an """"Islamophobia"""" sidebark would make a ton more sense than the """"Discrimination side bar"""".

Wikipedias sanctioned trolls: stop vandalizing and spreading your anti-Christian and anti-theism propaganda

Why are you hiding this edit?:

Criticisms of macroevolution

The term """"macroevolution"""" frequently arises within the context of the evolution/creation debate, usually used by creationists alleging a significant difference between the evolutionary changes observed in field and laboratory studies and the larger scale macroevolutionary changes that scientists believe to have taken thousands or millions of years to occur. They may accept that evolutionary change is possible within animal kinds, which change is referred to as """"microevolution"""", but deny that one animal kind can evolve into another, which change is called """"macroevolution"""".

The terms macroevolution and microevolution as used in mainstream science relate to the same processes operating at different scales, but creationist claims misuse the terms in a vaguely defined way which does not accurately reflect scientific usage, acknowledging well observed evolution as """"microevolution"""" and denying that """"macroevolution"""" takes place.CB902: Microevolution is distinct from macroevolution.

The Darwinists Nicholas Matzke and Paul R. Gross have accused creationists of using """"strategically elastic"""" definitions of micro- and macroevolution when discussing the topic. The actual definition of macroevolution accepted by scientists is """"any change at the species level or above"""" (phyla, group, etc.) and microevolution is """"any change below the level of species."""" Matzke and Gross state that many creationist critics define macroevolution as something that cannot be attained, as these critics describe any observed evolutionary change as """"just microevolution"""".

Arguments often arise between creationists and so called evolutionists over evolutionists' failure to recognize the word """"kind"""" in Genesis as not being equivalent to the word """"species"""",http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/feedback/2006/0908.asphttp://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/am/v2/n2/two-of-every-kind

God makes the animals (Genesis 2:18) and parades them before Adam to see if any would strike his fancy.  But none seem to have what it takes to please him.  After making the animals, God has Adam name them all.  The naming of several million species must have kept Adam busy for a while, why Adam would still have to be living for we haven’t even discovered nor named all the species.  Also consider the idea of every living creature being brought to the Middle East, that would have killed many animals due to climatic changes.http://www.evilbible.com/absurd%20torah%20science.",0

Hi !

That's why I asked on the talk-page if the mentioned sources (court-documents and atleast two primary accounts) are sufficient that the allegations should be mentioned. It is tricky to ask such a question without saying what the allegations -are-. I absolutely agree that just because someone claimed something in a court-filing, that's not evidence that something is true. But it -IS- evidence that you have been accused of it. 

On the balance I think I agree with you. One can be accused of anything, by anyone, afterall.

"Melchoir/ Ultra-Space Field Theory 

Hi Sam,

My name is Keith D. Foote. I'm the author of a treatise titled the Ultra-Space Field Theory. Every once in a while I google the USF theory to see if its found a home on any new websites. I came across a message from someone warning a Wikipedian writer to stop pushing the Ultra-Space Field Theory and that all future references would be sent to Melchoir. 

The Ultra-Space Field theory is an alternative model to the current particle theory paradigm and is generally ignored by the scientific community, so I'm not surprised your organization wants nothing to do with it. (My own brother, with a Bachelors in Science, called it 'whacked', though he could find no fault with its conclusions.) From what I can tell, it is a historical truth that scientists (being the busy people they are) detest new science models. Many of the assumptions in physics we currently hold as truth took decades to overcome locked mindsets. For example, a huge number of physicists describe magnetic fields as an illusion, though there is no evidence supporting this conclusion and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from billions of electrons being ejected by the Sun every minute. 

I would like to request Melchoir be given an opportunity to read the treatise. If Melchoir will e-mail me a snail mail address, I would be happy to send him a copy.

I can be reached at patienthunter@netscape.net

Thanks,

Sincerely,

Keith D. Foote",0

Hi there 7. I'm currently writing an editing tool for deletion tagging, . At the moment I'm looking for some users to do a bit of testing for me, as I haven't used all the functions myself.

Hi Saposcat,

 adviced to ask you. There is an urban legend in Hungary about the etymology of a word: Lófasz. That's pretty rude, it means horse's dick. The legend - which may be true - says that it comes from an old Turkish word, Lofat, which was a torturing device back in the 15th-16th century. It's a long stake or pole used for impalement. See picture here. As the picture shows there was such a device, but I have no sources if it was called lofat. Could you please tell me if that or a very similar turkish word existed in the middle ages?

"Clean-up
Even though I write most of this, I have to totally admit after reading it from start to finish that this article is a right mess. The references are too web-reliable, there are also too many meaning the reference numbers make it look messy and clog things up, and the references list is far too long for an article of this size. 

Another thing I see wrong is the lack of flow, the article jumps about a bit from one subject to another in the same paragraph, the idea of a paragraph is to keep to one subject, then if the subject changes, start a new one, looking back at what I've done, I've gone against the basic rules of paragraphing.

NB: I actually know Germans who insist that we should stop saying """"German"""" and """"Germany"""" (and that the Spanish should stop using Alemán), and everyone use """"Deutsche"""" and """"Deutschland"""", so, no, it is not a red herring fallacy at all, but a comparison chosen carefully (though not carefully enough; see a bit later). Your own counter however, is a straw man fallacy; no one said anything about transliterating vs. not transliterating, so the """"Ελλάς"""" argument is a complete non sequitur.  I do agree that Hellenic is an English word, and concede the point that the Deutsche comparison wasn't very apt after all; I was focused more on the situational than linguistic similarity when I chose it.  A better example would be expecting our articles about Japan and the Japanese to use Nippon and Nipponese to better match the native name of the country; these are in fact words in English. It would actually make  sense to do that than to do what's been proposed here, because """"Nipponese"""" has no confusing alternative meaning, unlike """"Hellenic"""" which commonly, probably  commonly, refers to ancient Greek culture in English, not modern.  —  ☏ ¢ ≽ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ≼

As for what should be in a rationale, well, it should generally point out how these criteria are met.  If the standard  template is filled out, you're generally well-covered.

Hello!

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

Pick an image name.
When uploading an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

Source the image.
On the image description page, explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

Provide copyright and license information.
This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like Photoshop or GIMP, then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the GFDL (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the public domain (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate tag on the image description page, like {{GFDL}} or {{PD}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using {{PD}}, you may also want to use {{NoRightsReserved}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
If you didn't create the image, or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might """"create"""", but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another tag that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of sites which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as """"only for use by Wikipedia"""", or """"for non-commercial use only"""", or """"for educational use"""".  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under fair use, but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

Describe the image.
To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  

Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: 

Copyrights, Copyright tags, Fair use, Image description page, Public domain, Images for deletion, Possibly unfree images, Copyright problems, Uploading images

Speedy deletion of Jessie parnell
 A tag has been placed on Jessie parnell, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia per speedy deletion criterion A7. 

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not meet basic Wikipedia criteria may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as an appropriate article, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is appropriate, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add  on the top of the article and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

I don't disagree in principle with anything you've written above. I would have no problem with a much stricter notability policy that favored importance over other concerns. However, what you or I might prefer takes  or should take  a back seat to what is. And what is does not require so stringent a standard, at least the way I read the current notability standards. In my view, David Boothroyd met these standards  though barely so  even before the minor scandal. After it, I think there's no question he does. While I share your concerns regarding the future of such articles, the article as it currently stands in userspace presents no viable BLP concerns as far as I can tell.
On a tangent, I am actually considering reworking the notability standards in a way that addresses your concerns above as my first Wikipedia-space project. There are so many """"nobodies"""" that have articles currently that I think this is a rather necessary change. As this would be a major shift, I don't plan on working on it on the actual page, but using a sandbox of some sort. Could you advise me as to both the feasibility of taking on such a project, as well as how to creat a draft like CoM's current Boothroyd article? Thanks, Unitanode 16:05""",0

"That statement is the only thing I cannot believable about the Pirate Bay trial.  I hope they win the trial but there is no way they operate at a loss.  My friend operates a website that draws 500000 people per month on average.  With the same or less ad coverage as pirate bay, he earns 1 US dollar for every thousand visitors.  For pirate bay, this equates to 1 thousand dollars for every visitor they have.  They claim 25 million active members, so figure a lower number of 5-10 million per day.  This brings in as high as $10000 per day if I'm staying conservative.  This is not counting donations and likely better ad deals due to the large numbers of people being drawn and time of each person spent on the website (ie, multiple hits by a person per day).  So the amount of money being drawn in per day has a lower limit of 10 grand.  365 days in a year, unless these people are complete morons they should be bringing in at least a million per year gross income.  More likely several million.  With these numbers, if they only get a million hits per day, which is well within everyone's, including piratebay's, estimations, then they would still be making on the order of $365000 per year.  There is no way operational costs equal or exceed this value even if they bought brand new servers every other year, which doesn't seem logical given my knowledge of networking.
Now they might be incorporating expansion costs, ie the new server banks in Russia and other countries, and other related costs to expansion in costs of business when saying they operate at a loss.  Hate to break it to ya, this means they're just spending money they already earned.  So yes, they do in fact earn that much money, they just spend it as fast as they earn it.

If you want to prove you are right, use the rights of all wikipedians (like User:Michaelas10 and User:Richard Harvey): EDIT!

Hell, when someone like User:74.129.234.170 tells you you're an asshole for being an asshole (or, in the words of a more tactful wikipedian, """"too bold""""), am I contributing to wikipedia?  No, probably not.  But am I honoring the spirit of equality?  Hell yeah!  We can swear at eachother until the cows come home without one of us depriving the other of the powers inherent in a wiki.  But if I wanted to contribute to an encyclopedia run by a community of rule-obsessed elites, I would submit to Encyclopedia Britannica.

Or, look at it from the utilitarian perspective.  I once tried to get in a revert war, and I found it was way too boring after only two rounds, so I quit (allowing User:Crossmr to get the last word...until a third party emerged from the community of equals to take my place).  But, man, throwing sand in the face of a pointless authoritarian?  Priceless!  I'll do it forever if you're willing to keep playing.  Bring it on!

Suffice it to say, I have a wikipedia alter ego, which has a couple serious contributions under his belt.  Or, to put it another way, I have a lot of IP addresses.

Convince, threaten, block.  Don't threaten, threaten, threaten.  It just doesn't work.

So if you want to revert my work, go for it.  I might argue with you, I might even be uncivil, but you can be certain that I won't block you or delete your contributions or even vandalize your encyclopedic content.

 Excellent work! 
I have been away from Wikipedia for years, and largely due to users like the despicable, self-deluded Gavin Collins. To return here after so much time and find that he has been removed from the site is an utter joy, on several levels. Justice has finally been served, proving that the system here actually works, albeit slowly. However, I can't help but feel sick about the time, energy, and effort the Wikipedia community has expended (i.e., wasted) in dealing with this Gavin Collins, a terrifically disruptive and possibly mentally disturbed individual. It is incredible to me that one user has caused such extensive damage and unending headache, heartache, and loss of resources. Yes, instead of spending hundreds of hours dealing with Gavin Collins' nonsensical, myopic, obtuse, elliptical, deconstructive, and dense argumentation, we could all have been making this a better place. And now, he's gone. So in a sense, I suppose those hours lost were not for nothing. And at the end of the day, Gavin Collins' dubious legacy is deeply stamped. Thank you, Wikipedia; thank you fellow editors.   07:42, 28 March 2011 (UTC

When indicating """"passing"""" in your statement above, could you please respond to the following questions re:the various registries you have referenced:

1)What do you mean by """"passing"""". Do the registries disallow breeding of dogs who have higher than your indicated ratings?  How do the registries gather the individual scores of each of their breeding dogs? How do the registries """"enforce"""" these requirements?

2) Could you state what testing organization(s)are accepted by each registry for these """"passing"""" grades?  Your """"grades"""" indicate they are probably OFA scores, but how are Penn-Hip scores treated in the registries, since this testing is also being used with Shiloh Shepherds, from what has been previously mentioned in this discussion?

3) What are your references for your gathered information; that is to say, what are the web page addresses for the various registries where this info is stated as required/enforced/recommended?

4) Most importantly, since the term """"required"""" calls for a resource by which adherence to this """"requirement"""" can be enforced, could you also please provide  the resources through which interested puppy buyers can confirm testing results for the individual dogs (or their parentage) they are interested in purchasing.  Whether claimed as required or not by whichever registries or breeders, these claims have no value (other than through """"blind trust"""") to potential puppy buyers unless they have an opportunity to verify the results themselves through independent means.

In other words, if a reader wants to research the hip """"grades"""" of the parents of a puppy they are considering buying (not generic group testing results) would you please indicate where that information can be found for each of the registries (NSBR, ISSR, TSSR)?  
 
Example: 

NSBR - Hip registration is primarily through OFA. To view OFA's hip information on NSBR dogs, please view website address www.xxxxxx.org""""
      AND
ISSR -  Hip registration is through OFA and Penn-Hip. To view OFA's hip information on ISSR dogs, please view website address www.xxxxxx.org. To view Penn-Hip's hip information on ISSR dogs, please view website address www.zzzzz.org  """"
      AND
TSSR - Hip registration is conducted through XXXX, however individual results are provided to prospective and current puppy owners by submitting a Request for Health Results Form, available at www.TSSR.com/Request for Health info.
 
4)If verification of these requirements for the registries is not published nor can be obtained in writing, would you also please indicate this policy.

If you can only provide resource information for a registry you are affiliated with, I would then ask that other discussion participants (i.e. registry members or non-affiliated breeders) provide this information and their policies in answer to my requests above.

Thank you very kindly. M.Dùfy

:

 Sandstein apparently thinks that everything not being a compliment is ipso facto derogatory. There is also another possibility that hasn't crossed his mind: neutral. No English dictionary has (derogatory) or (offensive) label next to the definition of the word nationalist. However, in Sandstein's native language the word nationalist does have a derogatory undertone. Here is the link to the definition of Nationalismus in the most authoritative German dictionary (Duden), where it has a label (meist abwertend) which translates into English as """"mostly pejoratively"""". In German it's used as a pejorative, in English it isn't and it belongs to the neutral register. I suspect that Sandstein mixed two entirely different usage contexts for otherwise related words with the same meaning, in two different languages.
 It was not my intention to make any kind of personal attack. If you look at my edit history you can see that my behavior has been nothing short of exemplary. I have never heard anyone complaining about being offended by calling them nationalist. More often than not, it is I who is on the receiving end of abuse which sometimes provokes abrasive responses. If someone said that they are offended I would've stopped.
 Sandstein's condescending comment about me apparently failing to understand something (what?), justifying the """"educational"""" component of the block by such lack of understanding is borderline insulting. Perhaps Sandstain trains his dog by taking punitive measures when puppy does something wrong, but may I remind him that we're dealing with human actors here that are not Fachidioten with blinders that only respond to Pavlovian stimuli dispensed by the master with his block^Wstick. An administrator should not be making such comments when blocking other users. They shouldn't probably be thinking of editors as offenders that ought to be subject to corrective measures (blocks) for their infractions (policy violations), but at least they could keep it to themselves.
 OK, let's say I crossed the line with nationalist name-calling. I didn't mean to use derogatorily, but I can accept that it is not an appropriate conduct. But what does that have to do with ARBMAC and the excessively long block? As I far I can see the guidelines on the WP:PA require posting a message on user's talkpage and seeking mediation. None of that happened. PA is a community-approved policy which takes precedence over anything ArbCom decides, or any admin """"broadly interprets"""". A week is something that trolls and bad-faith editors get. Surely it's too excessive?
 This whole circus is a result of content dispute with the user who submitted the enforcement request. It was not made in good faith and his ulterior goal is to remove me from editing a set of low-importance articles that are currently not in a NPOV state. He also submitted a sockpuppet investigation against me with evidence such as last-year's sarcastic comment of mine on a sister project, as well as edits that I made years ago. With all that in mind, I must say that Wikipedia community has become very effective at giving partisan editors tools to target undesirable editors - a Byzantine collection of policies which admins overzealously enforce without a second thought, and without thinking of a big picture. Admins in fact are incentivized not to involve themselves, which basically gives the enforcement gun to POV-pushers which are intimately acquainted with all the glorious details of the relevant wikilese. I urge admins to think outside the policy-enforcing request-observing mode and think whether blocking me in any way helps to resolve the pending content disputes.   """,0

 Oregon Vortex 

 Hello Queen Cake!  Your comments to me about the """"veracity"""" and the """"worthiness"""" of my edit to the article on the Oregon Vortex were nothing short of rude.  Have you been there?  Do you believe an eye witness is less reliable than someone with a Ph.D., or less who has NEVER been there?  Someone who has never been in the energy and has had the oppotunity to experience all the things that the article derides?  That """"optical illusion"""" that occurs with two people does not happen in a controlled environment.  It takes place in the great outdoors.  And I have also seen the golf balls, and many, many other things.  I now see that Wikipedia is nothing more than a forum for frustrated editors and writers who have never sold anything worthwhile and this is their last claim to fame, and they're going to go for it for all it's worth, regardless of whether they distort the truth or not.  Getting your name out there is what's MOST important.  What arrogance!!!  You don't even live in the US, let alone Oregon!  I have been to the vortex many, many times, and I will swear on a warehouse of Bibles that all the phenomena is just that:  PHENOMENA.  And by the way, my """"name"""" on this joke of a enclyclopedia is Ms Medium.  That's because I AM a Spiritualist Medium and am sensistive to energies, both good and bad, and I can tell you, yours needs a vigorous cleaning.  MsMedium""",1

Russians could be brutal but at least they did not conduct mass killings and rapes to destroy everything non-oriental. Georgia was fortunate to be under the Russian Empire than Persia.That was the epoch when people could do other things besides war. When they could go to Moscow, St. Petersburg or other places in Europe and get a proper education. That was the time when we built our first opera, first state theater which still stands there.

Macedonians
Hi Realek, sorry if I didn't awnser yesterday, but you seemed a bit angry with me, so I decided that letting some time pass would have helped to calm all down. Now, passing to your last message, let me thank you for having clearly stated your objections. Now I'll try to awnser your points: 
Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia. The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed.
The first part was already there: """"Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia."""" As for the second part, """"The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed"""", I admit responsability; but I only wanted to mean that the birth of the SRoM represented the completition of the formation of a Macedonian national identity, not that Macedonians were """"invented"""" in 1945; an identity that freed itself of the ambiguities and contraddictions that were present in the fathers of Macedonian nationalism, like Misirkov and Delchev. If you want to put it better, feel free to do it.
Greek Macedonians are actually an ethnic group
I think you know quite well how I feel about this, as I clearly stated it in the talk page. But sometimes compromises are necessary; and after all, it's only stated that """"Greek Macedonians"""" live in Macedonia, not that they represent an ethnic group. And it does seem that the Greeks who live in Macedonia call themselves Macedonians,like those that live in Crete call themselves Cretans.
Tito separated Yugoslav Macedonia from Serbia
I think you must have wrongly interpreted this; I simply thought it meant that Macedonia was administratively separated from Serbia, under whose control in the Kingdom of Serbia before and that of Yugoslavia after it had been
There was no resentment towards the Bulgarian repression during the beginning of the Bulgarian occupation of the region, by removing that sentance.
Honestly the removal of this sentence slipped me, but I can't help noting now that the statement is unsourced. Personally, I don't know how Macs reacted to Bulgarian occupation. After all, my field is ancient, not modern Macedonia.
In conclusion remember that I only edited Telex's text, without adding new statements.
In my view, the best way to awnser to those editors who say that the Macedonians were invented in 1945 is in collecting good, strong sources. For example, to make some names, Danforth's Macedonian Question or Poulton's Who are the Macedonians.
As for Telex, you should remember that it's a wiki rule to not bite newbies. Telex is a very recent that is among us only since April 25, and is clearly not a nationalist, but a honest editor who is striving to be NPOV. If you believe to see bias in his editing, remember that every single editor here (me included, obviously) has his POV, and it's a pure illusion that we can kept them out of our editing. This is why wikipedia has great possibilities: because our bias are emended by the work of others. Sorry this was so long. Ciao ;-) """,0

"Pesher theory, Satanic Attack or Religion Novice
One could interpret Dr Thiering's pesher theory as a Satanic attack
to discredit deity in religion... at best. Or one could simply chalk
it down to a novice babbling away.

From St Augustine through 1,000s of saints and experts, deeper understanding
reveals divinity to be real, including that of Jesus and heaven, etc.

The final proof then will be in the Second Coming which pesher theory would
equate to only a human being who is a larger teacher of mankind; but when
Christ comes again shortly and creates endless miracles, as healing across
the entire face of the earth, such tripe as pesher will be seen to be 
what it is, babble, from someone who has no depth of understanding of 
religion.",0

Sometimes around April I thought I have had enough of Internet Networking and Installation , I wanted  knowledge on Microsoft Networking(MICROSOFT SERVERS),Knowledge on SoftWares, Web Developping, So I headed to Icecool Contracts, where I work presently as  Network Engineer, Systems Administrator.

 Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the city 

Dear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2  and Chesdovi) are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag, that is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND  at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the   Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

I don't know whether the Opus Dei adheres to the index or, as it is said, censures new books, but I may say that if, it wouldn't be to blame for it. It has every right over its membership and followers, until forbidden so by the Holy See, that the Holy See itself over all the Church had when it did publish the index.
Though this has been officially denied, I believe the action of H. Em. Bertone against the Da Vinci Code was not far from censuring, and a quite just censuring too according to what one hears about its content (I actually didn't read it, Michael Crichton is better).
That Nietzsche was not included (I'm not sure about Schopenhauer) has I believe the easy reason that there was no need of clarification that his works are non-Catholic, and so """"on the index"""" by general rule without any need of explicity. Of course theoretically, those books Kant wrote on religion (and that includes the Critic of pure r.) would be implicitly on the index as well because he was not a Catholic, but from the very fact that he did believe in God, the Congregation may have felt the status of his books, from the Catholic point of view, needed further clarification. Also, not every work of Kant was listed.
As to its importance as of now, I agree (as a layman and non-theologian) that reading some of the books today not only does not lead to ecclesiastic penalties (as should be sure) but also is not sinful in itself, as no longer any disobedience to Church law (likewise, of course, as to Card. Bertone's semi-censuring) but it may be dangerous and thus imprudent, which can be not free from sin. (?) 84.154.109.57

Introduction
 The introduction """"Rigveda, a tatpurush compound of etc...."""" appears vague. Its as though a knowledgeable audience is being addressed. What, whose, when, where etc. are addressed quite later in the introduction. Are such kind of introductions in fashion or what ? I propose to change it to a more conventional one like the one for Avesta.
how is it vague? Do you mean, overly specific? This is the brief bracket explaining the Sanskrit term, too short for a separate """"etymology"""" section, and too central to be banished to a footnote imho. I see nothing wrong with it. As always, if people don't know what a tatpurusha is, and would like to find out, they can click on the link.  (ᛏ) 

 It's vague for a first-time reader who may think its quite uninteresting or may wonder what is it. That tatpurush is a mouse-click away is not as far-away as the patience that is tested by introducing literary prowess right in the beginning. Besides, the order of merit usually is what, when, whose, etc. Its finer meaning can come in between this list or sometime later. This trend is seen in the pages like Ashok and Sanskrit also. I would like the opinions of others on not only this page, but other such pages also because we must make them readable for the quick-surfer, and for the average Joe. 

 OK just keep it simple like HAL Tejas, instead of a """"tatpurush compound of..."""". That its a tatpurush can be mentioned later. 

this is nonsense. Practically every article on Sanskrit terms on Wikipedia gives a brief translation, and an analysis of the components if the term is a compound. See Yajurveda, Ashvamedha, or any other article you care to look at. And no, we will not dumb down articles towards your image of a """"quick surfer average Joe"""", we have simple: for that sort of approach.  (𒁳) 

Please have a look at Nylon, Human, Aircraft and electricity, all of which either provide a separate mention on the etymology of the same in a section dedicated to explaining the same, or a very short and brief one (as in the electricity article).

Ashvamedha, and Yajurveda similarly need to be cleaned-up from this imagined stretch of yours that """"we will not dumb down articles"""". Excuse me, this is a publicly viewable, highly accessible encyclopaedia meant for all. Thus, the more serious researcher would look at the tatpurusha compound blabber down in the history or etymology section, whereas the high-school student doing an assignment would be more than content with the info provided in the introduction. .

"Request to participate in University of Washington survey on tool to quickly understand Wikipedians’ reputations 

Hello. I'm part of a research group at the University of Washington. In April, we met with Wikipedians to learn what they would like to know about other editors’ history and activities (within Wikipedia) when interacting with them on talk pages. The goal was to gather feedback to help design a tool that could quickly communicate useful information about other Wikipedians. We have now created a few images that we feel represent some of what our participants thought was important. We would appreciate it if you took a few minutes of your time to complete an online survey that investigates whether or not these images would be useful to you.  Your quick contribution would be very valuable to our research group and ultimately to Wikipedia. (When finished, the code for this application will be given over to the Wikipedia community to use and/or adjust as they see fit.)

As other editors have been trying to explain to you, we have no need for an enormous diagram of disproportionate size, particularly when it appears to be copyrighted, and it is not properly sourced by using a spamlink to a commercial site.  Please read WP:NOADS and take further discussion to the article talk page.  (talk) 

I removed the diagram again...it was taking up way too much space and looked copy-pasted from somewhere else.  (Neigh) White Arabian mare

Let's take this to the article talk page, or that of the user.  (talk) 

Hi,

I will address what you said:

1. You are using a copyrighted image: I Have permission to use it. Also there is no copyright over the image (in fact, I will citate you: """"it appears to be copyrighted"""")
2.You are using a for-profit betting site as a source: There is a lot of for-profit betting sites as resources. In fact many of the big bookmakers have their own article in Wikipedia: William Hill (bookmaker). As you may know, they are legal companies (you might like them or not, but that is your personal issue)
4. and the material is not necessary for the article: The material is just for the article. Is the race course of the race.....

If the issue is the image size, we can talk about that, but the issue seems different here.

The other editor didn't explain to me anything. Just remove the material. 

Please, just objective facts, not a lot of: appears to, seems to, intention to.

Is there any big editor's authority? I think that this exceeds already the common sense.

  Sebastiansta

You uploaded the image as your own work, that alone qualifies as a copyright violation; only the owner of the image has the authority to release copyright, via the WP:OTRS system.  It is irrelevant that William Hill has a WP article, it does not make their web page a reliable source for info about the track, and furthermore, that information is more appropriate for the article about the track, not this race.

I would have played it sometime in the years 1983-6; probably at the earlier end of that range.

It was a sort of first-person shooter game, with your (stationary) hunting blind at the bottom of the screen.  At varying intervals, a game animal would come trotting horizontally across the screenalmost like a phantom, you remember those early graphics?and you'd hit the fire button to release a cloud of very slow-moving buckshot.

(I hope this is the right way to reply)
Good question. No, of course, it does bump up the principal. How about this thought experiment: for continual compounding, what if the payment is not made continuously? I only mean this rhetorically. The fact is, the payment period and the compounding period do not need to coincide at all; the compounding period is a convention. I hope I express this properly, and I do not do this on a day to day basis, but my understanding is:
 The compounding per se is on a six month basis, but can be calculated at any time.
 So, if you are late three days (and no grace period, etc), the amount payable is added to principal for this period of time. If you ask the bank (and their systems are up to date), you can determine new principal, which is old principal plus payment amount plus accumulated interest to that day.
 If you pay on the third day, you will have interest payable on the original principal plus the delayed payment for three days at the six-month compound rate (expressed as a fraction of days / six months).
 In fact, this is basically identical to interest on a given sum for x% annual interest for y days. You would pay interest of principal times x% times y/365. It just doesn't get compounded for the interim days (for example, on a daily basis).
 Why six months, etc? I have no idea. That was the convention a long time ago and it has stuck, and I think at one point """"they"""" chose to require banks etc to all quote and calculate on the same basis, rather like an APR.
 The point being any rate/compounding period can be chosen, the calculations are just extra work often dictated by convention/regulation. Hope this is clear. """,0

 Rostling 

Rostling is a alternative form of wrestling, a form of """"Worshiping God"""".  Normally done at small groups, there is always an entertaining match.  The reason it is played in small groups is due to the indisputable fact that it was invented in one of the these such meetings.  Bronski Wookie (name changed for security purposes), is credited with the invention of this game.  There are two judges, both decide the weight classes.  If there is a tie, then the judges decide who is the winner.  The game itself is like wrestling, but it allows a formerly banned hold: the behind-the-head choke hold.  Once in this hold, if held long enough and done right, the captive is forced to tap out due to lack of oxygen.  The rostler most known for this hold is named Justin Bieber.  No, not the girl, the rostler.  Never heard of him?  He often wins his matches by properly executing the choke hold.  
 To play the game 
 1. Both contestants start at opposite sides of the rink.  The judges announce their names, like """"White Bread"""" or """"Whole Wheat""""
 2. The judge starts the countdown, and the two contestants begin to rostle.
 3. A combination of moves are necessary to be effective in this sport, and there are two ways to do it. Finesse or power.  In finesse, one must use many holds and twists.  If one is quick, it greatly increases the chance of success in the match.  In power, one often uses his strength to throw his opponent to the ground.  Both techniques are very effective.  No punching or kicking is allowed
 4. The way to win is to force the opponent to tap out.  There are many ways to do this, the main point is to tire him out, or use the choke hold.
 5. Once the match is finished, the winner is announced by the judges, and they are congratulated.

That, is how you play a match of rostling.

Gender equality is one of this project's central concepts. It was AWOL.
(reposted from Portal_talk:Feminism)

Essentially, variations on Gender equality had been hijacked six or so months ago by redirects to both Zygarchy and Equalism, and had actually begun to affect the conversation across the internet. 

This is bad news, as these terms have nothing behind them but ill-defined assertions. I've rarely been embarrassed for Wikipedia, but this is one of those moments where the site's power was left in the hands of POV/OR mischief-makers.

""""Zygarchy"""" is a made-up word that would never meet the WP:NEO standard if anyone had caught it. It has never meant """"rule of two genders"""" before someone asserted it on Wikipedia. There are a couple hundred blogs out there crowing about the """"new word they'd learned"""" while learning less than zero about notable, verifiable internationally-established gender policy. (Somewhat ominously, """"zygarchy"""" is an obscure but genuine term for an ancient military formation involving two chariots. I think the chariots were used to run infantry over... or to cut them down with a chain between them...)

""""Equalism"""" has been used by notable sources and scholars but never consistently. There was some effort to use it to refer to communism in the fifties, anarchism at various points, and some among the Facebook crowd seem to like it better than """"feminism""""; one news citation in Sweden counts it as a subset of feminism. That is to say, it's a semantic game: There is no """"-ism"""" there, just a desire for one, a moving target without a developed philosophy behind it. I've redirected it to a far more notable article, Egalitarianism.

Nearly every instance of a wikilink to Gender equality had been piped to Equalism. That's what last night was all about for me: finding and removing the plumbing from this phantasm.

I've reestablished the Gender equality article with cites to the UN and an external link to the World Bank. I've added it to the various gender studies and feminism templates. This is one of this project's central concepts, and we really have to watch these pages. Cheers,  ✉ """,0

 The Pit and the Pendulum is a 1961 horror film directed by Roger Corman, starring  Vincent Price, Barbara Steele, John Kerr, and Luana Anders.  The screenplay by Richard Matheson was based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name. Set in 16th century Spain, the story is about a young Englishman who visits a forbidding castle to investigate his sister's mysterious death. After a series of horrific revelations, apparently ghostly appearances and violent deaths, the young man becomes strapped to the titular torture device by his lunatic brother-in-law during the film's climactic sequence. The film was the second title in the popular series of Poe-based movies released by  American International Pictures, the first having been Corman's  House of Usher released the previous year. A critical and box office hit, Pit's commercial success convinced AIP and Corman to continue adapting Poe stories for another six films, five of them starring Price. Film critic Tim Lucas and writer Ernesto Gastaldi have both noted the film's strong influence on numerous subsequent Italian thrillers. Stephen King has described one of Pit's major shock sequences as being among the most important moments in the post-1960 horror film. (more...) """,0

I only asked you if you blame Poland for all German losses. I did not claim knowledge of you mine. There are of course Soviet faults but in total is some 80% of Germans.

>You are a petty nationalist (I would even say borderline racist) who tries to skew everything to make Poland look like the victim of history.

Call me as you want. I call my self as patriot. If Poland was victim of history? Well much more then Germany, more then Russia, more then Belgium etc. We were just between two major powers of Europe in the corridor, flat territory where all goes back and forth. This is the difference between Canada and Poland. Its geographical location. You should think about it.

>Poland is a nation that does not matter on the world stage. GET OVER IT,

No comments. Do you love anything, maybe you only love is dollar?

>don't keep trying to blame others/make excuses for Poland's failure. you can try to blame Germans/Germany for Poland's misfortune,

Do you mean forgot the blood which was bloodshed. You do not know what you talking about. It should be never forgotten just for the sake of future generations. In Germany still Nazi party exists.

>but her own leaders did not act to Poland's best interests in the situation, and that is why what happened happened.

What happened? The II WW? Anyway do you believe Canadian leaders doing good job? It is only shallow impression because some economic prosperity.

>If Poland's own rulers hadn't of weakened her before the partitions, the partitions wouldn't of been successful, end of story.

Yes, democratic countries are weak. Poland was in some sense democratic country (less then USA of that days).
Possibly if you know the constitution 1791 was the second on the world, just after USA. Beside role of “Solidarity” in last century it indicates something. Any way my impression is you know little about Europe history. There a lot of small countries which participation is important.

>asking someone """"are you a Nazi?"""" implies that you think they are. I don't know about in Poland, but when we meet a new person in the English world we don't automatically ask them """"are you a Nazi?""""

It was not automatically in the case of so many German arrogant. It was only an example in conversation with you. It was not a personal question. You to often exaggerate.

> and finally I don't care how or why Poland is suffering!

That is bad. You show many consideration how poorly German were treated expelled from Poland. Now you show no respect to the death in concentration camps. Just beautiful. I could not expect anything more. Now: Are you Nazi?

>I asked for a reference and got it, that is all that was needed. not some lecture from a crusading nationalist who likes to dabble in historical revision (but its more like historical denial)

For sure I need not lecture from you how I should treat my fatherland. Also I need not lecture how to treat German revisionism. I am not revisionist I accept the present borders of Poland ))), I do not look for revision. You do.

>The Potsdam agreement was not a binding agreement, and it never gave the land to Poland, it gave them temporary administration over the lands,

It is you interpretation check the American, British and other atlases. Give me the “temporary” proof if you can.

>and using that administration they expelled and murdered millions of Germans,

millions? Do not be funny. Murdered maybe accidentally a few, it could happened because the post war disorder. After the war, what was German fault anyway. Millions you are absolute arrogant, where came from the number. You will have to apologize I am sure. In total was 3 millions how many death. Such number you are perfect crazy in XIX century Trucks did kill 1.5 million Armenians and we know it and after WW II in center of Europe MILLIONS of Germans. I have no words on you insolence.

I notice that we have a Category:European goddesses. It would appear that most European goddesses are individual personas, just like everywhere else. I think what some writers appear to have done is gather evidence that a particular triplet of goddesses associated with fate seems to be attested across Europe (going way back to whenever).
I think a little confusion arises because this reality was expanded upon and popularised by Graves (19th century) and others, leading ultimately to pride of place for the Triple Goddess in neopaganism (20th century), and later popularised again by certain elements within the feminist movement (late 20th century).
Ultimately, we don't have to restrict material to only one article. I doubt that the US civil war is left out altogether from the article on the US, just because it has its own article. ;)
I think Fuzzypeg's main concern is ensuring that Wikipedia documents the scholarship regarding pre-19th century triplicate goddesses in Europe.

You are saying that it's impossible to tell who did a bad thing first, and I agree. Yet you're saying that founding of Israel set a bad example for Palestinians. Arabs populating the land of Israel (sorry, """"Palestine"""") then, even before they came up with the great idea of calling themselves Palestinians, weren't exactly innocent. I do not think I ever said how it began and who's fault it is. I have an opinion and you can guess it, but it's irrelevant. The question is how it can end. Since there are two peoples and one isn't going to kill the other, the only way is to reach some kind of agreement. This agreement cannot be reached while one is determined to destroy the other. Freeing Gaza is a noble goal and it was within reach in 2005. Destroying Israel is wrong and it just won't happen. Open-minded liberals (I believe it includes you) don't understand that by justifying and backing up the atrocities committed by radical terrorists they causing more suffering to their brainwashed but otherwise innocent subjects/hostages. You are right, this is off topic and most importantly pointless.  """,0

Their earliest British ancestors have settled Australia by vice of terra nullius by meaning to fail to recognise the humanity of the native residents and have long mistreated the natives beyond the time of Japan's tyrannical grip on Korea. For this I put it to you:

Come off it. The Aboriginal people of Australian did not want and don't want to be part of the Commonwealth and subjects of the British Crown

I understand that there are plenty of users who have that affliction, but to me it means they should be that much more careful with how they interact with and react towards others  even more so in a forum such as this where we communicate with each other only with words.

welfare policies are programs that use a collective wallet that is applied by judgement. this is socialism even in your own words. it is called a mixed economy. a non-centralist planned economy with fixed wages is achived through democratised economy, something advocated by all modern socialists, and most early socialists - just not by the traditionally authoritarian and corrupt russia. labour unions are an element of this, a small measure of planned economy with fixed wages by agreement.

 """"The Man of a Thousand Voices"""" 

I took the liberty of editing the following statement:

""""Little has long been known as a top impersonator of famous people throughout the world, which has earned him the nickname """"The Man of a Thousand Voices,"""" a name which notable voice actor Mel Blanc once held.""""

Besides the grammar errors (a title is not a """"name"""" or a """"nickname""""), the latter half of the sentence is not an objective statement  it makes it sound like Little and Blanc faced off in a bid for the title and Blanc lost. That's simply foolish and inaccurate.

Blanc was the first to be given this title and he will forever be """"The Man of a Thousand Voices"""". Little would more accurately be """"The Man of a Thousand Impressions"""", but Blanc's title has been used to refer to Little also by less-informed individuals (primarily media reporters unfamiliar with Blanc or his huge volume of work and repertoire that frankly make Little's look like a dwarf by comparison).

I changed the statement so it reads more objectively:

""""Little has long been known as a top impersonator of famous people throughout the world, which has resulted in him being refered to as """"The Man of a Thousand Voices"""" (a title also associated with voice actor Mel Blanc).

Located on the River Olyokma River, a tributary of the Lena River. Include Olekminsk and Nizhneolekminskuyu HPP of total capacity of 2230 MW.

Aldan HPP

Aldan HPP of Power capacity 1,000 MW, average annual generation 3.6 billion kWh. In the power plant building must be installed hydropower units with a capacity of 5 200 MW.Commissioning of the projects are expected in 2016-2020.

Economic importance

Hydroelectric complex should achieve the following objectives:
Electricity exports to China ,and possibly also to South Korea but only China is interested in buying of power from Russia.
Ensuring reliable power supply to Russian Far East Oblasts.
Ensuring the supply of power to promising projects of mining in South Yakutia, in particular, the Elga coal deposits.
Provision of electricity to energy-intensive industries, particularly, aluminum smelters.
The cost of construction of priority YUYAGEK HPP is estimated at $ 8 billion which less than the single bhasha dam of pakistan at 14 billion.",0

"Moving Deep Ellum 

Hi, and thanks for you work on the Dallas, Texas neighborhoods.  

I do disagree with your move of Deep Ellum to Deep Ellum, Dallas, Texas both (1) because a google search seems to turn up no other Deep Ellums in the world, thus there is no need for the more complex title and (2) because the cut-and-paste move eliminates the page history (which is sketchy because our license, the GFDL, requires it).  

The appropriate thing to do when trying to move a page to an already existing location is to request a move at Wikipedia:Requested moves.  A week or so after listing there, an administrator sees if there is consensus on the article's talk page to move, and then, in this case, would swap redirect and article locations, with page history, talk page and all.  What I'm going to do is place a  on both articles and list it at WP:RM so an administrator can fix it at whichever location is decided by consensus.   | Talk",0

"""Blacks have extremely low visual memory so it is very difficult for them to recall digits in reverse.

Race and intelligence (explanations)#Spearman's hypothesis

IQ tests contain one or more sets of test questions of different varieties. Individually administered tests often are composed of subtests that have different homogeneous item contents. The mean Black-White difference varies considerably across tests with different contents. For example, the BW gap is larger on tests that require the recall of a series of digits in reverse order than on tests that require the recall of a series of digits in forward order. Across a large number of test, the standardized mean Black-White gap varies from near zero to over one standard deviation. According to , """"this variation between tests in the size of the standardized mean W-B difference is not explainable in terms of test bias or in terms of differences in types of item content or other formal or superficial characteristics of the tests.""""

""""The g-based factor hierarchy is the most widely accepted current view of the structure of abilities"""" Correlations between an IQ subtest's g-loading, and the magnitude of the Black-White-East Asian score gap for that subtest (;  pp. 47-8;  pp. 138-9).  For example, the Black-White gap is greater on backward digits span (a test where subjects repeat digits in the reverse order that they are given, and the more g-loaded test) than forward digits span (a test where subjects repeat digits in the same order that they are given, and the less g-loaded test).  As predicted by Spearman's hypothesis, the B-W gap is largest on the most g-loaded tests.  Narrowing of the B-W gap has been seen mostly on less g-loaded tests, such as literacy tests. Murray, C.  (2005) """"The Inequality Taboo"""".  Commentary Magazine, September 2005. Arthur Jensen argues that there is no independent evidence that the environmental explanations commonly given for the Black-White gap (for example, """"past history of slavery"""", discrimination, """"caste status"""", """"peer pressure against 'acting white'"""", etc) have an effect on g (, p. 510).
|The author of multiple factor analysis, L. L. Thurstone (1947), warned """"we must guard against the simple, but common, error of merely taking a first centroid factor, a first principal component, or other mean factor, in a test battery and then calling it a general factor"""".  """"Spearman's g, then, is a """"statistical artifact."""" (C. Loring Brace, 2001)

The gap is larger to recall digits in reverse because blacks are much lower in visual intelligence.

""""a test where subjects repeat digits in the reverse order that they are given, and the more g-loaded test""""

IQ tests are biased against blacks because they are designed to test people with high visualspatial intelligence.

This is obviously original research, but I cannot find no sources that supports my argument (even though I am not black).
