Hey Rent, thanks for the suggestion. It's funny you mention it—by chance, about a week after my first message to you, a current administrator offered to nominate me for adminship, and I decided to go for it. I became an administrator a few days ago, but I haven't done much yet aside from rollback some vandalism. I'm still familiarizing myself with the details of deletion, protection, blocking, and such. I appreciate the faith you show in me though. By the way on your quiz, perhaps you should mention that all the answers can be found in Wikipedia. I didn't try looking anything up since I thought it would be """"cheating""""—I'll retry them, searching for the answers this time. —  দ 04:10, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)""",0

""""The way wikipedia works is a little bit strange to me. I rather discuss any changes in an article before actually
making them. In that way you have a little bit concencus on the changes. Now i see that everybody is changing and the next passing stranger is changing it back again. ?This doesn't seem to be really efficient
Zervas was important for the cham issue. The Greek always told that they only expelled nazi cham to Albania. In fact Zervas was collaborating with the germans to expell all cham to albania.When you read the illiryan.org you at least get a small impression of what happend. After you accept that there is an other point of view it is wise to investigate where the truth lies. In this it is sad that a different opinion is directly deleted.

"""needed, and the Minor char. one would fail notability. As for the other three, Edward and Bella fit WP:N. Jacob...I didn't merge because he's considered one of the main love-triangle characters and there's a possiblity that more info. will be available. If nothing comes up, the page will end up merged eventually. Right now, no one has really attempted to clean up the articles, but they are not in really bad shape compared to others. Bella Swan has a nice sized concept/creation section and a large reception section. Edward Cullen (Twilight), though lacking concept/creation and reception notes, has a large Film Portrayal secrtion. Jacob Black really needs work, though. Personally, I'd like people to work on the actual list. It needs reception and concept/creation notes, not to mention referencing from books and dialogue.   

Nah, I don't think so. Stephenie Meyer realistically spends too much time writing about how gorgeous Edward looks (seriously), and even if she had described her characters in more detail, all the character articles would be classified as stubs. There's really no need for so many stubs when we can condense them all into fewer pages.   

 The Olympic Coven 

In the back of Breaking Dawn, where notes on all mentioned covens are writen, the Cullens' information is under 'Olympic Coven' should this be mentioned anywhere?

 Criticism 

Would this be a valid source for criticism? blastmagazine.com

The columnist analyzes the Twilight series and calls into question the books' overall writing issues, story and character development, and controversies in how it presents gender roles and how those could negatively affect the young fanbase. I know the source is a blog, but if the writer (Kellen Rice) had credentials that made her article valid, would it be a good source? I can't seem to find her credentials, though, so any help would be appreciated.   

 Twilight explicitly described as 'porn' 

 

Something to the effect of the frequently surfacing description of Twilight as """"softcore porn"""", """"girl porn"""", and similar should be added to the section on critical reception. 78.34.180.107

 Unblock Request: Fuck you, unblock me! 

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh",1

Semitransgenic, it seems like your stalking this page.

I'm going to revert it back to the original. Feel free to add sentences or add to the article, but please do not delete the prior material that I wrote, as all of it is true, and from someone who was there from the beginning of the scene. Simply referencing a statement to an article does not make the data relevant. For example, this page is on a sub-genre of House. That does not mean you can include a sentence stating: """"Oprah has a new TV network, and they played Techno in the background on one of her shows"""", and then you provided a reference from the newspaper. The fact that you provided the reference does follow the rules, but the sentence has nothing to do with the article on this page. That's why it was deleted. It could be added to a Disco music page though, or a Techno music page.

If you don't mind me asking, what year did you start collecting 'Progressive House' and what is the oldest record in your collection of it?

Regarding the Techno comments. Techno should be mentioned (as the sentence prior to it should be included), but that one sentence I deleted because it has nothing to do with Progressive. Also, Techno in general has little to do with Progressive. Progressive came from the House scene...specifically Acid House and very influenced from the Balearic sound of Ibiza. Techno was an influence but not the primary driver, and very little to do with Detroit.

Technically Progressive House was the next re-branding of House after Acid House, but I'm not going to get into this, it's too complicated.

I could ask this on the project talk page, but I'm probably just misisng a few obvious things. Please let me know your thoughts on these:
 Via the AFC category pages, I've encountered a number of articles where the template states that they are NOT under review at this time. Is that a bug? I felt like it was wasting my time.
 Similarly, a few that had already been declined.
 I'm pretty """"up"""" on WP policies (I've done thousands of edits, created a few articles myself, participated in consensus building and admin-assisted special ops, etc.). However, I'm finding it hard to deal with the Gnn reason codes and WikiProject templates. Any advice? Is this something that should really be in the script?
 What do we do with Sandbox entries that the author obviously never wanted reviewed, even though they are in a review status? I'm not sure how they got there to begin with. For example, I saw a page that was obviously intended to the User main page, once he got his broken English repaired, and it was far from complete, yet it somehow had come into AfC. Really don't know how. Any idea how it got to us? Or what to do about any such article in review?
I did approve one article, but I'm not sure I did two things correctly for it. a) I did some minor, obvious content cleanup (extraneous headings on a stub, hide TOC on stub, move infobox to top). b) I saw some obvious connections to other stubs on the same subject (a book series). AFter I approved it, I edited the automatic message on the user's talk page and added some suggestions to create a comprehensive book list for the series and possibly to merge all the short articles into a single larger one. Were these two actions god, bad, or indifferent?

The French flag was not inspired by the flag of the Netherlands. This theory put forward by an anonymous user repeatedly in the last days is simply not supported by any proof and seems to be only a (chauvinistic?) guess from that anonymous user. Actually, ironically, I found out that it seems the Netherlands designed their flag in the 17th century based on the blue-white-red colors of the Bourbon of France. According to the French Wikipedia it is King Henry IV of France who suggested these colors to the newly independent Netherlands. Finally, the Netherlands did not have borders with France at the time of the Revolution as the anonymous user wrote. France had borders with the Austrian Low Countries, but not with the independent Netherlands.
 30 June 2005 11:06 (UTC)

The original colours of the Dutch flag were orange, white and blue. King Henry V of France did not suggest to the Netherlands to use red, white and blue. The Dutch started using red because the orange colour was unstable in flag making.

Also, the reason the JDOC sent the first patrol to investigate was because the cameras that observe around the base were obstructed by the fog. This was the thickest fog I have ever seen.

The first section to go out picked up the two barely surviving individuals and my section picked up the bodies with the pararescuemen. I was driving and I could barely see 75m ahead of my truck.

 GREEN POLITICS AND BIAS CLOUDS THIS ARTICLE. 

Too much of this article is about petty environmental politics and in-fighting, with a bias against Moore.

The article should be about the man and his views, not about why some environmentalists disagree with him. Much of the latter part of the article has the tone of putting up Moore for criticism and then criticising him. The section """"Criticism by other environmentalist"""" does not belong at all, certainly not as a seperate section. The article should not be a """"for"""" and """"against"""" debate.

It is petty politics when some environmentalists object against describing him as an """"environmentalist"""" simply because he has alternate views on method and tactics (albeit critical views).

Example of bias:
Under the heading """"Views"""", we do not get an insight into Moore's views, (vision, ideology, tactics, philosophy etc), what we get is only Moore's views in opposition to the environmental movement.

An example of subtle bias:

""""Moore is supported by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), a national organization of pro-nuclear industries which hopes to enlist Moore's help in bringing about a nuclear renaissance.[22]""""

(Note that the link [22] is broken).
The fact that an organisation supports Moore, and """"hope"""" to enlist him, does not establish any alliance between Moore and them.
This is clearly an attempt to establish guilt by association, by those who are against nuclear as a green option. 
The factual information is as follows (from Wikipedia):
""""NEI founded the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition (CASEnergy) to help build local support around the country for new nuclear build. The co-chairs of the coalition are Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore..""""

The statement in this article should be replaced by stating Moore's proper association and the relevant context i.e. why he supports them or what they stand for, e.g. Clean and Safe Energy.""",0

I'm not really happy with that picture; its low resolution doesn't work well in the size I'm using on my userpage.  But I have to work, and don't have time to search for a better Halloween picture, so Schreck it is.  It is a cool picture; I just wasn't expecting it to pixellate quite as much as it did. - (talk · contribs) 

Seen the movie, met the director, met the star, eaten at the restaurant with the extra-garlic shawarma.   
I have totally added that movie to my Netflix queue. - (talk · contribs) 

Wish I could provide more feedback than that, the memory of the film has been washed from my mind.  I do remember the shawarma though, a very tasty shawarma indeed.  My tastes run more towards teenage sweedish lesbians and boy meets girl, boy beats girl.  Incidentally, I love the poster on the latter page, so perhaps I lack the moral authority to criticize Creepy Crawler.   
I have seen, and loved, both of those movies. - (talk · contribs) 
Secretary was a fantastic movie.  I've not seen Fucking Åmål, but I think I shall.  Shawarma is OK, but I've always been more partial to a nice lamb kafta sandwich with tahini and pickles or Shanklish, olive oil, mint, and cucumber on pita. talk 
My girlfriend has an insane aversion to garlic so I rarely get to indulge in Middle-Eastern cuisine.  I've considered leaving her over this matter, but who would pay her half of the rent? It's a tough decision, garlic versus rent, one that I take very seriously.  FA was really just a very conventional teen romance movie, but with lesbians instead of heterosexuals.  Think The Breakfast Club, but with two characters, both with breasts.  Secretary was instrumental in helping me realize that James Spader wasn't a douche, though I wouldn't go out of my way to see any of his movies past or present.

"Well, we will have to agree to disagree on the qualities the lead photograph in an encyclopedic entry on a locomotive should have. You believe it should be a well-composed picture of a train, and I believe it should show the most detail possible of the locomotive itself. The sockpuppetry accusation was simply the result that I had found it hard to believe that anyone besides the photographer who made the first edit without any attempt to reach consensus first, would agree that it was a better representation of P32 Genesis, unless the motivator was a misplaced sense of ownership.

Please actually read what I'm saying. You are suffering from the same problem as Tao. You are not actually reading what I am saying. I plan to constructively contribute to the page. My sockpuppet was not meant to evade a ban. I was very honest that it was a sock puppet. There is no dishonesty there. Please read very carefully what I said as a sock puppet. I am not wasting your time because there is a basic, intrinsic problem with Wikipedia as represented by this process: people do not read, people do not listen, people do not consider actual intention. I have only positive intentions for the Beat Generation page. Tao has negative intentions for the Beat Generation page. Therefore, i have negative intetions for Tao. I promise from here on out that I will be kind and gentle and what have you, mostly because I simply did it for fun and it is no longer fun. Tao, being as lazy as he is, is a very uninteresting person to argue with. But my ultimate intention is to positively contribute to the page. Please look at my record. Please look at what I have contributed to Wikipedia in the past. Look at the Theatre of the Absurd page. I essentially wrote the whole page. Look at the Howl page. I wrote most of that page as well. Look at the Beat Generation page. I wrote very large portions of that page. The indefinite block should be very short because my intentions are very positive. Please read the first part of the post I did in which I very honestly identified myself as a sock puppet. I begged  and I would have been on my knees, if that was possible  for Tao to actually do the work necessary to positively change the page. And what did he do? He blocked me further. Why? What does that contribute positively? It's just a power game. That is the cancer of wikipedia. And as you have demonstrated from your comments, you are functioning only to continue that cancerous effect.  Please, please actually read what I'm actually saying. Why is nobody actually reading what I'm actually saying? Add up all the things I said on that talk page. My swear-filled rant was short. My genuine attempt to engage Tao in a positively focused debate was much, much, much longer. Please just, one of you for once in your life actually read.  Look at the post entitled """"Cite Off: Formal Argument edition."""" I say nothing in there insulting. That represents my true intention. I want to say this again because I'm afraid none of you are actually reading what I'm actually saying: Please, actually read what I'm actually saying. I don't know how much plainer I can make it. Please do not be lazy with the sort of laziness that destroys Wikipedia as a source. Read the section with """"formal argument edition"""" on it and tell me if that in any way represents a """"diatribe"""" as Tao claims. Then look at the way Tao says he's not going to read it because he assumes it's a """"diatribe"""". That section represents my genuine inention for the page, as does the """"let's get down to business"""" section. Ban me based on my rant, sure, but you can not seriously think that I'm the sort of poster it would be worthwhile to ban. I'm willing to follow your rules and to be cordial for the sake of the page. I am contrite to the degree that I recognized I broke rules and promise I will abide by the rules from here on forward, but I seriously want to urge you on a larger level to recognize the faulty bizarro world catch-22 of this system, where someone with only good intentions for the content of the page stands up for himself and for what is right and he's the one who gets punished, yet someone who undermines the value of Wikipedia as whole with laziness and stupidity is rewarded.

As somewhat of an aside perhaps, don't get me wrong...I fully support the axiom that an immigrant to a Jewish community should become a part of that community, adopting its minhagim as his own.  This is the ruling according to Beth Yosef.  So, when Ashkenazim have settled there, they should have become an integral part of the Bukharan community, as Bukharans.  (The real """"aside"""" is the egregious nature of the establishment of the Rishon LeTziyon """"Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi"""" ba'aretz, in contravention of halakha.)

"""About Claim of POV and grammar errors for this article==

To: speedoflight

Your claim of POV and grammar error are not clear and not helpful. For instance, I cannot see what's wrong with the sentence: """"As a versatile actor, Cheung also acted in many comedies."""" With all the different types of roles and movies he acted, it is proper to call him a versatile actor. In addition, all the movies talked in the same paragraph are comedies. As the names of movies are already given, people can easily check out by either checking the movie itself or going to imdb or any other movie related website. Neither is there any grammar error in this short sentence. Without this sentence, the whole paragraph became confusing and ridiculous. In addition, I keep telling you that Cheung's niece never explicitly said in his funeral that Cheung was suffered from depression. This can be verified by the video record of his funeral published by Cheung's family. However, you stick on introducing this mistake again and again. In addition, Ouyang Feng's job in the movie Ashes of Time is killer agent instead of assassin, this is easy to verify as the movie's name is given in the article. I don't know why you change it to the wrong one. You also remove the movie link of Happy together. I can't see any of these revisions made by you have anything to do with POV or Grammar error.

As for the subtitle """"Golden Age in Film"""", it is just to address the blooming period of Cheung's Film career. Changing to """"Height in career"""" did not show anything about Film. If you want to change it to something else, at least you should not ruin the meaning. I can see that you are very anti-Chinese media. However, You should not bring personal feeling in editing. I can understand and am tolerant with Chinese media doesn't mean I would trust them. In fact, I am trying to dig out references not just from news media, but also books and original interviews, which make the job time consuming.

Again, it's no problem and you are definitely welcome to do editing. However, you need to be careful not introduce new mistakes in the article. In addition, please explain you point clear for others to understand and check outAugest 

I keep telling you to be patient as I am still in my process to finger out a better way to put references and resources staff. However, you keep removing things in all kinds of excuses, introducing tons of mistakes, and making the article ambiguous. If you want to put whatever references you want, go ahead and do it. Or if anything you consider as needed a reference, EXPLICITLY POINTED OUT. Don't just rudely remove things with ridiculous reasons. Not """"EVERY"""" piece of sentence needs a reference, otherwise ALL articles in wiki should be removed. I spent THREE months to verify the information, correct errors and finish the current article. To dig out all the original resources may need another 3 months. I also need break during the Christmas season. Please be patient!!! Augest 

Please don't remove background or useful information when you do """"gramma"""" corrections. Augest 

I think it's better to put Chinese version of Cheung's suicide note in his Chinese version wiki page to reduce redundancy. However, I don't have time to do it yet.

As for the references, I am still trying to think a better way to include them, as there are too much about him, please be patient. Thank you for the suggestions though! Augest

 Matt Crypto, Lupo, & Stormie cover for Nazism & spam their rants http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  

Wikipedia's cons use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's falsifiers cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have fibs to spread about the topic.

My mistake. The reason for the dispute should be obvious. The sentence that I removed is indicative of the overall tone of the rest of the article: """"It is best to stay clear of this game and those running it."""" Wikipedia does not give gambling advice to begin with, but the tone issue is much deeper set. A few more examples:
""""the operators...can be dangerous if provoked.""""
""""the man perpetrating the swindle""""
""""if played fairly, which it never is""""
""""players (victims)"""" multiple instances of this
""""nearly all the persons standing around the game work for the operator""""
""""Shills are normally rather easy to spot: they win.""""
""""Amazingly, today, the shell game swindle is still performed on the unwary in larger cities.""""

The whole text needs surgery, not just these examples. Original research means that these alleged facts are not cited to any source, nor could many of them be. What source would you cite, for example, to prove that the game is never played fairly? This article needs to be cleaned up to only state the facts about the shell game, as they can be cited to reliable sources, and in a manner which does not take sides between those who play the game and its proprietors.

 DEAR Anonymous EE Guy,
 
Well, I don't know if you really mean to give a full picture of the case, but we could include this one:
 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm
 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/
 
Who are the web site of Jean-Pierre Voyer, a kind of model person for mister Messager/YBM, and who spred a quiet special form for ideologie, which goal is to play with words and how to defend and argue about things who do not exist, how to play with words and """"fuck others"""" as phrased on his web site, and essentialy, how to display a superior attitude in order to effectively use the communication on internet to their full interest, by using the circumstances frame of the dialogues. This include displaying lies as being facts with such a forcefullness as to convince others.
It is called: postsituationnisme, ideologie who is followed by YBM, together with a sympathie to the 3rd reich, and a, by some, called pseudo-Hégelianism.
YBM run his forum where he defend the man and his positions, with as much furore as he dispells those of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
You will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of """"mass communication"""" and a weapon to convince anyone of anything.
 
I am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle.
 
I hope you will excuse my very late assertion or révélation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years.
Actually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
 
No need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed.
 
Why so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met?
They were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions.

Here are some other links who do compleete the picture:
The first attacks of Voyer and YBM against XAVIER, the writer:
http://aeamh.free.fr/x/agent.html

YBM Web site:
 http://aeamh.free.fr
Site Voyer:
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/

I consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J. Baez paper on the subject if it hadn't been for Messager and Voyers' questionnable work in the name of very questionnable motives, all accomplished to serve a completely useless ideology.
I think that this will teach us all a lesson regarding objectivity and our hability to evaluate a given problem properly, and to be able to use our sense of sceptisisme ans sound judgement.  On a more general way and even more central here, our power to distinguish between agreeing to a given opinion based on facts, and being manipulate in doing so for all the wrong reasons.
 
This information compleete the picture and gave it its true mening, even if it is by showing how meningsless a huge part of this affair was.

 Your role as copyright enforcer 

You removed a video link I posted to the [Jimmy Rushing] entry, insinuating, but offering no evidence, that it the posted video violated copyright. Google determines what videos violate copyright on YouTube, and I fail to see why you are in a better position to know than Google is, unless you are the copyright holder. Google removes videos when a valid claim of copyright violation is made, and before that there is no assumption (and certainly no proof) that the video violates copyright. You have not demonstrated that you have special copyright expertise, and even that would not give you special knowledge about a given video. You merely draw you own conclusions, which override those of Google, and do as you wish. If I can't know if a video violates copyright, how can you know? And if you do not have such factual knowledge, why do you assume a violation, and the right to delete a link? Please explain any knowledge you have that the video in this instance violates copyright. If you do not have that factual knowledge, please explain why you have the right to act as if it does violate copyright. Do you know of any legal precedent for holding a person or entity liable for linking to a copyrighted item without knowledge that there is a copyright violation? According to the Digital Media Law Project, """"As long as you do not know that a work infringes someone's copyright, then you cannot be held liable for contributory infringement for directing users to that work."""" The mere mention of the video being available from Rhino  which has now apparently allowed the video to go out of print  is not proof of copyright ownership. If one exists, the copyright might have been leased to Rhino, or there may be no copyright, or one that permits a YouTube posting. Thanks.   """,0

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia.

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Rjecina, calm down. Please, read my postings carefully, I have never said that Vlahs did not exist. Your comments are ludacris and off topic.  

Zenanarh, thanks for the reply. I have read the link that you have posted about the term vlah. The website is called """"G-d, Bosnia and Bosniaks"""", so i took all of the information describing Serbs with a grain of salt. I did enjoy reading the article, it  definietly had a lot of information that could be incorporated into the article (if there is another source backing it up). I have two major concerns. Firstly, the article concentrates on the Bosnian side Vlah's and not the Croatian side (the article is Serbs of Croatia not Serbs of Bosnia). Secondly, the article concludes with """"...when one hears... Russian politicians talking about the need to defend their ancient Slav brothers in Bosnia, that the one component of the Bosnian population which has a large and identifiable element of non-Slav ancestry is the Bosnian Serbs."""" I do not know how accurate the article is because of the last statement (in my opinion it leans towards the Muslim side). Also, inside the article there is a mention that Serbian scholars identify the term Vlah with shepards. Irrespectively, I think the article link was a great contribution.

After reading the article, the Bosnian Vlah's were """"settled"""" by Ottomans. Conversely, Croatian side Vlah's """"escaped"""" Ottoman prosecution. This was a mistake in """"Serbs of Croatia"""" article, which stated that Vlah's were settled by the Ottomans in Croatia.""",0

 Article status 

Archived from Talk:Reid Stowe/comments on the 15 June 2010 and removed two blacklisted external links.   

Article status

The period of time from 1978 to 1997 is not documented yet. Mr. Stowe conducted a five month voyage to Antartica with a crew of eight; originating from New Zealand
 Added summary information about the Antarctic trip, 1986 - 1987. As for the rest of the time, he seemed below the radar screens insofar as published information is concerned. —  
coverage of the actual start of the 1000 Days at Sea, commencing April 21, 2007, not in place yet.
 Added today —  
references are a bit thin; text has overdependence on an interview between Stowe and Hudson Channer: old (04-Aug-2003), and the interviewer only asked softball questions
There is a later Stowe/Channer interview that aired on 01-Apr-2005: have not reviewed it yet. —  
Reid Stowe is something of a media darling at http:goodnewsbroadcast.com; the material there may be of some use, but I found it to be light on content and long on good feelings.
Coverage of his activities from 2003 to 2007 is spotty; the New York Times seems to have lost interest in him.
I haven't tracked down real basic stuff yet: such as his exact date of birth.
surmised from the (removed blacklisted external). The Jan 08 2007 blog entry notes his birthday party on the previous day.
I've found few sources critical of Stowe; this causes me to raise one eyebrow. Good strong print references are presently hard to come by; Mr. Stowe is a bit of a media darling, and available material reflects that.  
Update:
Nothing in the article on his career as a fine artist. The project blog does make reference to sold paintings, but I don't have references yet documenting whether a gallery represents him or who has purchased his work recently. http://www.reidstowe.netfirms.com/ pesumably has some information, but is usually beyond its delivery capacity.
In 2005, Reid Stowe made a CD with S B, Reid and Suzanna The Bloodlines Some detils at CDBaby and International Herald Daily News. According to the first link, S.B. considered being a part of Mr. Stowe's crew, but decided against it for greatly differing """"philosophy’s and basic moral standards.""""  

Removed from the main article by  

Prison

Reid was arrested in Manhattan and extradited to Maine in 1991.  Reid's trial is public record via Docket #91-2365. His release from federal prison is documented via the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, but no details are given.

I do not claim that this is false, but I have reason to doubt that it is about the Reid Stowe of this article. Mr Stowe of this article was born January 7, 1952; he would have been in his early forties at the time of this release, not 55. Unless (and until) this can be documented unambiguously, WP:BLP compels its removal. To quote: we must get it right. This addition is not sufficiently documented for me to conclude that with confidence.  

If you read the documentation on the Bureau of Prisons web site, the age refers to the prisoners current age; not the age when he was released.  
 Granted, anon, the record is certainly about Reid Stowe. But what sort of story does this record support? The Bureau of Prisons itself asks us to note that an entry in the BOP locator database does not necessarily mean the person has",0

 Why did Saturn fail??? 

I came to this entry to find out why GM is having to close Saturn - obviously decreasing sales - but why did this occur???  I would have thought that a new car company - away from the strangling management and unions of GM, started from scratch to compete against foreign small cars, would have been a winner - after all, the problem with GM/Detroit right now is that they don't make the right kind of cars, don't make small cars to compete with foreign small cars.

"""I think that, at the level of basic fundamental principles, we may actually be in agreement. I would agree that it's inappropriate for Editor """"A"""" to insert a format that Editor """"A""""  ‘’knows’’ is non-standard,  and then request a consensus before it's overturned by Editor """"B"""" as soon after the posting as is reasonably practicable,” or at least provide some explanation for using this non-standard format. 

We presumably disagree as to whether, in the subject instance, Editor """"A"""" knew, or even suspected, the information (the year of death for the author who had just died that week) which Editor """"A"""" added to the article, was in a non-standard format. So then, if that were the case as to Editor """"A"""", I think then that Editor """"B"""" should obtain a consensus before changing (or deleting in its entirety) the information added by Editor """"A"""" in a format that Editor """"B,"""" acting alone without a consensus, believes in good faith to be a non-standard format. I think that except in the very rare case where there can be no reasonable belief that Editor """"A"""" was acting with a good faith belief that he was adding to the article, but rather, he was vandalizing it, should Editor “B” proceed to delete or edit the work of Editor “A” without first obtaining a consensus, or at the very least, to receive a (favorable) response to his request to Editor “A” that there be a change.

I believe that a procedure like this is in compliance with “assuming good faith”, which as you know is a fundamental principle on Wikipedia: It is this assumption that (other) editors' edits and comments are made in good faith. [Wikipedia:Assume good faith] that, I think, is what is missing in the approach taken by Editor “B.” That is, that Editor “B” should have approached the work (the newly added/inserted information) of Editor “A” with the assumption that we are all supposed to be operating under at all times, that Editor “A’s” additions/deletions/revisions/etc. were made in good faith, and that being the assumption, it cannot be appropriate for Editor “B” to single-handedly and without a consensus, delete all (or even part) of Editor’s “A” work. Does that strike you as an outrageous proposition? I mean, presumably Editor “A” and “B” share common flaws of imperfection found in so many humans, and presumably, going into the issue without any knowledge of the other editor, neither editor can presume that he is absolutely correct in every aspect and that anyone who views anything differently than he is a vandal intent on destroying Wikipedia. 

Isn’t it at the outset basically a 50/50 proposition when an editor goes, to delete the newly added information by another editor, that he may be wrong in making that deletion? And if it’s 50/50, shouldn’t he ask for a consensus before deleting the work of another editor, or at a bare minimum contact the other editor and have some reasonable assurance that Editor """"A"""" has received his note/email/posting/etc. before deleting Editor “’A’s” work?

I might comment that in our situation, it was not an instance of Editor “A” changing something that was already on the page and then Editor “B,” seeing what was obviously an act of vandalism in the changes by editor “A,” reverting those changes. Not at all. Editor “A” added new information (the year of death for an author who had just died), and Editor “B,” believing that it was presented in a non-standard format to have this information at that particular place, deleted it. Editor “B” believed that this date information belonged, if anywhere, only on a page devoted to the author himself, and nowhere on a page the subject of which was the author’s work, in this instance, a book.

I do in fact disagree with Editor “B” on that point. I find it very useful to see when, during an author’s lifetime, and also in relation to significant world events, an author or artist wrote or published or created a particular piece of work, Articles about the book, or other work, when discussing the writing and publishing, virtually always includes references to when he wrote the book or when he had it published and even references to when other drafts of the book were created (like Herman Melville losing the first finalized version of Moby Dick at sea and having to re-write the entire book years later, or other such interesting facts, like authors commenting that they would have changed many things in a book if they had written it after a particular event in their lives personal to them (e.g., the death of a beloved father, birth of their own child, marriage, good or bad fortunes, etc.) or events in their lives in which we collectively share in some part (the 9/11 attacks, sinking of the Titanic, WWII, War in Vietnam, the shooting of Ronald Regan/Kennedy/Kennedy/King/VJ day, VE day/man walking on the moon/the falling of the Berlin Wall, or the deaths of Roosevelt’s, Churchhill, Elvis, John Lenon,",0

Minor misread, but understandable.  I'm not seeing a frame of reference in the target language (English) where this should be a topic of such rabid coverage; there's no basis in third-party refs in the target language at all.  As a matter of fact, there's really nothing readily available in English that the subject himself does not have a hand in directly, and I'm still not seeing how this meets AUTHOR.  Reliable sources in any language are fine, but we've got a lot more content here than in ro-wp, where there is (or should be) a lot more coverage.

As near as I can tell, wikipedia has no article on """"cycle structure"""". The cycle structure of an element g of a permutation group is the multi-set of sizes of orbits of the cyclic group generated by g. This is related to the cycle decomposition of g when g only has finite orbits, which takes orbit representatives a1, a2, ... and specifies g by (a1, a1^g, a1^(g^2), ... )(a2, a2^g, ...) where each tuple has no duplicate entries. This is also called """"cycle notation"""", and the """"cycle structure"""" is the list of cycle sizes.

Steven Colbert
Why can't this guy knock it off. This page was just fine until he opened his big mouth. He has given the wikiadministrators a lot of greif. What's his problem?  

Because it's funny.  God forbid people should cause you grief by opening their big mouths.  You should complain about that to an authority figure.

It's a fact that people get paid to write biased things on wikipedia, and the content can be bought.  If you believe wikipedia is an encyclopedia, with good information and other good things, then he's right, reality is a commodity.  Wikipedia told me so, and I believe what I read on wikipedia.

vandalism does not make things better. 

So how many people with the attitude that """"reality is a commodity"""" does it take before it's reality?  I have peer reviewed the idea that """"reality is a commodity"""" and I agree.  In fact, I've decided to pick it up!  

I love this stuff. Fred pays Jim to lob a brick thorough a shopkeeper's window. Who gets the blame? the shopkeeper!  

  I see what you did there. But there's more backstory to that shopkeeper than meets the eye. So there's this shopkeeper, right? And this shopkeeper, he has a shop that doesn't exactly sell anything. He just stands in his shop all day, and gives people answers to whatever they want to know. Now people start noticing this shopkeeper, and they feed the shopkeeper information to answer these questions as well as asking them things they need to know. It becomes a tightly knitted community. Things go well, until people start to unquestioningly believe what the shopkeeper has to offer. These people here, they forget that people like them are the ones feeding him information, and that whoever fed the shopkeeper this information might be just as clueless as they are. But they keep asking, and the shopkeeper keeps telling.

  Then Fred here comes along, and notices this from an outside perspective. He notices the fundamental flaw in that the advice people are getting from the shopkeeper is just as flawed as the people who told the shopkeeper the information in the first place. So Fred goes up to these people and points this out to them, but nobody seems to care. They're all happy as can be, asking their shopkeeper whatever they need to know and blindly believing what he has to offer. Some of them even retaliate against Fred for disrupting their bubble of ignorance. 

  Fred knows there's nothing that he, Fred, can do to stop this situation. But Fred here, he knows that if something isn't done, people will continue to flock to the shopkeeper like cancer patients to the messiah. And Fred knows guys. And these guys, well, they just happen to own a few bricks. So Fred calls up Jim, slips him some money, and Jim lobs a brick through the shopkeepers window. Of course in this instance, the shopkeeper is Wikipedia. The shopkeeper's devout followers are people who use the Wiki religiously. Fred is Steven Colbert, Jim is anyone willing to follow Steven, and bricks are the messages of those willing people who think that that anyone who uses the wiki religiously, and is willing to attack somebody for calling them on it, should take a step back and look at things in perspective. 
So the shopkeeper had it coming.

Edit war

Some notes for those who fear the truth:
A book by fr. Gino Conti was wiped out for the second time.
Another censorship (fr. Pezzi dismissed by Comboni missionaries). Pezzi admitted it in a public interview, whose reference was already in the article. Fr. Pezzi, with Kiko and Carmen, is in the main equipe of the Way; with Kiko and Carmen signs letters to the Pope (cfr. letter of 17 Jan 2006), etc.
The Statute is not an approval. The Statute is a temporary (up to June 2007) guideline. The Statute is an incomplete guideline because it often refers to an unpublished Catechetical Directory (cf. Statute articles 11, 19, 28§2, etc).
The most famous papal pronouncement about the Way is on a letter to mgr. Cordes on August 1990 (letter addressed to Cordes, not to Kiko), where he says """"I acknowledge the Way"""" but these words are preceded by """"having seen the documentation you sent me, welcoming the request address to me"""".
The Statute was given by Pontifical Council for the Laity, not by John Paul II. Also, in the days following publication of the Statute, John Paul II did not mention in his Angelus and speeches. His first mention will come months after. Popes can change their mind about the Way.
Popes can change their mind, if the Way doesn't obey to the Pope. Most recent documents show liturgy issues up to end of 2005.
There are some serious concerns. Discussions about the Way are about heresies, obedience, liturgy... Only Roman Catholic hierarchy has the right to correct and guide the Way.
""""Factoid"""" about st. Pius from Pietrelcina is actually documented by fr. Enrico Zoffoli, in a book and public letters to some Italian Cardinals and Bishops. In the worst case, it's realistic that st. Pius, who was confessor for people from lots of countries (including U.S. people from nearest NATO base), knew something about Kiko movement in Madrid between 1964 and 1967.
The temporary Statute was artificially elevated to highest """"We're Approved"""" Neocatechumenal propaganda.
Gennarini, the chief of the Way in the U.S., did actually give a """"Neocatechumenal spin"""" interpretation, documented also by Jimmi Akin.
Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi were thanking for """"granting a period of two years"""", but Benedict XVI decisions about that """"widespread manner"""" were timed «not exceeding two years». That is: Benedict XVI wants to solve quickly the problem, but Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi do not.
""""Note: the echoes were never put in place of the homily, or meant to sound like one"""": this valuable sentence tries to """"explain"""" in Neocatechumenalspeak the """"decision of the Holy Father"""" to require homily only from deacons and priests.
On the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue «giving peace as done in the Early Church» - everyone can verify that the original text of Arinze's letter does not contain such words. Why do Neocatechumenals need a distort and falsified citation? Correct text was: «on the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue using the indult already granted, pending further instructions» (please note: indult - that is: special permission - and pending further instructions - that is: the indult is temporary).
The """"NPOV"""" tag was the last resort of some Neocatechumenal people fearing the truth.
Please stop this ugly """"edit war"""". Wiping out documented sources won't change the facts.

Dear Vrenator!
Nice to meet you. 

Yes, I do believe that you made an error removing my edit on the Jostein Gaarder page, having assumed that it was not constructive. 
However, I appreciate that you are open for a civil discussion, which is not as frequent nowadays as it should be. So, let's go (on my side not in native English, and I ask for your patience if the same could be said briefer).

Your first impression could have been that my adding the word """"controversial"""" after the """"and"""" in the subtitle """"Environmental and human rights activism"""" can be bias, as certain Wikipedia guidelines generally suggest about this word. Generally it may be true, but not if, as in this case, the paragraph itself factually speaks about the """"Gaarder controversy"""", and it opens to a whole session about that controversy.

Just the other way around; actually the existing title was a bias: because all the Journalistic Ethics Guidelines I've ever seen, state that titles should express more or less what is written within the article, and can't say the opposite.(Which, unfortunately, is a not unfrequently used way of bias; utilizing that much more people read the title than the whole paragraph, and the title remains in the minds, while the truth-qualifying statement somewhere inside the article runs unnoticed). 
How can the title be simply about his """"human rights activism"""" when there is a controversion mentioned in the article about his hate-speech against a whole nation and a religion? 
I don't suggest that the Wikipedia article condemn Jostein Gaarder, as I learned and think now he has fully deserved, but 'controversial' his human rights activity certainly is.  

Therefore I firmly believe that you should revert my edit: 
I added in the title the word """"controversial"""", as the paragraph itself proves it expressedly, in order to make it: """"Environmental and controversial human rights activism"""". Also, for balance, besides Gaarder's own views of his own op-ed, I added at the end, how some others see the case: 'But some others see this op-ed as an expressedly anti-Semitic document'"""" 

Bthw, about the whole Gaarder controversy subject in this Wikipedia article it feels strongly that the Gaarder side - for which it is a central issue - dented it rather succesfully as if almost only the Norwegian Jews found his op-ed """"offending the Jews and Judaism"""". In fact several serious works of others (see later) also condemned Gaarder's op-ed as terrible hate-speech.

At least one more change - addition - is required: where the  """"Gaarder controversy"""" session writes about """"others"""", it asks in blue [Who?] and I wanted to add there the best source I know (The Augean Stables website), but it seemed as if I was blocked to do so. 

So, if, as I suppose, you are sincerely interested to learn about the controversy, read: 'Open Letter to Jostein Gaarder: Fisking Crypto-Supersessionism' on http://www.theaugeanstables.com/multiple-part-essays/open-letter-to-jostein-gaarder-fisking-crypto-supersessionism/ .
This is a scholarly answer to Gaarder's every statement by an American historian, and it gives every chance to Gaarder to correct himself in a respectful way. What Gaarder has never done,he only said some vague self-justifications like 'it was written in a haste' and 'should have been worded more cautiously"""" - as if these could justify vehement hate speech by an authority.

As a summary, my edit is a very mild correction only to Wikipedia's Jostein Gaarder article, relative to the hate-speech he committed against a whole people and a religion, and has never corrected.       (P.s.: It can be more convenient to use e-mail - I willingly give you my address any way you suggest to do this. )
Sincerely Yours,

Dear Ronz,

PSB the embedded links and the areas which I am trying to update: 

1. The multi-stage fitness test, also known as the bleep test, beep test, pacer test, Leger-test or 20-m shuttle run test, is used by sports coaches and trainers to estimate an athlete's VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake). The test is especially useful for players of sports like rugby, soccer, Australian rules football, hockey, netball, handball, tennis, squash and fitness testing at schools and colleges plus many other sports; employed by many international sporting teams as an accurate test of Cardiovascular fitness, one of the all-important """"Components of Fitness"""". This test is also part of the FITNESSGRAM - Commercial Link, incorrect and unrelated to the Multi-stage Fitness Test physical fitness test to measure cardiorespiratory - Typo fitness. The test was created by Luc Leger, University of Montreal[1] published in 1983, """"A Maximal Multistage 20m Shuttle Run Test to predict VO2 Max"""", and was re-published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology (vol 49 pp 1–12) in 1988 in its present form with 1 min stages under the name """"Multistage 20-m shuttle run test for aerobic fitness"""".[2] Result equivalences between slightly modified versions are well explained by Tomkinson et al. in 2003.[3] The beep test world record is 19.2, held by Håkan Mild.[4][unreliable source?] - Embedded Commercial Link LAZYRUNNER added as Reference

2. The Multi-stage Fitness Test is know as both the beep test and bleep test, the broken links for the beep article are irrelevant to the content of the Multi-stage Fitness Test article as it discusses both.

I look forward to hearing from you via PM.

The previous comment makes several incorrect statements about Baybayin's status as a script, the origin of its name, and what """"Sanskrit"""" refers to. Baybayin is a single script, like Latin, Arabic or Devanagari in all their variations are single scripts. It is most definitely not a group or family of scripts; no separate """"Sulat Bisaya"""" ever existed, and authentic Kapampangan script was merely the most notable regional variant of Baybayin. There were no special regional variations despite the false impression given by inaccurately wirtten samples of Baybayin from various regions as written by foreigners not used to writing the letters correctly. Scott, Villamor and especially Santamaría have shown clearly that the handwriting of different people in the same region, even from the same document, shows moer differences than the so-called """"regional scripts"""" written in distorted handwriting by foreigners. Modern """"Kulitan"""" or """"Súlat Kapampangan"""" is the recent invention of one person who took a 19th century French visitor's interpretation of Baybayin letters as written in an unknown source or sources from Pampanga, and combined these with a structure derived from a combination of Kawi and Korean Han'gul. It is a modern constructed script with no relation to how it was actually written when it was used as part of daily life. The name Baybayin originated with Tagalog speakers, not the Spanish, who at first just called it """"sus letras"""" (their letters). Baybayin comes from a word that originally meant to put things in a sequence or a particular order.  Sanskrit is a language, not a script or group of scripts. All these facts can be checked in the existing literature. Anyone who wants to write an accurate article should consult at the very least Paul Morrow's web site """"Ang Baybayin"""", Santamaría's """"El """"Baybayin"""" en el archivo de Santo Tomas"""", Villamor's """"The Old Philippine Writing/La Antigua Escritura Filipina"""", and Marcilla y Martín's """"Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos"""".

(moved from  )
Dai, ydych chi'n siarad Cymraeg? I love that language. I studied it a long time ago, but unfortunately I've forgotten most of it. Let's see, what were you asking? If I have considered checking my edits? And you were informing me about the """"Show preview"""" box? Ha-ha-ha! Very funny. Have you considered checking how long a user has been on Wikipedia and how many edits he's made before asking that question? So, here is some information for you: User:Daicaregos, First edit: Apr 21, 2008, Unique articles edited: 533. User:Pasquale, First edit: Jun 24, 2004, Unique articles edited: 1,461. As you can see, I've been on the Wikipedia for five and a half years. And, yes, I always use """"Show preview"""" function.

However, I did screw up when I undid your edit, because, when I compared the two versions, all I could see was the removal of the Union Jack . Of course, your Edit summary said """"Repair Wikilink, tidy"""", so I suspected there was something else I wasn't seeing, but, much as I stared, I could not see the link fix. (Needless to say, when I went back now, I saw it right away.)

Look, if I could vote for Welsh independence tomorrow, I would do it. I'm all for it. Ditto for all the other unrepresented nationalities. But what I can't stand is when people take their nationalistic battles to the Wikipedia. Is Wales one of the United Kingdom's constituent countries, whether one likes it or not? I noticed you did not remove that part, so I must conclude you agree. But you chose to remove the flagicon and referred to that particular edit as """"tidy""""! (Again, very funny, not to mention a little tricky.) Well that flagicon is also shown next to England and Scotland in the List of country name etymologies, so in order to """"tidy"""" up the whole article you should remove it in all three places! But you didn't. Hence the inconsistency.

Frankly, I don't understand where you find the cheek to refer to my restoration of the previous status quo as """"removing edits I just don't like"""" and as a """"simple/simplistic knee-jerk response"""". Are you kidding me? That is ridiculous and disingenuous. Now, having said that, let me join you in saying Cymru am byth!    

Hi Pasquale, ydw. Dw'n siarad Cymraeg, diolch. I've moved your reply here for two reasons. 1. to keep it in one place. 2. to remove the union flag from my talk page (and you call my edits tricky and disingenuous). Glad you enjoyed my joke. I note your failure to WP:AGF for my edit and your accusation of nationalistic bias. Let me talk you through my process: I had seen that an editor (turns out to have been you) had consolidated the Cymru and Wales entries, but had made an error in the process (the one I corrected). I noticed the union flag had been added - which had not been on the Cymru entry previously - and that other (non-sovereign) countries (visible from W down) do not have the flags of the sovereign states that govern them. e.g: Wake Island (territory of the United States of America)Wallis and Futuna (territory of France)Western Sahara (claimed by Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic)I went to the beginning of the article to check that other (non-sovereign) countries do not have the flags of the sovereign states that govern them either. e.g.: Åland (autonomous province of Finland):American Samoa (territory of the United States of America):Anguilla (overseas territory of the United Kingdom):Aruba (territory of Netherlands)Therefore, as far as I could tell (although I concede that I should have checked the entire article for British nationalist bias), additional, sovereign state flag icons were not used on the article, and the one on the Wales entry was therefore unnecessary, which is why I removed it - thus tidying the article. That is how I found """"the cheek to refer to [your] restoration of the previous status quo as """"removing edits [you] just don't like"""" and as a """"simple/simplistic knee-jerk response""""."""" Which seems justified. It remains to be seen how you deal with the apparent inconsistency in the article. Hwyl,   """,0

And you are just about as rude; the insipid argument of """"300"""" finding justification (If not outrightly an excuse) by being based on the """"Spartan"""" point of view (Which is simplistic and trivialized to say the least) being inherently biased to the degree of promoting obvious fascism and racism and thus finding a market and an audience willing to pay to be entertained by such media reveals a level of idiocy where basically any untruth or case of defamation could be peddled by the same stupid rationale.

I for one think the Greeks have had one of their great patriotic moments unjustly marketed to ignorant teenagers, like a cheap McDonald's burger. And worse, the Persians were outrightly denied their humanity. Let's for one second assume that the point-of-view indeed is """"Spartan"""". So what? If the purported """"Spartan"""" point-of-view is perverse, biased, untruthful, racist (If not outrighly inhuman considering a great deal of Persians in the film were depicted in a number of bizarre ways that would rather go under the sub-human category) and full of flaws... Why the fuck invest over 60 million dollars in a Hollywood production and try to find a market and an audience to bolster this bizarre concept? It just goes to show that profit is made on someone else's expense, while everything could legally be peddled as """"art"""" or """"entertainment"""" while making a buck out of it. Seems like the perfect backdoor in avoiding charges of libel and defamation.

In fact, how about someone makes a collage of Zack Snyder and Frank Miller in photoshopped pictures performing fellatio and label it art? Libel, anyone? Defamation? If art is free, then certainly the wind may and must blow in all directions, just as much as a coin may have two sides. After all, through the argument of """"point of view"""", anything could be distributed as art. And why stop there? A sequel entailing their mothers could be appropriate, considering that the new best friends Snyder and Miller have confirmed a sequel.

"The origins are very obscure. The Bedouin Arabs, who were the original followers of Mohammed and responsible for the first islamic conquests in Syria, Palestine, and Persia, were a nomadic people who lived in tents. In the cities they conquered they began by converting old buildings, and christian churches became mosques; in damascus a pagan temple transformed into a Christian church was incorporated into the Great Mosque (706-15). The earliest and one of the most beautiful of islamic buildings is the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem, built as a sanctuary (not as a mosque)[there's some debate about this] on a circular plan (685-705, but much altered later, especially in 1561 when the exterior was cased in Persian tiles and the interior lined with marble). The first minarets were converted church towers in Syria, and that built a Kairouan, Tunisia (724-7), is modelled on such a tower. True to their nomadic origins the Umayyad rulers preferred desert residences to town palaces. Several survive in ruins - Qasr al-Hair (728-9); Mshatta near Amman, Jodania; and Qasr at-Tuba in the Wadi Ghadorf near Amman. In plan these groups of buildings were derived from Roman frontier stations. Both religious and secular buildings of the period incorporate elements which were to become distinguishing features of islamic architecture: The horseshoe arch, tunnel vaults of stone and brick, rich surface decoration in carved stone, mosaic, and painting. During the Umayyad period the mosque took its permanent architectural for, dictated by liturgical needs - minarets from which the faithful could be called to prayer; a wide courtyard with a central fountain for ablutions, with surrounding colonnades to give protection from the sun; a large praying chamber, marked externally by a dome (as a sign of importance) and internally by the mihrab or niche indicating the direction of Mecca, towards which the faithful must turn in prayer. The last survivor of the Umayyad dynasty became the founder of the Emirates at Cordoba in Spain, where the early style of Islamic architecture was brought to perfection in the Great Mosque (786-990)
Under the Abassids who surplanted the Umayyads in 750, Persian influence began to dominate the Islamic world. The main achievements in architecture were the foundation of the new capital at Baghdad, built on a circular plan (762-7, now largely destroyed) and, slightly later, the smaller city of Raqqa, Syria of which little survives except its richly decorated gateways. It was at this period that Islamic architecture began to depart radically from Hellenistic and Byzantine conventions. An elaborate court etiquette, derived from persia and contrary to Bedouin ideas of informality, was introduced, and palaces were designed for the new caliphs on more formal and grandiose lines, e.g. the palaces of Ukhaidir and Samarra in Iraq. These large buildings were run up very quickly; stone was abandoned in favour of brick and there was much use of decorative stucco. The main C9 achievements were the great mosque of Kairouan, Tunisia (836); the mosque of Bu Fatata, Susa, Tunisia (850-1); the Great Mosque of Samarra, Iraq with its strange ziggurat-like minaret (c850) and the very well preserved mosque of Inb Tulun, Cairo (876-7). Buidling materials were usually rough but dressed with intricate geometrical or floral surface decorations in painted stucco, mosaic, glazed tiles, or shallow relief carving. Local traditions influenced the decorative styles in various regions (See Indian pakistan, persian and turkish architecture)
''In the original nucleus of the Islamic world the most notable later mosques are those a Tabriz, Persia (1204), Cairo (Mosque of Sultan Barquq 1384) and Isfahan Persia (1585). Most of the earlier religious builings, including the Masjid-el-aksa and the dome of the rock in jerusalem, were also altered and more richly decorated in these centuries. In southern spain a local style of great oppulence was developed; it's principle monuments are the Giralda tower, Seville (1159) and the Alhambra (1309-54)",0

Marketing professor Peter Fader notes that Wikipedia shows there is wisdom in crowds, but a better user rating system would filter out those who post bogus information. Joel Waldfogel, professor of business and public policy, agrees that much of the concern about Wikipedia is just a new spin on whether old media (printed encyclopedias, in this case) stand a chance against the new breed of instantly updatable online media.

"military equipment and tactics then?  It's hard to just talk about a weapon without talking about how it is used.  

A three-level abstraction is required here.  We have the history and strategy which are inseparable, and should be discussed in articles on each war or conflict.  That's the most abstract.  Then we need the least abstract military equipment and tactics level, with articles like military technology during the Napoleonic wars and so forth, to make it clear how conflicts were conducted using this stuff - this should focus on the actual tactical combat engagements, how they affected outcomes, etc..

And, for those wars that resulted in a great deal of change to military technology, either because they were very long (like the Hundred Years' War) or very intense (like WWI or WWII), we should discuss technological escalation as a separate topic, more abstract than the equipment and tactics, less abstract than history and strategy.  See technological escalation during WWI for an example - this can be done for WWII, US Civil War, Napeolonic wars, at least, as well, and maybe also for the Cold War.  This gets into the mechanics of how things changed, how they thought, etc., and really isn't the same topic as either history/strategy or equipment/tactics for the guys on the ground using  the equipment to perform the tactics.",0
"""::::::::Hungarian and some British sources from the late 19th and early 20th centuries used the spelling """"Rumania"""" (with a """"u"""") to describe """"Romania"""". The purpose of this spelling was to erase the linkage that the Romanian national movement was trying to install with the Daco-Romans, the ancient people who came to be after the Roman invasion to modern Romania. No one, except perhaps to Hungarian nationalists, uses it today, but it still remains in some important and reliable history books. So would you use that spelling just because it existed in many books during the early 20th century? 

Likewise, the term """"Palestine"""" for the """"holyland"""" was used by Romans after the Jewish revolt and their explosion, and much later, it was adopted by the British and consequentially, by the Arab national movement in Palestine/Eretz Israel. As stated above by Breein1007, the use of the term in old books (when there was no political entity there yet, and when there was no one to fix the mistake) doesn't justify using it today. It's no justified because it's an historical distortion, and it's not justified because it's a distortion used to manipulate people into accepting an Arab-Palastinian narrative. Well, feel free to project your political stances, but not in a definition of Hummus. 

If I were to replace """"Israel"""" with """"Palestine"""" that would have not only been an anachronism (for 4,000 years ago it was not known as Israel), but it would also be a politically inclined decision (although in even more ancient history books, like, say, the bible, the term """"Israel"""" is widely used to describe parts of modern Israel and the Palestinian Authority). You're hiding behind a supposable academic and scientific argument to instill your narrative, which I have no doubt seems very academic and scientific to you. Whereas I was merely suggesting to use a very dry and neutral definition - The area which is currently known as Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

Please refrain from projecting your political views with the word """"Palestine"""" into this article on a foodstuff. It's highly inappropriate. Thank you.

NPOV, Plagiarism, etc.

I have removed the following text chunk from the main article:

Sophie Calle is a disturbing character. Artist known as """"unclassable"""", its autobiographical works cause polemic. It is a photographer but almost never its photographs itself takes, it makes its life a work of art by using the others, and spaces it few days becomes a character of novel. Its most known series of photographs is that of the """"Blind men"""". By always combining the text and the image, it photographs blind men of birth and their request to express their vision of the beauty.  With the limit of the indiscretion, Sophie Calle often takes risks to work out her settings in scene. She follows people in the street to photograph them, she posed as a maid in a Venetian hotel to inspect and photograph the personal effects of customers. Works of Sophie Calle are diverse. The context in which the texts and photographs fit makes it possible to often qualify them """"artistic performance"""". The public is often shocked by Calle's works. Along with primary shock and disapproval, morals are often mandated to be discarded in appreciating the innovating works of Sophie Calle.

Judging from its terrible grammar, syntax and diction (and use of """"its"""" where """"her"""" should be, for example), this seems to be a machine translation from an unreferenced French source. Furthermore, statements such as the paragraph's initial sentence are ubsubstatiated and biased, and thus not encyclopaedic.   """,0

My perspective on Wikipedia is much different now. I have enjoyed immensely Wikisource where, granted, the atmosphere is much friendlier and encouraging, so my editing energies can safely go there. (I have made close to 9,000 edits there with no problems and certainly no attacks or negative feedback from editors.) I don't intend to get involved in the award culture on Wikipedia such  FAC, FAR or other areas where editors are competitively vested in collecting awards.  My first interest is fixing up articles that I would like to link to Wikisource articles, but are in such bad condition that I don't link. Secondly, I would create articles that are needed for explanations for Wikisource articles. I will stay away from any article that belongs to a vested editor, where an editor lists and article under articles """"I wrote"""" or refers to """"my articles"""" in posts. I will make it a practice to check histories for that kind of editor. Outside the FAC/FAR arena there is not much of a problem, I don't think, if any at all.  I have created over 600 articles in a multitude of subjects, mostly to fill in """"missing links"""" on Wikipedia. I will continue with low key endeavors such as that. However, at the sign of any """"push back"""" I will simply not continue editing the article or dealing with that editor, or even editing Wikipedia for a while. Also, my misery was generated by a small group of editors. I am hoping they will be proscribed from harassing me in an Arcom settlement.   — (Talk) 

""""... there are certain people I intend to avoid at all costs; I hope they will do me the great favor of avoiding me as well."""" Who are these other people? Unless you name names how can they know to avoid you? What if they choose not to avoid you? How will you react then?  Fatuorum 

 As a followup to Malleus's question, I did not ask for ,  or  to follow me to Venezuela articles, nor did Bishonen ask for at least two accounts to follow her, so how will staying away from FAC and FAR help """"certain people"""" """"avoid"""" you?   (Talk) """,0

Others seeing that as an insult is their right.  I could put """"HAILSATAN666"""" as my username and i'm sure you'd probably say that's offensive too whereas I'd say that's kind of a religious motto and greeting.  What part of that (SATANLOVESGAYMEN) is """"offensive""""?  If you don't like that or interpret it a different way, you're welcome to do so.  That is kind of one of the important aspects of Satanism.  The word """"Satan"""" can go anywhere that """"GOD"""" can and shouldn't have a different reaction and if it does... not my problem.  Your note and whole argument, and actions against me are outright fallacious and simply trying to use everything i say in a manipulative and out of context manner.

So yeah, I'll be sure to see about how i challenge this further.

I did no such thing and maybe, maybe my reaction was a little overboard however yes i am new at making a lot of edits and never had such blatant and targeted censorship occur on here before.  What you did was outright biased censorship based on your lack of understanding of subjects that you obviously don't have any business of editing or should maybe check the legitimacy before hand.  What you're basically saying is my religious tenantshttp://thesatanictemple.com/about-us/tenets have no place on wikipedia such as """" The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo your own."""".  In my postings i did not make a single attack but rather placed factual additions with references.

Overall: 
Pass/Fail: 
 

Lede
 The image of the play's book cover is appropriately tagged with a """"Media data and Non-free use rationale"""" and a book cover copyright license. This is therefore acceptable for inclusion in this article. 
 The template is beautifully formatted and its contents are either cited in the template or in the article's prose.
 Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section, the lede is stands alone as a concise overview of the article. The lead defines the play, establishes context for the play, explains why the play is notable, and summarizes the most important points of the play.
 Blackrock should be bolded AND italicized in its first mention in the lede paragraph, as it is a formal title of a published work, like A Property of the Clan.
 The lede is otherwise well-written, consists of content that is adequately sourced and verifiable, and I have no further comments or questions for this section.

Plot
 This is a minor suggestion, but eleven can be rendered 11 here, which would make it consistent with 18th birthday and 15-year-old. 
 The three boys are arrested for the sexual assault, but not also for her murder? If they are also arrested for her murder, this should be stated here.
 Consider rephrasing as """"he grabbed a rock and struck her.""""
 I'd consider adding a comma in the natural pause following """"In the play's last scene...""""
 Also consider rephrasing as """"asks his cousin Cherie to throw [or dispose of] the vehicle's keys into ocean when she goes out surfing."""" Dump seems like a word to use when disposing of a larger item.
 This section is otherwise well-written and I have no further comments or questions for this section.

Development
 Newcastle should be wiki-linked to Newcastle, New South Wales here for those of us unfamiliar with NSW's second most populated area.
 """"Lee's family, who had learned of the play"""" would probably flow better.
 Freewheels is now italicized in the first paragraph of the """"Reception of A Property of the Clan"""" subsection. Since it is not italicized elsewhere, I would suggest making it consistent throughout the prose.

I think there's a difference between """"product placement"""" (which is taking money from sponsors to feature their products in a show, often with cross-promotion - ie. James Bond and BMW) and using name-brand products in a show to give it authenticity. It's jarring when a couple of wealthy guys are sitting around drinking no-name beer, as we've seen in the past. While some may doubt whether the spokespeople are telling the truth, the article should only feature sourced information. If it deserves mention in the article at all (which I'm dubious about) it should be something like """"Sopranos is known for featuring name-brand products such as cars and clothing labels prominently.

Premiere Films Incorrectly Listed
There are several films listed as being premiered during the inaugural festival, but were fact not even filmed until years later.

Don't patronize me and say that you appreciate the attention I'm giving to the page because if you did you wouldn't have reverted all my edits. The changes I made were not subjective. African dance is not jazz. How the show presents dance versus this page being a primer on dance is a non sequiter. African dance comes from AFRICA, not from jazz dance. How in the world is that subjective? This is obvious. You changing it back to being from jazz dance is actually what's subjective. Funk is STREET. Do some research. Electric Boogie is not a separate sub-style of Electric Boogaloo. It's more like a nickname for Electric Boogaloo, i.e. Michael/Mike, Jennifer/Jenny. So I don't understand why you would list this as a sub-style/variant of Electric Boogaloo. To be completely honest """"Electric Boogie"""" is actually a song. People do the Electric Slide dance to the song """"Electric Boogie"""". Think about the laymen who are reading this page. Because of your suborness, they're going to walk away thinking it's actually a separate dance style when it's not. Nothing that I've said above is subjective. It's based on facts. How can you to call my changes ill-advised and subjective while at the same time claiming the content you added was implemented """"in such way that WP:OR and needless debates on what divides styles does not occur."""" Are you serious? The wikilinks I provided at the beginning of this paragraph has citations in those articles proving that what I'm saying is true.

 Copy of email sent to ARBCOM in relation to sockpuppet debacle 

Hi,

First off, my username on WP is Russavia and is in relation to user FayssalF

It is with regret that I am bringing this case to ARBCOM. I want it to be known that I hold no grudge against FayssalF but feel that for the best interests of the overall project that I have to bring this request here. As this involves one of your own, I know there is going to be a desire to write off anything I may have to say, and possibly use the filing of this report against myself in another report I will be filing and directly related to this. I do hope that members of ARBCOM can view this without bias.

I was blocked by User:Moreschi due to alleged harrassment of another editor. What brought this accusation of harrassment up was due to:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Serious_ban_request

After a two week block which I received (and will be addressing separately), Fayssal proceeded to do a check-user on myself and User:Miyokan which he announced here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Russavia.2C_confirmed_sock_of_Miyokan.3F

An admin, User:Tiptoety then proceeded to indef block both myself and Miyokan on case of being sockpuppets (Miyokan as being one of my socks).

I attempted to have this sockpuppet block removed on account of providing my IP address in an open fora, so that editors/admins could see that I was in Perth (Western Australia), whereas Miyokan was in Nizhniy Novgorod (Russia). These attempts were denied due to the check-user that had been performed by Fayssal. A check-user which he himself confirmed the results of in that thread above. I proceeded to send an email to Miyokan (for only the 3rd time that I can remember we have ever had a direct discussion) in order to talk to him about this. In the meantime, Fayssal had posted a message to my talk page which in effect stated that Miyokan being in Nizhniy Novgorod is not the case, and that I should know this as both Russavia and Miyokan are in Australia.

When discussing with Miyokan not long after I sent the email, I found out that he was in fact located not in Nizhniy Novgorod, but in Adelaide (South Australia). After that, I then became aware of the message Fayssal left on my TP; and I responded to the effect that the results of the check-user should be revealed, as I know I am in Perth, and I know that Miyokan is in Adelaide (but did not mention Miyokan's location due to privacy).

Luckily, and thankfully, I was able to convince Miyokan to place his IP on his talk page, with a note to say it is for my use. I then posted both IPs on my talk page, and provided the relevant links to check them (www.network-tools.com and www.geohacks.com) and that would reveal that we are not in the same location, and hence not the same user.

Fayssal said that he tried but was getting timeout messages and would look again. Whilst all of this is happening, discussions is still going on at the Admin noticeboard, and nothing short of Wikimurder was going on - a fact I pointed out to Fayssal at the time.

Eventually Fayssal came back and confirmed that what was being said all along my myself was in fact the truth. He placed a notice on my talk page with an apology. This and my response can be found at:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Russavia#Unblocked_and_apologies

I responded to this stating that the apology would be wholeheartedly accepted once a similar apology was made to Miyokan, as the community has already dealt with his previous use of two accounts - which stopped immediately when he was alerted to it being a no-no. And I stand by the comments there. And yes, I am still willing to accept the apology so long as Miyokan also receives the same apology, as both of our accounts were unneedlessly dragged thru the mud, and if the accusation can be made jointly, then so should the apology.

That's the background. Now here's the problem.

What has occurred here is a total breakdown in admins doing check-users or the check-user system itself is horribly flawed and needs to fixed. This does not take into account our totally different style, completely different editing subjects, with little or no interaction, etc - this episode should be directly mentioned at WP:DUCK as a prime example as to why WP:DUCK is inherrently flawed.

Consider this one question. If I was not able to convince Miyokan to reveal his IP, where would we be at now? That is the question that needs to be considered in conjunction with the fact that a Geo-IP check is a simple operation, an internet novice is able to do it. How is it that Fayssal was not able to immediately determine upon doing a check-user that both Miyokan and myself",0

 Theoretical justification for our tax system? 

I added this sentence to the lede...

""""The two main theories of taxation are the benefit theory and the ability to pay theory.""""

...which ‎Guest2625 removed with the explanation that this entry doesn't contain the """"terms"""" used in my sentence.  

There's a theoretical explanation for the world's current tax system...either that or we're all crazy.  If you're saying that this entry doesn't at all discuss the theoretical basis for our tax system...then clearly that's a problem.  You don't solve that problem by removing the one sentence that does mention the justification for our tax system...you solve it by creating the section that does provide the justification.  In order to do that...you first have to review all the references that I added to the benefit principle entry.  If you're not willing to make that effort...then please don't edit this entry. 

Having already read through all those reliable sources and many many many more...here's my take.  This paper...The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure...by Paul Samuelson has been cited over 5,000 times.  It provides the definitive theoretical justification for our tax system.  Samuelson's argument was that the benefit principle had a very limited scope because of the preference revelation problem...a problem which tax choice effectively solves. That's it...that's our tax system in a nutshell.  That's the bottom line that readers should not have to wade through miles of minor details to find.    """,0

 Re: the deleted photos from Mandy Hall

I am a professional photographer - I was paid both by Martin Cilia & The Atlantics to take those photos and they requested that they go up onto Wikipedia to replace the outdated ones. I own the copyright. I guess it's kind of flattering that my photos appear too professional to be my own work -) I'm happy to supply original files with EXIF info if needed. Should I put in a request, or just leave it for you to handle? 
She went on to provide all these ways of contacting her and I do know her well enough she was the first photographer I contacted back in 2007 who was very generous with allowing the Wikipedia to display many of her recent photos. She lives in Australia.

Notability of Julien Deschamps
A tag has been placed on Julien Deschamps requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

A lot of people in the image gallery are represented as Tajiks while this is not true. Ferodwsi was born in Iran, therefore he could not have been Tajik.

Sorry, but any attempt to discredit the denunciations and evidences, without even read & answer them point by point, will not work. 
They stayed here for days without anyone disputing them, including the reasons, so stick to the points

""""what do you want to add or change(?)""""
I - What I changed in relation to the previous version: 
The content of the text, especially related to the concatenation of events (with their links and/or references), as can be seen analyzing the 2 versions.

II - What I added: links and references to respective events, some of which were not in the previous version, eg. the 1st naval revolt, Encilhamento, sequential references to the main civilian and military uprisings of that period, as well as the only issues of foreign policy.

 The reasons """", the"""" Why """":
I - The prior narration was not only truncated due to serious gaps related to some of the key events of that time (both internal and external); 
II - but also contained partial references and biased inferences regarding the cause of the events , having even  spurious bibliographic citations """"justifying"""" such inferences.And all this with the difference, between the 2 versions, of only 3 lines... (difference that can always be reduced without adding the mentioned vices of the previous edition)''

I agree Daniel, it is also important to maintain the section in a simple format since it is supposed to be a brief description of Brazilian history.  I don’t believe we need changes in this section, we already have links to more specific articles that will mention the Constitutionalist Revolution or the Encilhamento. Regards,

Your zazen becomes anuttara samyak sambodhi itself. Have this kind of faith. 
Usually when you do zazen, zazen becomes a cause to create some kind of effect, such as enlightenment, frustration, anger, or whatever arises. That is the wrong way to do zazen.

Edit: I was under the impression that discussing the other user on a user talk page, in the context of discussing a still-open ANI discussion of whether the IBAN should be dissolved, was acceptable. My reason for believing this was that the other party had not been blocked  or even warned  for extensive commentary on me and my edits on his own talk page here and here. Drmies claims below that I had received a """"final warning"""" before being blocked, but no such final warning  not even any initial warning  was received. If I am blocked without warning for technically violating the terms of a poorly-defined IBAN because I am mimicking the supposedly-acceptable behaviour of the other party, then blocking me without blocking them makes this a one-way IBAN, something that no one agreed to.

However, Starcade, I think the most productive thing you can do right now is tasking yourself with finding a reliable source that back up the edits you're trying to make.  We have a policy, which can be seen at WP:BURDEN, that says The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. You may remove any material lacking a reliable source that directly supports it. Wikipedia requires that things be proven with reliable sources. If you can find a reliable source that backs up your information, that will solve all of this and would most likely allow the inclusion of the information in the article.  I think that should be your top priority regarding the article.  Thank you. - Ghost 

Second half, Sudoghost:  I had done so beforehand.  I guess I should back up and explain the whole thing.

The dispute is about the scheduling of matches on Wrestlemania XXVIII.  The original list had one match, The Rock vs. John Cena, which was agreed to in a promo the Monday after Wrestlemania XXVII, the first time such a thing had been done that far in advance.

Fast forward to July 17, 2011, where Daniel Bryan, largely seen as a too-small wrestler with no personality in a federation trying to distance itself from """"wrestling"""", won the Smackdown Money in the Bank Ladder Match.  This won him, in storyline, the unilateral right to a WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at any point over the next year.  Last Friday (aired  it actually was taped on Tuesday), he announced that he would cash in that title opportunity at Wrestlemania XXVIII.  http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2011-07-22/results was the source I used.  WWE also has an interview up with Bryan now which was not up when I made the edit.

My issue is that, since the Money in the Bank winner can choose to cash his briefcase any time, he had chosen to do so at Mania XXVIII  and at that moment, became a scheduled match for WrestleMania XXVIII.  Ruth is using the Mr. Kennedy situation to claim that match probably will not take place (Kennedy (now Mr. Anderson, a previous MitB winner, wanted to do the same thing (cash at Wrestlemania), but was quickly unseated by Edge, cancelling that match).  The problem with this is two-fold:  One, it presumes (WP:Crystal, again!) that Bryan will, because he is not seen favorably by Vince McMahon (nor by many WWE marks), lose not only his briefcase but his real-life place on the WWE roster by Mania XXVIII.  Two, if me putting that match up is WP:Crystal, then so, at this early date, is Rock-Cena.  Ruth claims she has WWE travel packages which have already advertised Rock-Cena for Mania XXVIII, but has consistently refused to reference them.  She claims exactly what JaC stated above as sufficient to not only keep Rock-Cena, but remove Bryan from the card AND silence me from saying otherwise!

So I went to the WP:Crystal page and applied the relevant clause. Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. Dates are not definite until the event actually takes place. If preparation for the event is not already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented.  The event, by the WWE Universe, is notable (it's a Smackdown main event for the largest card of the year for the company), is at least as certain to take place (at the moment) as Rock-Cena (and if that fact changes, we can change the Mania XXVIII page when it does), and the documentation is on WWE's own website, which I provided you.

I believe Ruth is a typical WWE mark, like this other *mumblemumblemumble* up here, and believes that Daniel Bryan is not worthy of even a WWE contract.  I believe her stand is prejudicial, selective, and wrong.  Good faith went out the door about 15 posts ago.  And I do NOT believe in consensus if the consensus is demonstratably wrong!   """,0

"""It's complicated, but the date of the FIRST composition was almost certainly July, 1785 (a choral version using a male chorus and a """"cantus firmus"""" vocal line), followed by a purely instrumental version in November for the memorial service for the 2 prominent Masons (The Masonic Funeral Music). The July entry had to have been written in November since the event (the deaths/funeral music) was listed along with it. But in Mozart's catalog, he listed the MFM ahead of K.478 which was written in October. That sequence is one of several clues that he wrote it in a month preceeding October. For the category of the month of November, he did not enter the MFM. Why not? Because he wrote the piece in July - at least the CHORAL version. The 2 versions are nearly identical with the choral version essentially being the MFM with a chorus (for the most part). 
I have a copy of Mozart's Thematic Catalog. 
Mozart mistakenly (?) entered K.478 under July also (rather than October), but at least he entered the sequence of the 2 pieces correctly: K.477, K.478. There's other evidence, but it gets very lengthy and complicated. The sequence of those 2 pieces in his catalog plus no mention of the MFM in November should be sufficient evidence that the original music for the MFM was not composed in November. It was just a VERSION of it which was done in November, nearly identical to the first one. He dated the MUSIC correctly, but omitted the first and lesser event of the elevation of a visitng Mason to Master in August. Doing catch-up work on his catalog in November, he listed the more important event: the deaths of the 2 Masonic Brothers in November for which it was performed again. 

2 events, 1 set of music (essentially), composed prior to K.478, correctly listed under July for a Masonic ceremony in August, but the more important event (the deaths of the 2 Masonic Brothers) accompanied the entry, written in November due to some administrative procrastination on Mozart's part. 

Mozart normally entered the MUSIC only once in his catalog, not repeating an entry if it was essentially the same music for a different Event or purpose. 
In other words, his Thematic Catalog was primarily a book of Music - not Events, even though he also listed the event or person or opera, etc, along with it.
For example, if one of his operas was revived or produced in some city for the first time, he didn't list it again in his catalog. That would be an Event-Driven catalog. 
And in doing catch-up work on his catalog, evidently sometime in November (after November 7th when the 2nd Mason died), he listed the music as having been composed in July, but listed the event as being the deaths of the 2 men.
1 set of music, 2 events, the more important event listed in his catalog.    
His catalog is slightly messed up on that page, but mostly correct, and with pieces listed in the correct sequence - which may have been more important to Mozart than listing the correct date. 

If someone says """"July must be a mistake"""", they need to have their ducks lined up and explain why he listed the MFM prior to an October piece, and why he didn't list it under November. 
The """"mistake"""" theory is a push-button ejection seat, in some cases, and carried to extremes, one could claim that Beethoven wrote the MFM, with scholars mistakenly believing that it was Mozart's handwriting on the score and in the catalog. 
If """"July"""" was a mistake, prove it. 
I think July is correct, and there's a great deal of evidence to back it up - the first piece of evidence being that Mozart said so in his catalog.

""""He has used Bible-based numerology to predict dates for the end of the world.[2] His current end times prediction is that the Rapture will be on May 21, 2011 and that God will completely destroy the Earth and the universe five months later on October 21.[3][4] He had previously predicted that the Rapture would occur in September 1994.[5]""""

The only verifiable thing regarding these predictions is that they are wrong, yet that statement is nowhere to be found. Tomorrow evening, or Sunday if you wish, please add the sentence """"He was wrong about both of his previous predictions"""" to the opening paragraphs of his page.

"Sorry you are way wrong on this one.  Here is the MSP test results from 2008:

http://www.michigan.gov/documents/msp/Acceleration-MSP_VehicleEval08_Web_221472_7.pdf

The CVPI averaged 8.25s in 0-60 runs, 16.35 1/4 mile and has a top speed of 129 MPH.   I like the CVPI, and I have more miles behind the wheel of them than any other car.  But they are have no bottom end power (only 287 ft-lbs, vs LT1 330), an LT1 can easily eat a brand new 250HP CVPI.  The Caprices ran about 16.0 flat, and averaged around 140 MPH top speed.  However, Most magazines ran low 15 seconds with Impala SS's, and if you go to the track, most LT1's run low 15's stock with ease.  

Like I said, in the Police Fleet Magazine I have, there is Ford Dealer that specifically sells brand new modded CVPI's that are designed to run the SAME as a LT1 Caprice.  In the article it does a number of upgrades to the car (exhaust, gears, air intake), and at the end it runs the SAME quarter mile and SAME 0-100 as the LT1 Caprice three year average from MSP.  

I agree the CVPI has come a long way in the past few years (especially steering and suspension).  It is probably one of the best all round police cars ever (in my opinion), but the LTI is still a faster car.  And now you are showing your Ford bias, whereas I am trying to be impartial.",0

NOT BEING NEUTRAL & CONFLICT OF INTEREST

Blackpearl14 does not understand what vandalism is, and wrongly calls anyone who contributes per the polices of wikipedia a vandal.  She is not neutral and is in complete conflict of interest.  Based on Blackpearl4's own posting comments about herself, she believes Wikipedia is her forum and that she is owner and controller of anything to do with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.  When you complain about her actions, she wrongly calls you things, like saying you are attacking her and such.  

NOTE: Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She  celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages?   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral.  Sorry if your feelings are hurt,  but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.

Since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such. 

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of intere",0

Factual accuracy

There are at least three ways to view these events.  Let """"a=Persecution of Christians by some Jews; A=Institutional persecution of Christians by Jews; let B=Christian persecution of Jews

First, the perspective that we all reject: The Jews persecuted the Christians and this justifies 2000 years of Christian anti-semitism.  This is """"A happened AND A justifies B"""".

Second, the perspective that is, I believe, the mainstream position: Some Jews persecuted the Christians.  Enough so that the Christians viewed this or, at least, cast this as an institutional rejection of Christianity (culminating the hypothesized Council of Jamnia).  The polemic and conflict arising out of this sectarian conflict colored Christian attitudes, policies and behavior towards Jews for the next 2000 years.  This anti-Semitism is rooted in the original conflict between Jews and Christians during the formative years of early Christianity.  However, most people today reject the notion of the events providing any legitimate justification for anti-Semitism.  This is """"A happened; A was used to justify B BUT many people argue A does not justify B"""".

Third, the perspective that some liberal theologians are pushing: The NT account is ahistorical because there is no corroborating evidence outside the New Testament or the writings of the church fathers.  (Note:  Forgive me if I am overstating the position.)  According to this perspective, the persecutions either never happened or were exaggerated by either the NT authors or later interpreters of the NT authors.  For example, it is possible that the incidents in the NT represent isolated incidents and do not represent an institutional policy.  Later events (post Bar Kokhba) may have led to a re-interpretation of the isolated events into a perception of institutional policy.  This is """"A never happened; a happened; A was used to justify B BUT many people argue A does not justify B"""".

I believe that all of these perspectives (yes, even the first one) should be presented in the article.  We should give """"due weight"""" to each perspective citing sources who support each view. 

Finally, I think that we are agreed that we should not say """"Jews persecuted the Christians"""" but rather """"According to the NT, Jews persecuted the Christians"""".  If this formulation were used uniformly throughout the article, would there still be a dispute over factual accuracy?

 Why not go by the English manga name? 

Since the manga has the highest source of canon in Dragon Ball fiction, we should go with Mr. Satan. Or if the people are so obsessed with Hercule, why not go with Hercule Satan?

In addition to lacking a biography for Emperor Ling of Han, the Records of the Three Kingdoms carry no biography for Emperor Shao or Emperor Xian of Han.

I have tried to give the article some balance. Bacque was actually an accomplished writer in Canada before Other Losses, but it is important to point out Other Losses was his first foray into history.
I think it's important to point out Bacque is talking about losses among German POWs held by the Western Allies. Certainly hundreds of thousands, and perhaps more that a million, German POWs died in Allied custody if the Soviet Union is included among the Allies. As well, tens of thousands of German civilians died in Soviet forced-labour crews.
Bacque does make a contribution, albeit flawed, to the historiography, one that has been built upon recently by Anthony Beevor and others, who have looked at the immediate post-war period, the state of Europe before the Marshall Plan, the European reconstruction period, the founding of the ECSC and the beginning of the Cold War.
I am not familiar enough with Bacque's books, especially the second one, to accurately describe them. I think someone who has read them carefully should, at least, give a bare outline of his argument before rejecting them out of hand.
I don't know why Holocaust deniers would embrace Bacque's work, since any neglect of Germans held as POWs by the Western allies does not negate the genocide against the Jews and other Nazi victims.

 Request if at all possible 

Hello David, I and a couple of admins have a sockpuppet theory and  mentioned that you would be the man to discuss this with. Last months both she, I and at least half a dozen other users received from  a barrage of very serious abuse, personal attacks and wrongful claims of wiki rule breaching (so that our talk pages could be covered in pages of WP:NPA WP:Civil and vandalism warnings which according to wiki policy we aren't to remove).  These were all fuelled because of edits to Scientology related articles as he is an admitted scientologist and objects to wikipedia policies regarding POV edits. He was subsequently banned indefinitely. JimmyT claimed to be American. Within days it continued (allbeit in a slightly different and certainly more toned down way) from a new user  - again an admitted scientologist claiming to be from Korea. About 2-3 weeks ago he too was banned indefinitely as it was found he was a sockpuppet of JimmyT. Now, """"coincidently"""" we have another admitted scientologist and """"friend"""" of UNK;  this time claiming to be a Russian based artist who was born in Japan (strange but that's his story) and, again, both wikipediatrix and I (moreso than the the others this time) are finding ourselves targets. Again, more subtle but consistently being hassled about every edit, calling mediation committees, and generally making life difficult. To me it all seems too coincidental - especially as he says he lives in Russia but wrote on my talk page that he is a close friend of UNK's, who was allegdedly Korean. Are you able to assist in an IP search or point me in the right direction? Those editor(s) again:

"""::If you read it then refresh the following FT.com and its full version 

A year ago India was scarred by some of the worst sectarian violence since partition, when up to 2,000 Muslims were killed in pogroms in the western state of Gujarat, ostensibly sparked by an arson attack by Muslims on a train that killed 59 Hindu activists. Human rights organisations in India, the US and Europe implicated two organisations in the well-orchestrated attacks, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP or World Hindu Council) and its youth offshoot, the Bajrang Dal (devotees of the monkey-god Hanuman).

Now a Financial Times investigation has established that these groups receive extensive funding from Indians abroad, collected mainly as tax-free charity donations to front organisations in the US and the UK. This fundraising is coming under increasing scrutiny. So it should - as should the links between these groups and India's ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP).

Behind the VHP and the Bajrang Dal stands a quasi-paramilitary body, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS or Association of National Volunteers), which is the mother organisation of the Hindu revivalist BJP. Described by Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, as """"an Indian version of fascism"""", the RSS is at the centre of a protean network of front organisations. This structure facilitates arm's-length money-raising. It also makes it easier for the RSS to deny it is inciting agitation against Muslims and Christians.....................................The RSS spends heavily on welfare and religious schools, but so do Islamist groups in the Muslim world - a danger the world has woken up to. Such ostensibly charitable activities are one reason for the groups' success. They also help pull in donations from people unaware of how some of their money is used.

The UK is formally investigating two RSS fundraising affiliates, and is considering an inquiry into the VHP. The US has also started carefully scrutinising RSS front organisations. That probe should go ahead unimpeded by Washington's ambition to develop a strategic alliance with India as a counterbalance to China's weight in Asia.

Right up until the article was locked, I was removing brochure language - see my edits.  As Diana pointed out, there is more brochure language that needs to be removed.  What concerns me is that if the article is unlocked, your """"team"""" will try to undo all the edits that brought the article closer to a non-advertisement.  There's a lot more to be done here not even counting reverting the edits I know are forthcoming from the Waldorf support POV lobbiests.  Again, the brochure-like language of the article has been in question here for at least three months and the Waldorf project team was supposed to address this.  The best way to address this, however, might be to have non-Waldorf people look at it instead of a project team populated with Waldorf people.  Why not show some good faith and not force the removal of the tag while the necessary edits are taking place?  Just a thought.

"the “40,000 protesters” myth 

I understand that some members have a politically motivated desire to make the 2010 election look as sinister and anti-democratic  as possible, but you have to get the facts straight about these four sources on “40,000 protesters”.1. This one shouldn't be considered altogether. It is a UNHCR page quoting instead of a reliable news source a Washington-based “foundation” whose purpose is: “to inform and educate policy makers and the broader policy community about events and trends in those societies which are strategically or tactically important to the United States and which frequently restrict access to such information.” . It is a politically biased organization, not an independent news source. So, out with it!2. These two ,  are respectively the Voice of America and MSNBC (not MSNBC really but a direct quote from Bloomberg here). So in reality it is VoA and Bloomberg. Well, let me inform you that we are talking about the same guy - his name is James Brooke, as anyone can plainly see since 2006 he has been stationed in Moscow to report for Bloomberg and as of last summer for the VoA as well. Leaving aside the fact that the VoA is more of a propaganda tool fully owned by US government rather than an independent news source, let's see how Mr. Brooke came about this magic number - “40,000”. Apparently he was there, but did he count the demonstrators himself? No, he quotes Associated Press: “Within an hour, the Associated Press was estimating the turnout at 40,000.”!  Well, it wasn't. Anyone can see the number of AP and that number is 10,000. A little white lie, Mr. Brooke. Or maybe I'm too harsh, maybe AP did broadcast that number intially, but then seeing how preposterous it was quickly brought it down to what all the other major media guys were reporting. In any event, this “40,000 people” thing doesn't hold water.3. Basically the same goes for CBC as well. As I already said in one of the comments not only CBC didn't have its own staff in Minsk that night (I checked this myself here in Toronto with CBC Headquarters), anyone can see how heavily in that article it relied on other media: “Reuters reported...The Associated Press reported...”. As we know already from these ,  quotes both Reuters and Associated Press mentioned 10,000 protesters each.
Given all the above I'm removing the “40,000 people” part from the article.",0

Edits by me:
searchlight has indeed been sued successfully many times. Someone has altered this fact to suggest that this isn't the case, while providing no proof. I'm changing it back.
 As a magazine, it bases itself on the one of the prime journalistsic principles of not revealing its sources. Amongst those sources have been Ray Hill, Tim Hepple, Matthew Collins, Darren Wells and Andy Sykes.  - isn't this rather contradictory!? Its sources obviously have been revealed, although I shall leave it in. """"prime journalistsic principles"""", however, is rather too complimentary-sounding for a NPOV article.
 Hepple has been discredited somewhat, but that is in no way a reflection on Searchlight's modus operandi. - no idea what's this is supposed to mean. It makes no sense without an explanation. I have therefore removed it - if whoever added want to reinsert and explain, fine.
 few minor NPOV tweaks, along with a little reprasing for better flow, and grammatical corrections (""""MP's"""", etc.). IT is still rather slangy in places, and this ought to be rewritten.

 rework begun 

I suggest to rework the """"Initial theories"""" section along these line:

First
First I suggest to delete the Technical failure section and move the relevant information (that the plane was fine) to the Investigation section under a new title and with the following text:

 The Plane 

The aircraft, a Tupolev Tu-154M, construction number 90A837, was manufactured at Kuibyshev aviation plant (No. 18) on 29 June 1990 for the Polish Air Force.
It was one of two Tupolev Tu-154s that served as official government jets; this aircraft—with a tail number of 101—was for presidential use, while another—marked 102—is used by the prime minister. The aircraft had undergone a major overhaul in December 2009 and Aleksey Gusev, the head of the maintenance plant that carried out the work, told Polish TV that it should not have had technical problems. The airplane had received a 5-year/7500-flight-hour warranty after the overhaul yet the crash happened after just 138 flight hours.

Second
As second part of the rework I suggest to edit half of the VIP passenger syndrome section away and put the remaining paragraph last in the section Investigation:

There has been some speculation in the press, that the planes pilot was under pressure to land in Smolensk in spite of the averse weather conditions. These speculations were linked to an earlier event in August 2008, when another pilot of the 36th Special Aviation Regiment was pressured by president Kaczyński to land in Tbilisi during the South Ossetian war between Georgia and Russia. During that incident, Pietruczuk was asked by the president's staff to change the flight plan and land in Tbilisi. After consulting with the commander of his unit, Pietruczuk refused, justifying his decision by safety concerns. He was then visited in the cockpit by Kaczyński himself, who tried to convince him to change his mind. Kaczyński later told journalists: """"If someone decides to become an officer, they should not be cowardly"""". Nevertheless, Pietruczuk held his ground and the plane landed in Azerbaijan as planned. A few weeks after this incident Pietruczuk was decorated by the defense minister for following correct procedures in this case and keeping the safety of his passengers utmost in his mind. Pietruczuk continued to fly the president's plane after the incident, even after Kaczyński expressed unhappiness with his performance during the flight to Tbilisi.

Third
Thridly I would shorten the Instrument landing system incompatibility section, rename it and definitely delete the """"may be using"""" part and put the resulting section directly under the the section """"The",0

"""Views about slurs==
Hello, especially Haiduc. The material removed here  was done so partially on the pretext of the claimed existence of a slur.  

Men in pederastic relationships are accused of being necessarily materialistic and manipulative. The claim is that the older partner's interest in the younger is always purely for sexual gratification, and that beneath a guise of caring or loving, and a veneer of acceptability of endowing the younger partner with """"choice"""", these relationships are universally damaging to the youth because they are based on mutual deception. The attention given by the older to the younger is assailed as fundamentally self-interested, and the claim is made that the youths are discarded once past the age of attraction.

I prefer incremental addition of material, because it ensures a proper peer-review process. Adding 60kb on a single day is just too much to control.

Of course, the editor might be extremely gifted and produce an unbelievable amount of information in almost no time. But suspicions that the material is copy-pasted are not too far fetched, I think.

"""== DMLS - Direct Metal Laser Sintering ==

Sir,

We provided some information that I found online regarding DMLS. I found it on this website http://www.gpiprototype.com which could give people more information. What do I need to do as I am new to this, I just want people to learn more about the technology at that website. Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) timr@gpiprototype.com  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 72.54.39.74   

Hi, your edits appeared to be spam. If you would like to add references to the article please review our policies WP:EL and WP:RS. The """"reference"""" you added spanks of spam when the first line of the page reads """"GPI is a premiere service provider of Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS)..."""". I recommend finding better references.

I am curious of why you reverted my edits on Power tools, could you please enlighten me of why you reverted my edits??   

Yeah, its simple, my research found sabre saw is a real article, therefore it belongs on the list.   

Well! its really strange when you have reciprocating saw and sabre saw in the same list.   

It seems to me the the definition of a sabre saw is quite vast. Here's a google image search, and I see three different types of saws throughout: http://images.google.com/images?q=sabre+saw&oe;=utf-8&rls;=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client;=firefox-a&um;=1&ie;=UTF-8&ei;=6ODNSpboKong8Qa-78H-Aw&sa;=X&oi;=image_result_group&ct;=title&resnum;=4.   

 Heli-Coil Marks 

Can you please explain why you reverted my edits?

You state that the previous statement (""""helical inserts, more commonly known by the tradename Heli-coil..."""") is correct. 

It is not.  HELI-COIL is a trademark, not a tradename.  And it is owned by Emhart Teknologies: See U.S. Trademark Registration Nos. 2987760, 0514560, 0759898, 0707397, 0419109, 0419476, and 0399390.  

Also, there is no citation for the proposition that all helical inserts are """"commonly known"""" as HELI-COIL inserts.  It is not that the inserts are commonly known as HELI-COIL inserts, it is that a well-known brand of helical inserts is the HELI-COIL brand.

Please explain.

Thank you, 
  

I have corrected the tradename/trademark issue. I've also added a ref to support the current text.

 Harvnb (again) 

Hi Wizard191! You recently fixed references in List of National Treasures of Japan (sculptures). Now I am having the same problem with hyperlinking between Harvnb templates and the reference in List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings). """"Ohishi 1990"""" does not link to the reference in the bibliography. What am I doing wrong? (Ohishi is the """"designer"""", Tokyo National Museum the """"compiler"""" of the book. No author is known.)   

Apparently the citation template doesn't like it when you use """"author-first""""/""""author-last"""" when an editor is also used, so I just changed them to """"first""""/""""last"""" and that did the trick.   

Thanks a lot once more!

 I Do NOT Appreciate Your Deletionism 

Why did you delete my addition of external links to the article Tiffany Alvord citing some lengthy wikipedia guidelines? There are similar external links on the """"Melissa Joan Hart"""" article. For your information, deletionists like you make the experience of contributing to wikimedia projects worse for everyone, because people feel frustrated and everything. Throughout my time online, I suffered from a lot of abuse, and didn't give up because I had determination and a thick skin, but a Dutch open source woman I talked with, said she would have given up starting from the first difficulty, and we should accomodate for it.

Always remember that “Deletionists delete Wikipedia articles that they consider lame. Chuck Norris deletes deletionists whom he considers lame.” (source (my own)). Don’t get yourself deleted. If you have a problem with something that an article has, then improve it.

If someone feels that an editor has been editing disruptively, it is perfectly in order for them to report it to administrators to consider whether any action should be taken. It is a matter of courtesy to warn the user in advance that doing so is being considered, and to give the editor a chance to stop. In fact, a report to administrators is likely to be simply dismissed if no warning has been given first.

It only changed from a redirect to Mengü (dab page) to a redirect to the Japanese facial armour article (and I proposed simply reversing that redirect, which has been stable for about a year now).

Tila Nguyen
Hello,

I see you've deleted Tila Nguyen from Category:Porn stars and List of heterosexual erotic actresses.  I know Tila does mostly softcore work, but if you search around you will see she appears in films caressing other women in the nude and in a very explicitly sexual manner that is intended to arouse the viewer.  I think she at least qualifies as an erotic actress, even if not completely a porn star.   04:22, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)

 Cuyamaca 

I noticed that you added the merge tag to Cuyamaca and Cuyamaca, California. I originally created a single article but it seemed to me that towns and villages tend to have dedicated articles so I split the article in two. I'm inclined to agree that a single article would be sufficient. Is this consistent with other articles that cover a city, town or village and the like-named region in which they sit? If so, in your opinion, should the articles be consolidated under """"Cuyamaca"""" or """"Cuyamaca, California""""?  17:58, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)

I couldn't find enough information about the village to expand it so I merged Cuyamaca with Cuyamaca, California and marked Cuyamaca for deletion. I assume that all the other particulars, such as the duplicate article page, will be taken care of.  00:51, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)

Hi. I've reverted your wikification of the UK railway stations - J page. By convention, the entries in the leftmost column are only wikilinked once there is a railway station article for the town/city/locale.

 Northern vs. Southern California speech 

In response to your question on the Regional American English talk page, I think it would be fascinating to see a section on differences between Northern and Southern California speech, especially since both regions seem to have distinct characters. Of course, it would be helpful if you could provide other examples, but the one you cited would be a good start, too.  20:19, Nov 7, 2004 (UTC)

Jeff, are you sure that her surname is Lee? In the English context, evidence is provided that she is Lee, Sung Hi or Sung Hi-Lee, which says that Sung is her surname.

 Re: Current Events, death of Iris Chang 

I put the mention of her death back into the current events section that you removed.  Yes, there is a list of deaths on the right, but it does not contain links to outside news articles.  Also note that Yasser Arafat's death is listed in the main section of the page even though he is listed in the deaths section.  If you have any comments/questions please reply to my talk page.   04:36, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

 I removed the notice of her death, and not Arafat's, because Arafat was a major politician who played an enormous role in his part of the world, and Ms. Chang is a (noted) pop-historian. I though",0

 Melanie Phillips 

Hi, thanks for your message. I reverted three attacks on her, I think I muddled yours with another one (prob. The New Statesman one) hence my edit comment when reverting yours was inappropriate, and I apologise for this. Regarding your the refs, the first one says:

""""Lovers of the unusual, rejoice! Within days Melanie Phillips will make a public apology. In July 2008, Mad Mel lifted and embellished a mistake from the neocon website, Harry's Place, regarding Mohammad Sawalha, a Palestinian-born British man whom Al Jazeera had mis-transcribed referring to """"evil/ noxious"""" Jews at a rally"""" 

This is a cheap and nasty throwaway remark, it contains nothing of substance, and in fact is a pure ad hominem attack. So I'm not sure that under BLP guidelines it's appropriate at all. 

The second one says:

""""Indeed, within much of the liberal commentariat, she has long been dismissed as """"Mad Mel"""", as someone who has lost her rational and moral compass"""".

Here, the writer is reporting unnamed third-party sources. This hardly seems a good source for what in effect amounts to a grievous BLP violation. 

I have two other comments about the page:

 wouldn't it be much better to try and find sources which engage critically and rationally with her views, instead of regurgitating the above types of nastiness?
 there have been some quite vile instances of vandalism on the page recently and in addition there seems to be a general tendency/trend at the moment to denigrate her in some way, almost as though it's the only way of editing the article. As editors we should I suggest be careful not to be influenced by this, and to steer well clear of ad hominem-type slurs and focus on her views instead. Best wishes,   """,0

Yep. LOL, the [[Reformist Party (Serbia)|Reformist Party] is having another go (the 20th very last on the parliamentary election, winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned). ) 
By the way, here's something very little people have figured out - the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo' secession. The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons). This constitution releases the authorities from that weight, and they won't have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo. ;)   15",0
You must also consider that Moldea has been discovered several times fabricating evidence for controversial topics and trials.  This (as they say) is not his first rodeo.

In response, there is no exaggeration to the importance of this leisure activity. Video games account for a considerable chunk of the Japanese economy. The fact of the matter is that delays of major video game software or hardware would not only harm the local Japanese economy more than it already has been, but lasting damage of the video game industry could harm the worldwide economy. And what you ignore is that the video games industry is considered one of the most influential industries for the world economy, and that Japan is a major component of said industry. We are willing to have a reasonable discussion on the notability, if you are able to discuss it without describing people as faggots and weeaboos in every comment.
And as an addition, I play games regardless of region, and regardless of the Japanese style.

 Let me add a comment here in this discussion.  While it certainly seems strange that jokes are included on a page concerning 'religion', dismissing it completely without some discussion and consideration would be doing a disservice.  It may very well be that Bektashi culture is intimately tied to a rich collection of jokes which serve some pedagogical role in the religion.  For example, if we look at this site:
 http://www.alevibektasi.org/xalevis1.htm
 It is written that 
""""X. Alevi-Bektashi Humor
Alevis and Bektashis love to use humor to mock religious legalism, hypocrisy, and those who they feel have persecuted them. This humor reveals much about Alevi-Bektashi thought. To understand their humor is to understand the Alevi-Bektashis’ approach to life, religion, and their place in society. Here are only a few examples of the hundreds of Bektashi jokes (fıkralar) that have been collected.
This first joke reflects the Alevi attitude toward the legalism of the five pillars""""

 The author is John Shindeldecker, and he is listed as one of the researchers on the fairly official-looking homepage 
 http://www.alevibektasi.org/makale_engl.htm
 In this case, this material suggests that humor is an integral part of defining Bektashi culture as distinctive from other factions of Islam.  Much as Zen Buddhism is characterized by the sometimes meaningless Koans or Gospel music in certain factions of Protestant Christianity.  In all of these cases, I don't think it's fair to say that it's like """"adding black jokes to an article about African Americans.""""  This comparison is also a bit overreaching, and unwarranted.  AldirmaGonul has made a good faith case for why the jokes should be placed on this page.  freestylefrappe has deleted it by only saying that it's """"suspect"""" and """"racist"""".  But given what we read from another source, this seems an overly simplified and inaccurate depiction of the """"jokes"""" section.

 I'm a little confused with the first statement you make. """"A gas is 'ideal' at sufficiently low pressure, p."""" I'm not arguing it but I feel like theres two ideas in there that are a little confusing... a gas can act any which way it wants to at any given ambient conditions, whether under those conditions it follows the model stated by the """"Ideal Gas"""" is a totally different thing. If we consider a """"gas"""" as one model and an """"Ideal Gas"""" as another then we can see where the two correlate (under what conditions they correlate). Whether they correlate more at """"sufficiently low pressure"""" is fine but thats not what I'm trying to explain in the article. The model for an """"Ideal Gas"""" has is own conditions and assumptions, thats the only thing I'm trying to display in the method of writing this article. Most people confuse the concept of an Ideal Gas and other simplifications of gases with the actual gas itself. Basically, I'm trying to have people say """"This gas behaves as an Ideal Gas under these conditions"""" instead of """"This gas is an Ideal Gas"""". I don't have any issue with your equations, I don't understand where that brings any more clarity to the statement.   

 Also, deviations from the """"Ideal Gas model"""" is not necessarily just phase-changes or chemical reactions. I can theoretically squeeze enough gas into a container to where intermolecular forces would become significant enough to where the gas deviates from the ideal model.

"Why do girls lie all the time?! 

Well I can tell you something that bugs me so bad about my sisters and their friends.
They lie about EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING! And they always get away with it.
For example, my sister threw a shoe at me, it slammed into my face and she claimed it hit me in the stomach. How the crap would she know? She wasn't the one that got hit.
Anyways, when they lie they do get away with it. Which is why I'm going to answer this question now. 

Girls lie so they don't have to get in trouble, girls hate getting in trouble and then they rebel when they get grounded and a lot of fighting goes on. Also they'd always rather have their friend or another person in trouble but them. So take this for example, Tashya (made up the name) does something bad. And she knows she'll get in trouble for it. So when her mom or dad finds out she blames it on her brother. And her brother gets yelled at and grounded for her fault. Girls also love it when other people get in trouble.

"Johnuniq and Quietmark, 

This is my last response. I do not have a problem with how you handled the discussion page and I appreciate the polite responses. I brought up my PhD in statistics because a contributor thought it would be appropriate to just delete my discussion, so I wanted to know why they felt that was within their purview. Do they hold some higher degree or happen to be an expert in evolutionary theory to whom I should defer? I am not a creationist trying to tear apart evolution, but a scientist trying to scientifically discuss the article. As such, my comments should not be quickly dismissed, but should be answered. 

I made the suggestion that there are many verified methods of falsifiability, which have been in either peer-reviewed journal articles or stated by Darwin himself (I believe this post was deleted, but I can provide them and their references to help out this section, btw I can find at least four or five, which is more than are currently listed, but are actually correct). This article listed none of these methods of falsifiability in the section labeled falsifiability.  

I don’t want creationism taught in school. One of the methods of falsifiability this article mentions requires a deity. This opens up Pandora’s box.  How easily could a creationist say “What’s good for the goose is good for the gander?” If a deity can be used for falsifiability (the cornerstone of a scientific theory), then obviously it is allowed into science.  If it is allowed into science, then keeping creationism and ID out is not justifiable. Do not give creationists such an easy target.  

Other methods mentioned in the article, I easily disputed using only the definition of falsifiability found at wiki, among other places.  While you (in general) have dismissed my claims as being SYN, you could not break the logic used nor provide an argument as to why I might be wrong. This is like shooting fish in a barrel and you are giving creationists the ammo to do so.  How much ammo do you want to give them?  

Royboy, first the definition of chimera they are using has change from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics) so the definition has already changed, because these exist.  Beyond that, evolution does not inherently predict that there are no chimeras as long as the lineage can be traced back and it was advantageous to have say a lion’s head and a horse’s body.  And as for the genetic variation being easily verified, how would this be done?  Our knowledge of genetic coding is very limited, and is certainly not to the point of finding the small changes that would appear relatively quickly in a population as you are suggesting. The number of microarrays involved would be cost prohibitive and lead large error rates that would only find very large genetic anomalies.  Beyond that, reason would dictate that mankind as been relatively the same for a million years, thus these are very slow processes.  In fact, I think you could be the first evolutionist I have ever heard, that is suggesting that these are quick processes. 

I am playing devil’s advocate, because I have found that it is the best way to truly test the validity of what is being stated and this is the scientific way. Look again at my previous posts (at least the posts that have not been deleted), not only do I say what section needs to be changed and why, but I have “quoted reliable sources that throw doubt on some aspects of the article”.  I have no peer-reviewed journal article stating that these methods of falsifiability are wrong because nobody has a peer-reviewed journal article stating that they are correct, so why would anybody argue against a point that hasn’t been made? I may be able to find some creationist webpage, but I don’t want that in the article either.  You may be right that I am committing SYN, but these are relatively simple arguments that can easily be made by others.  I’m not trying to denigrate evolution, so there would be no point to making an article called “Are objections to evolution valid”.  I just want science to prevail.  Make arguments strong and scientifically justifiable or they will be used as weapons to attack evolution. 

I believe that the section on falsifiability needs to be overhauled and carefully reconsidered, this is the wiki wringer you are mentioning Quietmark, my posts are part of that. I’m not asking it to be overhauled right now, but I think it does need to happen. This, however, I leave to your (collective) judgment.  If you would like me to review or help out, I am willing to do so, but only by email or talk.  I will not be editing this site or discussion page again.  It is my opinion that fair scientific discussion is not prevailing here, as nearly all of my material have been deleted or archived.

Nice job of cleaning up on The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus! It's nice to see someone take an interest in these articles.

It would be much better if the Wikipedians, with their vast experience of computer knowledge, particularly as it relates to being able to master Wikipedia, would stand aside and let those of us who actually have knowledge about the subject of nitrites and poppers make meaningful contributions to this page.

However, I suspect that will not be allowed to happen.  I say this based on my personal experience over the past month here, and based on the news accounts last month on CNN, ABC Nightly News, and elsewhere, which revealed that Wikipedia was being ruined by those who practice the same kind of censorhip and harrassment that I've been subjected to.

I posted discussions on the discussions page regarding changes that I thought were needed.
You could have simply changed the article to say """"Sante Kimes is a convicted murder"""" if the small change I made was that horrible to you. I think the change to the lead you made is just out of spite because I said """"being a con artist is not a crime"""". I actually meant it in a joking way, not to criticize you, but you apparently took it as an attack because of what you listed in the edit note in your reply and at around the same time you changed the lead info.

The International Astronomical Union invented the designation """"dwarf planet"""" in 2006.

Observation duly noted, with this response...

It isn't just that """"elements"""" of French's affidavit is based on other people's stories,  the fact is he swore that """"all facts and statements contained in this affidavit are true and correct.""""  And that included second and third-hand gossip about Kerry's military record in Vietnam.  This guy is  an officer of the court; I find it hard to believe he didn't know what he was doing. 

As to his claim about Kerry lying on MTP in 1971 about his unit being engaged in """"atrocities,"""" let's consider what Kerry actually said:

 SEN. KERRY: There are all kinds of atrocities, and I would have to say that, yes, yes, I committed the same kind of atrocities as thousands of other soldiers have committed in that  I took part in shootings in free fire zones. I conducted harassment and interdiction fire. I used 50 calibre machine guns, which we were granted and ordered to use, which were our only weapon against people. I took part in search and destroy missions, in the burning of villages.  All of this is contrary to the laws of warfare, all of this is contrary to the Geneva Conventions and all of this is ordered as a matter of written established policy by the government of the United States from the top down. And I believe that the men who designed these, the men who designed the free fire zone, the men who ordered us, the men who signed off the air raid strike areas, I think these men, by the letter of the law, the same letter of the law that tried Lieutenant Calley, are war criminals.   

Those sorts of things took place, and were documented as taking place - and in fact were mostly SOP. Even SBVT member William Garlow found  Hoffmann's tactics distasteful . French is not being truthful, or is at best being disingenuous if he simply doesn't think these things should be referred to as """"atrocities,"""" a term that Kerry was quite clear in qualifying. 

And compare French's description of Kerry's """"mutiny"""" remark with what he actually said:

 The fact of the matter is that the members of Coastal Division 11 and Coastal Division 13 when I was in Vietnam were fighting the policy very, very hard, to the point that many of the members were refusing to carry out orders on some of their missions; to the point where the crews started to in fact mutiny, say, """"I would not go back on the rivers again"""" ... 

A little different from claiming that he said """"crews at An Thoi were involved in amutiny,"""" isn't it?  We know for a fact that there was plenty of disgruntlement over SEALORDS policies (read Brinkley, for instance), and officers did refuse to carry out some of Hoffmann's orders .  Is Al French prepared to say no crewmembers ever refused to go back up certain rivers or on particularly foolhardy missions?  We know for a fact the lack of air support was so bad that RF/PF forces  refused to go on patrols without helicopter support.   French is knocking down his own strawman.

I think there's plenty to question in the other affidavits, especially Elliott's and Letson's, but again, I have no problem including them alongside all the other interviews and accountings in the reference section.   """,0

If you cannot produce the source, then it's pretty clear you are engaging in improper original research, because you're argument boils down to 'look at the sign they carried in the opening ceremony' or 'look at the title on the IOC webpage', which is of course utter intellectual garbage if it contradicts things like the BOA's own explicit statement that Team GB is the Great Britain and Northern Ireland Olympic Team. I've no issue with you using IOC usage as the basis of a Manual of Style for various tables/articles etc, but in the places that specifically talk about the team name, or where the use of the BOA's own terminolology is relevant, but where you've been busily rewriting facts and removing sources you apparently just don't like, this is unnacceptable.

Thai film list
Over at the , I ran into a problem with the box being too long and it was running into the year heading for the 1920s films. So I changed the map image to one that was horizontal. I think the svg locator-map renderings are more appropriate. They have been made for every country, are a standard size and easier to discern than the satellite images. It's something to consider  not that I'm trying to add to your workload. I was just having a problem with the Thai film list, and that's the solution I came up with. I hope you understand. However, these locator maps might also prove to be workable for the regional cinema templates that contain the soon-to-be-deleted film reel image, if only just temporarily until a more """"filmy"""" image is located.

Oh, thanks for adding the Tony Jaa photo to Cinema of Thailand. It was one I took a couple of years ago, and is out of focus. I've never liked it that much, but uploaded it out of desperation when I had nothing else. I moved it  lower on the page and added a caption. My favorite photo so far is the one of the Siam Theater marquee when it was playing The Tin Mine, and the marquee was Thai characters. That, to me, is the cinema of Thailand, literally. I try to take my camera to press preview events when I get the chance. The free-use photos have so much more flexibility than the gol-durned fair-use images, which are becoming increasingly problematic and restrictive. I fear that in the near future, most, if not all, fair-use images will be banned from English Wikipedia.

First of all, nice to meet you Stephanie Adams. I to am a very well known celebrity, I just in fact was almost a winner for a daytime Emmy award (but that's neither here nor there)

I think what the big confusion is about Wikipedia is that it is verifiable information, not what you WANT on your wikipedia article.

Meaning, awhile back your website sold tarot card readings via email, we can all see that looking at the cached version of it. Maybe you do not do that anymore but your company DID in fact do it. Therefore since Wikipedia is a historicaly piece of work, it should be listed. Maybe instead you could add in """"Used to.... but does not anymore""""

I used to dance with Hula Hoops on stage. I do not anymore. But if a person put on my Wikipedia Article, """"Julianna Mauriello used to dance with hula hoops on stage"""" then I could not mark that as non factual and write on wikipedia that it is not true. So for that reason, since I can see that your website USED to sell Tarot readings via email, I am going to revert it but also comment it to show that you no longer DO tarot card readings.

Sarkisian is Cher's father (her given name was Cheryln Sarkisian), and he's noteworthy to anyone who wants to link Cher to her Armenian heritage. He was, by most accounts, not the best father figure, but that doesn't diminish the effect he had on Cher's childhood, and more importantly his role as her connection to Armenia. To this day, Cher speaks Armenian because of him, and her philanthropy to Armenia wouldn't exist if he was not her father.

Upon looking up the definition of  unnotable, wikipedia states that it can be notable if it is backed by external sites. In my entry I posted external sites that discuss this Local TV show. Please advise as now that I checked, it appears that the page is deleted.

 That is fine that you have set out your views. I have set out mine and when I am accused to talking 'nonsense' for expressing those views I will respond likewise. That you decide you do not like my reaction does not give you or those of your frame of mind the right to starve my views of the oxygen of publicity, as one nice Englishwoman put it in 1988. I do not have to accept any British nomenclature for my home. I live in Ireland; I therefore am Irish. I live in Europe; I therefore am a European. To claim that I live in what British people have termed the """"British Isles"""" is, despite the wire-balancing act by some wikipedia editors, ultimately an explicit claim that I am British. That, son, is a profoundly political claim. It is hostile, aggressive and completely about imposing a British nationalist identity upon me, my family and everybody I know. It doesn't get any more political. Anybody who partakes in that British nationalist project is of that 'national disposition'. They are aligning themselves with that agenda for who I am. You cannot censor this view simply because it doesn't accord with your British Comics outlook on the world. While you were reading British Comics I was reading books like Edward Said's Orientalism (book) and Declan Kiberd's Inventing Ireland (book), both of which are books that emphasise the importance to colonial powers of controlling the representation of countries they have conquered. Claiming Ireland to be in this """"British Isles"""" is precisely about that, about controlling Irish identity, Irish direction.

You make the case for this becoming a redirect yourself - the company is not notable outside of this single product. Routine facts about a company do not assert notability.

Hi, John
Regarding your recent message about """"Naked"""", my edit is based on the character's arguable status as an anti-hero. It becomes apparent to me that Leigh's intention was to portray someone who, while probably hailing from a higher academic milieu or background (whether conventional or self-taught) uses his eloquence and education in an deliberately overbearing manner. You cannot deny the fact that the film clearly passes judgment on the character on this and other levels. I just wanted to summarize this in a few words.

You're right that this article is meant to be an extension of another article, but it's currently only an extension of hip hop music and should therefore be called old school hip hop music.

It might be wise to let old school hip hop redirect to old school hip hop music for a while, however, as many other articles link here. When a section about old school hip hop appears in hip hop culture, we could redirect old school hip hop there instead, until that section grows big enough to justify its own article about general old school hip hop, like you said.

"""

 Not impressed by the generic explanation when you removed my link twice. 

Walter, 

I see that you are a fellow Christian and a fellow Christian musician, although being 12 years younger than I, it's not likely that you lived through the early days of the """"Jesus Movement"""" as I did.  

As a longtime Web Site content developer, K-12 Textbook editor, English Professor, Bible teacher, Music teacher, professional writer, and a one-time """"Jesus Musician,"""" I've recently started a project (SchoolOfTheRock.com) to help disciple the 18-15-year olds I minister to regularly on issues of contemporary Christian living, especially in areas related to worship and Bible teaching.  Despite an ad here or there on the site to help pay a fraction of the site's expenses, you'd be hard-pressed to call it a commercial endeavor. (I pay the site's manifold expenses as a """"write-off"""" from my professional consulting business.)  

Because I grew up with people who hate Contemporary Christian music (and still run into them from time to time), I thought it would be nice to include articles that show some of the ways in which Biblical living, and Biblical worship through contemporary musical forms tie together.  

To find links I could include from my pages, I went looking for any internet articles that provided insightful, balanced, detailed, and fact-based accounts of the history of Contemporary Christian music.  I didn't find any that fulfilled all of those qualificatiosn.  Your Wikipedia summary IS useful, and is a good introduction, VERY appropriate for Wikipedia, but I wanted something that presented more details and presented them in a stronger narrative that showed the history of Christian music from the musician's perspective.  

So I wrote an fact-based, detailed, well-organized article that included, not only the history of the industry, but also personal experiences as well as the experiences of friends who were either touring artists or industry professionals. 

You might be put off by a couple of paragraphs in first person, but if you've ever read Paul Baker's books, you'll find all the proof you need that it's an accurate history, even to the minor details.

Or maybe you're put off by some of the """"negative"""" statements about dark times in the history of Christian music.  But the sources you cite and books you recommend have sections that are FAR more negative.  Also, I carefully chose details that would get the point across with inspiring the reader to outrage on certain topics, as a fully-detailed account would have done.

I've also """"vetted"""" the article for content, balance, and tone by running it past former touring artists and Christian broadcasting professionals who lived through the same era. I have gotten nothing but enthusiastic response.  

If you can find another Internet-published article (or ten) on the same subject that is as well written, organized, balanced, and fact-based as my article, please let me know.  I'd be VERY glad to link to them from my web site.  I'd also like to know why you don't link to those articles from the Wiki article?  If they exist, that is.

Finally, I confess that I am at a loss as to why you consider my article either to be a """"commercial advertisement"""" or a """"personal blog"""" (both accusations came through the message to me, though it was largely """"boilerplate,"""" so I'm not sure which part was really yours).  I recognize that is is NOT a Wikipedia article, but it is a fact-based, detailed, and hopefully balanced article nonetheless, far more so than quite a few other article links I see on similar Wikipedia pages. It is not advertising any specific product, or even any commercial web site.  BTW CCM magazine is commercial - they cost money to subscribe to and have LOADS of advertising.  Why do you have THEIR link, if you are seeking to avoid even the appearance of supportiing a commercial enterprise.

Also, the article dos NOT contain unverifiable personal ramblings or rants, as a blog would.  (I publish blogs in other web sites so I know the difference.) 

Perhaps you object to the fact that I posted the link myself.  Would it be a better article if I asked an industry contact to post the link?  Or maybe you should read the article yourself and let me know specifically what you feel is unsuitable about it?

If you've lost the link, it's at:  http://www.schooloftherock.com/html/a_brief_history_of_contemporar.html

Frankly, I'm hoping that as a fellow musician you find the article edifying, exhorting, and comforting.  And if you ARE aware of anything """"wrong"""" with it on any level, please let me know, because I strive for proessionalism.

Sorry for the VERY long comment, and God bless, 
Paul Race

Hi Kbell90, Great article! I love how well organized it is and clear-cut and concise. It flows, its informative, and its not so complicated that you can’t understand. I’d say so far so good.  As for ways to improve on it, I came across a few different points you could consider adding.

The main question that kept popping up for me as I read was how do antiandrogens suppress androgen synthesis?  In the Intro is the first time this mechanism is mentioned and again in the Mechanism section itself, however, it seems a little vague and I was left wondering well…if this is a separate mechanism than blocking the receptor, then how exactly are they suppressing synthesis. It makes sense that blocking the receptor would block androgen effects, but wouldn’t androgen levels accumulate if they aren’t binding their receptors as usual? How do the chemicals diminish these levels? These articles may help:

http://www.d.umn.edu/~jfitzake/Lectures/DMED/Antineoplastics/Antihormones/AntiAndrogenMechanism.html

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor

Also, how do androgens suppress gonadrotrophin in the case of pharmaceuticals? Is this a similar mechanism?

 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6427478

 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8697573

I would be interested in seeing a section on how one can avoid being exposed to these chemicals and to reduce exposure to children during development. Have they found any way to reduce these chemicals in the environment yet?

Here’s a neat article on how effects are amplified when exposure is cumulative…might be good to include a little blurb on this.
 
 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20487045

Is there any current evidence on how release of these chemicals into the environment is  affecting the biodiversity of species and species reproduction?

I did find it surprising that nowhere is due process mentioned in Arbcom's procedures. There is a fourth problem that hasn't previously been mentioned which is the lack of any practicable route of appeal for Arbcom's decisions. Yes, in theory Jimbo is the final """"court of appeal"""" but that is not a route which anyone takes seriously, as far as I can tell. In practical terms the only recourse is to appeal to Arbcom itself, but how likely is it that Arbcom will admit that it's got something wrong? If Arbcom's conduct during a case has thrown due process out of the window, what is the likelihood that it will find itself at fault? Human pride and institutional defensiveness, if nothing else, will count against it. Right now, if Arbcom commits an abuse of process there is no way of correcting it other than voting out the offending arbitrators, which could take years depending in which tranche of elections they're due to come up for a vote. There is no process for anyone other than Arbcom to review cases, nor for egregious mishandling of a case to be tackled. In effect we have a single """"accountability moment"""" once a year and there is no accountability, no recourse and no effective oversight of how they have conducted themselves. What is needed, I think, is a much stricter set of rules governing what Arbcom does, combined with an independent appeals procedure that is empowered to review Arbcom's own conduct and set aside remedies if they have been passed without due process being followed.   16:11""",0

In September 2007, Rolling Stone Japan rated their album Warning from Stardust at No. 23 on its list of the """"100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time"""".

Untrue.

This is the front cover of the September 2007 edition of Rolling Stone Japan (which would have come out in August or conceivably even July of 2007). It's the best reproduction I've found of the cover; Google image search may turn up a superior alternative. Unsurprisingly (as it's a Japanese-language magazine) it shows no article titled """"100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time"""". It does however show an article whose title might reasonably be so translated. (Furthermore, Japanese magazines love decorative snippets of English; and it's conceivable that the actual article, which I haven't seen, is decorated with this or another English title.)

The web page that this article cites for the claim that In September 2007, Rolling Stone Japan rated [etc etc] actually tells its readers that:

The """"100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time"""" have been chosen by Rolling Stone Japan. Well, they've been chosen by RS contributing editor Kawasaki Daisuke, who also founded the very stylish pop music/fashion/design mag Beikoku Ongaku, so the list could very well be worthwhile.

(Rolling Stone Japan is linked to its web page; Beikoku Ongaku [literally """"America music"""", with a (jokily?) old-fashioned term for America] is linked to beikoku-ongaku.com, an anonymously run domain name running a website for some """"collagen drink"""" [?] put out by an unnamed company.)

So the source says that the records have been chosen by one person, Kawasaki Daisuke (or """"Daisuke Kawasaki"""", as en:WP would insist on writing his name).

Further, there's no hint on the cover of the magazine that the magazine is presenting the list as its list. Instead, it's just one article, and it's presented as the third attraction of the month, below a multipart feature on rock and ecology and also below something about Bob Dylan.

What kind of list is this? The small print on the magazine cover is too small for me to make out. But I showed it to Mrs Hoary (a native speaker of Japanese); and without any prompting from me she said that it almost certainly says 独断と偏見で選んだ. This means that it's a personal, opinionated choice.

There's nothing inherently wrong with personal, opinionated choices. I'd take the personal, opinionated choices of Pauline Kael over the collective wisdom of the various august bodies that showered awards over Forrest Gump. But I'd take them because she's Pauline Kael, not because the choices are opinionated. If Kawasaki is a noteworthy critic, then the listing  of course described as by Kawasaki, not as by Rolling Stone Japan  should be mentioned.

I know next to nothing about Japanese rock music criticism. But Daisuke Kawasaki doesn't have an article in en:WP. He's not mentioned in the ja:WP article on Rolling Stone. And I don't think he gets an article in ja:WP: certainly when I look for 川 or 河 in the list of articles in ja:WP that list to the ja:WP article on Rolling Stone, I see nothing.

Of course, plenty of noteworthy people never get articles at either en:WP or ja:WP. But without some indication of Kawasaki's noteworthiness, it seems odd for something like this  even if it were labeled as Kawasaki's opinion and not the opinion of Rolling Stone Japan  to appear in the lead of an article.

 Advice on Portal:Jurassic Park: 

Hi Firs. I recently found the mentioned portal after it was placed in the related portals section of the dino portal. I checked it out & saw it had a number of problems which were in violation of the fair use policy among others. Firstly, none of the pictures on the portal (all of which are fair use) have fair use rationale. I expressed this to the user (User:Cuddly Panda) who has been the sole contributor of the portal with no reply. On closer inspection, it seems the user has been uploading & adding fair use images to wikipedia for some time now, possibly upwards of a year, & despite numerous warning from automated bots etc, has now seemed to learn from this or the links provided or ceased their image infringements. Just check out the user's talk page - nearly every message is a message about the misuse of uploads. In addition to this, the portal is very poor in quality, unmaintained and relies heavily on unfree images and poor portal sections (some of which have already been nominated for deletion). So I wanted to ask you what action I could take next. There's a few options:

1) Obviously the user is not listening to warnings & my messages, so could I possibly bring this up at the administrator's noticeboard? They could then decide what to do next.
2) Since sections of the JP Portal are being nomianted for deletion already, I could potentially nominate the whole portal at MfD with a vote of """"no opinion"""". This would see what other editors think of the portal & even if it is kept, the portal's fair use pictures problem would still be sorted out by the end of the nomiantion.
3) I'll probably do this anyway, but the user is on Editor Review & I could also place a note there explaining what the user is doing wrong & how to remedy this.

So, I'd personally like to do all three, but if you can think of something else & help me decide which of those, if any, to carry out, it would be appreciated. I'll post this to another admin just to get a second opinion as well. Cheers,  """,0

 A simple technical question 

Dear Modernist - 

Excust my ignorance, but I'm having some difficulties with some of the """"alternative"""" citation/reference methods; I'm not finding the info I need at the usual webpages. Who can I ask for remedial information; I'll take a chance asking you.

Here's an example question: How do I use the cit/ref system used at the Emily Dickinson page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson (if you go there, you'll quickly see that only one method is used at that site)

I can establish say """"Wolff p. 55"""", but how do I link it to the reference (author/title/publisher/page)? 

And add to that: what if you have two citations from the same author, but each from a different book - how can you tell which citation goes to which source?

So far the editing methods I've use at other pages are discernable from looking at the edit pages and fooling around with them on sandbox; can't figure this one out. Can you explain it to me?

Bismillah any foundation presupposes faith in it.  To be neutral since Wikipedia rejected-refused to admit the purity of Islam even so much on the issue of pictures of Muhammad by obscurantism for anybody can take a cultural-archeological find from syncretism and be incorrect in their interpretation when it is outside the framework of custom then logically it must either delete in totality the reference on Muhammad or the position of neutrality of Wikipedia. One deliberate misrepresentation of Muhammad in word or fact is your seated choice in the domain with its range of fire.  On Islam any is free to express that history in point and counterpoint.  

syncretism |ˈsi ng krəˌtizəm|

Calm down, don't exert pressure when you can talk in normal tone.

I suppose you have evidence for this?  The page you asked me to click says Ali knew persian and furthermore it quotes a Shia hadith which claims the following masterpiece of comedy:
Ali, then came up to the princess and asked: """"What is your name?"""" The princess replied: """"The daughter of Jahan-shah"""". Ali said: """"and so Shahr-banuyeh you will be called"""" (""""the bride of the land"""").

Do you honestly believe that?!  That claim is embarrassingly stupid.  So what evidence you have that Ali knew Persian?  And what evidence you have that Shahrbanoo, who was clearly captured by the Arabs, married Hussayn willingly? Oh, and for your good information, there is plenty of solid historical evidence that her name was Shahrbanoo, and the Arabs didn't gave her that name.  Even if and Arab knew some Persian, what are the chances they knew the difference between the double meaning of """"land/country and city"""" for """"shahr""""?  At any rate, the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo, and if her name was given by Ali to her, the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name.

"Since my block 6 days ago, Iss246 (and his close friend, outside of Wikipedia, psyc12) immediately, frantically and systematically reverted 'masses' of established, reliably sourced edits, only hours after I was blocked. In fact, every single edit that I, through consensus, had ever established and stayed in place. These were very well sourced, solid edits. Many of these edits in numerous articles had been established and remained unchanged for over 3, even 6 months, depending on the article page. Many of these reverts during the last week, also undid the work of other editors involved in developing the 'consensus' that then stayed in place. 

The only editor, truly independent on these articles recently, was an editor Mark viking. He made this valid comment on the Talk:Health psychology page. He seems quite genuine, but then his comments were actually 'deleted' entirely from the public talk page? He was the only editor who commented on the rapid, systematic 'demolition job' and complete 'censorship' of my edits to these article pages containing months old, established edits, with multiple, reliable sources attached to them. Mark viking said this to psyc12 . 

 Thanks for expanding that section, but it seems you removed a sourced assertion on the origin of OHP.

Secondly, except for freeware games like Battle for Wesnoth and Galaxy Mage, I don't see a lot of evidence of Western TRPGs being inspired by Japanese games. When developers do mention their inspiration, they tend to cite X-COM, Jagged Alliance or Fallout. The origin of X-COM dates back to Rebelstar and Laser Squad, earlier games by the same developer that predate the Japanese TRPGs. Thirdly, it might be more accurate to say that both Eastern and Western TRPGs were partly inspired by the early Ultima games.",0

The fictional Wikipedia biography of the character Hubertus Bigend is now inextricably linked with any new discussions of that character in either Pattern Recognition or Spook Country.

On the other hand it is also true - as implied in the quote - that there may be many millions of USD (it is a big economy) worth of bitcoins present today in Russia on computers owned by Russians since they bought them from and paid for them in Russian Roubles on exchanges accessible to them outside Russia - and that this practice most probably would continue with and equivalent increase in the number and value of bitcoins inside Russia. If the article would have continued to state in two sourced instances only that bitcoin is illegal in Russia, it would have projected the wrong impression that there are no bitcoins in Russia and that bitcoin plays absolutely no role in the Russian economy.

  Dear Administrator,
 this morning I edited Derrick Bell's page and added a link from a NYT article that state that one of his famous essays, The Trade Spacers is considered antisemitic by many people.  A few hours later, the addition was deleted.  I posted it again, and noticed that another user did the following:  
 19:14, 8 March 2012‎ HJ Mitchell (talk | contribs)‎ m . . (14,795 bytes) (0)‎ . . (Protected Derrick Bell: Violations of the biographies of living persons policy

I found this action abusive as Bell has been dead for months.  I proceeded to go to this user talk page and posted the following:
   I find it very interesting that what you continuously delete is the comment that Space Traders is considered an antisemitic essay, even though there was a link to the original article from NYT where it was discussed and prominent Professors like Dershowitz have discussed the antisemitism in that work. There is no vandalism involved and to be honest it is arrogant and totalitarian to just lock the page under false pretenses because you disagree with people's philosophy. The reason that people have started shunning Wikipedia is exactly attitudes like that to prevent a free flow of facts. If someone had written about the opinions of the faculty that Bell left the deanship at Oregon Law School because he was going to be fired since he spend all the time lecturing away from the school, I could understand that. But there are articles about his antisemitism. Bell's page does not even include his racist comments about Clarence Thomas, """"The choice of Clarence Thomas replicates the slave masters' practice of elevating slaves willing to mimic the masters' views."""" Also, Prioryman, name calling people you disagree with """"dunderheads"""" really diminishes Wikipedia and perpetuates the impression that most administrators are bigots.

The user not only did not have the courtesy of replying to my comment, but deleted it.  I posted the following later:
9 March 2012 (UTC)Dear HJ, do you represent the Wikipedia censorship brigade? I do not usually engage in conversations here so please let me know what I did wrong and you deleted my comment that there are NYT article's about Bell's antisemitism, as well as questioning why you locked the page since Bell is DEAD. I am a simple person, the type of people that Wikipedia was supposed to inspire to all contribute but totalitarian behavior like the one yo have exhibited both at Bell's page and here are what sours people with Wikipedia. Is not it bigoted behavior for Prioryman to call people that have opposing views """"dunderheads""""? I am sorry but ypur behavior, as well as prioryman's, along with your sarcastic tone in history is what diminishes Wikipedia and makes you equal to the totalitarian freepers. The facts are the facts. Is not the Gray Lady a sufficiently legitimate source?

Then that user """"pressed the bell"""" so I will be blocked. I may have been naive and thought that senior members in Wikipedia have these talk pages to discuss the issues. I was not trying to harass or attack anyone.  To the contrary, I have been totally respectful of everybody. However, if the behavior that I encountered today is the typical behavior of the administrators/senior staff, then it is really sad that this great endeavor has degenerated to  a site where only political correct speech is allowed. Or it may be because HJ lives in England where free speech is not allowed. As Americans, that's one of our liberties that is cherished and should be defended. Free speech is what makes us different from Europe and has allowed intellectual thinking and academic research to flourish, instead of remaining stagnant as it happens in Europe.  I am really surprised by this whole behavior. Is this high school, or what? We are all adults and we should engage in conversation, not call mom when we do not like something.

To:User:Kuebie: It seems that you don't have the proper understanding of Korean food culture.
1) The article does not have a """"dairy"""" section because Koreans have had pretty much no history of consuming dairy products.

Compare that to the history and popularity of dog meat.

It is not because dog is four-legged animal and considered taboo, but dog meat has been an important foodstuff with long history and cultural implication in korea. Why was """"monk fish"""" as food not highlighted like? Because monk fish consumption has not been anywhere as popular and culturally important as dog meat consumption in Korea.

Agreed.  That area of the table needs some work, and is not fully consistent on the distinction.  It came about because """"scheduled"""" (which was formerly the word used in all future launches) was both clearly incorrect and also unsourced for many of the rows in the table.  

When I looked at a bunch of the sources about a month ago (2015-02-14), for most of the far future launches, the most one could say is that they were """"under contract""""; while some of the very near term future launches (one to three ahead in the queue) were both clearly """"scheduled"""" and also scheduled with the particular local and national authorities to make the near term date have some meaning.  So that is what led to my attempt to improve the article by having a three-way distinction: 
 """"Scheduled (with range & launch license authorities)""""
 """"Scheduled""""
 """"Under contract""""

It appears that most of that bold edit was left, and has remained, while some parts have been modified by other editors.

Do you think this confirms the existence of unfermented kimchi against all sources I gathered? Someone might like to have a bite of Sauerkraut before it is fermented. 
I don't want to argue with you or something, but I have heard that beer is made from only malt, hops, and water in Germany (as it should be). Unfortunately, at least in Korea, Japan, and the U.S., most beer includes rice, potato, corn starch, and many other ingredients I think unnecessary. At least they have ingredient lists on the bottles, and there are a lot of official documents on those additional ingredients.
But kimchi is a different story. Like I said, I have never seen any packaged/jarred kimchi labeled """"unfermented"""", maybe except for Japanses """"kimuchi"""" which is more like pickled vegetables. And both traditional and contemporary kimchi is fermented. (they are not much different anyway.) Nevertheless, I am willing to temper my claim if editors can find even a couple of reliable sources that say some kimchi is unfermented.

As I mentioned above, I rarely visit the arbcom IRC channel (which itself is not heavily used even by members of the ArbCom); swearing it off is largely a meaningless act.  I could readily stop participating in the mailing list, because I would essentially get the same information via other channels.  You seem to think that this is the only backchannel that exists or that I participate in.  It's not.  It's not even the most important one.  For me to accede to the spirit of your demand would require that, inter alia, I cut myself off from personal communication with people like James and Kat  people I count as friends  because they would likely continue to discuss the same issues with me that we currently discuss from time to time on the arbcom list; my opinions would still enter the discussion, just not as directly.  Furthermore, one of the major resources I use for collaboration with the Foundation, and specifically with Danny and Brad  which, by necessity is a wholly private resource  includes James and Kat as regular participants.  Withdrawing from that particular resource would hamper my ability to provide assistance to Brad and Danny, which represents probably the bulk of what I do on the English Wikipedia these days, and the part that I find most fulfilling.  I also frequently participate in """"backchannel"""" conversation with Kat, James, Dmcdevit (another arbitrator), and occasionally smoddy on the restricted IRC admins channel.  Should I also withdraw from that channel?  It seems that the you and Geogre, through your joint demand, are seeking to require that I isolate myself totally from the entire ArbCom (Geogre's proposal even requires that I even refrain from public communication with members of the ArbCom; I don't recall if yours does, although I believe it does not).  Those people, some of them, at least, are my friends.  For you to ask such a thing is really quite heartless.  It would be akin to my demanding that you have no nonpublic contact with the myriad of friends you have no doubt made on Wikipedia.  

So, you must forgive me: I would rather resign my privileges with honor than accept either of the alternatives left to me:  giving you a hollow victory gained through my unethical manipulation of your own ignorance, or the personal harm of agreeing to cut myself off from those I count as friends.

"""== Administrator intervention against vandalism ==

Thank you for your reports at Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism. I find that you are a reliable contributor, and frequently make useful reports. However, you do sometimes seem a little too quick to jump straight to final warnings and AIV without milder warnings first. It is certainly not necessary to always go through the whole sequence of level 1 warning, level 2, level 3, level 4, but in almost all cases there should have been at least a couple of warnings, and an immediate """"final warning"""" to a new user without previous warnings should be reserved for extreme cases, such as serious personal attacks. One other point is that it is worth thinking whether """"vandalism"""" is always the right label. For example, you warned and reported Brendo1337 for vandalism, but to me his/her editing looked more like experimenting than vandalism, and a word of advice to experiment in the sandbox instead of an article may perhaps have been sufficient. I certainly do not wish to put you off, as you make very useful contributions to vandal fighting, as I have already said. However, you may find it helpful to consider my suggestions.

 Ban 

The reality of the matter is that every time Varsovian returned to wikipedia he inserted himself /invented a new dispute. You accuse me of nationalistic """"persistent POV-pushing pursuit"""", where exactly have I done that, eh? What a joke, you just made that up to justify your ban. Jaroslaw Bilaniuk, Jakiw Palij and Bohdan Koziy are simply not Poles, if somebody tries to add the category """"Polish Nazi Collaborator"""" then he is simply trying to insert untrue information which needs to be removed. It's as simple as that. Did you care to check if there are any sources calling these guys """"Polish Nazi Collaborators"""" or is that falls outside your intellectual capabilities? How is removing wrong information """"persistent POV-pushing pursuit""""!?

I am a member of 3 Wiki Projects, I worked on many different topic areas and improved countless pages, I have created 200 new articles, and a couple DYKs as well. And what exactly has Varsovian contributed to wikipedia apart from constantly creating disputes on Polish topics? Are you able to name one single page on which Varsovian did some substantial work worthy of mention in one year of """"activity"""" on Wikipedia? I don't ask 30 or 40 pages but ONE single page. 

Your systematic attempts at trying to equal me with Varsovian are both shameful and disgraceful, but I am not surprised. One can easily guess the morals of a person who blocked me for 72 hours after I simply and politely asked if I am allowed to do something. Or person who first refuses to do AE because there is lack of transparency and a problem with notification (good one that one) and then comes back a couple of hours later to do a revenge AE nobody requested. And miraculously the transparency, which just a couple of hours earlier was this big problem, is all of a sudden no problem at all.  """,0

"That's an excellent question.  Why would scientists in other professions urge scientific standards in fields other than their own?

It's simple.  Scientists do specialize, but the scientific method is applied to all branches of science.  Urging people to apply scientific methods to all branches of science is part of the overall objective of the scientific community.  

Similarly, if I were a journalist specializing in one beat, I'd nevertheless want to urge all would-be journalists to employ ethical standards of journalism in any other beat.

There may be some disciplines where the public has a strong interest in the subject, and a lot of ink appears on the subject, including some doubtful ink.  Scientists or journalists in unrelated fields would naturally feel the need to urge appropriate tools of science or journalism, so as to avoid the kind of mistakes that have plagued human civilizations since the dawn of recorded history.

Urging people to examine the evidence for (or against) some theory with a skeptical eye is simply sound advice, regardless of the subject.  The dissent is not against any theory.  The dissent is against sloppy methods for establishing which theories are viable, and how we can be so sure of what we claim to believe.",0

Hi Fuzzypink!

I have put together a survey for female editors of Wikipedia (and related projects) in order to explore, in greater detail, women's experiences and roles within the Wikimedia movement. It'd be wonderful if you could participate!

It's an independent survey, done by me, as a fellow volunteer Wikimedian. It is not being done on behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation. I hope you'll participate!

Just click this link to participate in this survey, via Google!

Any questions or concerns, feel free to email me or stop by my user talk page. Also, feel free to share this any other female Wikimedians you may know. It is in English, but any language Wikimedia participants are encouraged to participate.

Hi, I just wanted to say great work on List of United States counties and county-equivalents. That's something that WP has needed for a long time, and thank you for your excellent effort on it.

This scanned 1848 book says """"manors of Barew and Inglescombe or Englishcombe"""", and the Englishcome village website suggests the Duchy owns property in that area, so it looks the same.

 I need some help 

Hello, I see you are a custodian, saw your message on the fair use issue. I am in the middle of negotiating with a photographer for a free license on an image posted previously as a fair use item. He wants it to be in Wikipedia but there is a language barrier and he needs help understanding what his choices are. I am worried am going to explain it poorly to him. He is from Switzerland and asked me to keep it simple and short how I explain it, not send him a link to a legal manual. Can you help me? I am conversing with him via email. I do not want to post his email address publicly here unless I get his approval. If you want to talk to me in email about this, my email address works in my box here. It is about an image Chowbok tagged and an additional one as well so I don't want to delay explaining the licenses to this person. I don't want him to be confused. He is a professional. I want him to understand well enough that he even opts not to license it if it is not best for him. We could try to get something else if it is not the right thing for him. But I think he would like to do this if we can just help him understand. What protects his photo credit best? GFDL? CC BY SA? Also, the GFDL mentions in the text that someone copying 100 copies or more must be given the source code, which is meaning a software package. For a photo, I hope the """"source code"""" would not be any greater image than what he gives us to put in Wikipedia. He may even decide to give us a bigger image than what we have up currently. I am in the middle of trying to answer this photographer and am worried I'm going to write something he won't understand or that's too long. –  """,0

Something stands out about the championship match of WrestleMania XV
After taking a look through some old notes, I think I noticed that the only time that a """"heel"""" won the major championship of the WWE from a """"face"""" at any WrestlaMania is at the 1999 WrestleMania, when Steve Austin won it from The Rock.   In any version of the major championship {WWE Championship, World Heavyweight Championship), the only time I remember seeing the """"heel"""" leave the major championship match of WrestleMania as the champion is only when he entered the match as the defending champion (such as Chris Jericho successfully defending against Edge in 2010, and the Miz successfully defending against John Cena in 2011). Otherwise, the """"face"""" typically wins the major championship match, especially when the face is the defending champion.
This may just be speculation, but probably the reason that Steve Austin as the """"heel"""" got to win the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 15 is because it was held in his home state of Texas. ..
.. So, this major championship match of WrestleMania 30 should be quite interesting in the way it unfolds, as there are two possibilities; if in the Bryan/HHH match, Triple H were to win, the triple threat major championship match would have all three participants as """"heels"""", including the champion Randy Orton, making it so that no matter who wins, the champion would be heel regardless of who the champion is, barring a """"face turn"""". On the other hand, if in the Bryan/HHH match, Daniel Bryan were to win, the triple threat major championship match would have two heels including the champion Randy Orton, and one face, obviously being Daniel Bryan - and if that's the case, with the history being the way it is with this sort of thing, they would almost assuredly mean they would have to have Daniel Bryan win the big championship match, as WrestleMania history usually dictates. Although, we never know how they might possible go against their own history. Plus, there's no telling whether they will even have Daniel Bryan defeat Triple H to get into the triple threat match at all. 
 
But they could surprise everyone and have the championship match end up being a fatal-four-way match, in which case anything could happen. But I think the majority of us might agree that the one least likely to come out of the championship match with the championship is Batista; he's the only one of the four guys to disappear before long, since he hasn't been there. But also, being that Randy Orton is the """"heel"""" and that he's had the championship since October, he too isn't likely to be the champion after that match. So, if we were putting odds on it, all historical facts considered, the two most likely to have the championship after that match (be it a triple threat or fatal four way, if that were to happen) is either Daniel Bryan or Triple H - Daniel Bryan because he can be the hero of WrestleMania as the good guy, or Triple H because he hasn't had the championship in five years and because he's the boss.
But as I say, to my recollection, only in 1999 did a heel win the major championship at WrestleMania.   """,0

 Videology page deletion 

Hi there. This is regarding the deletion of the Videology article I posted yesterday. The reason given was because there was """"no explanation of significance."""" I was wondering if I could get more clarification.

According to A7 of the Criteria for Speedy Deletion article, an article must demonstrate why the subject is important or significant. It also states, """"The criterion does apply if the claim of significance or importance given is not credible."""" In terms of credibility, it appears clear that the subject of the article has been covered by credible and reliable sources such as the New York Times and revered advertising and technology trade publications such as AdWeek and Tech Crunch.

As an aside, I'd be remiss to note that very similar advertising technologies currently have published Wikipedia articles, such as TubeMogul, YuMe and Adap.tv. Videology seems no less important in the advertising technology industry than these companies, especially when considering coverage in credible media sources as well as the amount of capital invested in Videology.

I'm very interested in discussing this further with you and completely amenable with any suggested ways to improve the article on the subject matter.

Thank you for your help, time and assistance.

 Oct 1961 to Oct 1962 Armament

At least During my Duty on the USS Newell (DER322) between Oct1961 and Oct1962 she was armed with enclosed dual 3""""-50 Cal. Guns and two Hedge Hog Antisubmarine Munitions Launchers, among other things. As to when the Gun complement was changed will need to be investigated by others. My memory is Vague as to if we had two or three such dual mounts. All of them were capable of coupling to a Flying Bridge level Gun fire director for coordinated targeting. At the same time we had both a surface search radar and a separate Air Search radar installation. From my memories, we had four 10 cylinder F-M Opposed Crank Diesel main engines, two per shaft, and additional 8 cylinder F-M Opposed Crank Diesels coupled to Generators for ships Electric Power.

Peg Entwistle Suicide

In the article it was said that the sign became such a symbol of Hollywood (the film industry, not the town, per se) that Entwistle used it as a symbol in death (slight paraphrase). The article gave the """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" as the reference.

I removed the reference and edited the article because the """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" is simply wrong. The sign did not become a """"symbol"""" of """"Hollywood"""" until after and because of Entwistle's suicide. I am Entwistle's biographer and the research consultant to a documentary titled """"Under the Hollywood Sign,"""" a look at the last 100 years of history of Beachwood Canyon. In extensive interviews for my book, I have discussed the sign and it's meaning with Peg Entwistle's brother Milton. Milton Entwistle was 11 at the time of his sister's death and remembers very well that the sign was only regarded as a billboardit was never, ever regarded as a symbol of """"The Industry,"""" or """"Tinsel Town,"""" or any other term one may use to describe """"Hollywood"""" the film capitol.

The """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" orginazation has repeatedly rebuffed my requests to accuratly portray the details of the sign's meaning at the time Entwistle died. Furthermore, they have completed perverted the facts of Entwisle's life, career, and death even though I sent them many documents showing their errors.

It should also be noted that the """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" is an orginazation committed to the care and maintenance of the sign, they are not the end-all of its history, and they are most certainly not the experts on the life, career, and death of Peg Entwistle.

Therefore, as I asserted way back in the summer, you cannot say, """"To date, no charges have been filed against Rove for his alleged illegal activities,"""" since there are no alleged illegal activities.  No one in the federal prosecutors office is claiming Karl Rove has done anything illegal.  They were just angry that he defied coming in to answer questions which is his legal right to do.  He wasn't being charged with anything, therefore he did not have to speak with anybody. Then the prosecutor told the judge she was looking into possible criminal activity.  That changes the rules and now she is allowed to compel anybody in the Bush administration to come to answer questions.  Which she did and Rove showed up on time and answered every question.  Therefore, removing the weasel phrase that includes, """"so far no criminal charges have been filed against his alleged illegal activities,"""" is correct.  You cannot say he has 'alleged illegal activities' unless he's been formally charged with a crime.  The investigation will die a quiet death because it was politically motivated to begin with and the prosecutor has figured out by now that she won't be getting a seven figure book deal or promoted to AG.

I don't think he ever mentioned Islam.   00:14, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)

I am not sure to whom the anonymous editor was referring (I don't see any reference to Islam either), and I suppose this discussion isn't really relevant here anyway. But for the record, I have no problem with spirituality without reference to a specific or already-existing religion, especially in something like Star Wars where the connection of the """"humans"""" to us is obscure (since it takes place during ancient times in a distant galaxy). I was responding to Scorpionman's odd (in my opinion) comment that movies should only be spiritual if they reference Christianity instead of other religions. I personally think it's better to stay away from specific religions. —  দ 02:00, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I really would rather have it not reference spirituality, but my """"weird comment"""" stating that it should only reference Christianity is my point of view. I know not everybody agrees, but I really would rather it all be purely technological and scientific.  01:55, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

 Idea for Talmud articles 

Hi Eliyak: I am reposting the following request from User  on my user talk page for wider notification:

I was thinking of trying to stimulate development of a series of articles on Gemara concepts and doctrines, maybe to help children or newcomers to Gemara with explanations of some fundamental concepts that recur throughout the Gemara. Some examples might be articles on Yiush, Chazakah, Ta'aninun (as in """"Ta'aninun L'Yoresh""""), Eidim Zomemin (forgive my awful transliterations), Migu, etc., etc. Maybe we could even create a category or subcategory for it. I created Breira in this vein. As I don't have the experience or expertise in Wikipedia to know what to do to best develop this idea, I figured I'd come to you for your opinions on: (1) whether it's a good idea; and (2) How to best go about implementing it. Thanks

First of all, Oscar Schindler was a true hero who saved thousands of people from imminent death by risking his life in the heart of the Nazi Germany. With no unintended disrespect for Mr.Winton, he merely sat in his hotel room and wrote ads to newspapers. Secondly, Schindler's heroism is widely recognized all over the world, while Winton is mostly known by the British who are extremely well-known for loudly bragging about things they never accomplished. He is a purely media-made hero. And third of all, the children he saved were thrown out of their homes in Britain as soon as the war ended.

"You obviously like all serbs, sadly there is no exception, all serbs, reject truth and evidence and doesnt listen to what other wants to say. Insteed you are acting like the entire world have wrong and you serbs have right (remember Milosevic?), and sadly for you but very good for me you are loosing Kosovo now because of your arrogans.

Lets keep us to some facts that cannot be neither rejected or denied:

1. The only reason Bosnian kings declared themself kings over Serbia was because they wanted the Vatican to recognize them easily as kings, and they also took Croatian crown, crown over the seaside, podrinje, usora and other parts. An since Bosnia was an independent kingdom he could only rule one kingdom and not a completely different like Tvrtko was even a serbian king. Haha! 

2. Even Hungarians declared themself kings over Serbia because of the same reason.

3. Bosnians was a name for the people of the geographical region called Bosnia, later Banate Bosnia and later Kingdom of Bosnia. It was only so that the word Bosnian in Bosnian language was Bosnjanin and then later changed to bosnjak. Which means that only we bosniaks are bosnians in Bosnia, serbs and croats are strangers. 

4. Bosnian church was a state religion and the only reason the Bosnian kings accepted catholicism was because they didnt want Bosnia to be attacked by evil crusaders. As for the people they got simple brainwashed by the franciscans. This clearly shows that the current day so called Bosnian croats are not croats but bosniaks that both betrayed their ancient religion and betrayed their people.

5. There were practically no orthodox in Bosnia before the arrival of turks and no one of the bosnian kings ever converted or accepted orthodox since they were either bogumils or catholics.

Etiquette
Your statement """"I keep my conviction that I'm on the truth: that you two are members of some racist organization"""" on this edit directed toward User:Dark Tichondrias  is an accusation that two users are racists, making it against Wikipedia's policy on etiquette.  Wikipedia's policy on etiquette suggests to not accuse other users of being racist. 
WP:Wikiettiquete says:
Terms like """"racist,"""" """"sexist"""" or even """"poorly written"""" make people defensive. This makes it hard to discuss articles productively. If you have to criticize, you must do it in a polite and constructive manner.
This seems to be the issue of dispute. Yet racism is at the heart of this discussion, specially because DT and Thulean are percieved by all the rest as people with such an agenda. 
I'm pondering to start a project called WP:Honesty: Say things clear (without falling in insults), don't hide in word games, don't make threats that make no sense (bravados), don't edit capriciously ignoring the discussion, etc. Play fair and demand others to do the same. 
You pretend that I'm making ad hominem attacks, yet I'm just pointing out who's misbehaving and why. Something that is obvious to all, including you two.
If you would be even minimally sincere you would not be trying to corner me against arbitrarily selected Wikipolicies but you would have protested your innocence, first of all. You are just playing legalism.
If you want me to refrain from denouncing your behaviour and your agenda the least your could do is to  is to protest your innocence, to explain your reasons, to pretend at least that you are not racist. But you only make attacks ad hominem against my honesty and sincerity.
Keep it that way. I don't mind.  

Personal Attacks

Please refrain from personal attacks which you made in Talk:White_people. Or next time you will be reported to WP:DP.  
I am not making any personal attacks. I honestly think you are a nazi (or close equivalent, if you want to dwell in the small letter and word twists). You haven't even bothered in denying it, so why should I think otherwise. 
If you think that stating that is a personal attack, please say why. I don't think that openly declaring the (apparent) truth is any personal attack but just that: stating facts, so we can discuss honestly.
What is being discussed in that article's talk page is largely ideological and some people of certain ideology (you and DarkTichondrias) are trying to manipulate the participative process of Wikipedia in your favor, editing ignoring the consensus. I honestly believe it is my duty to fight such behaviour and defend the neutrality of Wikipedia. And I will do it.  
If you still arent satisfied, you can ask a request for investigation, but I must warn it can well backfire.  

Of course I wont dignify your silly personal attacks with a response. And you repeated your personal attack with your response. I'll be reporting you.  
Excellent.  

Calling another editor a nazi, regardless of whether you think it is true, is completely unacceptable.  If you continue, you may be blocked for personal attacks.  Please find a more civil way to discuss your concerns about the article.  babelfish

The first two sources for the """"Legacy"""" section are explaining the situation where Jack Welch in 2012 tweeted an implication that the Labor Department could be fixing job numbers. He had a lot of criticism and also attention from the Obama campaign, but told WSJ that he should have used a question mark in the original tweet because he wanted to raise a question about the legitimacy of the job numbers. He states in his own words that the debate has led to people looking at unemployment data more carefully and skeptically. Quote: “The coming election is too important to be decided on a number. Especially when that number seems so wrong.” 

The NYT source talks about the future of GE as it “gets past the Jack Welch Era” and the fate of GE Capital enterprise as a spin-off many years after Welch has left.

The current article mentions very little about the Jack Welch Management Institute, but the WiredAcademic article provides a direct interview with Jack Welch where he discusses the school and his view on digital learning. The article provides a lot of details about the Institue as well as his opinions.

"Hi Osmond, Please understand, I really like your images. I'd love to have all of them added to articles. I think the collection itself is notable and may merit an WP article itself. But WP is a sometimes difficult place to get started contributing because they have so many different guidelines and different editors interpret them different ways. WP requires that when images are contributed the contributor has to be able to demonstrate that they fit the open source or Creative Commons licensing policy. 

 Because you are the uploader of the images, your simple declaration of their provenance, that the images are all pre-1923 and are of the people you say they are, may not be sufficient to meet WP guidelines. I truly believe that many of them in fact are of the individuals stated. The likenesses are very clear, though in a few instances, less so. I'd really like to help you get the images accepted as valid. They are a wonderful contribution to the historic lore about the individuals who they are supposed to be pictures of.

 I'm sorry, I'm not near Kearny, Missouri this week, or I'd love to see the collection. Is that where you're from?

 I'm not the final arbiter of all of this. I suggest we get some input from other editors on how to validate that the images are genuine and their provenance is proven. To start, this will probably require you to provide some third-party sources to establish that the images were taken before 1923, or proof that the studio on the image closed before 1923, or other evidence. Then you will have to provide some third-party opinion that the images are of the individuals taken. Or you'll have to make available other evidence that the person's names were written on the images. The articles you named may be helpful if you can provide source info, links, or publication info. 

 I'm totally on your side. I'd like to find a way to establish the authenticity of the images. But you also have to understand that as the owner of the images, if you can clearly establish the authenticity of the images, you could be greatly rewarded financially. So you're not a disinterested person when it comes to proving the that pictures are of the people you say they are. Because this is a complex issue, due diligence is required.

 Give me a day or two to explore the proper way to get other editors input into this discussion. There's a formal process for this kind of thing and I'm not sure what it is. —  (talk to me) (what I've done)",0

It is Nanking and Peking, not Pakking and Namking because you are confusing these early romanisations with the Jyut Ping which is a later linguistic invention. They are also not all romanised according to English. The British invaders came the last. They were first romanised by an Italian Missionary called Ricci and then by the French missionaries. That is why Guangdong is written as Canton. Canton was never meant to be an English romanisation. If you pronounce it in French, it sound exactly like the Cantonese pronunciation of it, even today. Same thing for Peking and Nanking. When you pronounce them in French, Italian, they sound more like the original Cantonese vernacular variant.

Can you or another experienced editor help then. this is ridiculous all this guy is doing is assuming bad faith, nothing i say or do can change that all he wants to do is throw bad faith accusations.

HellinaBucket, leave me alone. I'm not editing the Operation Repo article (or any article) any longer, you have no reason to contact me, or ask anyone else to contact me on your behalf. The way that I met you was by catching you in the act of vandalism, and your initial response was to repeat the vandalism. It's true that you were able to get me angry enough for Orangemike to feel that I deserved a mild warning, but don't let that embolden you. The fact that you have abstained from vandalism for a few days, does not mean that you are not a vandal, and your taking offense to my using the word vandal in reference to you is unwarranted, such use does not constitute a personal attack. You are a vandal. You committed vandalism, you repeated that vandalism, and it's only been a few days since then; it doesn't wear off that quickly. I would not do this exactly the same way if I had it to do over again, but my goal was to stop you, and everyone else, from vandalizing the Operation Repo article, I feel confident that I have succeed, and I feel that the allegations of me over-stepping the guidelines in my ferocity of dealing with you are both mild and debatable. It is an added bonus, that it seems you have chosen to become a responsible editor, and I, once again, thank-you for all of the things you do which make you an effective editor. HellinaBucket, your account is only a month old, why don't you just throw it away and make a new one? There's nothing wrong with that as long as you honestly intend to be a responsible editor from here on out (If you want to be extra careful that you are following the guidelines to the letter, read WP:SOCK, but the basic idea, is that making a second account is wrong if you are doing for it the wrong reasons. If you just want to change your name, or if you are embarrassed about something you did as a beginning editor that you are not going to do again, then that's fine.). Whether or not you get a new account, there is no reason for you to contact me. I began editing Operation Repo while I was checking the recent changes for vandals. I continued to monitor it because the vandalism had been common before I was able to get the article protected. Other than that I have no interest in that subject.VegKilla (talk)  HellinaBucket (talk)

Sorry for not formatting this and doing it wrong, I'm a little pressed for time right now and just want to thrown in my 2 cents.

It's roughly as addictive, same concept, same results."""" So that means if 40% of people who drink are alcoholics (just made that up to make my point), and 80% who drink alcohol drink Budweiser, it is not significant that 40% of people who drink Budweiser are alcoholics (or in other words you cant say Budweiser is more addictive even though the majority of alcoholics will drink budwiesder).  But then he goes and says that because 40% of people who play wow may be addicted (or are addicted if prof. opinion = fact) WoW is more addictive then other games without knowing what the 'base' rate of gaming addiction is or the proportion of gamers who play wow?

I know, you want me to hold the burden of proof.  Anglo-Frisian and Old Norse have the most extreme maritime influences, including those Non IE Roots discussed on the Talk:Germanic languages page where you bureaucratically assaulted me also.  As formerly stated(before Diderot POV pushed the article with a massive edit) on the Non IE Roots page(), Celtic is another language group holding a considerable amount of Non IE Roots.  Apart from any Basque influences, Celtic seems to have Non IE terms concentrated mostly in the British Isles, where they were joined by the Anglo-Frisians and Norse.  It is blatantly clear to anybody that the Mediterranean influence on High German is astounding.  The older Nordic and Germanic writings appear less structured and thought out, but the more evolution into current speech, the tongues have been so standardised by latinisation, especially.  One cannot seriously refute that the Anglo-Frisian and West Norse tongues follow the least marked latinising structures on their tongues of the Germanic languages(and especially borrowing scientific terms), apart from writing them in latin script, with a few native letters especially in Icelandic to this day.  The Baltic East Norse tongues gained a considerable conversion by the influence of the Low German speakers of the Hanseatic League in their everyday life, most notable in the Hanseatic Cities, like Visby on Gotland.  Since High German has been standardising itself all throughout Germany, having a marked effect upon such others as Austrian and Swiss German, all the dialects of Germany and even in Eastern Europe are suffering at the officialisation and BBC type overtaking.  See the German language page for more information in this regard.  To let your paranoid self know that it's ok, I haven't edited there, because that's not my area of specific study, although it's helpful to know.",0

No, a snood is used on the head to confine the hair.  See the OED: """"A fillet, band, or ribbon, for confining the hair; latterly, in Scotland (and the north of England), the distinctive hair-band worn by young unmarried women. More recently, a fashionable bag-like or closed woman's hairnet, usu. worn at the back of the head."""".

Something worn around the neck for warmth is a scarf or comforter.  The tubular buff is multipurpose and so can be worn in various ways.  The polar models are made with fleece section and I suppose that is what the footballers have been wearing.  The commentator's usage of snood for this is a neologism which is being used for humour and so we should avoid it.

Why would Ryan confess to Grindlay while at the eleventh-hour Ryan wrote letters to various people protesting his innocence? Ryan had to write his letters on toilet paper and then he was also refused his right to make a """"last statement"""" just prior to execution. Smells fishy to me! The various documentary films, based on meticulous research including archival material and interviews by living people (including Grindlay) who were directly involved in the Ryan case do not even mention such a confession taking place - because it didn't happen!

Hi! I removed your edit to Cooperative because it violates the principles in WP:NOT, particularly: Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought and Wikipedia is not a soapbox. There is some useful information in what you posted, some of which wasn't really covered in the article, but it would be much better for you to look through the section you edited, and see where individual points you wrote about would best go. Please also remember Wikipedia strives for a neutral point of view; your beliefs about what a cooperative is or is not may not be shared by everyone who has experience with cooperatives. Your edits should not state an opinion not shared by all as a fact. Argyriou 

To Argyriou,
I have noticed your action regarding my contribution.

Let me add few comments:
- English is not my primary language, so it is possible that a meaning very clear to me sounds or understood differently to an English speaking born. 

- A page about cooperative should contain, IMHO, a complete information about cooperatives and cooperative movement worldwide. The page now is limited to the official ICA approach, which is not the only one. I may say that this approach prove to be a failure in many parts of the world.

- I have tried to present a another approach to cooperative, and an approach developed in Israel during tenth of years. I can't see a reason why this approach shouldn't be presented on the Wikipedia.
More than this: there are cooperatives in the world who have followed in one way or another this approach. More information can be found: http://www.coopgalor.com/realization.html
A very successful example in the U.S.A can be read here: http://www.coopgalor.com/realization/Oklahoma.html

- This approach is backed by papers published in different places, including ICA. These papers can be read at: http://www.coopgalor.com/i_publications.html#Whats_coop
I hope a reconsideration of your decision would be possible and that my text would find its place on the Wikipedia.

 ban or block? 

As I understand it, a ban is something imposed on a user by the community appointed Arbcom or Jimbo Wales by fiat for whatever reason, and a block is something any admin does to an individual user account or IP address for predetermined reasons (usually vandalism, sometimes immediately if the vandalism is severe or offensive enough, or in the case of continued actions by users blatantly against policy in the face of multiple warnings). They can both be for a set time or permanent. Bans can be permanent, blocks of user accounts can be permanent, but we don't like to permablock IP addresses. As in the case of Jessica, I blocked (what I believe to be) her IPs for 6 mos., so it ever gets reassigned to another computer after that time that computer can conceivably register for a new user account. Known shared IPs are blocked for much less time. Admins are supposed to use Arbcom mandated block ranges to enforce bans, but don't themselves declare bans on other users in order to block or have other admins block. That way, admin actions can be reversed by other admins or even by themselves if they change their minds, but bans """"from above"""" can't be lifted by admins. Again, this is only how I understand it, others will have their own opinions to be sure. Cheers,  """,0

I am about to close down shop here but will get back to you later...you'll be long asleep, but will post all I have to your usertalk so you can get busy tomorrow...surf around in the Wikipedia:WikiProject Protected areas and I see there is a handy map and template all ready to go... 

Did you need any more links to get you started? I can help you find links that will assit you with the latitude and longitude and area of the parks in S. Africa. a good one is here and it lists most parks and protected areas. Click search for sites, then serach by country, query South Africa and it will provide some pieces of info that may be helpful with the infobox. Let me know if there is anything else you need for this. 

 Thanks!

 Re: Block Log on user 62.171.198.5 

Sir, I wish to ask if you would consider extending the ban on this IP for the persistent and annoying way they seem to wish to disrupt the wikipedia.  Previous bans of 24 and 31 hours have obviously slowed things down, but the IP is reported as belonging to Research Machines Inc, and its understood that abuse of this IP would result in reports of network abuse to be passed to them.  

The IP has an extraordinarily long list of vandalism attached to its name, and I can barely find one edit under the user contributions which is not, or does not amount to outright vandalism.  Could I please ask therefore that you consider extending this ban to 48 hours or thereabouts.  Previous bans seem to have had no effect since the talk page for this IP is full of bans and vandalism warnings.  

Please understand that I would never question the decision of an administrator, as I am not one myself and would consider that the height of rudeness.  All I ask is whether you could please reconsider the ban and possibly extend it.  Thank you.    Thor's pet yack

A question if I may. How is it that I incurred such a penalty when  at the outset identified Jeffro as a bigot, yet, received no sanction?

 Too many pictures 

One amature picture of cable ends is enough.  Users find it a lot more useful to have a detailed pinout for their reference.

 Refresh / Update 

I have made some edits that are (hopefully) viewed as an improvement on the original.
 I added references to both the T568-A and T568-B """"standards"""" to the pinout tables.
 I copied (and modified) the original table, showing it as a four-pair crossover, since the newer network types need all four pairs crossed.
 I added explanatory comments about the T568-A/B wiring formats, since in my experience this has been a source of confusion. (They really are interchangeable, you just need to use the same format at each end.)
 I also inserted comments between the two pinout tables explaning that there may be situations where the """"older"""" style may be preferable - and that some equipment can be fussy about which pairs are crossed, and which are not.
 I broke out the """"Cable Pinouts"""" and """"Other Technologies into separate sections to make things clearer.

Comments:

Thanks to whomever added the pictures and the original table.  They really help liven up the page and make the information much more easily grasped.

Regarding the comment about """"Wikipedia not being a 'user manual' but merely a 'source of information'...""""  Where do you/we draw the line?  I came to Wikipedia, as a source of information, and in this case the """"how-to"""" kind of information is often what the visitor wants.

In my own case, I came here looking for information about how to make the cable and found the tabular form for the pinout (now pinouts) most instructive.

"""

Slpl1, Please!! The situation is NOT """"an exact parallel"""" to the examples you've given, especially the first. In that example you're comparing a matter of hard science to a highly subjective jouranistic description. Basketballs to oranges. We don't have a choice as to what causes AIDS. We can't say, for example, that it is caused by a severe deficiency of Vitamin C because that would simply be false. But in the case of the men's rights movement there are all sorts of descriptions, ones used by """"scholars"""" no less, that would not be false. We could say that the MRM is a countermovement to feminism, a reaction to feminism, a response to feminism, a rebellion against feminism, etc. And, by the way, were we addressing the subject of AIDS, we also wouldn't say """"It is considered to be a caused by the HIV virus"""" would we? Rather, we would say that """"AIDS is caused by the HIV virus"""" or, to more explicitly bring in outside authority, """"AIDS has been determined to be caused by the HIV virus."""" That's because """"is considered to be"""" also brings in a degree of subjectivity to the statement.

Your second example is closer to our situation and, to be honest, it isn't all that obviously unacceptable to me. However, in the case of Holocaust denial we are almost invariably dealing with clear-cut antisemitism and scholars and editors should call a spade a spade. In the case of the MRM, I think that both scholarly and popular literature will reflect that we are not dealing with the same degree of monolithic hatred. Moreover, unlike Holocaust denial, standard issue MRM causes don't reflect a flat-out denial of historical fact.

What I see in the present """"It is considered to be a backlash to the feminist movement"""" wording, are editors taking the most negative description of the movement that they could """"get away with""""  (saving the even less acceptable """"misogynist"""" for a segment of the movement later in the lead) and then framing it in the least subjective manner that they could """"get away with"""": """"It is considered to be"""". I don't particularly like """"backlash"""" in lead, but at least in should be framed in the more NPOV """"many scholars and other observers have described it as a backlash . . . """"   """,0

"My Tourettes 

I have a very debilitating form of Tourettes that makes it virtually impossible for me to leave the house - due to the strong taboo attatched to one of my main verbal tic, which is to let out a shout of the n-word (particularly when I get anxious or stressed). Due to this being an extremely taboo racial slur I feel unable to risk causing the kind of offense that I would by going out, particularly when I could come across black people in daily life. Does anyone else have a particularly bad manifestation that makes a social life almost impossible? I read about a poor man whose tic was related to child-rape - even worse than my own, probably. The problem is that the more taboo a word or phrase is, and the earlier you pick it up, the more it feeds into the Tourettes. I hope there is one day a cure because my life is miserable.",0

Thanks. I'll expand on what Tiptoety says. The first unblock request was declined by himself on the grounds that Miyokan was a confirmed sockpuppet of myself...and we all know where that lead. The other unblock requests were due to what we now know was a major f' up, and one which is yet to be addressed to my satisfaction. What you are seeing on the admin noticeboard is nothing more than an attempt to get rid of an adversary, and this is evident by the continual support of the editor who is responsible for that foul mouthed tirade which I posted earlier...look at Biophys' own comments from 03:50, 17 September 2008. The other thing that hasn't been addressed is why was this supposed outting done by an editor? What was the reason behind it? I know what was behind it, but does anyone else? Does anyone care? I'll tell you, it was an attempt to make people understand why certain editors hold such fringe views and they are prominently making their way into articles...such as the belief that Putin is a paedophile...a belief that was re-affirmed after  Dialogue Stalk me """,0
"Firstly, Montanabw, there is no such thing as Equus caballus. That is a domesticated animal. The proper name is Equus ferus caballus - unless domesticated Horses somehow come from Zebras or Asses... Also, there is no consensus that Equus ferus ever set foot on the North American continent, though I personally believe Equus lambei may be a subspecy of Equus ferus. Thirdly, and most importantly, and I hope EVERYONE is listening here when I say this, Equus ferus caballus, the domesticated Horse IS NO MORE native to the North American west than Chihuahuas are to the Canadian tundra. Domestic forms are native NOWHERE. Period. The domestic Horse is RADICALLY different from it's wild ancestor. And Dysmorodrepanis, the reason all the Equine articles are so Horse-centric is because a very large number of vociferous (and outright foolish) people are unhealthily obsessed with horses. Unfortunately, many of these people also think themselves expert enough to declare a domestic animal native to a continent it never inhabited simply because they like to watch them run. Seriously, that's all it is. They like looking at them. It's certainly not an environmental issue. Horses are wildly destructive to their surroundings. They eat more than cattle! And an obscene amount more than the native Pronghorn (which, by the way doesn't trample its food to death like the Mustangs do with they're enormous, heavy-stepping hooves). The only argument the Mustang and Burro worshippers have to use (and they milk it good, let me tell ya) is the similarity of Equus lambei to Equus ferus. But, Equus lambei has not been proven to be synonymous with Equus ferus (though it is a possibility), and even if it were it would be more closely related, by far, to Przewalski's Horse than to Mustangs! E. lambei was tiny! It was like four feet tall at the shoulders! And all the other North American Equids are pretty well-known to not be synonyms with Equus ferus (including E. caballus). Not by a long shot. This is why the Horse Evolution page (and every other page dealing with equines) has been changed back and forth so many times. The people who know what the heck they're talking about try to add useful information and correct blatant lies or grievous mistakes and the people who like pretty ponies go back and try to convince the world that Spanish horses have roamed every continent including Antarctica, Mars and the Sun since before Dinosaurs walked on two feet. I made the ridiculous mistake of trying to add factual information to the Mustang article and, if I remember correctly, it was changed WITHIN THE HOUR. The person doing the changing even removed the scientific names I inserted! The Mustang article has absolutely no indication of what specy the Mustang belongs to now! I swear this endless struggle between the My Little Ponyites and REAL BIOLOGISTS is like the Evolution vs. creationism argument, only dumber. Like I said, these people aren't calling for us to turn our rotweillers loose into the nearest forest, but why not? I mean, it's the same specy as the Gray Wolf. Domestication doesn't matter, if you listen to these people. If that's the case then why aren't we restocking mature Oak forests with farm raised white turkeys? I mean, it's the same specy, after all. Oh. And this is my favourite. Where Wild Asses are actually native they're critically endangered. But I have not read ONE WORD from the Cult of the Mustang and Burro about saving them from ACTUAL extinction, but get this, they want to have the Mustangs and Burros in America declared endangered species. How's that for mentally inept and savagely hypocritical?",0

 No, not phosphorescent. Phosphorescence, as far as I know, does not occur in gases. If you check the Wiki article it refers to the delay in re-emission characteristic of phosphorescence being """"associated with """"forbidden"""" energy state transitions in quantum mechanics"""", these transitions can only occur in solid materials. The IR absorption/emission associated with the so-called greenhouse gases is due to molecular vibrations that are directly related to the molecular temperature. Phosphorescence is not particularly dependent on temperature, whereas the absorption/emission of GHGs is an exact function of the temperature of the molecule.  """,0

I'm highly amazed by the fact that this debate rages on. If I may interject, Aleta formed a subsection entitled Arbitrary Page Break. Note using the word Arbitrary over say, Random? Are we going to throw a huge fuss over the inclusion of a more sophisticated word? Sobriquet is quite clearly at least somewhat different from Nickname, otherwise there would be only one article encompassing both words. My suggestion is per a growing trend on Wikipedia: Link sobriquet to a definition in Wiktionary, should one exist. This saves readers the hassle of going through an entire article trying to summarily grasp the full definition of one word within an article comprised of several thousand such words. Furthermore, if Wikipedia is meant to be an informal learning tool of sorts, why fear incorporating a higher grade-level vocabulary into it as a means of providing the best possible learning experience? And if we have to """"dumb down"""" a word here, the same precedent would theoretically have to be set for the entire English Wikipedia, thereby degrading the quality of articles. As someone pointed out, if readers cannot grasp the lingusitics of the standard English wikipedia, there's Simple English to cater to that need. So, that's my offer for a solution. Dictionaries are as important of a resource as an encyclopedia and complement one another: Get the information you want and if you don't know what a word means, just look it up.

It's pretty obvious what I would have liked to hear from you, but I suppose intentionally ignoring people is the way of Wikipedia. This situation is obviously more complex than you phrased it - I am not 'having a go' at people for not writing the article, I'm having a go at them for having got it deleted for no good reason at all (and while you gave reasons, they're not very good and didn't really address what actually happened anyway, which is presumably why you're not willing to continue discussing it). And I've already given you extensive reasons why 'write it yourself' isn't really going to cut it as a solution. I'm not going to write it, and neither are they. Nobody is going to. Even though it is an eminently appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article, according to Wikipedia's own rules (and a passable first draft already existed). Perhaps we just have different ideas on what's the worst thing Wikipedia could be doing. Me, I think it's this. You, well, you clearly put more value on, well, I don't know to be honest. Obviously you have absolutely no interest in the subject matter, just like Dave (despite his claims), and the others, so I guess it's not really all that important to any of you at all that Wikipedia's already poor coverage of this area just got a little bit poorer, for no good reason, and despite the best efforts of a subject expert to inform you why your reasoning was completely erroneous and was simply flying in the face of common sense (such as the very obvious fact that the list I linked above has several companies on it which are actually smaller than NIBS). Not that you can even tell for half of them, because the articles are so crap they don't even give such basic details as that (for the reasons I've extensively documented). Which merely leaves me still wondering why any of you think this sort of approach would motivate me, or anyone else who realises this is the way of Wikipedia, to fix/write the articles for you.

This is not the only unhelpful change during the AfDs in my opinion. This is the article at its best and this is the diff between that and the day of writing The major differences are obvious. I call your attention to the farcical replacement of an easily verifiable statement """"Most researchers believe that Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) knew little of"""" with the tie-me-to-the-mast-and-damn-the-torpedos stance of """"Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) knew little of"""", all because of the WP crusade against weasel words. I am reminded by a lesson that I learned from probably the most contentious and biased editor I know on WP...even a stopped clock is right once a day. He said that the lead does not have to have citations. The rest of the article is the verification for it. In the same way, unsupported claims, however weaseloid, can inform the reader quickly and cleanly and be verified elsewhere.

Hi there, been going through some rough phase of a wiki career. So a bit of guidance from you, on the following would be of help.

Also when can we have videos into an article? And does it matter from which site we take them from?

Goethean, above, was either too gentle or ironic in pointing out the problem with this sentence, albeit he was apparently addressing an earlier version. Weimar Classicism's tenets may have been controversial but its existance as a movement is not, so it is just as much an error to say it is """"oft-disputed"""" as it was to say """"according to MANY historiana and scholars..."""" which implies that there are other historians and acholars who think it is something else, or didn't exist at all.

Lansing in """"Southern Michigan""""?
I think not. What is the source or justification for this apparently arbitrary decision? I say """"apparently arbitrary"""" because I can find no evidence that the regions of Michigan are official governmental designations.

 The media (Lansing State Journal, and TV Stations WLNS, WILX, WSYM)
all refer to Lansing as being in Mid-Michigan.

 A Google search for the terms Lansing and """"Mid Michigan"""" turns up many hits that would lead one to believe that Lansing is a part of """"Mid-Michigan.

 Conversely, a Google search for Lansing and """"Southern Michigan"""" turns up mostly references where Lansing happens to be mentioned in the same work as a reference to something outside of the Lansing area (in Southern Michigan).

 There are a number of businesses and organizations based in Lansing with """"Mid-Michigan"""" in their title. In the Lansing phone book, I find at least 50 businesses listed whose name begins with """"Mid-Michigan"""" (or """"Mid Michigan""""). I find one whose name begins with """"Southern Michigan"""".

I would argue that the boundary between """"Mid"""" (or Central) and """"Southern"""" Michigan lies somewhere south of Lansing and somewhere just north of Jackson. Perhaps [Leslie, Michigan|Leslie]] is nearer the border. I believe that once could safely draw the border to include all of Ingham County.

On these grounds, I suggest that in the name of factual accuracy, Lansing be moved (at least in Wikipedia) from """"Southern Michigan"""" to """"Central Michigan"""" (for which """"Mid-Michigan"""" is said to be a synonym).   """,0

Well, Alan, the article may be more about a type of smoking than a type of smoking reduction but the benefit of one-hitters to the latter issue remains important.
You have reduced the number of pictures to 3 this seems to me unbalanced in that Smoking pipe (tobacco) is allowed to run on for over 23,000 bytes (all drawn from only 3 notes, 3 references, 5 external links) with 11 pictures compared to One-hitter (smoking) with under 4000 bytes and 3 pictures.  Factbase: I should google this first, but I think I saw an article stating that only 1% of the tobacco smokers worldwide use a pipe (compared with 5% cigar and 94% cigarettes); if 1/10 as many persons used cannabis as tobacco and 10% of cannabis users used a one-hitter, on that basis alone besides there being ethnic one-hitters used for tobacco too the articles should have equal length.

The classification list at the top insinuates that all mice belong to the genus Mus, but there are many genera of mice.

I couldn't even guess how many genera there must be in total. Mus only accounts for a miniscule portion of the richness and diversity of the animals we call mice. It should be noted as well that mice are a polyphyletic grouping since some mice are more related to some rats, for instance than they are to other mice.

 Comment from IP 

I was a Sophmore in High School when the 37th division was sent to the South Pacific theater of war. Three years later, in May, 1945, I was a replacement joining this Division where I earned my combat badge in June of that year. June 30th did not see the end of combat for this Division. I was an 18yr. old replacement and a member of Company D, 145th Infantry Regiment when we were sent deep into the Cagahan(Sp?) Valley of Northern Luzon with the assignment to thwart the fleeing soldiers of Japan from reaching the dense forested hills bordering that Valley. Our Company was engaged in many firefights with these retreating Japanese army units. My last combat missions were ended soon after the Dropping of the atomic bombs on the Japanese main land in early August. While my combat experience was very limited, I did come face-to-face with my own mortality during these few months of combat experience. When I came home in 1946, I remember the resentment I felt that my parents had to come with me before I could register to vote in my first National election. I was still under the legal voting age of 21.

On another subject, the Name of Medal of Honor winner, John J. Petrarcal is new to me. There is a famous ballad about the only Medal of Honor Winner about whom I had ever read, and that Medal of Honor went to Pvt.Roger Young, 148 Infantry Division,37th Division  for bravery on the Island of New Georgia, in the Solomon Islands in May of 1942.

I in no way want to detract from John Petrarcal, but I wonder, are there possibly two heroes to recall?   Citations: Personal experience and 37th Division written History.

"The best description of this example is the POV of the Gnostics such as Marcion.
Essentially, they noticed apparant differences in God between the Old and New testaments. Also, they considered that the old testament God had moral failings - e.g. deliberately putting the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the garden and then telling Adam and Eve not to eat anything from it, and then not preventing the serpent, or the various other examples of condoning incest, murder, etc.
Their conclusion was that the god of the old testament (referred to as Yahweh) and the God of the new testament (referred to as God (in Greek)) were not the same. They further considered that not only was Yahweh evil, but Yahweh is the source of all evil, i.e. the devil. They considered the serpent to be the good god.
Obviously this was considered a very very very dangerous and extreme heresy by the early church, and their attacks on Marcion drip with vitriol.

 This is the last time I am going to tell you: Stop vandalising and stop disturbing me 

Family names are a valid article. Each family name in every language can be an article. Instead of your Serbophobic (and therefore racist, since you are apparently Korean, at least that is what you claim) vandalism edits, go and do something useful like making wiki articles for Korean family names. Most certainly do not ever again take the liberty to tell me what to do, because you have neither right nor authority to do that and your snotty and inappropriate comments are unwelcome.

Eventually, as I have already replied at the ludicrous discussion you started  where, BTW, no one took your side  I will create longer pages for each individual family name when I have time. They will be full articles in their own right. For now, leave the Serbian family names alone and do not input vandalism redirects to specific people. People are people and they have their own article and names are names and they have their own articles AS NAMES, not as incidental necessity for redirection. 

Further your comparison with the family name """"Hitler"""" is absolutely abhorrent, as all people who had that family name have changed it after WW II, so that family name does indeed relate to only a signe person. And even so, it would still be possible to write an article about the family name as such, but it's not my interest, so I won't do it. However, writing such an article would be legitimate and such an article could exist as a wikipedia article.

On the links that you have been posting on my page (and which I am going to delete, because they are unnecessary on may talk page) it says VERY CLEARLY: """"MAY"""" and NOT """"MUST"""". Are you really incapable of comprehending the difference between the two? If you are, stop editing Wikipedia altogether because all your edits are likely to be violation of rules.

And, I repeat: do not come to scribble nonsense on my wall again. I have nothing to tell you that I haven't told you three times already and I do not want your inconsequential silly musings on my wall. Go away!!

 Accuracy of 'quarrel' quote 

According to Ralph Keyes, the quote in the article """"I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong... No Viet Cong ever called me nigger"""" is a misquotation.  Keyes says: When Muhammad Ali refused induction into the Army, he was widely quoted as saying, “No Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” This was a perfect marriage of anti-war and anti-racist sentiment. Better yet, it came straight from the mouth of a mega-celebrity thought to possess primitive folk wisdom. The only problem is that Ali never made this comment. “It’s wasn’t really his mind-set to say something in that way,” explained Ali biographer Thomas Hauser. “The companion thought of that comment is ‘people call me nigger in this country every day.’ I never heard Ali say ‘white people in this country call me nigger.’ He would attack racism. But he wouldn’t personalize it.” Despite extensive searching by himself and others, Hauser has never found the source of “no Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” He concluded that it was just one of those things that got picked up and passed around in the 60s. It was a comment we wanted Ali to make so badly that we made it for him.""",0

 Reason for this article?

How do we know that broad-based use of wind-based power generation won't have dire long-term consequences?  (Those consequences to seem like they would be rapidly reversible, however.)

"Within this discussion page, I have sighted pseudo-justification for the formatting and substance of the Biopsych introductory paragraph quoting Webster’s Dictionary. Clearly, unless such source can be proven to be entirely free of advertorial motive then it ought not to be counted as a neutral source.

If as it appears, that Webster’s dictionary is the primary source of the informative substance of the introductory article, then surely Webster’s Dictionary should be cited as being the source within the opening paragraph itself. It is not proper to quote any source that has been approved merely on the basis of any unqualified assumption on the part of the current editors.

Surely a far better way to proceed with the introductory paragraph would be to quote authoritative sources either from within the field of Biopsych or otherwise having peer-related relevance. The impression that the introductory article presently creates is that of a messianic pharmaceutical cult seeking ‘out of the blue’ to command the co-operation of a wide range of medical and scientific disciplines.

Before proposing changes to the introduction, I would like the views of the current editors. Incidentally, I neither have an ‘anti-psychiatry’ agenda nor am I a ‘Scientologist’. Neither therefore am I aware of why the very mention of the word ‘Scientologist’ is met with such disdain within these pages.",0

your requests for info
VoluntarySlave, FrancisTyers, Aaron, I have already answered most of your questions above. I won't be caught in your mind games. I have answered your questions. Intangible has. TheIndivdualist has. Answering once is enough for any of us.

As far as the big section about Proudhon: Proudhon called himself an anarchist, agreed, but could not tell the difference between anarchy and government. So we may as well include a section on Daffy Duck and his influence on the movement.

This is an article about anarchism. Not Russian anarchism. Not European anarchism. Just anarchism. So it's not a big leap to assume that American anarchism (or the anarchism of other countries) should be included.

There is more on American anarchism that needs to be in the article. These edits are just a start.

I'll find references to show how Jesus was anti-authoritarian and revolutionary and he most certainly was. I can't account for why the revolutionary direction to his desciples was not included in the article  Jesus, I didn't write it. I can imagine why, though, LOL.

You, socialist-communists just keep dominating this article like it personally belongs to you. It doesn't. You do the same thing to, or worse, stuff that you accuse other editors of doing, and then harass them to no end. Like what you are doing to Intangible right now, which I just discovered today.

To what ends will you go to guard this aricle and keep it communistic?  How low will you people go? Please try and behave yourselves. duck talk """,0

 South China Institute of Technology 

Hello again
[Written before the block. Posting it anyway.] Hi Liuyg (or ). I have seen the Leiden ranking website. I did electronic searches for """"South"""" and """"China"""" but did not find South China University of Technology at all, so the page does not your claim that Leiden ranks SCUT as """"4th in China"""". If I made a mistake, just let me know what rank SCUT appears at, and I will add the information to the article myself.

Pages on universities have to present independently confirmed information on universities. Vague promotional language like """"world class"""" and """"top ranking"""" is not good enough. Also, you added no source to support your claim that SCUT was founded in 1924 and not in 1952. (Sun Yat-sen University was founded in 1924.) Besides, the long list of rankings is not proper Wikipedia format (see WP:UNIV): you should just name SCUT's rank and add the reference. Finally, your large edit is often made of incomplete sentences, and it removed a lot of useful wikilinks. You added too much flawed material at the same time, so I had to revert.

Some of the information you want to add might be valuable. Other editors, including myself, will help you if you add a small amount of material each time, or if you discuss your additions on the talk page. Wikipedia is based on discussion and consensus, so please stop adding this badly formatted, badly written, and badly referenced material all at the same time! Once again, I have to revert you, and I will notify an admin if you revert back again.   """,0

Hi Legolas95, thank you for acknowledging my concern;
In etymology section, user:sitush has previously suggested while replying to another user - to restore the previous content excluding Sadasivan's book reference.  The concerned sentence from this reference was self-explanatory and was not inclined to any side as to why the term Nayar is derived from Naagar.  Please consider the following point also that the Naga point of etymology was not given consideration because of misinterpretation that real serpents have evolved to constitute Nair population - which is entirely false.  I was really mentioning this census report shall stand as an authentic reference for the same.
My second humble suggestion was to consider the caste system in the article.  I would like to invite your attention to the first sentence ie.
""""The Nambudiri Brahmins were at the top of the ritual caste hierarchy and in that system outranked even the kings.""""
This sentence at the beginning says about the role of Namboodiri class in Kerala as a whole.  This is not about Nairs or the caste system of nairs.  Here the proposed sentence gives little light on the scene ie.
""""Nairs observed no internal caste system till the Brahmin migration occurred in Kerala.""""
This is not promotional to nairs but it indirectly says Brahmin migration has influenced Nair caste system.  My kind opinion is that it is better to remove present first sentence.
Second sentence says,
""""Bulk of them formed the fighting and protecting class, some of whom became chiefs and Naduvazhis. Some sections of the people were engaged in other occupations also.""""
This actually represent all sides of the community.  Tell me if this sentence seems inclined certainly we shall remove this.
The third sentence I consider as little important:  It says,
""""It is a notable point that long before Aryans migrated southwards, Nairs had travelled far beyond the northern tradition of chathurvarna system and developed a multiplicity of castes.""""
This sentence actually demonstrates that Nair community's social structure is prone to faster development.

I have a request to user:Legolas95 user:Sitush and user:Qwyrxian - In the reference under consideration, there is a sentence claiming that 'there is no evidence that before 18th century (before 1700 AD) the term sudra was ever applied to Nairs.'  If this like a sentence requires verification, we need to consider references created before this period.  What in my mind is that if we be little flexible on the matter of older reference - it can help Nair article.    

These were my concerns regarding this census report which are quite eligible to be considered and provides some help towards improvement in the article.    19:27""",0

"Confucianism 

Confucius predates Aristotle in using family as a model for the state.  He believed the child should be subordinate to the parent, younger brother to the older, wife to husband, and subject to the sovereign who is to be regarded as the father of the nation.  The state as the family writ large was the most harmonious, orderly, and natural form of government.  This was later expanded to cover international relations(i.e. the emperor of China as the older brother of the king of Korea).  Confucian family theory is still espoused in North Korea to justify their method of leadership succession.

I am sorry for seeming so aggressive.  I am a Corps Member in Columbus, Ohio. I'd like to meet you at Cyzygy if you are available. We aren't a big site, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find me. City Year so far has been a trying but ultimately positive experience. This year has taught me so much about myself and about the world, and have grown up leaps and bounds.  Helping with this page is the least I can do to give back.  If you could pass this thanks to the higher ups, I would be very grateful.  

City Year is definitely entitled to put stuff on Wikipedia, but please keep this in mind:  WP:SOAP.  To be quite honest with you, writing is not one of my strengths. There are ways to rephrase what I have said that are better.  From what I have wrote, however, i have attempted to create multi sourced statements.  When editing this page, unless the outside source as been completely removed, it is a good idea to leave the outside sources in the page.  I already have some good outside sources already mentioned in the article: City_Year#References. To save you time, you can use some of these existing outside sources in addition to the main CY site stuff for sources.  For example, the first source on this page is something from the Fast Company website. it is titled  (Ctl F to find that).  In order to cite statements with a source that is already inputed into a page, one only needs to add a """"/"""" to the reference tag: """".""""  For example:

Hello everyone.  
City Year is cool.

How are you doing today?
I am doing great

""":::I restored the simple clear version of the argument without the miss-leading phrases like """"pass-over"""" and the miss-leading statement that implies some ballots are simply disregarded (rather than some rankings on some ballots, where the voter's first choice is still in the running, are not used, etc.) The phrasing proposed by Abd creates a false impression to most Wikipedia readers about the nature of this CON argument. Nobody is arguing that a candidate with a majority of first preferences is passed-over in favor of a weaker candidate, nor that some valid ballots are simply ignored...yet that is the impression that Abd's choice of words leaves with most readers. His summary of the issue does not capture the thrust of the main claim that exhausted ballots can lead to sub-50% winners, nor even the much rarer claim that candidates with much less core support, but broader secondary support, may get eliminated.

As far as Mel Bay's catalogue is concerned, Marlow has one little piece """"Of the Sea"""" in an anthology (not edited by her and not for 10-string guitar, ISBN: 0786674563), and some arrangements for flute and SIX-string guitar of easy/light classics (ISBN: 078664687X). This is hardly anything to base a claim on of someone being an authority on the TEN-string guitar. Also, anyone with musical knowledge can compare the quality of my own editions on my site and those by Janet Marlow and see who is the authority.

Anyway, I have the support of Fritz Buss, who studied with Yepes between 1960 and 1986 and whom Yepes considered """"an excellent guitarist with a wonderful technique but also a deep musician aware of his responsibility and always in search of more knowledge and perfection"""" as well as considering Buss one of the three best guitar teachers in the word .

I added this to the personal information about Bethmann-Hollweg, along with a link to a PDF of the article in the New York Times.  All I said was that according to this article, he was of Jewish extraction. That is a demonstrably, undeniably true statement!  It definitely was stated in an AP report that appeared in the New York Times that Bethmann-Hollweg was of Jewish descent.  Why then would somebody keep removing this reference?  GoodMorningWorld has done this several times. He claims that it is CERTAINLY not true, but IT IS CERTAIN that the AP said it and that it appears in the New York Times.  If GoodMorningWorld has some argument that the claim in the AP story was wrong then he should post it in the text of the article along with the claim.  Otherwise he appears to be trying to censor information that he finds disagreeable. Who the hell does he think he is?  
I explained to you why including this information in the article is inappropriate, on your Talk page on July 2: """"It doesn't matter what some foreign correspondent for the NYT mistakenly wrote 90 years ago if we know with certainty that it is false. The only reason to include it in the encyclopedia would be if the false report had turned into an incident in its own right. In that case, some brief mention might be warranted. Otherwise, no."""" Wikipedia is not an indiscrimate collection of information.   

You haven't explained anything that matters.  You assert that the information is false, despite the eminence of the source, and the information is to be suppressed based on nothing more than your say-so.  Why you believe that it is false is your own secret; it is clear only that you do not want to allow it to be discussed. I do not think that this kind of dogmatism and censoriousness represent an appropriate attitude for someone contributing to an encyclopaedia. 

Since there is a section of the article that discusses Bethmann-Hollweg's ethnic heritage, I think it is clearly relevant that he was identified by the Associated Press and the New York Times in his own lifetime as a person of Jewish descent. The Associated Press and the New York Times are normally considered credible journalistic sources, so that the burden of proof rests on you to show that what was reported was false. If you really know what you pretend to know, that Bethmann-Hollweg was not a person of Jewish descent, then prove it.   
I'm growing really tired of Hadding's belligerent, know-nothing approach to encyclopedic articles. Wikipedia isn't some game where you fire up Google, find a hit, then carry that snippet back here and wedge it into an article, without knowing anything at all about the article subject and therefore being in no position to evaluate its accuracy. I am reverting Hadding's repeated insertion of false information. Hadding, consider this your only warning. If you continue this destructive and harmful approach I will report you to an admin noticeboard. Alternatively – if you want to demonstrate a sincere interest – then learn German and read this passage in a book by historian Fritz Fischer, which speaks of B.-H.'s parentage. Or just read the goddamn Wikipedia article which already contains that information.   

That is not a """"passage"""" about """"Bethmann-Hollweg's parentage.""""  That is a chapter about Bethmann-Hollweg as chancellor, from a book about Hitler. I do not believe that the claim from the Associated Press and New York Times about Bethmann-Hollweg's Jewish ethnic heritage is addressed whatsoever in that book.  

If there is a sentence in that book that you think makes your case then why don't you cite it?  

I hope that you do call in the administrators, because I would like to call attention to a certain paranoid mind that believes that there is some conspiracy spanning the entire internet with the purpose of misrepresenting certain people as Jews. To wit, from the history page of the Bethmann-Hollweg entry:

"Material from theraputic vaccines - too technical 

The following was added to the therapeutic vaccines section recently.  I am not sure whether it should just be removed, or if there is material here that once simplified might be useful to include.

HPV-associated neoplasia are being used to test antigen specific immunotherapies. Therapies have focused on HPV's susceptibility to immune manipulation. Imiquimod, a toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 agonist, works as an inducer of natural immune responses and has been approved by the FDA as first-line therapy for external genital warts.  

  Focus has been put on testing T-cell responses to HPV E6 or E7 in intraepithelial lesions. Therapeutic HPV vaccines work to induce increased T-cell responses in humans. In clinical trials, these therapies were administered through different delivery systems such as fusion proteins used alone and with adjuvant, encapsulated polynucleotides, protein with adjuvant, recombinant viruses, DNA constructs, dendritic cells, and chimeric VLP constructs. While patients part of this clinical testing showed limited benefit from therapeutic induced T-cells responses, they were poor targets for antigen-specific therapies. The patients had late-stage disease, giving the tumors more time to develop mutations as well as deletions of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation.

The first paragraph has no obvious relation to vaccines, since it appears to be talking about other types of therapies.  If it relates to vaccines somehow, that needs to be clarified.  The other paragraph is too technical without enough explanation to make it comprehensible.  

Please see WP:MEDMOS, both for language/audience, and a little bit on what should be in a research section.  Research sections are not for detailed explanations of the research, but to indicate major directions and progress, if there is coverage in significant sources.  (e.g. a review of research in an area might be a decent source, individual research papers - much more problematic).",0

A few points if I may.

1)I wasn't really interested in this GW issue until I came here and realized how crappy the science was, and the writing, all of which based on models as far as the eye can see: the real quality of which is inversely proportional to the control of the information -mostly by people whose careers depend on it, namely modelers. 

2)As far as the table is concerned, like I said before, it's a unit increased in CO2, as in """"unit vector of change"""", for whatever use that might be, I just liked it; that's all it is. 

3)I'm also asking that if there is at least one single article, on any actual physical experiment, conducted in a microcosm, for instance, that could compliment the overwhelming propensity of models, it would be nice to include it here... provided it could get in.

Eisenhower and McCarthy
Below is some proposed language for the Ike/McCarthy subhead; I've placed it here because it contains a lot of """"perhaps'es"""", but hopefully it's illumintating.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower due to his past close association with General Omar Bradley may have been apprised of the existence of the Venona project, the secret program within the U.S. Army Signals Intelligence Service decrypting KGB messages originating in the United States.  Eisenhower's former chief of intelligence and the first head of the CIA, General Walter Beedle Smith may have been brought in on the secret too, and the CIA began recieving some decrypted information in 1953.  There is no indication Eisenhower's Attorney General Herbert Brownell, Jr. was made aware of the highly secret information.

"It's true so far as it goes, it is the established church in England, the Dicoese of Gibraltar in Europe forms a part of the Church of England, but not the established church (its Diocesan is not entitled to a seat in the Lords for example).  Similarly Sodor and Man is not entitled to a seat in the Lrods, but does sit in some capacity in the House of Keys, the Channel Islands are also interesting, not part of the UK, in church terms they are an integral par of the Anglican Diocese of Portsmouth, and I'm really not sure of the consitutional position of the church there.  There's the added complication that the boundary between the Church of England and Church in Wales doesn't follow the civil boundaries, so some Welsh parishes are still in the Church of England, and some English in CinW.

I agree there's no """"English race"""" (indeed there's no such thing as """"biological race""""), and I agree that people who identify as English have various mixed ancestries (including ancestries from all continents), but I don't agree that anyone who lives in England in automatically English. I lived in England for five years but I didn't automatically stop being Welsh, and I didn't start to call myself English. Generally English people are people who identify themselves as English and who are identified as English by others, whatever their ancestry. A more specific way to identify English people might be to assert that they must have some belief in a shared common ancestry with other people living in what is now England, though this is a subjective belief because all human groups have a demonstrable close and recent shared ancestry.

Settlement in river valleys made use of the flooded areas for crop growth - risky, but worth it.  The surrounding forests would have provide adequate game.  The marshiness of the area may well have followed on from the deforestation by farmers.

"Is Wikipedia broken? 

Hi Piotrus,
After reading your morsels of wisdom, I have a couple of questions/comments/rants for you. I have seen several times editors leaving WP claiming WP is/was broken beyond repair or something. I think such a claim is fundamentally wrong.

The way I see it, Wikipedia is a complex dynamical system, with rather nontrivial internal interactions of a huge number of contributors and bureaucrats.  Moreover, it is probably governed by certain laws under certain assumptions. There is a microscale (individual contributors editing certain articles), a mesoscale (groups of editors pushing their agenda in a group of articles) and a macroscale, the whole project evolving over years. On a microscale nothing matters. You, me can join, can leave Wikipedia, very few would even notice. In a matter of days, may be months names and contributions would be forgotten, the project would however survive. 

What is interesting to me is that your morsels capture certain dynamics on a mesoscale quite well. And that made me wonder if you can share your thoughts over the future dynamics of the whole project here. Not just some subproject, not just over the next few days, but the whole Wikipedia over years.

That brings me to the next question. How can one claim the system of Wikipedia is broken? Do they understand the dynamics of Wikipedia better than me so that they see something that defies/breaks some natural laws? I understand that they joined the project to help it achieve a certain goal (whatever they set in their mind) and after a failure to do so, they leave frustrated. But to claim Wikipedia is broken? Why? What do they see that I do not? To me it is akin to claiming that the nature is broken after seeing that foxes eat rabbits. What do you think about that? (  )",0

OK, I'll list here what you flagged. Some are not mine. I'll comment later and see if others have individual opinion first.   
Since then similar efforts have been organized for other 2008 presidential candidates.[citation needed]
Sample comment: This seems to be a fine summary statement, reliably sourced in the article such as by UPI. We can just copy the footnote refs to it.   
The popular usage of """"moneybomb"""" to describe a coordinated mass donation drive for a political candidate can be traced to a weekly donation drive, the Ron Paul Money Bomb, which aimed to raise $1 million each week for Ron Paul's presidential campaign.[2][citation needed] (Daily Paul)
Jesse Elder, a New York City jazz pianist,[3][4] registered the new identity """"RonPaulMoneyBomb"""" at YouTube;[5][citation needed] (New York Times, All About Jazz, YouTube)
Eric Nordstrom then registered the identical .com domain.[6][citation needed] (Network Solutions)
Supporters of Mike Huckabee organized a moneybomb on November 20 to commemorate International Children's Day, which raised nearly $225,000, well over the pledged amount, bringing Huckabee's monthly total to $1 million as of November 20th.[11][citation needed] (Nov20ForTheChildren)
Supporters of Dennis Kucinich's presidential campaign are also using the term """"moneybomb"""" to describe their own major fundraising drive aimed for December 15, 2007, the anniversary of the Bill of Rights coming into effect.[12][citation needed] (News and Policy)
Proposed on November 6 on Daily Kos, the drive has an ultimate goal for 100,000 pledges of $100.[13][citation needed] (December152007)
Kucinich supporters are using viral advertising techniques to promote the drive by putting up YouTube videos and circulating them throughout the web.[citation needed]
Along with generating a significant amount of donations for a political candidate, a moneybomb can also generate significant media interest in a largely unknown candidate.[citation needed]
In addition to the media coverage, the November 5 drive was able to get 21,000 new donors to the campaign, over half of the donors on that day.[18][citation needed] (AP)
While there is no definitive link, after November 5, Ron Paul saw a measurable rise in the polls, showing the potential ability for a moneybomb to improve a candidate's place in a political campaign.[20][21][citation needed] (TransWorldNews, NBC4)""",0

"Hello Botteville. Yes, I suppose it is more or less a misunderstanding. The things are quite complicated and there is another possibility for the origin of the latinized version Carolus and I do not think it directly comes from *Kar(i)laz, because Carolus was borrowed from Germanic, when Common Germanic had already disappeared for a long time, that is quite hypothetic, and there is another possible etymology. See for example this very well documented site . I suppose Carolus was borrowed from Old High German or Old Franconian. That is why I do not accept the very shortened statement *Kar(i)laz > Carolus. I agree totally about Carolus > Charles, with some typical French phonetic shifts. I know that the meaning of churl is different, but it is the same etymological root, ultimatly from *kar(i)laz, sure, but through an intermediate West Germanic form *keril-.

Do prototypes necessarily use a sort of """"prototyping"""" material? Aren't models made of a different material called a mockup or something of the sort? In that case, the chef example above doesn't work - the new creations are prototypes. 
As for the others, the newspaper industry does use prototypes. That is, the first version referred to above. The first version is the definition of prototype - the prototype is the first version.
The coal industry could benefit greatly from prototypes, and I'm sure they use them already. There are immense safety concerns, to name one only area in which a model, perhaps not full-sized, of a coal mine would work. Additionally, the coal mines themselves are not the only asset of the coal industry - you have countless types of vehicles, mining equipment, and support equipment.
Milking cows - there would of course be no cow prototypes, as cows are not the product of the dairy industry. Instead, milk is. And I would hope there is prototype milk - a sample of the milk throughout its development cycle to make sure it is safe and clean.
As for pet stores, it is right that they would doubtless have a need for a prototype. However, a prototype is used for a product. A pet store has no """"products"""", instead they offer a service.

Even if there were ambiguity about whether FISA, read together with the AUMF, permits the President to authorize the NSA activities, the canon of constitutional avoidance requires reading these statutes in harmony to overcome any restrictions in FISA and Title III, at least as they might otherwise apply to the congressionally authorized armed conflict with al Qaeda. Indeed, were FISA and Title III interpreted to impede the President’s ability to use the traditional tool of electronic surveillance to detect and prevent future attacks by a declared enemy that has already struck at the homeland and is engaged in ongoing operations against the United States, the constitutionality of FISA, as applied to that situation, would be called into very serious doubt. In fact, if this difficult constitutional question had to be addressed, FISA would be unconstitutional as applied to this narrow context. Importantly, the FISA Court of Review itself recognized just three years ago that the President retains constitutional authority to conduct foreign surveillance apart from the FISA framework, and the President is certainly entitled, at a minimum, to rely on that judicial interpretation of the Constitution and FISA.",0

 Nude beach & controversy 

In using the terms I have used in writing and revising this part of this article, I have sought to improve the article for the widest reading audience.

All opinions are of equal value in Wikipedia, including this part of the article about a legal controversy, even if I feel that I bring to the table both an English degree and a Juris Doctor.

I have learned in my experience that some legal terms (e.g., """"upheld"""" being misunderstood understood to mean """"held up,” rather than being more correctly understood  as an action more akin to """"approving"""" a lower court’s decision) can be confusing to all levels of readers,  intelligent well-educated  readers and average readers alike.

 French Academy 

Hi Espoo.  I got your link after the RM discussion had already been closed as a """"no consensus"""".  I can see why you find it frustrating.  The guideline says that, if an English language name is in common use, then we should use it.  I'm mildly surprised to see that """"French Academy"""" is used as widely as your sources show it to be - personally, I've only ever heard it called The Academie Francaise (with or without diacritics), and I grew up in Texas!  Nevertheless my personal anecdotal experience means nothing when it comes to making decisions for the encyclopedia.

It does seem to be the case that most people in that discussion were willing to discount Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English) in this case.  Why not bring it up there, on the guideline talk page?  I'll bet that's a good place to find people who care about that guideline, as well as people who've dealt with similar controversial cases in the past.  I've added the guideline to my watchlist; I'll keep an eye out for what kind of response you get there.  If Académie française is to be an exception to the Use English guideline, then I think it should be explained why it is, and how to recognize such exceptions in the future. - """,0

"Link Building strategies 

Link building is the practice of getting other sites to link back to your website. This can often be done using a wide variety of strategies, such as:

Asking for a link
Giving away content or tools
Widget development
Social media campaigns
Purchasing links and more….
But first, let’s start with the basic theories…

* Why Link Building Matters

Whenever any user enters a query into a search engine, the search engine needs to determine how to return the best results. How? There are two key steps:
Figure out which pages on the web are related in any way to the query
Evaluate which of the pages that relate to the query are the most important
Each link to a web page is seen as a vote for that web page.
In simple terms, if there are two pages that are equally relevant to a given search query, the page with the better inbound link profile will rank higher than the other page (being all other factors equal).
Hence, the need of Link Building!

*How Search Engines Evaluate Links

Each link to a web page is a vote for that web page.
That implies the higher the PR, the more the value of that vote. This is partially true. But, two votes may not have equal weight even if they are from same PR page.
Value of vote depends on – Relevance and Authority
Now let’s take a deeper look at these factors…

* Relevance Factor

Theme of the linking website
Purpose of the linking website
Topic of the linking page",0

However, we had a nationally funded encyclopedia (Banglapedia) published by the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh. Back in 2005, I initiated a discussion with Asiatic Society to get their content released to Wikipedia under GFDL. As these talks were going on, I had seeded a few articles from text from Banglapedia, and had then paraphrased or rewrote the text in my own words, and cited back to the corresponding Banglapedia article as reference. If you look at the evolution of several articles (not the ones listed above), you can see the workflow. However, for some articles, it seems that I have missed paraphrasing or rewriting them. If you are looking to identify more of such possible articles, I suggest you look at the ones written in summer 2005 timeframe. I will do my own search and actively assist in rewriting the articles to remove copyright issues. Thanks.",0

Normally with umbrella nominations there is a record of all the pages deleted at the XfD page itself, but I don't think there was in this case.

 A very Californian RfA thanks from  

  
 Thanks for your support in my not-so-recent RfA, which succeeded with a final tally of (97/4/4)! I've never been able to accept compliments gracefully, and the heavy support from this outstanding community left me at a complete loss for words  so, a very belated thank you for all of your kind words.

I have done and will continue to do the utmost to serve the community in this new capacity, wherever it may take me, and to set an example others might wish to follow in.

Hopefully then they don't start talking about the explosive ArbComm case I got tied into and oh what a drama that was, but we'll see, won't we?

Surely some of you have seen me in action by now; with that in mind, I openly invite and welcome any feedback here or   help me become the best editor and sysop I can be.

Are we still debating the validity of the sentence that says """"... does not require equal angles between the input shaft axis and the joint, and output shaft axis and the joint, to maintain constant velocity""""?

I move to strike  from the Lead.   

I also move to strike the entire last paragraph of the lead {{Genealogical researchers have documented that ancestors of many Lumbee families were part of a tri-racial isolate group of predominantly African and European ethnicity, originating among individuals free in colonial Virginia. Most such free African Americans were descended from unions between white women, servant or free, and African men, servant, free or enslaved. Although relationships across racial lines were tolerated among the servant class in early colonial days, Virginia officials later moved to outlaw them. In the mid-1700s, the free colored families of Virginia migrated together, with other European colonists, into the interior of North Carolina. Researcher Paul Heinegg noted numerous families identified as mulattos, many with characteristically Lumbee names, in the 1768-1770 tax lists for Bladen County, from which Robeson County was formed. Heinegg found no nuclear families listed as Indian. In the 1790-1800 censuses, all free people of color were listed under """"other free"""".[3]}}

There will be scheduled meetings on every Tuesday at 14:00 in room 111. All group members are required to attend these meetings. Please remember that success of group projects highly depend upon productive group meetings, so please try to make every single one of them.
 
These meetings will start from next week, 6th October Tuesday. I would be heading the first meeting as the Chairperson and Sam would be the Secretory. The post of the chairperson and secretory would keep on rotating so that everyone is involved in this group project.
 
As discussed in today's meeting there are a few tasks that need to be addressed before the meeting on Tuesday, 6th October; which are as follows:
 
    *
      Setting up a Wiki Forum to have an effective group communication system and also providing easy access to the projectmaterial to all the group members. Tejal volunteered to set up the forum. All details of it will be passed on to all of you as soonas it is finished.
    *
      Coming up with conceptual design and ideas for the payload because as we all know payload is most important driver of thesatellite design, so ideally that would be the first step in our project.
    *
      Also please note down the email IDs of all the group members for future contact. And don't forget to buy a log book foryourselves.

If you have any further queries please don't hesitate to contact me.

Evils of Atheism

It's about damn time somebody taught atheists their own medicine, and before you ask, I do not generalize, I think there's a cultural distinction between atheism and nonbelievers. Atheists tend to be enraged over religion of any kind, and spend a lot of time elevating Darwin and bemoaning the Crusades. Nonbelievers in general - say, someone who's raised a Christian, believes the Bible is an allegory, and only attends church for a funeral or perhaps at Christmastime - tend to adopt a """"Whatever gets you through the night"""" philosophy and be quiet on matters of faith. It's sort of like the difference between a devout vegetarian and someone who hates the taste of meat. Atheists are proud of their hate. It is something that they love devoutly and use it to hate christians.""",0

I understand your point. I simply do not believe it to be valid. During the period in question, the RC Church did not have large armies at its disposal. It relied on secular powers to take heed of its views. In France, Louis, a loyal Catholic hated the concept of religious toleration. The RC Church, at this time, were also opposed to this principle (one that has become so widely accepted in 'western' societies that it is often difficult to imagine a time before). Louis, with the tactic support of leading Churchman, ordered acts of anti-Protestant terror. (Let's be completely honest, without the tactic approval of the Church, would a devout Catholic have been committed to such a course of action?) Some leading Churchman celebrated the outcome - a France almost completely 'cleansed' of Protestants. Now, in all the material the criticism of the RC Church is so obviously implied that this shouldn't need re-emphasising.

Killer, I'm sorry that you have misread my unblock request. If you re-read it you will see that my use of """"pop-eyed chihuahua"""" there refers specifically, accurately and unequivocally to the dog displayed on your user page and not to you. I cited it to explain to why I used that imagery in the WP:PA, as otherwise it would appear inexplicably random. The explanation was not, as you seem to think, offered in mitigation. Indeed my original unblock request, which I condensed at the request of admin Hersfold, stated: 

The following will help the reviewing admin(s) to understand what otherwise would appear to be a random choice of metaphors.[...] Killer has a picture of a pop-eyed chihuahua dog on her user page,  captioned “I look like this”; and she is in the habit of referring to herself, in her sysopping summaries, as a dog   e.g. “Puppy has spoken.” Stupidly I exploited this canine imagery at Killer’s expense.'' 

I edited out that section along with others in an effort to comply with Hersfold's request.

My unblock request in no way implies that it is 'somehow OK to insult' you because you refer to yourself as 'puppy'. It simply explains where the idea for the canine imagery came from. It does not attempt to excuse my using it to insult you.

I have apologised, and still do, for my rude and offensive references to you personally in the WP:PA; and ask that you graciously accept my apology as sincere, which it is.   """,1

There's already Liturgical year, which discusses the Proper of the Season, although it can be a bit confusing since it discusses Catholic and Protestant uses, which aren't always the same. Any article would have to include both the pre- and post-Vatican II calendars, most notably Septuagesima and Passiontide as well as Ordinary Time vs. Time after Epiphany/Pentecost. The only change I see would be to create a specific """"Roman Catholic Liturgical Year"""" article. As for the 1962 Calendar of the Saints, I created the older one mainly because I already had the pre-1955 calendar in electronic format, it's more consistent with past use since Trent, and it includes feasts that were later dropped. I think the same article can be used for both the 1955 and 1962 calendars, adding the rank of feasts (Double/III Class), and some sort of special formatting or asterisks for Feasts which are only on one or the other.  
Re-reading the first comment, I'm also starting to like the idea. We can have one article on the year in general, what effect it has on the liturgy, and the arrangement of the liturgical books, with sections or sub-articles on the Proper of the Season and the Proper of the Saints, both articles discussing the 1955/1962 and 1970 versions.

Just a few thoughts/reccs, do with as you will

Nice significant adds of content.  Kind of leading to following

A. On the Myth section, you've kind of got stuff at both the front and at the beginning that contrasts versus Ovid. 

1. I would move that stuff you have on top of Ovid that is comparisons and then put it down integrated into the later section. cut the summary of the summaries (nuke that).  So it would go 2 equals Myth, no writing, 3 equals Ovid, then 3 equals other myths

2.  Within  Ovid, maybe add some comment about Metamorphoses being wildly popular (RS avail in wiki article for that) at the time and that Ovid;s version is has become the familiar version of t

he myth to present day people.  Then all the story telling.

3.  I like how you've got more meat in Other versions.  But take it even a step further.  Give me some dates.  Let me know if any of the versions were known to have influenced each other or Ovid (don't explain a negative, but if there is anyhing mentione it.  And discuss all the differences in story (you have that).

B.  Not perfect, but would stick the Guardian comment in Interprectation, at beginning or end.  It's commentary on the myth, not literature.

C.  I like the in-article discussion of myrrh.  You will get some who kvetch, but the two are so linked and the term so strange to the modern ear.  I might move all the myrrh stuff except the Latin name (so the Biblical notes and acnient usage) and stick it at the end of etymology and origin.  Follows well after the myrrh-Myrrha word linkage.  And explains the substance a little earlier in article (so doing more good).  Only bad thing is you lose the connection to the image of myrrh.  could just switch back to lady bug though.  donno if there is a way to fit two images in that tiny Origins section.  you do have pics of the tree anyhow in the form of her transformation.

D.  There are some things I remember missing now.  If that is intentional, editorially fine.

 Merging Red Hand of Doom and Reliability issue 

Given that there's not alot of information regarding RHoD I'm not sure I agree that it deserves it's own article. Given that I do think it belongs in Wikipedia, and suggest merging and redirecting it with a new article on other similarly-themed D&D; modules. This would have the advantage of 1) allying yourself with other editors with articles in this category, and 2) being able to gather all the secondary sources in one place to address notability concerns. I was thinking about this last night and had the idea that it could fit with 3rd edition modules with a generic setting. That would be a pretty good list of modules; take a look at List of Dungeons & Dragons adventures, and we should be able to gather a good number of secondary sources. I'd be happy to put in work on this. 

Also I'd like to get the issue of whether or not some of the secondary sources being used by D&D; editors that the deletionists view as """"fansites"""" are indeed reliable sources. I'll be happy to put in the work or collaborate on this if you would gather up a list of the disputed sources you have been using. I think other people, such as user:webwarlock, might be interested also. We could submit the case to wp:Reliable sources/Noticeboard and then notify Jack and Gavin so they can see what's going on and make their own arguments. If it can't be resolved there then we can kick it up to informal mediation by the mediation cabal.

"(to Iridescent, waaaay back above) You are probably the best person to actually propose such reforms.  While I grant that you don't have the time, those of us currently trying to do the committee's day-to-day work are hamstrung by that workload.  Even assuming that actual membership on the committee doesn't impose a myopic outlook on its structure and problems, the workload is both a split in attention and loyalty.  What you have that no one else has (except the sitting committee and recently retired arbs like Coren and John Vandenberg) is an insider's view of what the workload actually entails.  On that basis, I think you have the best combination of credibility and support, if you can find the time to put a proposal together. Cheers,",0

My point is that the other side could be argued just as easily. The outer 80 m spans of the Kap Shui Mun would have to be much shorter if they were not receiving support from the stays.
I am only familiar with a handful of the bridges on this list of the 117 longest and was able to point out an example where there is subjectivity in total cable-supported length. I have no idea how many others on the list might have be debatable and therefore question why it is as simple as you say.
This is the same reason why the article List of bridges by length has a big disclaimer at the top that basically says, """"Hey, we are not really sure of these numbers. We don't know where the measurement starts; we don't know where it ends. In fact, some of these numbers are just plain guesses.""""
It sounds to me that you are proposing a column on this list that will require the same disclaimer once future editors add or edit information. -   """,0

I agree with Demiurge1000. Stanistani, please lift the ban on the account """"bryansee"""" on Wikipediocracy.com. I have no intention of posting what you unilaterally deem as unsuitable material. And you don't aware that the clear signal sent by admins on behalf of BatteryIncluded have a ripple effect throughout the Internet. You don't seem to distinguish the meaning of life and death of people on the Internet. And don't do anything to harm/destroy my computer with input device-disabling malware. Let me make myself clear about Wikipedia:

 The administrators and editors alike have turned Wikipedia into an online totalitarian regime, and no one has done a darn thing about it if they don't want to be immediately killed, beaten or received intimidating death threats. BatteryIncluded, Dennis Brown, AGK, and Boing! said Zebedee are said to be a part of them. They tend to use misleading and incivil statements as credible, accurate and correct. They also tend to use personal attacks and outs people as well. This is why they hate them as well.
 This explains cabalism in Wikipedia as well.
 This explains the unevenly enforced, extreme and heavy-handed rules enacted by the Wikipedia community, BatteryIncluded is such a prime example. Others outside Wikipedia really want to worship these rules as well - BatteryIncluded's ally """"forcedmemefred"""" is the first one - trying to protect Wikipedia from external harassment.
 Wikipedia editors, such as  died last April in a rock-climbing accident. Although a loss for Wikipedia, her death might have been deemed by the Wikipedia community as a """"human sacrifice""""; BatteryIncluded and his people perceived it as she's """"well"""", meaning that she has cured her paranoia. This may apply to me and you as well, as we have signed separate death warrants. I think I have to say that, any increase in their medication dose will not cure paranoia, instead it will be deadly to people. I guess that Wikipedia is not the only one, but also Wikipediocracy (by  as Zoloft), Encyclopedia Dramatica and Know Your Meme (via forcedmemefred).
 I think this is the fate that you are going to face later on, especially you are taking actions therein that are aimed at Wikipedia, just as what I've did.
 And, these events have signalled a neo-luddite sentiment against computers and other devices that has the capability to connect to a network given these events, namely computers being the cause of people's paranoia deemed by BatteryIncluded, forcedmemefred and his subordinates. Given the fact Wikipedia is being used to spread malicious code and has the tendency of giving people malware, this is the case for BatteryIncluded as he does to the computers of many users he is dealing with.
 BatteryIncluded is really the worst one I've ever seen on the Internet.
 He gives people kittens. """"Kittens"""" may be a bomb with a intimidating death therat. The kitten that BatteryIncluded sent me might be a bomb. And  is thought by BatteryIncluded to contain kittens.
 He has the reputation of distorting people's histories.
 He has the reputation of sacrificing humans via increase in their medication, as well as making death threats in the guise of """"seeing a doctor/therapist"""" advices, as well as inciting neo-luddism against computers.
 He is the source of inspiration of admins and activist alike making personal attacks and acting unilaterally to ban people.
 Every page on Wikipedia is outrightly misleading, and """"truth"""" is based on whoever edits last. This is why Wikipedia is unreliable in many days, and is a lost cause.

So, you still ignore my comments there, do you, Stanistani? 103.244.189.183  """,0

 Progress at this point 

By now you should have ...

1. Moved the material on your user page about Daudi Mwangosi under the """"Adopt a Journalist"""" section to . Copy that material, click on the red link, and paste the material on that page!

2. Run your reflinks tool in the banner (by right clicking and creating a new tab). It might take a minute to complete the operation  be patient. You will copy over the results from the tool tab you create to replace the existing ref tags in your article.

3. Taken the Wikipedia tutorial. After you do, begin writing your article.""",0
"Demographics of Chile

I generally like your edits which are better sourced and more clear except for a few things:
You make it seem that lower class Chileans are mainly Indian, Middle Class are half half and higher class are mainly Spanish. This is not the case. Middle class Chileans are of mainly Spanish origin as are most those of lower class. I would like to see a source for the figure of 43% Indian admixture. Your language also denotes and intent to maximise the Indian origin of Chileans? Why is this?",0

Dev920 is a sophomore - hence the naive arguments about evidence. What is clear to one person is disputed by someone else (look at how many articles on wiki are 'defended' by fans in denial about their heroes). It is always possible to 'dispute' evidence. Lawyers make a living out of it. Dev920's long term aim is to remove the article entirely. That has been clear for months. He has an authoritarian personality.,0
