Oh hi. Long story short so I won't be """"ranting"""" (or what not) this time:

So Sjones is wikihounding me constantly for nearly a year now, and his pal Bridies is also obsessed with me to the point of where the great most of his entire activity here on Wikipedia in the 5 months was all about how to rid of me (while I've substantionally adited hundreds of different articles during the same period, over 5,000 in total since March 2012). That's just not normal. Btw, right now I'm blocked because I referred to this wikihounding by """"stalking"""" (which is just semantics really, apparently they call it """"cyberbullying"""" now outside the Wikipedia).

Now, GAs. Basically what The Devil's Advocate wrote in his comment - and this example of the so-called """"additional evidence"""" (as it was called by Sjones in his wikihounding thread) is indeed a good example of """"evidence"""", as it shows what is actually this """"problem"""" with me - and it's that I actually know (and obey) all the policies, rules and guidelines (including but not limited to everything regarding GAs and their reviewing process), while many reviewers don't know, and even when they're informed about the rules and guidelines (the proper ones, because in this case the reviewer was misinformed by some other apparently uninformed users, strangely including at least 1 admin) they might even flatly and completely refuse to acknowledge and use them (here, the reviewer's invoking """"ignore all rules"""" instead of admitting the wrong). I'm all for proper reviewing, instead of incorrect/arbitrary, which is why I've opened this thread recently (aftter this very debacle, precisely) because the scale of this problem (various types of bad reviewing) is pretty alarming, and some reviewers' blatant refusal to play by rules after they're being informed about them is just absolutely unacceptable (that's my opinion, at least, but I can't see how could I be any wrong with being right).

If Wikipedia decides to semi-protect or totally protect a generic conceptual confusion, then stupidity must have reached its top. Worse than that can it not become. An encyclopedia that guards total conceptual confusion with all its forces must be a world and historical record of stupidity.

Sorry, did Bastun just claim to be an outsider to this article?! Codswallop. Yes, I was sugesting Off2riorob was an outside opinion, since he'd never edited the article before. Are you suggesting that his opinion isn't valid because he posted before you, but if he was asked and he reiterated his previous comments that he'd then become an outside opinion? 

Have you actually read WP:NOTCENSORED? If you have, perhaps you could actually explain which part of it is relevant to your argument. You'll also find you've picked completely the wrong person to try that argument on in relation to this particular article, since I made the pages of El Reg in relation to a previous dispute where I was attempting to include well sourced details of Adams' rather colourful past. Naturally you might not have seen that, but a look in the talk page archives would have shown you the nature of the dispute.

There is no attempt to """"censor"""" this information from Wikipedia, it is currently sat in Gerry Adams Sr. without a problem. However there's no direct relevance to this article, since Adams states he has no recollection of being abused and wasn't aware of it until the 1990s. Why would we write about Gerry Sr. on the Liam Adams article, should it ever be created which I doubt will happen in the near future at least. That would be synthesis of the gravest order, attempting to imply a cause-effect link because one case of abuse and another when nobody has said Liam Adams was a victim of abuse by Gerry Sr. 

It would seem that Bastun is very much swimming against the tide of consensus, having failed to offer any cogent explanation as to exactly how this information is relevant to this particular article he's now making wild accusations of censorship. Tiresome. 303 """,0

"""Hi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o)

First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, starting with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to be written.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.

Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: user:/Sandbox, that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.

For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along; I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of our best teachers ().

Here's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted inline citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work.

Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.

One last thing to keep as a motto: """"It's better to write one good, well-referenced, nicely-presented article than it is to create fifty unreferenced one-line stubs!""""  (talk …stalk!) 
How references work

 Simple references 

These require two parts;

a)
Chzz is 98 years old. """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 

He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website] 

b) A section called """"References"""" with the special code """"{{reflist}}"""";
== References ==
{{reflist}}

(an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections)

To see the result of that, please look at user:chzz/demo/simpleref. Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as user:/reftest and try it out.

 Named references 

Chzz was born in 1837. 
""""The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 
 

Chzz lives in Footown.

Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see user:chzz/demo/namedref to see the result.

 Citation templates 

You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look;

Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation

FPC
I like the photos looking down the river and the path, as well as the photos of the street cars during the blizzard. Your hardest part will be getting the images sharpened. If you have Photoshop, you can try Smart Sharpen or Unsharp Mask, then downsize the image. If you get them sharpened, and mess around with the color/contrast to give the images some """"vibrance"""" (whatever that means), they could have a chance. As Fir0002 suggested to me, however, I would wait until the FPC page is no longer loaded with the ultra-high-resolution images that it currently has. — 0918 • 2006-01-14 23:45""",0

From the Boston Globe:Lieberman, a Democrat who won reelection as an independent, also said he wants to be called an Independent Democrat.A strong backer of the Iraq war, Lieberman was returned to office on Election Day with strong GOP support. He ran as an independent after he lost the Democratic primary in August to Ned Lamont.He said yesterday on NBC's """"Meet the Press"""" that he will begin his new term as a Democrat because it would make him part of the congressional leadership. The senator is in line to become chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.""""I'm going to caucus with the Democrats both because it's good for my constituents in Connecticut, because I retained my seniority, I become a committee chair, but also I want to continue to work to bring the party back to its historic traditions of strength on national security, foreign policy, and innovation and progress in domestic policy,"""" Lieberman said.He said that because voters returned him to Capitol Hill as an independent, """"I am now an Independent Democrat  capital I, capital D. Matter of fact, the secretary of the Senate called my office and asked, 'How do you want to be identified,' and that's it. Independent Democrat,"""" the senator said.With many Senate Democrats having campaigned or raised money for Lamont, as the party's nominee, Lieberman acknowledged that it might be """"a little awkward"""" for him back in Washington.""""They played by the traditional partisan political playbook. And I can't say I enjoyed it, but we're all grown-ups, we've got a job to do, and I'm going to do my best to get that job done,"""" Lieberman said.Democrats will hold a 51-49 edge in the Senate, so Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000, could find himself courted by Republicans.He was asked about the possibility that he might switch caucuses if he became uncomfortable as Democrats sought to enforce party discipline, particularly if the GOP offered to keep him as a committee chairman and respect his seniority.""""I'm not ruling it out, but I hope I don't get to that point. And, and I must say, and with all respect to the Republicans who supported me in Connecticut, nobody ever said, 'We're doing this because we, we want you to switch over,' """" he said.""""I believe that the American people are considering both major political parties to be in a kind of probation, because they're understandably angry that Washington is dominated too much by partisan political games, and not enough by problem-solving and patriotism, which means put the country and your state first,"""" Lieberman said.In 2001, Senator James Jeffords [Addition by Hodgdon's secret garden: (""""D."""")] of Vermont abandoned the GOP and aligned himself with the Democrats, putting them in control of the evenly divided Senate. The switch made him a hero among Democrats and a traitor among Republicans.Lieberman said Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia listed himself as an Independent Democrat in the late 1970s. Before that, the last senator to use the designation was in the mid-19th century, he said.link  17:36""",0

 helms's votes on black, federal judicial nominees. 

A user by the name of  is trying to edit war a removal of my credible information about how Helms voted for African-American Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation in 1991. This is not a WP:Synth, which is what he's trying to say. I'm not stating material not explicitly stated by the source:it explicitly states that he voted for Thomas on the two references I provided. The section has a sentence that reads that Helms blocked """"black judges from being considered for the federal bench""""; however, it makes no mention of how he voted to confirm Clarence Thomas – an African-American – to the Supreme Court, a FEDERAL court. In other words, Helms did vote for a black federal judicial nominee. That sentence standing alone leaves the misleading impression that he opposed all black candidates for federal judgeships, when it is not the case. I'm just balancing the article out. , if you're reading this and disagree with me, do not REVERT my changes, or I'll report you for edit-warring (you don't need to break the 3rr to be blocked).

 Promises, Promises 

One I promise to look at the screen while typing and turn the auto spell check on...so that someone known as Nishidani doesn't pick on my spelling....promise...PS nice to see you picking on me..  
Never trust spell-checkers, it's better to guess, and your's was better than that of the Japanese gentleman who, prey to a phonological difficulty in pronouncing 'l', wrote 'interrectual', which is, judging by the historical record, an occupational hazard of that class. It's a medicinal necessity for me to pick on people, as it stops me from picking my nose, which can lead to major haemorrhaging (sp.?)at my age, and I dislike the idea of an obituary writing that down as the cause of my death.  

sorry nishidani I removed your bit on league of nation mandate as it is already mentioned further up the article..  
No need to apologize. We all make errors, and I more than most. I can never get any work done, trying to reason on talk pages. I see now Shiruberstein, an editor I like, is taking me to task for never having writing any article of quality, but only edit-warred (? a strange interpretation of a 3 year attempt to reason through fundamental problems to get some lineaments of consensus) so I guess I must rethink everything here. It really is a waste of time. Cheers   

I love the chuckleheads. I've always just got on with thing, I don't so much lead with the chin as charge in full steam ahead. I had a great laugh at cool making out that I had done the """"large make over"""" when it was one of them, I just added bits to his make over. They don't seem to appreciate quotes from books that can't be found in JVL...bye the bye, nice bit on Lebanon not invading Israel. greatly appreciated..The tripe tripe that Israelophiles trot out has been found to be false many years ago and still they try to shovel manure...  
Don't use the word 'Israelophiles' within my hearing. There are a lot of people who love that country, within and beyond, and yet are as deeply distressed by its military and political history as they are of their own. (Many virulent critics of America are infused with a deep patriotism, idem elsewhere). Always distinguish, cultivate an ear for nuance, particularly in what you say or think, otherwise you needlessly offend decent people. (Asto the rest, of course)  

I'm sorry if the word offends...I don't know of any other word that can be used to describe someone who is in love with Israel...Its use is the same as Anglophile or francophile...I have come to the conclusion that nationalism is a destructive force with very few redeeming qualities....  
You're right in logical terms, since it has analogies with the terms with which you compared it. But language is not logical (it is one of the flaws in I/P articles that no attention is paid to this, despite academic literature on the issue), but full of queered exceptions, where tone and use subvert comparisons rooted in a sense of parity. For example, just the fact that in standard usage, -phile is suffixed to a disyllabic term for a country ('Anglo'/'Franco'/'Sino'/'Russo'), whereas Israelo-, having three syllables, differs and creates a slight jarring difference from the norm, counts. There's an informal rule that ethnic disyllable are neutral, a pejorative connotations elicit monosyllables ('spik, wog, yid, chink, gook, hun','nip'/'jap', 'frog' etc., though exceptions exist, 'Polack') and this plays round the other terms, to nuance them in various ways. Language is a minefield, and what to one ear sounds okay, to others may resonate differently.
To illustrate on a different level, Wiki as I said is full of incoherencies over pages, and hidden traps, and most efforts, as the present one on 'Judea and Samaria' to get clarity and conceptual coherence into the encyclopedia fail because most people are tone-deaf to these things. One I noted long ago was that in articles like that on Avraham Stern,Lehi, orGush Enumin you'll often note native Israeli editors insisting on the word 'underground' to describe them, these ultra-Zionist terrorist movements, and, I don't think this word is used of comparable Arab movements i",0

 Factual error and substitution of opinion for fact concerning reconstruction of infratructure

The introduction to the article makes the following claim: 

""""Beginning with the invasion in 2003, a Multinational coalition of forces, mainly American and British, has occupied Iraq. The invasion has led to increased civil violence, political breakdown, the removal and execution of former president Saddam Hussein, and national problems in the development of political balance, economy, infrastructure, and use of the country's massive reserves of oil.""""

The inference about problems in infrastructure is factually inaccurate. There is ample documentation available online, at sites such as www.enr.com (site of Engineering News-Record, the world's leading construction and engineering professional journal) and the U. S. Department of Defense news site at http://www.defendamerica.mil/, of the extent of reconstruction and new construction in Iraq, especially in remedying deterioration and neglect dating to the Saddam regime. 

Given the freedoms the Iraqis now have, and have won for themselves, and their liberation from an undeniably tyrannical regime (facts not mentioned in this introduction), the claim that """"these issues have led to major setbacks for Iraq"""" is obviously opinion masquerading as fact.  """,0

Wikipedia welcomes pictures even if they are not from the 'serious' sources. Pictures are the exclusion from the rule that one cannot add a personal content to Wikipedia. I thought the same applies to the link to the websites containing only mere pictures, nothing more and so did www.garycki.com/nationalparks.html  
If the content in Polish on the website www.garycki.com/index.html contradicts the above statement the website can be split between two independent domains (although still mutually linked, why not?) - one of which will be dedicated to the national parks.
I would at least leave the link on the """"List of national parks of Norway"""" pages because you cannot find a better photo guide to ALL national parks in this country, including the planned ones, even on the government www.dirnat.no pages.

Stabbed Kercher getting axed
Hello, Wikid77 here. Now that User:Zlykinskyja has been hounded away from editing """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""", the wholesale axing of fully-sourced text has begun. See: removal of forensics. The apparent WP:Wikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman, with legal expertise, trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms. I warned beware of """"colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia"""". Perhaps if American student Amanda had been """"Adam Knox"""" then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20? misquoted infamous statements. (I didn't know any evidence in December 2009, now I know much, and some seems falsified in Italy). Zlykinskyja tried to add how """"Donald Trump"""" rejected the verdict (+source), but that was quickly deleted. Some US officials are conducting a mock-trial by judge to compare verdicts, but I doubt that could be explained in the article. Then some prankster this week posted at top, """"Breaking news: Knox dead in prison from suicide, details not confirmed"""" (from an IP edit in the London area), and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that. I wish we could split the article into several low-target subarticles (I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles). The talk-page has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on """"Amanda Knox"""" and naturally, a prior subarticle was AfD deleted.However, I suggest the following:
 """"Amanda Knox"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article with civil suits, appellate trial, and college coursework in prison.
 """"Raffaele Sollecito"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article, noting he completed his computer degree while in custody, and they met, at a classical music concert, because he looked like Harry Potter.
 """"Prosecution of Amanda Knox"""" (new) - would contain all the pro/anti-Knox text, moved from edit-wars in the Kercher article.
 """"Investigations of Kercher murder"""" (new) - would be a forensic article, with fingerprints, Low copy number DNA, luminol, unidentified DNA/prints, listing exact quotes+sources, etc.
 """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""" (reduced) - would be trimmed into an overview, linking sections to subarticles.
I have seen how other articles, split into subarticles, greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details, so that forensic details would likely match the sources, when viewed there. This message is just a general notice, sent to a few admins, and I don't expect an immediate response. Also, feel free to delete this, knowing it was posted in a 1 May talk-page revision: as a May Day warning about axing of Kercher text. Thanks. -  """,0

Let me point to the typical as I think mode of tailgaters (I only guess because I am not one) so called """"autopilot"""" when one switch off and focus only on the stop light of the car in front. This can be observed in cases when locked on to the tailgating mode, all other lanes are free to move and drive faster even within limit and surely free of obstacle of slower cars in front, but those drivers on autopilot persist and do not notice of the opportunity to change lane. Often they do tailgate for a long distance without changing lane which is free for some time and only when you decide to do so or come from behind, they come suddenly in front of you. This is partially subconscious. Our peripheral vision is sensitive to movement, their brain register this, they immediately notice that the object they notices (you) moves on or into free lane, they make immediately reactive rather than fully conscious and rational decision and they move dangerously in front of you. I believe that if they drove not on autopilot, they would long before you decided and changed lane.
I believe that such sub/un counscious behavior is a result of poor driver training. Proper training enable much better and counsious decisions and faster.

I would not be at all surprised if others have made negative assumptions about me based on looking at my contributions history and attacked me, so the user does have my sincere sympathies and apologies.
What to do differently when groups go after me? Write a better Wikiquette name several people? Go to WP:ANI naming several people? Do User:RfCs naming several people? That is where I admit I need further advice. 
Since a 7.5 year old off wiki email is often the focus of harassment, and so far the advice is not to go into detail about it, I don't know how to defend the recurrent references to it. Let me say again, it was a stupid, overly generalized and exaggerated response, but certainly not written with some evil bigoted intent. I feel that a lengthy correction of it complete with refs about then existing specific incidents/issues/etc, or stating in detail my current views, would be inappropriate, even on my user page and doubtless lead to more accusations by people who have a different POV.

Main points AGAINST this article (RfC)
Information that shows irregularities, tendentious editing, vandalism and POV on this article should written here:
I will start from what looks to be the main problem. 
Albanian nationalism refers to nationalism among Albanians. It should not necessarily show only claims made by certain circles as is done in this article. So the first sentence of the article: Albanian nationalism (also known as Albanianism[1][2][3][4][5] or Pan-Albanianism[6][7]) refers to nationalist Albanian ideologies and theories that were cemented during Communist Albania (1945-1991), its continuation into modern Albania, as well as its proliferation in Kosovo is a POV. Albanian nationalism does not refer only to ideologies and theories that were cemented during Communist Albania... it refers also to Albanian national uprising and Renaissance and Albanian national pride. 
Kosovo is a disputed matter and to say: """"The struggle for the liberation of Kosovo from Serb rule became the struggle for the recovery of the ancient land of'the Dardanians and thus a re-creation of their ancient kingdom"""" is a POV. Here are references that beg to differ One, Two, Three and Four. For more read Kosovo.

"A few weeks ago, in anticipation of Millennium Park regaining its featured topic status, I broached the idea of CUP credit after the last article was promoted and you indicated that credit would not be granted.  It is my belief that I misrepresented the work done to regain Featured Topic status at a time when one last article was needed.  It is also my belief that you rendered a decision that getting credit for getting one last article promoted was gaming the system. You noted that this type of credit was dangerous territory for the cup.  Clearly, just having articles added to a topic or repromoting a deleted topic could be gaming the system, but when a rule change requires taking a 17-article topic from 1/3rd  to 1/2 Featured content, it is not a matter of gaming the system.

The winner of this contest could come down to whether you grant me Featured Topic points for Wikipedia:Featured topics/Millennium Park. I earned FT points for this topic when it was first promoted.  At that time the topic was 15 articles and the requirement was that 1/3 of the articles be WP:FC and all be at least WP:GA.  Thus, I was acknowledged for bringing 5 of 15 topics to featured status.  However, during the year two articles (Park Grill and Grant Park Music Festival) were added to the topic and the requirement was increased to 1/2 of the articles needing to be featured. Thus, I had to ensure that the two new articles be promoted to good article (which I did without a lapse in topic status) and that a total of 9 of the 17 articles reached featured.  Thus, I helped raise McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink (March 23), Harris Theater (Chicago) (June 12), Millennium Park (August 31) and Exelon Pavilions (September 25) to featured.  Promoting two GAs and 4 FAs is more work than most people have to do to get a new FT. (T/C//WP:CHICAGO/WP:FOUR)",0

Now is the winter of our discontent 
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house 
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; 
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; 
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings, 
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. 
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds 
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty 
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; 
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, 
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up, 
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover, 
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain...

"Another common theme of the financial 'media' is to claim that Japan is a source of liquidity to the world.  Low interest rates actually reduce liquidity as interest payments are not being made on loans, and thus, money isn't available for financial intermediaries to recycle back into making new loans.  The money supply in Japan has been steadily declining for at least the past few years, yet world stock markets have been reaching new highs, and assets of all kinds have been bid to sky-high valuations.  Thus, it can be argued that the asset bubble is being driven by money supply expansion in Europe and the United States, and not by the shrinking money supply in Japan.

 The """"Sahrawi Republic"""", which is nothing but a governement in exile, has one however. It can appear on its page, I have no problem with it.
 Result: None - as far as I am aware of - is wanting to delete """"Coat of arms of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic"""". It should only not be same as """"Coat of arms of Western Sahara""""
 I don't know whether this is clear or not, otherwise happy to discuss every detail.
 The problem we are having with koavf is that he is a fervent militant of the """"Sahrawi Republic"""" and wants absolutely to have Western Sahara be a subtitute for this republic ín Wikipedia.
 And he is editwarring everyone who thinks differently, even when this costs him to be blocked on indefinite, and again and again.
 Only a strong admin can stop him. The best solution would be to ban him from editing the topic as had been suggested once already.
 Unfortunately he is unblocked every time by admins who want to show good will, although he does not care and just ignore them once they have unblocked him.
 We are having this situation not for the first time now and this is really exhausting!

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 95.7.140.82

Bill,

I don't find your un-edits a gender-based attack.  I am largely concerned with the content of the article itself, but I wonder why you put up so much opposition to my very small edit.  Surely it can't mean that much to you.

I don't want to make derogatory comments about men.  I have nothing against men, and I don't enjoy tearing people down.  You mention the term """"well-referenced"""".  I prefer for statements to be well-referenced too.  I don't think that this particular statment is well-referenced, and furthermore, I don't think that it can be well-referenced, because I don't think that it is true.  And so I wonder about the author's neutrality.  Wikipedia articles are supposed to be both neutral and well-edited, and that statement is neither.

I don't want the article to be deleted either.  I think that it serves a useful purpose, and I enjoyed reading it.  I just want to do away with that particular sentence.

Of course, if you can find evidence that American women are materialistic sluts, then we have no problem at all.  But I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote that was confusing personal opinion for universal truth.

 The naming of the article debate (Rosogolla) at Talk:Rosogolla 

@ User:SpacemanSpiff|Spaceman'''Spiff

Hello,

Please be informed that there appears to be an error or, a careless mistake at Talk:Rosogolla page under heading """"The naming of the article debate."""" 

1.TABThe first instance of the discussion, concerning a """"Straw Poll"""" event, correctly spells the name of the article Rosogolla that states, """"Those in support of Rosogolla please mention your support below…”

2.TABHowever, the second instance of the same discussion INCORRECTLY spells the name of the article and states, """"Those in support of  ! Rasagulla  Please mention your support below, you can also mention a alternate name here….."""" The speling “ Rasagulla “ does not appeared to be intended. 

3.TABThe second incident of incorrect spelling makes the debate defective. Besides, the same might misguide and/or create confusion in a participants mind, yielding a undesirable result.

The above information is for your kind information and necessary corrective action.

Thank you,

"Why is an article about a Greek Orthodox theological subject being dominated by an Roman Catholic editor?
Why is Esoglou making very disproportionate (at best) Roman Catholic additions to this article? 
Why is an article about a Greek philosophy and a Greek Orthodox concept (as it is used exclusively in the present) being dominated by the editor Esoglou? Why are there recent very long additions about people like Augustine whom in their writing never used the word (because Augustine could not speak nor read Greek). Being added to an article about the very essential difference between Roman Catholic and Orthodox theologies as specifically noted by scholars of Greek Orthodox theology?  
Why is Esoglou engaging in rewriting this article to say a concept that is almost exclusive spoken of in Greek?
Why to an article about a theological concept so important to Greek Orthodox Theology that is mentioned by Greek Orthodox theologians in that way. 
Why is the actual text for the Roman Catholic church now equal to or more that the Eastern Orthodox? Even though the concept is not spoken of by the RC church per se?
Why or what evidence is there to believe (outside of what anecdotal evidence Esoglou added) that theoria is now somehow something so Roman Catholic embraces in the way the Eastern Orthodox do?
Why is Esoglou using this concept's article to ATTACK Greek theologians (John Romanides)?
Why is it Esoglou could not make his edits to the article Contemplation instead? Since he uses the excuse that the term Contemplation is the same as theoria even though that is so vague as to miss the entire point of why Greek Orthodox theologians such as John S Romanides and Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos use the term theoria instead of contemplation. *Why is it that it appears that Esoglou's edits confuse the whole point of the article and I can not find any Roman Catholic sources let alone encyclopedia and scholarly sources that treat this subject the way Esoglou has rewritten the article?
Why would it not seem that it is in Esoglou's best interest to discredit this theological subject because it contradicts his narrative that there is no fundamental difference between the Eastern Orthodox church and the Roman Catholic church. 
Why is it as the article is the specific difference it not to be believed that Esoglou is not POV pushing after he wrote this sentence in the article TODAY..
Contrary to what Romanides said, it is Roman Catholic teaching that God loves all, even those who choose against him, such as the devil. 
Why is in Esoglou's POV interest to either make the article incoherent, discredit the Orthodox theologians in the article or poison the well and have the article deleted wholesale?
Why (if anyone spends the time to read what has been said on this article talkpage) it is not clear that Esoglou's behavior has tried all of these things and is actively now ruining the article and running contributors off of the article as his recent reverting and rewriting of the contributions made by User:Timothy.lucas.jaeger show. 
Why does the article not reflection how this concept is being used and presented by Greek theologians but is now peppered with Esoglou's anecdotal original research? His speculation, opinions and interpretations? Why is allowed to do this to various wikipedia articles without even once being banned for an hour let alone 24 hours? LoveMonkey",0

You have it lucky in Itsly where you can watch it after work! Very upset about it but what are you gonna do. I could watch a re run of the game, but I can't quite ever get into it because I already know what happens, it's not fun to watch anymore with all suspense gone. (I like shouting at the TV screen) You probably know the feeling hahaha. Highlights are he best bet, but I know it doesn't show the full story of the game. So I can't banter much, but what a game it would have been I'm sure. I talked to my brother about it though, who had the luxury of watching the game and he said that if it wasn't for Buffon, it would be a whole different story. I love to see Buffon do well and still show people that despite his age he is still a top 3 goalkeeper at least! This just goes to show that you can't doubt a team's Champions League performance based on his they are doing in their domestic league. As a true fan, you are always rough on your team, but always stay by them through thick and thin. As you've said, this should be a great confidence boost for Juve and can hopefully channel it towards Serie A and further CL games, as there is still a long way to go!

After the Christian population of the bishoprics of Skopje and Ohrid voted in 1874 overwhelmingly in favour of joining the Exarchate (Skopje by 91%, Ohrid by 97%), the Bulgarian Exarchate became in control of the whole of Vardar and Pirin Macedonia. The Exarchate was also represented in the whole of southern Macedonia. The “Macedonian Question,” became especially prominent after the Balkan wars in 1912-1913 and the subsequent division of Macedonia between the three neighboring states, followed by tensions between them over possession of Macedonia. This partitioning of the territory had a tremendous influence on the development of the Macedonian national identity.Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe - Southeast Europe (CEDIME-SE)MINORITIES IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE - Macedonians of Bulgaria, pg. 6  In order to legitimise their claims, each of these countries tried to 'persuade' the population into allegiance. Paul Fouracre. Cambridge Encyclopedia of Medieval History Some scientists argue also that the use of any ethnic definition of the Slav speekers in Macedonia during the 19th and early 20th Century did not refer to ethnicity, but rather a socio-occupational description. The Slav population in Macedonia tended to be Christian peasents, farming folk,The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World - Loring M. Danforth, ISBN13: 978-0-691-04356-2 attested socio-political circumstances, such as in what language the local schooling was provided, or whether the local church aligned itself with Serbian, Bulgarian or Greek Orthodoxy. The majority were under the influence of the Bulgarian Exarchate and its education system, thus in the early 20th century and beyond, were regarded as Bulgarians, whatever that meant.(Brubaker 1996: 153; Ruhl 1916: 6; Perry in Lorrabee 1994: 61)The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica.

To Inquire into the causes and Conduct OF THE BALKAN WARS, PUBLISHED BY THE ENDOWMENT WASHINGTON, D.C. 1914  However, the key events in the formation of a distinctive Macedonian identity emerged during the first half of the 20th century in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 when the Bulgarian Exarchate discontinued its activity in most of the region. The process strengthed especially following the Second World War, with the withdrawal of Bulgarian authorities from Macedonia, the establishment of Yugoslav Macedonian Republic and the signing of Bled agreement. With the founding of the People's Republic of Macedonia in 1944 as part of SFRY, a sense of a Macedonian national identity gained strength and became systematised.(Bell 1998:193) The Yugoslav government began a policy of removing any Bulgarian influence and cementing the Macedonian identity.Europe since 1945.

[edit] Armenian Genocide
Peres' denial of the genocide should be noted in this article, failing to do so makes it more of a hagiography than a biography. His shortcomings must also be mentioned in addition to his feats like winning the noble prize. Do you think it'd fit better in political views? In anycase it must, and will, be mentioned somewhere. How about adding this in his political views segment:

Peres' foreign policy outlook is markedly realist. For example, to placate Turkey, the only significant Muslim country in the region that is friendly towards Israel, Peres has explicity denied the Armenian genocide, which caused an uproar among genocide scholars.(citation) E10ddie (talk) 

Peres made these statements in 2001, when he was foreign minister. Clearly, he was caving in to Turkish pressure. Israel has very few friends and cannot afford to lose them, so basically it is not free to take the position that would seem to mesh with its outlook and history, which is to recognize that the Armenians were murdered en mass. Now he is president, an honorary position, not a political one, and his """"views,"""" whatever they may have been back then, are worth about as much as mine are. I have no problem with mentioning this """"view"""" in the section on his political outlook, but a separate section on this one utterance gives it undue importance and distorts the picture. Gilabrand (talk)  

[edit] sumac opening sentence
I don't know what the right wording is, but do you see the problem with """"Sumac (also Rhus) is a genus of approximately 250 species of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae""""? First of all, there is no reason to italicize Sumac. Secondly, it is not accurate to say """"Sumac is a genus"""" because there is no genus called Sumac (but there is one called Rhus).

I may be too steeped in botanical jargon to easily come up with something which is natural to non-plant-people. But we need to figure out something which (a) works whether people get to this page as Sumac or Rhus (currently, the latter is a redirect to the former; policy would have it the other way around), and (b) doesn't mix up scientific names versus common names in a confusing way. Kingdon (talk) 

I am not a botanist and my reason for reading the article was because of the spice, which is used all over the Middle East. I was surprised that the spice didn't rate a mention in the lead. Sumac needs to be the first word in keeping with Wikipedia norms, and the same as the title of the article (i.e., not plural). How about: """"Sumac refers to a variety of shrubs or small trees of the genus Rhus, as well as the purplish spice that is produced from its dried, crushed berries Gilabrand (talk)  
Looks like Richard New Forest (talk · contribs) has solved it for us (I'm happy with his wording). As for """"first word"""", Wikipedia policy isn't quite that strict (""""earliest natural point in the prose"""" at Wikipedia:Lead section#Bold title and I don't know whether a plural fits under """"slightly different form"""" or not). Anyway, enough",0

"Hi Mihir. We all understand the complications you're going through. As I said here, an unacceptable burden has been placed on the CAs to make this poorly designed program work. We can be lenient when it comes to writing style, poor English, etc. These issues can be fixed gradually through copyediting, although I have to say that in some cases the English so poor (often resulting from copying text verbatim and then attempting to change individual words or verb tenses, or removing one or two phrases from the sequence) that the text is incomprehensible. Only editors who are subject specialists can copyedit such articles, thus greatly reducing the pool of editors who can make the repairs. Here's an example. The student had had multiple copyvio problems before and asked me to look at the new draft. I could confirm that blatant copyvio doesn't seem to be there anymore, but I simply cannot understand the content enough to fix the English or even comment on its accuracy.However we cannot be lenient on copyright violation, ever. The scale of the problem is now so large that it's now going to take literally months (and many editors) to find and remove it from articles edited by IEP students. The silver lining to this cloud is that we'll probably find and get rid of a lot of other copy vio that didn't come from IEP students. Hardwired control is one example I found today.

"Fraudulent Law Degree 

It should be fair commentary to note facts in the articles already referenced concerning the REASON Judge Ware told the fabricated story to hundreds of audiences over a twenty-year period after law school.  The reason cited in all of these articles is that this fabricated story is what motivated him to pursue a law career.  Therefore, it is also fair commentary to question whether this same fabrication that he told for 20 years after law school was part of Judge Ware's personal statement in his application to Stanford Law School, as anyone who has ever applied to law school knows that what motivates you to pursue a law career is the CENTRAL QUESTION in one's personal statement.  The lack of a more thorough investigation into whether Judge Ware told the same fabrication in his personal statement to law school is a CRITICAL ITEM that should be part of the commentary, as it is more likely than not that he did tell the same fabricated story, which would make his law degree fraudulent subjecting him to immediate disbarment.  Obviously, those who would know that this fabrication was on his personal statement would have complete power over this judge's career, making him incapable of delivering justice in particular cases if those with power over him want a different result.",0

You Can't Stop Me
Dear Bongwarrior

My suspicion is that you are suffering major shrinkage from the inordinate amount of cannabis you have consumed over the course of your useless life. I understand that the prostitutes you procure so regularly laugh at the size of your penis, however I would implore you not to let this shortcoming (if you'll pardon the pun) stamp out the fun that happy, prosperous and sexually capable teenagers can have vandalising wikipedia. Hopefully you wake up and learn that those of us who don't want to consume cannabis, live of welfare payments, drop out of university and edit """"incoherent ramblings"""" on Wikipedia for a living may want to have a facet to their lives which does grant them fun without having to chase pink elephants around their parent's basements all day. 

Also, Bongwarrior is two words - and therefore in my opinion your username constitutes an """"incoherent rambling"""". But then again, your probably too high and sexually deprived to employ any reason and acknowledge this. You're parents having """"relations"""" is probably one of the most costly mistakes that society will have to bear - because undoubtably everybody else's taxes will be use to subsidise the treatment you receive for schizophrenia in five years. Seriously mate, just get a fuggen life, because you're not going to stamp on my fun.

"I just wanted folks to more know about actual real vampires.  

I just wanted folks to know more about actual real vampires not just the ones in Hollywood. For centuries real vampires have lived in secrecy and practice the faith in secret. The whole negative discussion as to why my articles should be deleted just validates and supports vampires living in secret and not sharing anything about our lifestyle or faith with the mundane public. (Thank God the rest of the world is a little more open minded and civil, than some of these disgruntled, bitter,  Wikipedians. I find myself laughing at the bitterness and hostile tone of some of these people. They should put this kind of energy into finding a cure for AIDS or ending world hunger. It is amazing that so many obviously, disgruntled, unhappy people are on Wikipedia. I guess not a lot of happy go lucky out the coffin vampires like me are on Wikipedia. Maybe more people should take up the vampire faith. Although it might not help some of these severely depressed and repressed souls. Vampires just do not have the time or energy for this kind of negative energy. I feel really sorry for all those people who have nothing better to do besides sit around and discuss why someone does or does not have a right to post something on Wikipedia. It is really sad and precious time wasted on having a nasty attitude and a closed mind. These people make me thank my lucky stars I am a proud and very happy vampire.

Just to give an example... I've been to church until like a year ago despite I never liked catholiscism and in fact, I feared it when I was a kid.
and why did I do that? I did that because I didn't dare have a rational conversation with my parents, and what happened when I did? I was called a terrorist by my fucking father, among other things... I had to cry for days, I was ignored, made fun of and insulted... what did my mother do? she didn't force me to be a catholic like my father tryed to do, but she didn't help me either, she just seemed to agree with him, while agreeing with me when he wasn't there... just like an evil cat.
and she does just that all the time, she complains about my father's obssesive controlling personality with me and my sister, but when my father says all his bullshit to me she never says a thing, but it's different with my sister(16) because my mother supports her against my fathers crazy temperament.
my father treats me like I'm a 30 year old drug addict living off his money. he doesn't get that I'm studying a career and that(like everyone here, I dunno about other countrys) he has to pay for it... it's not like I'm not doing anything! my 'god'...
whenever I'm happy what do they do? I swear to my life that they FUCK THINGS UP FOR ME no matter what. 
and whenever I'm sad (that's most of the time arround them, because I don't dare to even joke arround with them since they are offended by anything) whenever I'm sad they come with theyr you need god in your life bullshit.
or theyr see? we are right and u r wrong bullshit...
I'm sick of this, I just wanna get a fucking job, get out of this house and lead a NORMAL LIFE where I'm not issolated from my friends  and can go out and have fun with them without being threatened with loosing the internet conection or being taken out of college...
and my sister? according to my friends who kind of know my situation... she's envious of me and that's why she treats me like shit and doesn't even respect my room like I do hers.
and can you believe I love them???? I do , and that's why I think Im looney, because this isn't possible...
I forgive them every single time! but If I want to hold on to my physical and mental health and have somwehat of a good future, I have to develop a stiff upper lip and not give a shit about them anymore.and I should even take regenge according to most of my friends! but I don't even want to!..I just wanna be left alone anf try to forget all I've been through... I just wish it was physical abusse so I could show my scars and make a point, but this way...anyone can think I'm crazy.
Maybe this is the cause of all my existential doubts, because I don't have anything to be sure of and feel confident about in my everyday life becase my family does the job of ruining everything for me.

I'm sorry for all the swear words, but I had to express how I felt somewhere, also I think I'll erase this because I don't think it's allowed at all on wikipedia, it's just that there's so much rational people here that I think I can get some good advice and I've nowhere else to turn.",0

Kvens are indigenous to today's Northern Norway

Thank you kindly, user  ! 

The user  may not understand that the Kvens are indigenous to Northern Norway, in my view anyway, and many of the best experts seem to agree.  We are not moved by the personal assumptions and/or believes of the user , but science instead, of course, as you seem to agree. 

The user   Please read the related writings from this column's archive.  The Norse are not indigenous to the extreme Northern Norway of today.  The Kvens are.  The Northern Norway's Tromsa area alone has at least 12 prehistoric Kven place names. 

Historians and linguistics experts have been able to come to this conclusion, for instance based on the words and spellings that were used prior to the time - and/or during the time - when the first Norwegian/Norse immigration to Iceland took place.  The relevant sources have been given in this forum, for instance KVENLAND / KAINUUNMAA, 1986, by the Professor Emeritus Kyösti Julku. 

Where are your sources for counter claims, user  ?  Do we only have your personal narrow view point, which even appears to be based on no sources at all.  If there are sources behind your views, what are they in relation to this matter for instance ? 

The related and quoted experts - earlier mentioned in this forum - are not basing their views only on the writings of Ottar, or Alfred the Great, or Tacitus, or any other before mentioned or not mentioned historian, or other scientist, writer or leader alone, of course.  Ask yourself for instance, who might be behind the prehistoric jewelry hidings that have been discovered only recently from Inari, not that far from the coastline of the Arctic Ocean. 

Examine and read more.  Only after having done that, make your own conclusions, not before, please.  In the meanwhile, let the experts make their conclusions, based on all the material and sources they have available.  Wikipedia is here to reveal the findings of science, not the opinions of yours. 

  It is generally accepted that the Sami people are the indiegenous poeple of Northern Norway. I am aware of the history of this article. If you read the article you will notice footnotes such as this: A reference. These are the references for the paragraph you are reeading. When you click on one you will get the reference list. A link is provided for most articles. I suggest you read the article being referenced, and either start discussing my interepretation of the refered article, or the content of the refered article. For the later you need to provide your own references.  

User Labongo:

Your view is not a """"generally accepted"""" view at all, but only your view.

We hope you agree, that it is not reasonable to request for us to have to provide evidence to everyone separately.  Please check the archive for the beginners. 

There is a reason why we are asking for the exact quotes and exact - easily verifiable (as Mr. Mikkalai put it) - book and page information from you.  The reason is, that simply showing a list of authors and books proves nothing.  Wikipedia's vandals and foul players are known to resort to exactly this sort of tactics.  

Once again:  The sources offered do not agree with the text written in the Kven article !  To understand this, you only have to read the last comments by the user Drieakko''.  As everyone can see, he continues backing up from his statements.  In different ways, he goes on appologizing, while he attempts to round of his false statements.  What does that prove:  This is only a learning processs to him.  He really doesn't have anything to contribute to this topic, except for chaos ! 

User Labongo/Drieakko:  It is your job to show where exactly someone - a respected and known historian or other scientist - agrees with your text.  The burden of proof is in your hands to show evidence.  Please, include exact quote(s) and page information.  That is how Mr. Mikkalai wanted to proceed, after a recent concensus was reached. 

We are quite familiar with the related material in question.  We have provided our sources in detail, you have not, not even a single quote with a matching book and page information.  - - Steve Wondering

 K U C 

The Bible in Matthew says to put your light on the top of the basket, not under it.  The foundation of notability is identifiability, which I think the congregation at KUC, insisting that they are not a building, is successfully obfuscating by having no pictures of the building on their website.  To quantify this statement, it took me eight full man hours to find KUC on a Google satellite map.  It was easy enough to locate the intersection, but looking at [the picture] on Google, there is no reason to suspect that the building in the distance is the church.  Zeroing in on the actual location was finally accomplished by finding a picture of the church on the web site of the architects of the church, and comparing this street view with the aerial view available from Google.  (Of course, by the liberal definition, I still haven't found the church on Google, because the church is not a building.  If this is your personal view, then you need to consider that this congregation is not currently WP:N notable.)  So assuming that the congregation feels righteous and will not help in identifying their we-are-not-a-building building, I'd suggest that the first thing you could do to improve the notability of KUC is to work on its identifiability: (1) get the maps specifically including Google improved, i.e., get the Google place marker on the building instead of in the middle of the street intersection, (2) does the church have a street address, (3) make your own web site with pictures of the building identifying the building as owned by KUC.  Include pictures of the view toward the surrounding area, such as showing where people park on Sunday morning, the Kippax Fair, and the """"adjacent park"""" where the Christmas Day 2005 services were held. Is the maximum seating capacity of the sanctuary recorded by the fire department?  If there is a sign posted to that effect, the sign could be photographed.

Assuming you have access to local libraries and local newspaper archives that go back to 1969 that would include articles about the previous names for the church, you should be able to find additional articles that are not available on the internet so as to satisfy WP:GNG.  You could report these references on your new web site.

I'm still puzzled by the argument that recognition by both the ACT and the federal government are primary references.  I'd be interested in your viewpoint about this.

I'd also think about material that was on the previous article that was of no interest to readers in Kentucky, such as names of the staff, including the complete list of names of ministers.  Learning that Kippax has a kitchen, has preschool classes on Thursday, and the building was used for a concert, is pretty much indiscriminate information = not encyclopedic.

I think the AfD problem here is that people are questioning churches on the definition of notability in WP:N, """"worthy of notice"""" without being able to articulate or quantify their objection.  Note the argument in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Birchcliff Bluffs United Church that the church there was WP:RUNOFTHEMILL.  The argument is bogus, because the closest example in the essay is a bank that has been in the news five times in 30 years because of being robbed, whereas the church in question could be expected to have mentions, or more, in 500 articles in the last 90 years.  But I think the attitude is real.    """,0

"the truth 

PLease explain to me, sentence by sentence, why you have edited out the following addition:

The main impact zone of the crash was approximately 19 metres (57 feet) in width. No wreckage was found from the airliner within this impact zone or inside the building. The lawn immediately in front of the crash site was unmarked. Within the main impact zone was a hole that the object punched in the building, approximately 9 metres (27 feet) in width. The Pentagon is composed of five concentric rings. Only the outer three rings were penetrated. The upper floors of the first ring collapsed, but the structural integrity of the second and third rings remained. At the end of the third ring was a circular 'punch out' hole, again 9 metres (27 feet) in diameter. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 38 metres (114 feet). The vast majority of the mass of the aircraft remains unnaccounted for. For flight 77 to have caused the damage observed at the Pentagon, the wings would have had to have been broken off, pushed into the fuselage, after which the fueselage and wings would have had to have been compressed sufficiently to fit through the 9 metre hole. No physical mechanism by which this process could have occurred is known.

Flight 77 did not hit the pentagon. Its so obvious as to be comical. The capacity of human beings to believe what is demonstrably complete bullshit because they are afraid of going against the group consensus never ceases to amaze me. You are being lied to, day in, day out, by your media. Stop. Think. Please.

Page protection
Keilana, can you please explain why you have semi protected the page Huma Abedin ? You have stated vandalism which is clearly not the case! Please see Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard where the matter is being dealt with ! Can you explain your actions ? I understand I am new here but it was one of the first pieces of information i have cont. to wikipedia there has been no decision made, I can not understand your actions !

Having now had the rules for vandalism explained to me I believe you have abused your power as my contib. clearly dosent fit any of the terms ? I ask you to reaccess your actions.

The decision was made at Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Huma_Abedin_.28edit.7Ctalk.7Chistory.7Clinks.7Cwatch.7Clogs.29. Its common practice during an edit dispute such as this for an uninvolved admin such as Keilana to semi-protect the page to reduce the intensity of the dispute. In any case, from the tone of Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard#Gossip_magazines_as_reliable_sources it seems that semi-protection was the right call to stablize the article while discussion continued there and on the talk page of the reliability of sources. MBisanz talk  
I would question how uninolved you actally are give these messges left on my talk page: And don't worry! You'll be able to edit that page in 5 days! Enjoy! —BoL 

And by waiting for five days is by just waiting and you'll be able to edit the semi-d pages. Don't worry, give Keilana some time! She's offline right now, and so am I. —BoL  Retrieved from """"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:100%25freehuman""""

I intend on asking someone to examine your actions. You clearly statd vandalism as your reason for the protection i would not you made no contibution to the talk page and sort no concensus from you action! I will also ask you to explain you relastionship to those who have sort to remove the information ? I would also like to know why you have changed you id ? thanks I will be adding this information to the talk page and any were else i find help ! I also note you did not add the fact the matter was being listed to protection page to the talk page of the article ?

I did not create the name of the page in regards to gossip mag tittle had you read the info you would understand Hillary Clinton was interviewed for the article.

To request unprotection, please go here Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Current_requests_for_unprotection. To ask for Keilana to be examined(?) I'd wait for her to respond here, and if your not satisfied, there is the Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard. I leave the personal inquiries for Keilana to answer is she desires to. MBisanz talk  
Responded on the editor's talk, thanks MB. Keilana|Parlez ici  
I would like to know how the article was brought to your attention I would also advise you that i have posted this information on the talk page of the article.

Thank you Dear MBisanz, thank you so much for responding to those concerns on my talk page. I've posted on the person's talk, if s/he wants my admin actions looked at s/he can always seek input at AN or (God forbid) through recall. You've been a great help recently, and when you're ready for RfA I'd really like to nominate you, if you've got some space for me. ) Best, Keilana|Parlez ici 

Retrieved from """"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MBisanz""""

and your atual post:

Hello, Sorry I couldn't attend to your concerns earlier. I semi-protected the page (here) because of the reasons stated there. As it is election season in the United States, articles about prominent political figures such as Mrs. Clinton are particularly vulnerable, hence the protection. There was a dispute over the reliability of sources, and I protected the article to cool the dispute. Protection isn't an endorsement of the current version, I have no ulterior motive. (see here for protection policy/information). In general, an admin doesn't need consensus to protect a page when a dispute is ongoing. Is there a problem with my administrative actions? Thanks for expressing your concerns, feel free to ask on my talk page if you have other questions or need something. Best, Keilana|Parlez ici

 Synonyms 

Hello anonymous user, in this edit (11 June 2014), you removed the name Drepanodon Leidy, 1861, from the synonymy of Mosasaurus, stating in the summary that Drepanodon is a synonym of the cave bear. You did not mention a source for this, and you might be right, but first of all, you did not show you realized there are two taxa named Drepanodon. The first one is Drepanodon Nesti, 1826, which was classified as a member of the Felidae when published; the second one is the junior homonym Drepanodon Leidy, 1861, the one that is listed in the synonymy of Mosasaurus. As you did not mention any justification for your edit, I restored the name Drepanodon Leidy to the synonymy of Mosasaurus. An extra reason for me to do this, was that it would be far more likely for the older name, given to the remains of a carnivore, to apparently represent another species of carnivore, than it would be for a name given to saurian remains. Confusion of the names was what most likely happened here, as far as I can see.

In the same edit, you removed the name M. copeanus Marsh, 1869, from the list of invalid or dubious species, because the name had been synonymized with Plioplatecarpus depressus. The idea of this list is to summarize names that have been associated with the generic name Mosasaurus, but are no longer recognized as valid species in that genus. If such a name is eventually synonymized with a taxon in another genus, then just removing it from the list is removing information. On the other hand, adding the name for which it is now considered a synonym gives extra information. Especially if someone stumbles upon a name in Mosasaurus somewhere, and wants to find out more about it, and so decides to look up Mosasaurus in the encyclopedia, it would be most helpful when the accepted name is provided.

One last thing: am I right in suspecting you to be the same user as , another user with a keen interest in saurians but lacking that extra bit of skills in the field of taxonomy?  klaas  """,0
"""

You're both right in the sense that enough is enough. If you haven't noticed, I've hardly contributed a thing to the RefDesk in quite a while. If you also haven't noticed, many other valuable editors who used to contribute regularly just, say, a year ago, are now long gone. I suppose I was left the only one to hold the fort. It's now clear, however, that you simply don't appreciate what's happening here, and no matter how hard I try, you never will.

I know this will be futile, but I'll explain how I see things one last time: The Humanities RefDesk used to be a wonderful place to learn. OPs would ask questions, and a decent variety of intellectuals would put in their admittedly POV two-cents, with the result of providing the OP with a variety of differing POV answers, which is basically the closest one can get to an NPOV answer to any """"humanities"""" related topic. This was the Humanities RefDesk I fell in love with.

Now, however, it's pretty much dominated by one supposed omniscient Cambridge Phd. One who verbally abuses other editors in the cruelest and most sadistic of manners due to the """"folly"""" she percieves in their contributions (while the admins conveniently turn a blind eye). One who is incapable of those all-too-human facets known as humilty and fallability. This editor proceeds upon handing down, as if from above, her more-often-than-not flawed, revisionist, biased, and downright incorrect responses (and from my own ethnic POV, extremely offensive and insulting to the memory of my family) to historical questions. When these responses are succesfully challenged, she is incapable of responding in a civil manner (not just to me) and lowering herself to """"stand corrected"""".

These, to me, are not the makings of a RefDesk editor, nor a proper historian. 

But once again, you're right. Enough is enough. I've spent far too much time and effort on this. If you'd indeed prefer the Humanities RefDesk to degenerate into a ClioBlog, then that last obstacle you've been facing, little old Loomis51, has given up. I fought the good fight, and I'm damned proud of it. This, to me, is truly a sad day for Wikipedia.

This is no grand exit, no demand to be blocked, nothing melodramatic like that. I still love Wikipedia and its articles. Unfortunately that once great Humanities RefDesk that I couldn't wait to come to visit upon returning home from work, in order to learn new things, and (hopefully) return the favour by sharing whatever I know with others, is no longer. 

I'm not really sure what all those nonsensical """"conditions"""" you noted above were, nor did I pay much attention to them. Whether my words above are some sort of """"breach"""" of those conditions, I have no idea, nor do I care. 

I just can't help but find it funny that you've extended your jurisdiction to Wikiversity. What's next? If you can somehow hack into my Yahoo account, will my emails now be scrutinized for any anti-Clio content? How about MSN? Is it ok if I call Stu up on the phone and speak """"inappropriately"""" of her? lol (Not that either of us really cares about all this bullshit to actually talk on the phone about it, we have lives, you know! We've never even spoken on the phone, and interestingly, I know rather little about him except that he's apparently from Detroit and that we disagree on pretty much every issue except for the fact that Clio's a fraud! I'm actually rather curious. I've often wondered if Stu is perhaps some obese Asian guy, some skinny Black guy, some white senior citizen, or whatever!) 

If you want to block me, then block me. If you don't, then don't. It's all so obviously arbitrary that I really don't give a shit at this point what you do. All you should know is that I'm just pretty much fed up with the whole RefDesk farce, and I don't really see myself engaging in it in any way any time soon. I have absolutely no intention of any further """"Doctor Anastasia"""" bashing, as like I said, it's futile. If you don't believe me, then block me. If not, then don't. Do as you please.

Let me just mark this day, June 4th, 2007. Let's just see how the Humanities RefDesk looks in say, six months from now: December 4th, 2007. Will all be as is? Will any of my remarks ring any truer? Let's just see. In the meantime, adios muchachos!

Walk away, as in walk away from the argument. Why would I walk away from an article? That is just silly. See WP:SOAPBOX. Please, stop it.
The consensus that was created allowed both POVs in the lead paragraph, allowing for the statement about non-citizens claiming American identity, which is sourced by a source provided by .
I really don't see what the argument here is. Both POV's are provided due weight. Both views are presented. The content was improved by adding percentages of non-citizens counted by the census.
Therefore, please walk away.  
The introduction consensus is Citizens of the United States are referred to as Americans. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens and expatriates may also claim an American identity."""" 

It places Sparkie82 point of view front and center. What is the rationale for removing """"non-citizen residents, dual citizens and expatriates"""" which other editors sought to include as they are counted by the U.S. census as sourced and included in discussions throughout the literature? To change, there must be a rationale, a counter-source, and context among the preponderance of sources which include more than citizens so as to gain a new consensus on the Talk page.   

@TheVirginiaHistorian I'm fine with what you just said was the consensus, i.e., """"Citizens of the United States are referred to as Americans. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens and expatriates may also claim an American identity."""" That is a compromise version we reached a while ago. However, RightCowLeftCoast keeps changing the first sentence to: """"Americans, or American people, are citizens of the United States of America."""" and then he declares that his version (which he has been defending for years!) is a consensus, which it is not. At this point, I sincerely question his able to act in good faith.  (t•c)  

@RightCowLeftCoast, if you sincerely want to see the article be the best that it can be and you trust the community to tend to the article, and you don't simply want to keep inserting your own version into it, then please stop editing the article. If you do, I will also stop editing it. What is your answer?  (t•c)  
The edit made changed the lead paragraph which was stable for several months, claiming to change it to a consensus version, while not. It failed to provide references for the lead sentence, which the stable version has in spades. Futhermore, the sentence in the stable version remains in the lead paragraph after the second sentence which explaining the multicultural nature of Americans. This sets up for the third sentence. All the content is well cited and, the cite added in the reverted edit by Sparkie82 is a duplicate source from the current third sentence.
The fact that Americans are Citizens of the United States is very well cited in the stable version.
As this is about article content this is better of in the Americans talk page and not my talk page, and kindly ask Sparkie82 to leave me alone.  """,0

"""==Proposed move to Stiffness to weight ratio==

Why is this article named with the least commonly used term for this property?  Google returns 75,400 results for """"specific modulus"""", 78,700 results for """"specific stiffness"""", and 783,000 results for """"stiffness to weight ratio"""".

I could understand this if Wikipedia were advocating the term """"specific modulus"""", e.g. because it is shorter, or more technical sounding, or whatever.  However my understanding was that Wikipedia was explicitly not in the advocacy business and that its articles should be named with the commonest term.  In this case the commonest term occurs ten times as often as the other two terms.

This name has the further benefit of being self-explanatory, whereas those unfamiliar with either of the other two names would have to consult a dictionary when they encounter it in a text, which may well be why it is by far the commonest term.

I therefore propose moving this article to Stiffness to weight ratio and linking the other two terms to it.  This won't compromise findability in any way, but the choice of name will indicate the most commonly used term.    """,0

 Project News
Two new WikiProjects have formed that relate to WP:Films. WikiProject Actors and Filmmakers has been started as a descendant of WP:Films and WP:BIO. The project will help to improve the quality of articles on actors, directors, screenwriters, producers, cinematographers, film editors, and film score composers. WikiProject James Bond also formed this month and will help to improve James Bond films, books, characters, and other related articles. The projects each currently have memberships of 20 users, and are seeking new members. Stop by both of these new projects and see if they interest you.
 We have now reached over 25,000 film articles that have been assessed by our assessment department! Remember to always add the {{Film|class=}} template to a film article's talk page so the project can get a better idea of what work still needs to be done. Below is a table showing a breakdown of our articles by class and importance.
Films without infoboxes have increased from about 2,000 to just over 5,000 films with systematic tagging completed this month. There are also tallies for requested film images (~7,000), articles that need synopsis (~4,100) and articles that need cast section (~400).
 Spotlight Update:  Multiple films and film-related articles have reached GA and FA status in April 2007.
 Fritz the Cat (4/28) Heavy Traffic (4/10)
 Shia LaBeouf (4/14)
 Leslie Nielsen (4/19)
 Battlefield Earth (4/19)
There were also two GA films that were recently delisted. Please help return the articles to their prior GA status.

"""Spinal manipulation is a regulated/controlled medical intervention and can only be performed by chiropractors and a limited number of physical medicine professionals. Prior to the adminstration of spinal manipulative therapy, absolute contraindications must be screened out.  These include inflammatory arthritides, fractures, dislocations, instabilities, bone weakening disorders, tumours, infections, acute trauma as well as various circulatory and neurological disorders. Although most contraindications apply only to spinal manipulation of the affected region, a few emergency conditions, such as visual field defects is an absolute contraindication spinal manipulative therapy.   In February 2008, the World Health Organization sponsored Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and its Associated Disorders, the largest and most comprehensive study on neck pain, diagnosis, prognosis and safety to date. This included a consensus of the top experts in the world whose findings were collated using a best-evidence synthesis, which addresses risk, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment risks and benefits. With respect to the association of VBA stroke and cervical manipulation the study concluded:

  Vertebrobasilar artery stroke is a rare event in the population.
  There is an association between vertebrobasilar artery stroke and chiropractic visits in those under 45 years of age.
There is also an association between vertebrobasilar artery stroke and use of primary care physician visits in all age groups.
no evidence of excess risk of VBA stroke associated chiropractic care.
 The increased risks of vertebrobasilar artery stroke associated with chiropractic and physician visits is likely explained by patients with vertebrobasilar dissection-related neck pain and headache consulting both chiropractors and primary care physicians before their VBA stroke.""""[http://www.fcer.org/html/News/bonejointdecade.htm  

A 2007 study which examined over 50 000 chiropractic spinal manipulations had no reports of serious adverse effects.   The most common minor side effect was  pain in the head, neck, arm or upper back; and stiffness of the neck, shoulder which occurred after, at worst, 16 in 1,000 (0.016%) treatments.  Furthermore, the authors concluded that the risk of serious adverse effects was, at worst, 6 per 100,000 (0.006%) spinal manipulations.   Despite the controversy and skepticism  regarding chiropractic spinal manipulation, the  World Health Organization states that  """"[when] employed skilfully and appropriately, chiropractic care is safe and effective for the prevention and management of a number of health problems.""""

Unfortunately, judging from previous """"warnings,"""" some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are.

Pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack (and it has, in fact, been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once). 

Frankly, if you are looking for personal attacks, try yourself for your AGF-violating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals, or David Gerard for claiming that I am """"trolling"""" when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others. It's very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things.

If you want to start blocking for incivility, I might suggest removing David Gerard for a while for his actions, or Elonka for falsely claiming that I was using sockpuppets or that I was harassing her, or the sysop whose very talk page says he's going to go around blocking people no questions asked and in fact did so after I caught him restoring placing illegal information on how to pirate software an article talk page.

"""

{{unblock|reason=Block serves no purpose. Given that my so-called PAs were limited to AN/I, and that I am preparing a case for RfC/U then I am hardly likely to persist. Further to the point that remarks on AN/I that are not related to content disputes are not disruptive, and therefore the block is not preventative, as there are, and have been, no concerns regarding disruption or vandalise to encyclopedic articles. My argument stands that this block is a WP:COATRACK with my """"personal attacks"""" being highlighted to mask the uncivil remarks and assertions on AN/I. Those assertions, based on undue lack of AGF, over my response to a WQA are based on straw man arguments, with no evidence to support the claims, and in fact run on a parallel track to the discussion at AN/I, but have in fact been misrepresented through synthesis to create an attack on my contribs, and cannot be reasonably analysed as a """"bad faith"""" WQA response. However, this is the tone that has been used by an admin who refused to get involved in the WQA, but did not hesitate to question my ability to respond to the WQA, which was also, notably, my first WQA response, which was concluded and closed by supporting editors. Therefore the attack on my response, which was made prematurely, perhaps an uncivil approach in itself, was unfounded. Since the close, the admin has refused to recognise their critique as a bad faith attack, nor have they refactored it recognise the conclusion of the WQA. They have, instead, used my earlier uncivil remarks, which I should not pre-dated the AN/I topic by 3 days and therefore the admins right to question my WQA response was somewhat presumptious given that the two events are unrelated, and casting doubts on an editors ability to contribute to X-area of wiki because they had a dispute in Y-area of wiki is not a logical conclusion, it is a straw man argument; i.e. """"Because MB was uncivil to editor-A on AN/I, he should be kept away from WQA"""". This flaw being, that every article, user, project and content page on wiki has a discussion page, therefore why not argue """"If MB is uncivil on AN/I, he could be uncivil anywhere""""? Having dismissed the admins argument as flawed, based in this discrepancy, plus the fact they were assuming I would respond to WQA, but it had been my first and there is no evidence to suggest I was going to make a career out of it, the admin drew conclusion based on a false premis. Those conclusions were used detrimentally and matter-of-fact, despite being opinions, theories and at most, concerns. At no time did the admin attempt to address those concerns on my talk page, as would be proper. Instead they made uncivil remarks, questioning the faith of my response and promoting a damning claim, using quotes out of context and lacking correct interpretation. I maintain that the intentions of the admin were uncivil, and that by addressing me """"potentially uncivil"""" the admin was making proactive disdainful remarks, based on one solitary WQA, rather than a reactive proposal based on sufficient history, behaviour patterns or evidence to support the theory. To make matters worse, when I confronted the admin with this they adopted a defensive stance, dismissing my anger at their assertions as uncivil, and convoluted the matter further by placing my angry response above their own behaviour, whilst casting judgement, thus clouding the issue, i.e. the WP:COATRACK counter-measure. I consider this an attack on my integrity, as my response to WQA was rejected and questioned before it was even resolved, which is a clear example of attacking the faith of an editor. Because the admin continued to accelerate their case against me with condescending remarks, and refusal to accept their straw man claim as unreasonable or irrelevant to the discussion, i.e. a fork. Their persistence to use those comments can only be observed as advocating. For any admin of that experience to be unable to recognise their own bad faith, illogical attempt to predict an editor, and close-minded approach, there has to be a underlying motive, in my belief, for them to persist, to the degree of blocking me and refusing to allow their behaviour to be questioned is paramount to enacting COI.  So, though my responses may be considered uncivil, they are in reaction to what I perceive as irresponsible admin attitude, and pessimistic misuse of my response at WQA. That is not a PA, or uncivil, it is a legit observation with regards my POV which was made to look warped due to the late-interjection with straw man based propositions, casting aspersions on my ability to handle WQA. Unless there has been a direct complaint or issue pertaining to a page, or discussion, it is not appropriate for an admin to imply anything, and therefore my one-off role at WQA is",0

Hello, . Please don't use the word """"important"""" when talking about notability, as you did at WP:HD#Zeeshan haider.

I am not entirely familiar with the First Austrian Republic awards system, but given the common cross was a service award for a month's service in the Freikorps, and as it was awarded to just about everyone who served, I don't think it should be included. The special cross though, is notable given only 1,000 or so were supposedly issued, so I will add it. I propose adding the exact date of the award of the Verleihung der Ehrenbürgerschaft into the text where the award is already mentioned. I understand the Medal of Merit in Gold was a lower award, but am unsure how common or notable it might be. I am not a fan of including every medal awarded to military people, as I know some are incredibly common and not notable.

Rankings
Between 1988 and 2004, the school's position in BusinessWeeks biennial business school ranking has averaged around #5 and #6. BusinessWeek also ranks major academic divisions/disciplines; all of the school's divisions ranked in the top five in all nine surveys of the past twenty years. The magazine has consistently rated the major disciplines of the University of Michigan Business School in the top five since it launched its biannual ranking of professional schools in 1988. Only three other business schools can make this claim.

When BusinessWeek Online announced its """"Top Ten Management Gurus,"""" based on surveying executives worldwide, Michigan professors Dave Ulrich (rated number one), Noel Tichy, C. K. Prahalad and Michigan alumnus Gary Hamel, PhD 1990, dominated the list.

BusinessWeek'''s """"The Best B-Schools"""" report of October 2004 ranked the business school sixth overall among the best business schools, and fourth in leadership for its training efforts. In the same report, under the """"Best and Brightest"""" category for schools that produce graduates with the best skills, the business school ranked:
3 in Marketing 
5 in General Management 
7 in Ethics 
8 in Global Scope 

In other BusinessWeek rankings, the MBA program was ranked:
2004 - 6
2002 - 8
2000 - 6
1998 - 4
1996 - 2
1994 - 6
1992 - 5
1990 - 7
1988 - 6

In its Executive Education Rankings, BusinessWeek ranked the business school:
2003 - 3 
2001 - 3 
1999 - 2 
1997 - 2 
1991 - 1 

In the Wall Street Journal/Harris Interactive Survey Rankings (2005):
2 National School Overall Ranking
2 National School Marketing
4 National School Operations Management
4 National School for Recruiting Woman
1 National School for Recruiting Minorities
10 National School for Ethics

The Wall Street Journal/Harris Interactive Guide to Business Schools: Recruiters' Top Picks 2005, released in September 2004, ranked the business school:
1 national ranking - Top North American Schools 
2 in academic excellence for Marketing 
4 in academic excellence for Operations Management 
7 Top International Schools 
9 in academic excellence for Accounting 
1 for hiring minorities 
5 for hiring women U.S. News and World Report (April 2004) ranked Michigan's Executive MBA program as the #1 public EMBA program. In its """"America's Best Colleges 2005"""" report, Michigan ranked:
2 in Management undergraduate programs 
2 in Marketing undergraduate programs 
3 in Finance undergraduate programs U.S. News and World Reports Departmental Excellence Ratings (2002) placed Michigan in the top five for strength """"across the board."""" U.S. News & World Report's Best Undergraduate Business Program rankings (2006) placed Michigan third, tied with University of California-Berkley. This is the highest rating for any public university.The Financial Times' Special Report on Executive Education (2005, released May 2004) ranked Michigan:
3 in Program Design 
4 for Quality of Program Faculty 
Among the top 10 for Skills and Learning, Food and Accommodations, and Relevance of Teaching Materials

The infamous referendum

Let me explain, since you're not Maltese. 

The """"yes"""" votes did in fact surpass the """"no"""" votes slightly, but despite that, less than 50% of the total voting population actually voted """"yes."""" Therefore, the Nationalist party celebrated because the """"yes"""" votes surpassed the """"no"""" votes, and concurrently, the Labour Party celebrated because less than 50% of the population voted """"yes."""" (Can you imagine what it was like? Carcades from both parties, mass meetings...both claiming that """"WE WON!""""? Seriously...)

Therefore there was complete chaos in Malta for a few weeks because nobody could figure out whether we were actually going to join the EU or not. Finally, the Primeminister was eventually forced to hold an early general election to clear the misunderstandings. 

Quotes from the letter:

""""The Christian Democrats [Nationalists], now in power, are assured of a coming election victory. They are also in for a resounding defeat in a referendum on Malta's European membership.""""

""""There should be an amalgamation of Election and Referendum. The Nationalists should say; """"ok, we are going to have a referendum on Europe; this coming election will serve also as a referendum on Europe""""."""" [ This is what the Nationalist party was forced to do]

Now, obviously, the Nationalists still claim that they won the referendum, while Labour still claim the opposite. But the point is, an early general election was held due to this. In other words (it's hilarious really), the referendum was utterly futile. Our entry in the EU was in fact determined by a general election!

Now that you know what happened, perhaps you could reword that phrase or something...whatever you thing is right...

 Conditioning? 
 Introduction
The emergence of reputation systems
How do we identify what is good? And how do we censure what is bad? We will argue that developing a humane reputation system ecology can provide better answers to these two general questions — restraining the baser side of human nature, while liberating the human spirit to reach for ever higher goals.

Most social interactions require matching human needs on the one hand, and quality or taste on the other hand: hunting for a reliable mechanic, looking for an interesting book, sifting through potential investments, judging the merits of proposed policies. Drawing from a distributed pool of reputations has the potential to ease the search for opportunities, ideas, friendships, cultural goods, and high–quality services; hand in hand, pressure will increase for honest behavior, competence, and fulfilling subtle human needs. At the same time, more efficient tagging of con artists, sources of spam, untrue claims, and dishonest actions can better sanction antisocial behavior, for the most part in a bottom–up """"distributed court of opinion.""""

Sustained rapid advances in information technology have created unprecedented abilities, which come along with unprecedented dilemmas. Data has never been easier to create and move around, but to make decisions one also needs to understand its context and implications. Just as important is what lies behind its face value, in realms such as speculative bubbles (Chancellor, 2000), shady financial practices (Partnoy, 2004), and the political statements that are the topic of much of our public discourse.

Access has generally become easier, driven by falling production, communication, and search costs; however, there are consequently far more suggestions, demands, and events to consider, straining our individual information processing capacity. Leaving the computational milieu alone to evolve """"naturally"""" is no guarantee that an ideal or even acceptable society–wide information infrastructure will emerge, as Brin (1999), Lessig (2001), Norman (1994), Schenk (1998), Stallman (2002), Walker (2003), and others have warned. To promote an interconnected ecology of socially beneficial reputation systems, conscious design, analytical modeling, and learning from past successes and failures is indispensable.

Filtering tools are still in their infancy — and having a better window to look out at the world can also imply that others can more easily peek in. Search engines speed up finding similar work done elsewhere; collaboration tools from humble mailing lists to community software to advanced groupware aid both individual and collective problem–solving. Yet it seems that for many important issues, all these tools are not keeping up with the increasing scale and number of decisions we must make, leading to what (Homer–Dixon, 2002) has referred to as an """"ingenuity gap.""""

Sheer computation power is not enough — another factor of 1000 in speed, storage, or bandwidth translates to a more modest gain in making better decisions, and perhaps even a net loss in other forms of effectiveness. (Indeed, if the data or assumptions are noisy enough, the programming aphorism of """"Garbage In, Garbage Out"""" applies.) Those who seek to use technology or the public space of ideas to advance their own agendas can also leverage increased computation power. There is indeed a technological revolution still in progress, reshaping commercial and social interactions — but its ultimate course will be affected by designers, activists, researchers and civil society at large. As (Fischer, 2002) said:

""""Peter Drucker argued that """"there is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all."""" Adding new media and new technologies to existing practices will not change the consumer mindsets of learners and workers. We need to explore new computational media based on fundamental aspects of how we think, create, work, learn, and collaborate ... New tools should not only help people to do known cognitive tasks more easily, but they should lead to fundamental alterations in the way problems are solved.""""
In order for computational advances to translate to widespread social advances, the tools must confer the ability to """"think smarter, not harder"""" — and use our collective evaluations of what is desirable to steer resources away from unproductive negative–sum games. Human brains provide an analogy: the difference between a moron and a genius lies primarily not in more or faster neurons, but in neurons that are wired together more effectively. In the same way, reputation systems are a generic tool that allow our observations, analysis, and actions to be """"wired together"""" more efficiently.

(not so random un-indent)
Perhaps easiest is to imagine an airfoil propagating through a large """"body of air"""" which is initially at rest. Once the airfoil is well inside this body of air (by several chord lengths, say 5 or more), the rate of vertical momentum change of this body of air is equal to the lift. Or more precise: the reaction force of the wing on the air (minus the lift force). At the edges of this body of air, far from the airfoil, nothing is happening. 

Small air parcels are subject to three laws:
 mass conservation: the mass of a parcel is constant. Its position, volume and shape may change. 
 Newton's laws: the 2nd law states that the rate of change of momentum is equal to the net force on the parcel. The 3rd law states that the force by one parcel on its neighbour is equal to minus the force by that neighbour on that particular parcel.
 A force model: if incompressible flow is assumed, the pressure distribution at the edge of the parcel is such that its volume does not change (but its position and shape may change). In case of a compressible fluid, pressure and volume are related through some thermodynamic equation of state (since the parcel mass is constant, a volume change implies a density change) . 
These three act together. In general the influence of the airfoil diminished with the distance from it, since the effect of the displaced volume by the moving airfoil is largest in its neighbourhood. Hope this gives some clues to pinpoint where the crux of your problem is.    21:57""",0

And the use of """"Britain and the US never existed"""" was too much in my view. They could simple have remained neutral while the Axis fought against the Soviets.

""""Regarding the Japanese decision not to attack the USSR (in Dec 1941 and Dec 1942), they did plan to do so in the case of major Soviet defeats under Moscow or Stalingrad. However, that hadn't happen, and the role of the Western allies was minimal in that. In addition, as some scholars believe, the Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) lesson was duly learnt by the IJA staff.""""

Minimal? Stalin loved the oil embargo that Roosevelt put in Japan. It could have been this very factor that saved his neck. The Japanese were a military government, and both the Army and Navy did put pressure for their attacks. The attack in the in the Pacific was purely desesperation. If Roosevelt didn't mather with the Soviets, it was just question to give the Japanese their oil and good will to put them against Stalin. However at this time the US was already allied with the Soviet cause. And I don't remember were I read now, but the US embassador even treath the Japanese embassador in a conversation if they launched an attack against the USSR.

About Nomonhan, the IJA staff learned some serious lessons on how to FIGHT the Soviets with it. The Army never give up of the idea of attack the USSR. Even the Navy had some simpaty for the cause if it's advance in the Pacific would not be halted. War between the two countries was probably inevitable. Get rid of the Communist treat was one of the largest security problems for Japan. Matsuoka's secretary comments this in the World at War Banzai episodie. He said: """"But when an integration against the north parted [oil] the Army naturally joined up with the Navy"""". Obviosly, only for maintein the war in China and could fight the Soviets in the future because the critical resources needed.

Battle of the Bulge:

Why the Soviets can loose like they did in Barbarossa and this be extremely analized by hypocrital """"intelectuals"""" like you and the causes of one supossed less than expected performance the Western Allies not be?

Battles are won by several factors. Anacronism is not nice here. The Western Allies win in the Bulge. The Soviet sucess in Bagration for instance, was not garanteed when it was launched. It could had end up much worse than in the Bulge. With even defeat.

Re::: Lend Lease:

Yes, the Soviets could produce everything they needed. Look the link I posted above. The importance of the Lend Lease is well illustrated. Also, no Lend Lease, less material produced, more casualities for the Soviet side. They would resist this and the combined offensive of all the Axis powers? Pehaps, isn't? I'm just trying to point all this is something of impossible complexity, and therefore should be let in the field of personal opinions. 

""""That means about 40,000 German tanks were not built'' And what crew was supposed to drive these tanks? Germany had a desperate situation with personnel, due to the Eastern front""""

Perhaps they wouldn't have if they could master their forces there from the start. 

Also the money and the time spent with the subs could be used to solve many other problems, produced even more refined weapons, and this includes weapons of mass destruction. 

I'm here to """"fight"""" with you as long as I can. But one thing you already admit: you don't belive the USSR could hold all the Axis countries together.

Speedy deletion of Encyclopedia Nova Caesarea
 A tag has been placed on Encyclopedia Nova Caesarea, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read our the guidelines on spam as well as the Wikipedia:Business' FAQ for more information. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC): Electronic Plagiarism Detection
http://www.jiscpas.ac.uk/apppage.cgi?USERPAGE=6588
JISC completed a plagiarism project in 2001, and they are establishing a plagiarism advisory service as a result of this experience. There were 4 parts to their plagiarism project, and they include:
1. Technical review of free-text plagiarism detection software 
2. Technical review of source code plagiarism detection software 
3. A pilot of free-text detection software in 5 UK institutions 
4. A good practice guide to plagiarism detection
A listserv has also been to continue discussions dealing with academic dishonest and plagiarism issues.
A copy of JISC's Technical Review of Plagiarism Detection Software Report can be accessed at http://www.turnitin.com/static/pdf/luton.pdf.
.
JISC Plagiarism Advisory Service
http://www.jiscpas.ac.uk/
JISC Plagiarism Advisory Service is a new offering that began in September 2002. It is based in the Information Management Research Institute at Northumbria University (UK). New materials are constantly being added to this plagiarism portal, but it currently offers advice & guidance, educational materials for students and other online resources. A plagiarism detection service, supported by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) until August 2004, is based on the turnitin.com platform and allows instructors to conduct electronic comparisons of work complete by students.
JPlag
https://www.ipd.uni-karlsruhe.de/jplag/
Guido Malpohl initially developed this software which is designed to detect academic dishonesty. The software does more than merely compare the text of documents. JPlag also looks at program language syntax and program structure so it can also be used to detect stolen software parts. Instructors may use JPlag for free, but they must first set up an account in order to prevent unauthorized use by students.
Library Electronic Databases
http://www.library.uiuc.edu/orr/
The Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign provides access to numerous electronic resources for students and faculty. Instructors may want to consult these resources when checking for plagiarism. Full text databases like EBSCO and Expanded Academic ASAP (InfoTrac) are two obvious starting points when checking undergraduate assignments. One thing to keep in mind is that some resources that are not full text but provide abstract information are often used by students.
Moss
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~aiken/moss.html
Moss or Measure of Software Similarity is a tool that has been used primarily to detect plagiarism. The way it works is that it detects similarities of C, C++, Java, Pascal, Ada, ML, Lisp or Scheme programs. Moss is free to use for instructors and staff of programming language courses only.
Plagiarism.org
http://www.plagiarism.org 
University of California Berkeley students and alumni created plagiarism.org to be used to detect plagiarism. One thing to watch out for is that the software doesn't differentiate between quoted materials and original writing. 
The Plagiarism Resource Site
http://www.plagiarism.phys.virginia.edu/
Lou Bloomfield, Professor of Physics at the University of Virginia, is the sole author of The Plagiarism Resource Site. The goal of this site is to """"help reduce the impact of plagiarism on education and educational institutions"""". Numerous links are provided to sources on how to deal with plagiarism.
Turnitin
http://www.turnitin.com/
Turnitin, a plagiarism.org partner, considers themselves to be """"the world's most widely recognized and trusted resource for helping prevent Internet plagiarism"""". Free trials are also available, and subscription costs vary depending on the type of plan chosen.
Turnitin is currently the subject of a copyright controversy. For more information, check out the following article, """"A Plagiarism Detection Tool Creates Legal Quandary"""" at http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i36/36a03701.htm.

 Characteristic Saffir-Simpson Cat 4 Cyclone Larry Central pressure 920-944 mbar 915! mbar when landfall made Potential damages """"More extensive curtainwall failures with some complete roof structure failure on small residences. Major erosion of beach areas. Terrain may be flooded well inland."""" 55% of all buildings in Innisfail damaged. Entire banana crop and some of sugarcane crop demolished. Rooves stripped of countless buildings; some buildings flattened entirely. Extensive flooding. Universal power outages, sewage system fails. Airports closed for the day. Storm surge4.0–5.5 m5.0m 1-minute average sustained winds210-245 kph 200km/h confirmed. Otherwise unknown, with gusts frequently exceeding 280kph. Conclusion Larry is indeed a category 4 cyclone at the very least, unless we are willing to ignore important factors for the sake of 10km/h of confirmed sustained wind.

I already have an article (American) claiming it was Cat 4. It's right [here. However, as you stated earlier, newsgroups are not an authority on the matter, are they? As for my friend , well what can I say to you? You have gone against all sound logic and called me a liar because I can't confirm 10km/h of sustained wind. I'm unsure if you even know what logic is. To you, it's all cold hard data, with stupidty thrown in for free. Your level of intelligence sickens me. You've also failed to note the case for central pressure, which was on par with most Cat 5 storms. What you're proposing is this: 

""""A cyclone that brought about more than the effects and damages of a typical Category 4 storm and that had the Central Pressure of a typical Category 5 storm, is in fact a mere Category 3, simply because it's confirmed/measured sustained winds were 5 knots below the """"cut-off"""" for Category 4.""""

For the rest of you: SS scale uses 1-minute averages. A 1-minute average of 200km/h was RECORDED about 30km north of where the cyclone crossed. I understand this is 10km/h less than the cut off for cat 4 (as stated above), but at least it puts estimates and what-nt to rest. Further, I'll leave the rest of my argument to logic, that is, if you have any.

 Input needed on a Wikiversity project 

Hi Jimbo Wales.

I'm leaving you (and a few other folks) this note because you've had some interest in Wikiversity's studies of Wikipedia in the past, I wanted to get a few more eyes on the project before announcing it on Wikipedia: I hope to do that over the next few days on the talk pages of the 4 """"beta test"""" articles: Barack Obama, John McCain, Sarah Palin, and Joe Biden, with a broader announcement later after the initial kinks are worked out. I was also hoping you would know people who would be interested in this, as well as knowing people with a few """"special skills"""", including:
Data collection and sorting from the article histories (how many edits and what sorts of edits over a given time period, etc.)
People who can make good graphs and charts from that data

Here are some concerns that I found in the article on a quick run-through:
 resolved Please make sure that the discussion regarding naming is completed and the decision is finalized with consensus one way or the other before you nominate for GA status.
 There are two citation banners in the article, both for lack of inline citations, and both were placed there several months ago.
 resolved There are several sections in the article (Working, utility and assistance dogs, Show and sport (competition) dogs, Dangerous substances) that are composed almost completely of lists.  MOS discourages lists in articles, so these should be turned into prose as much as possible.
 There are a lot of short sections in the article.  For as many of these as possible, please either expand them or combine them with other sections.
 resolved There shouldn't be external links in the body of the article as there are at the end of the Ancestry and history of domestication section.  Instead, these should be turned into references, moved to the external links section, or removed altogether.
 The article needs quite a bit more referencing.  For example, in the Ancestry and history of domestication section, six out of seven paragraphs are completely unreferenced.
 Make sure that all of your web references have publishers and last access dates.  Also, please make sure that you are actually using the publisher, and not the work.  For example, with current ref #41 (The Case for Tail Docking), the publisher should be Council of Docked Breeds, not cdb.org.  
 resolved References that are in English do not need to be marked as such.  References that are in any language other than English do need to be marked.
 resolved Current ref #70 (Wolf at my door) deadlinks.
 resolved The Australian National Kennel Club external link deadlinks
I didn't go through the article line by line, so there are probably things that I missed.  The above are just fairly big issues that jumped out at me on a quick look through the article.  Also, I was recently involved in bringing Horse (another article about an animal with significant human interaction) to GA status...you may want to take a look there to pick up some ideas about layout, referencing, style, etc.  Drop me a note on my talk page if you have any questions, and good luck on your quest for GA.     —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  """,0

My cite states that no notes issued prior to the """"greenbacks"""" were legal tender under the greenbacks and you would have known this if you had bothered to read he material I posted in the two wiki Fed articles. BTW: are you wise and omniscient ones (sarcasm) aware that Federal reserve notes were not legal tender until 1933?

lets see if you read it here 

I believe that Congress does NOT have the power to make paper money a legal tender and does not even have the power to make gold and silver a legal tender.The reference below show clearly that at least one US president and Funding Father agree with me on both counts and that at least two US presidents, and Founding Fathers agree with me on one count.

I hope that claims of original research and synthesis can now be put to rest as BOGUS.

An old NY times article http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res;=9501E2DB133BEE33A25751C1A9669D94679ED7CF references the following quotes

James Madison  - Thus the pretext for a paper currency and particularly for making the bill a legal tender, either for public or private debt, was cut off

Thomas Jefferson - I now deny their (Congress's) power of making paper money, or anything else, a legal tender

A Mr Benton who is also cited, states: The power granted to Congress to coin money is an authority to stamp metallic money, and is not an authority for emitting slips of paper containing promises to pay money.

Per Yale Law School records of the minutes of the vote to TAKE AWAY from Congress the power to """"emit bills of credit"""" during the Constitutional Convention as recorded by Founding Father and future president James Madison  http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_816.asp 

FN23 This vote in the affirmative by Virga. was occasioned by the acquiescence of Mr. Madison who became satisfied that striking out the words would not disable the Govt. from the use of public notes as far as they could be safe & proper; & would only cut off the pretext for a paper currency, [FN24] and particularly for making the bills a tender [FN24] either for public or private debts. 

and

""""Mr. Ghorum was for striking out, without inserting any prohibition. if the words stand they may suggest and lead to the measure.""""

My aside: The power to be struck out was the power to """"emit"""". Mr. Ghorum, (Madison misspelled the name - the person is actually Nathanial Gorham) states that if the words stand (the words being """"emit bills of credit"""") that """"they may suggest and lead to the measure"""" with the measure being printing legal tender paper money. To be ABSOLUTELY clear, this vote denied Congress the power to """"emit"""" per money, and strikes at the core of arguments in favor of paper money, because Congress cannot make paper money a legal tender because the power to print paper money was REMOVED from Congress. If Congress cannot even print paper money, how can it make it legal tender?

In Federalist 44 - Madison states 

The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the necessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice, of the power which has been the instrument of it.

From Craig v Misouri

 The whole was intended to exclude everything from use as a circulating medium except gold and silver''', and to give to the United States the exclusive control over the coining and valuing of the metallic medium. That the real dollar may represent property, and not the shadow of it.

From the dissenting opinion to one of the Legal Tender cases http://supreme.justia.com/us/79/457/case.html - starts with THE CHIEF JUSTICE, dissenting'Acts of Congress not made in pursuance of the Constitution are not laws.We perceive no connection between the express power to coin money and the inference that the government may, in any contingency, make its securities perform the functions of coined money, as a legal tender in payment of debtsIt is unnecessary to say that we reject wholly the doctrine, advanced for the first time",0

"I never said it would happen. I just said that I wouldn't be suprsed if it does. I made that guess based on everything that's happened so far in Naruto, and the way Kishimoto creates plot twists of this kind. Now your comment is what seems fanboyish and unjustifiable. Kabuto already seemed to have a kind of kind of second nature back during the first part of the series where his eyes would change color when he got mad. Kishimoto wouldn't give him a similar state to Juugo, because it wouldn't be something that new and because he wouldn't want to have two characters be so similar. And as for my Orochimaru possesing Itachi theory, just because something happens at one point doesn't mean it will be the same story next time. By your logic, just because Kakashi needed the help of his students (look 2-3 people right there!) to bail him out of Zabuza's trap during their first meeting, that would mean Zazbuza could have easily killed him during their second meeting when they were fighting alone. Or just because even Gaara's own father, the Kazekage himself, feared Gaara's power, a genin like Naruto shouldn't have been able to beat him let alone after he transformed. Or how could the Uchiha, being the strongest clan of Konoha, be killed so easily by a single member of their village? See? You definetly chose the wrong story to bring up that kind of logic. Practically every single fight in Naruto craps all over it. Orochimaru COULD take over Kabuto, and go on to Itachi after Sasuke's team has weakened him. Perhaps they cause him to overuse his Sharingan eyes, who knows? Orochimaru could find him, make his move, steal his body, and seek vengeance on Sasuke. The point is just that neither of us knows whats gonna happen and we'll just have to read the story.",0

 Page content for footprints poem 

Why do you keep removing this text? These are important facts
about this poem and about the authorship. There has been so much public deceit and this is nothing but pure sabotage when you cannot even give me credit for my own work. 

Footprints, also known as Footprints in the Sand, is a popular allegorical text written in prose. Although released as an """"anonymous contribution"""", it is often mistakenly attributed to Mary Stevenson or Margaret Fishback Powers. Carolyn Joyce Carty is the only author of the most popular version known as Footprints poem; One night a man had a dream whose copyright actually reflects it's anonymous contribution of authorship. See U.S. Copyright Record. 

There also seems to be a critical error when stating that neithr Ella Scharring Hausen or Mary Stevenson never claimed their own copyright that it was only claimed for them by others. What kind of nonsense is that? Mary Stevenson vicariously tried to claim authorship of Hausens public domain version.

 The various local government areas pages only list them.  I was thinking something like that.  These three paragraphs are from a couple of papers I wrote, they can be incorporated into the article.  

The states (and territories) run the majority of the government in Australia and devolve some of this power down to local government, local councils.  Because this devolution of power happens on a state by state basis, in different states, the local councils have different powers.  Though generally they provide water, sewerage and look after local roads, with the states looking after health, education, police and so on.

Tasmania, like the other states, has a constitution.  Unlike the Australian constitution the Tasmanian one is simply an act of parliament, as such to change it requires no more then a majority in the parliament, not a referendum.  This constitution (among other things) establishes local government in Part """"IVA - Local Government"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  However, this part while establishing the fact that councils will exist, leaves open how they are operated and what their powers are.  Both the system and power of the councils being provided by the """"Parliament ... from time to time"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  It is the """"Local Government Act 1993"""" (referred hereafter to as either the 'LGA' or 'the act') that currently provides for the creation of the various councils, the role of the councillors, what power the councils have and so on.  

The act requires that the various councils """"provide for the health, safety and welfare of the community"""", """"represent and promote the interests of the community"""", and """"provide for the peace, order and good government of the municipal area"""".  Generally the act permits councils to """"do anything necessary or convenient to perform its functions either within or outside its municipal area"""".  Specifically, the act provides for the various councils to have the following powers (among others): to charge land rates, """"service rates"""", special rates and to levy fines (in relation to by-laws); and, to make by-laws in respect to anything the council has power to do.
 I'm sure the other states have similar legislation.   (Fuck you!) """,0

Sicilianmandolin, the info in the first paragraph is not at all promotional. If you really want to still keep away the info that you deleted, I will accept that, even though I do not understand why, however I will not allow anyone to just delete info in the first paragraph as it is now. It is, as I said, promotional. All first paragraphs of other nations are equally as 'promotional' (as you say) and captivating. Wikipedia, I agree, is not a tourist brochure, yet you always include the best achievements of the country in the intro. 

Also, what I mean by 'attacking' Italy-related articles is that many people seem to not want pages to change and there is constant edit-wars, reverting and deleting. Rather than deleting disputable info, I believe that it is better to improve it, rather than revertion. As I've only edited a few Italian articles, it could be only concerning those pages, but that's what I see in that.

Ok, let's just leave the intro as it is now. If you want sources for the info you deleted, I could go and find some.

Re """"mutations' sound to the layman rather dramatic ..."""", that's a fair point, which the article should clear up. Generally the more dramatic mutations will be unviable and, in placentals mammals including humans, will usually be spontaneously aborted (can't remember the incidence of this in humans but it's surprisingly high; most mothers are unaware of it because such embryos usually abort before symptoms of pregnancy appear).

""": Hi Hanely, and others,

First, a further clarification on the concept behind wikipedia, neutrality is a fundamental pillar, but there are two others as well, no original research and verifiability.  This takes us into the """"weasel words"""" you mention, which it's true is an area where improvements are needed with the article.  A reader should be able to independently check everything written in a wikipedia article should they want to, and as such, wikipedia is more about providing verifiable information rather than what a given editor simply thinks or believes is """"true.""""  You specifically cite the Criticism section, and I agree.  """"Plagiarism"""" has evolved the furthest of the three subsections IMO and is solidly referenced with verifiable sources (I think the believer stance(s) aren't presented as well as they could though), and the same should probably be done for """"Science"""" and """"Revelation"""".  For instance, one thing that can be done for """"Revelation"""" is cite the low book sales and distribution of the TUB instead of the simple current statement that it isn't widespread.  """"Peacock terms"""" have been an ongoing challenge from my perspective, commonly inserted throughout the article in a way that aggrandizes the book, but I think this is currently toned down.

What I'm hearing from you Hanely overall is a suggestion to focus on TUB alone, make the article perhaps a book summary with some history added, and put everything else in other articles.  It is one way to go, and you specifically mention Criticism-related topics as being placed elsewhere.  This would also need to be true of the adherents section and anything """"pro"""".  I don't agree with this tactic however, for reasons of wikipedia policy and overall usefulness to the average reader.  What makes TUB interesting and worth writing & reading about is that it purports to be more than a typical religious book, and people accept it as such.  I think that is a highly intertwined element of the TUB topic, and it fits in this article, and by the same token the reasons people *don't* accept it as such is part of the story.  I think it is a challenge to have the article reflect these differing perspectives, but that's a basic challenge involved with wikipedia articles in a nutshell.  Writing separate articles for separate points of view is discouraged.  See POV forking.

I think there needs to be a top-level article that is a summary of The Urantia Book basics, its teachings, its history, and those who are pro and con on topics related to it.  Other articles can then develop certain topics in more depth, if needed or wanted.  I don't see why the top-level article shouldn't be this one, it already serves as that, and other similar topics on wikipedia are structured the same way (for instance A Course in Miracles isn't a simple book synopsis & some words about the history, but covers pro and con viewpoints, as does Book of Mormon, which also has a plagiarism section).  I certainly do not accept that for some reason everything to do with Criticism should be tucked away in separate articles.  This is inherently biased toward the idea that the main wikipedia article is only for those seeking viewpoints where nothing negative is said.  Audiences also come to learn about contrary viewpoints, and those viewpoints are just as valid.

On the points you brought up, my thoughts:

1.  I've seen a tendency over the 1+ year I've followed this wikipedia article off and on for people to add many digressions to the article.  And understandably so, TUB is enormous and has thousands of interesting details and side stories.  But not all will fit in the main article.  I've seen multiple people each add a few sentences here and there, and over time, the article has become enormous and unfocused with all sorts of illogical disorganized digressions.  Like you say, this article can stand to be streamlined (you should have seen what it's been like before!).  IMO, the Lucifer rebellion story, while interesting, doesn't quite make the cut in terms of being essential enough to mention on the main page.  Perhaps an article summarizing TUB's view of the history of earth is worthwhile to build up?  The Lucifer / Caligastia / Satan story would fit in article such as that, for example.

2.-5.  Like I've said, Criticism is appropriate to have, as is the view of believers, and a POV fork is contrary to wikipedia standards.  In terms of Gardner specifically, despite any opinions on his conclusions about TUB, his book is one of the few published about TUB to analyze it from a nonbeliever perspective and it's entirely appropriate to use and cite as reference material for the article.  I say that even though I'm not personally convinced by arguments he makes.  I've read his book, have access to a copy, and can make edits regarding i",0

Please do not delete my contributions just because for some reason you deem them 'speculatory'. It is improbable if not impossible that the Yankees will make the playoffs this year and their remaining games against Boston are at Fenway. Therefore the Red Sox will not return to play a game in old Yankees Stadium.

'Nuff said. Or perhaps not. Here's a tidbit from that last WS """"Trivia"""" section linked above:

 According to Tug McGraw, one of the police horses, who lined up in the field during the 9th inning of Game 6, was not """"stadium trained."""" (8th item down the list)

I don't think you can top (or is it bottom?) that for trivia. There's a simple reason that over a quarter of a century of trivia sections (and probably more) have piled up in these World Series articles: Writing well is hard work. It's just too easy to simply drop minutiae onto these pages and file them under """"Trivia"""" and let somebody else do the hard work of integrating them . . . later. 

Part of my motivation for dredging up all those links above is that I've noticed an inconsistency of style and layout, and some confusing or redundant info in all the WS articles going back to 1903. It's like the same car built by different contractors at different times with different materials. I find it a bit troubling because it's a sign of limited effort, limited means for anybody to have developed a plan for what could be a real highlight of WP (can you say """"Fall Classic Portal""""?). I found it fairly easy to take the '06 trivia about La Russa and Leyland and create a separate section under the """"Background"""" section, and it seems to have held up since Friday night. But it took some time to sift through it and move the info.

Cutting to the chase: All this WS """"Trivia"""" is classifiable. The better it's organized, the less it will seem like trivia, so if a handful of """"labels"""" could be cooked up for categories of info formerly known as trivia, the overall style of these articles will seem to read better. That ought to settle the trivia issue.

Postscript: For instance, a 4-1 WS where one contender splits """"on the road"""" and then comes home and sweeps to win 3 more and clinch is fairly rare from what I've looked up so far. What the Cards have done against Detroit in 2006 matches what NY (NL) accomplished in 1969 (except the Mets dropped Game 1 instead of 2 to Baltimore). I'm still working my way thru past Fall Classics to see when else this happened, so I can add this info to the '06 article in an appropriate place, but not as an addition to the dreaded Trivia section. A heading that might be appropriate for this info each and every year: Long series, short series. 4 or 5 games would classified as a short series, 6 or 7 classified as long. Easy to spot trends in this area and develop copy to fill a section like this. Was a short or long series predicted each year; by who; was a trend broken, were the prognosticators wrong, did a noted BB writer point this out so it doesn't smack of the dreaded Original Research? Now really 'nuff said.   (talk)  """,0

RfA thanks
My RfA at school play with me...|thumb|right|140px]]
Thank you for your participation in my recent RfA, which closed successfully. I felt the process was a thorough review of my contributions and my demeanor, and I was very gratified to see how many editors took the time to really see what I'm about and how I can be of help to the project. As a result, some editors changed their views during the discussion, and most expressed specific, detailed points to indicate their opinion (whether it was , , or ).

A number of editors were concerned about my level of experience. I was purposeful in not waiting until a particular benchmark occurred before requesting adminship, because I feel - as many do - that adminship is not a reward and that each case is individual. It is true that I am not the most experienced editor around here, but I appreciate that people dug into my contributions enough to reach the conclusion that I seem to have a clue. Also, the best thing about this particular concern is that experience is something an editor - or administrator - can always get more of, and I'll continue doing that, just as I've been doing. (If I seem a little slow at it, feel free to slap me.)
I intend to keep my """"dirty, dirty violator face"""" clean from now on -) 
I am a strong believer in the concept that this project is all about the content, and I'm looking forward to contributing wherever I can. Please let me know if I can be of any help. In the meantime, I'm off to school...

You can't have it both ways. You're either an encyclopedic website that seeks to be factual and informative while minimizing speculation or you're a fansite. Either way, it's not suitable for inclusion. For example, if your site is a community run information site, then it should not be included under the In general, any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of brilliant prose guideline. Your Wiki won't provide information we don't already have or will have in the future if its just a community info site. However, if it trades in information that we won't be adding, such as speculation, theories, spoilers, because of Wikipedia guidelines on such material, then we should not be posting your sites for the reasons discussed above. It is not the case of making a link between encyclopedias, but between an encyclopedia and one particular fansite.
Further, the two Wikis you mention aren't even major fansites, when the guideline specifically states: Fan sites: On articles about topics with many fansites, including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such. In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link. We already have the major AND official forum: The Fuselage. If you'd like to add a link to a directory of Lost fansites, be my guest... but inclusion of either Wiki alone (instead of a list) is preferential treatment of minor fansites, since there are certainly other, larger, more popular fansites (Lost-media, Lost-tv, for example). Certainly, if we were to start adding fansites at random, we'd have to begin there and with others, like a link to TWOP's reviews and forums. The best course of action if you believe these sites simply must be linked to is for you to make a list of fansites and include a link to that directory, which is how WP:EL says to proceed.
As for removing the disclaimer, its not going anywhere. The disclaimer was put there specifically because we'd have people posting each and every fansite they dreamed up as official sites when they weren't. Lost is an example of a show wherein Wikipedia guidelines and policies are repeatedly ignored by the editing community, so the long-term editors have had to be very diligent in monitoring this page. This is an outgrowth of that, and has for the most part helped a lot. Moreover, there is no """"freebie"""" section for links. All links listed there are official sources except IMDB, which is used almost without exception. The same list of reasons I mentioned above for IMDB, including the fact that IMDB is a featured part of the standard TV Infobox, clearly do not apply to these Wikis nor any other site people have been trying to add (Mr. Clucks, 4815162342, etc.)
Finally, I will agree with you that the list of links for all the individual networks is redundant, and should be chopped down or moved to Airdates of Lost as a link for the country/network listed there.  """,0

 The Dellums mayoral campaign was criticized for holding expensive fundraising dinners and because Dellums would not disclose his plans for the city, or his positions on issues.  - please provide a reference for this; surely, per WP:BLP, you would never insert something like this without a source?

 Elise Ackerman, an Oakland resident who bought the domain recallmayordellums.com sent an open letter to Dellums that was covered in the local press, saying to Dellums, """"African Americans and Latinos live in fear in Oakland because of your lies. Middle-class residents working two jobs live in fear because of your lies. Nurses, teachers and social workers live in fear because of your lies."""" Near the end of the message, she continues """"You are not effective, you are not honest, you have no integrity and you should step aside."""" - what is your source for this?

 In 1972 John Lennon wrote the song Woman is the Nigger of the World. Asked for his reaction to the use of the word """"nigger"""" by a white singer in a pop song Dellums wrote """"If you define nigger as someone whose lifestyle is defined by others, whose opportunities are defined by others, whose role in society is defined by others, then good news - you don't have to be black to be a nigger in this society, most of the people in America are niggers!"""" Lennon was delighted with his reaction and proudly read the quote on the Dick Cavett Show prior to performing the controversial song with his wife at the time, Yoko Ono. - can you explain the removal of this material?

 Grenada and Cuba controversies, treason allegation - why did you add the bolded text to the header?

 Conservative journalist David Horowitz suggested Dellums' actions were treasonous. - source?

 Why did you change Dellums worked as a lobbyist for the government of Haiti in 2001–2002 to Dellums accepted $500,000 in payment for lobbying work for the government of the impoverished nation of Haiti in 2001–2002?  How is it acceptable, per NPOV to add the impoverished nation of?

Part III

What's with blanking out the names completely? So much for compromise. I'm going back to COUNTING the pre-1925 champions. Here's why:

1. The outside sources, such as the Encyclopedia Britannica, list them.

2. All the arguments that could be made against the pre-1925 French tournament could also be made against the other three.

3. The idea of the """"slam"""" didn't even emerge until the 1930s, with Don Budge...but do we see anyone black out pre-1938 Wimbledon champs?

4. It's clear that the French tournament was MORE open...their first champ was a Brit, as was two runners-up in the early decades. Interestingly, the US """"Open"""" in 1881 was open only to Americans, and was for several years. Yet we count them, because that's the origin of the tournament.

5. There's also the pro-am dispute, pre-1968. 

6. Wikipedia is supposed to reflect pluralistic viewpoints, not just the one of one person such as Fyunclick who violates WP:OWN to contort this and similar tennis articles to reflect his own views, rather than reflecting outside sources that existed long before Wikipedia did.

Perhaps. Generally, if something is commonly known as exactly """"Dallas"""", that should be listed on the disambiguation page. People (or characters) with the given name or surname may be moved to a separate page as they are partial title matches. That would suggest that Dallas (Alien) should remain on the disambiguation page. But the page could perhaps be reorganized to make it easier to use. Perhaps a section for == People and character == with entries for Dallas (name) and Dallas (Alien) (sometimes a hiddden comment is added to remind editors to only add an entry if it is known as exactly the term being disambiguated).  ≠ wiser

I think there are passages in Proudhon that read like minarchism. But there are just as many others if not more that don't. Whatever Larry Gambone says (I see that's where you've been taking your Proudhon quotes from, which is I guess why you never give decent references), there is certainly inconsistency - or at least, a greater degree of complexity than I think you are willing or able to accept, in Proudhon's work. But then who isn't inconsistent? As I said, it's not hard to find quotes in Proudhon that are against anarchism or that support property (in the full-blown sense). That doesn't mean that he was never an anarchist. 

I think 'On the general idea of the revolution in the 19th century' has his fullest discussion of the state and of his version of an anarchist society. It's definitely worth reading, and is widely available in english (though unfortunately I don't think it's on the net). 

In Section IV (On the principle of authority) you can find for example:

""""We conclude without fear that the revolutionary formula should not be direct legislation, nor direct government, nor simplified government; it is no more government.""""

""""Neither monarchy, nor aristocracy, nor even democracy, where this third term implies some or other government acting in the name of the people and calling itself the people. No authority, no government, even of the people: there is the revolution.""""

 defaultsort is your friend! 

Hello! I noticed your edit to Mikael Odenberg, so I thought I should drop by and tell you about the wonders of {{DEFAULTSORT}}.

A sortkey is an alternative term the article should be sorted by when listed in a category. For example to add an article called Albert Einstein to the category """"people"""" and have the article sorted by """"Einstein, Albert"""". You would type """"[[Category:People|Einstein, Albert]]"""". This kind of sortkey you successfully added to Mikael Odenberg in your edit.

But, I reverted most of your edit! Why? Because there is a feature called """"Default sort key"""", which changes the default sort key used by categories from the name of the article to the one specified with the magic word {{DEFAULTSORT}}. Instead of adding |Odenberg, Mikael you simply add  {{DEFAULTSORT:Odenberg, Mikael}} above the categories, which I had already done in this case.

Thank you for your otherwise very valuable contribution!  (Talk ° contribs)

 Chemsitry Comments 
I have noticed that you seem to spend a lot of time commenting on chemistry articles, claiming that they need to be either put in context or wikified. I was wondering if you could put in context your own level of knowledge in chemistry, so that the articles can be reeditted to be applicable to your own level of knowledge. With the chemical reaction stubs, I have been assuming that people will generally be looking at them  if they have a basic level of chemical knowledge (i.e. one of about an A-Level student in England) and will not need a full explanation of why the reaction proceeds as it does. If this does not fulfil your ideals what else will I need to add, complete mechanisms with comments of facial and stereo selectivities and such. If so this is simply not possible as there will be a large amount of repeated information on Wikipedia. Please get back to me on this topic. - 

Hello! Eh. Lately I've indeed been editing chemistry articles; BUT only to remove improper categories (such as those you added to, well, a damn lot of articles). Using AutoWikiBrowser. On some, tags such as {{wikify}} have been posted, but not many. I may have edited one or two chemical reaction stubs, but I don't know which ones. Point out more specifically which articles you refer to and I'll see what I can do. Do note, however, that my knowledge of chemistry is extremely basic, and my contributions to chemistry articles have only been clean-up/maintenance work.  (Talk ° contribs) 

Its okay. I'm a qualified chemist, but you seem to be suggesting for example on the Bechamp Reaction that more detail is needed. To me it seems clear. Also on the category front, they were not incorrectly labelled. I have been putting them into the topmost category they can go into so as to create a list of all the chemists that appear on wikipedia. This is because it is otherwise hard to see who may or may not need to be added. I have been finding your editting very unhelpful in removing them from this category.

Then during the 1970s people began using that term to refer to what they refered to as 'political Islam.' Then Daniel Pipes popularized the usage of the term.

History of Primal Therapy article

I read through the recent discussions on Talk:Primal_therapy. I also added two more comments to the Talk:Arthur_Janov page. Did you send an email enquiry? The 1973 date for France D's marriage to Art is without credibility. After the divorce, to Vivian's great credit, she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate Arthur Janov. After all, he wrote in the original Primal Scream: """"It is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through Primal Therapy have never separated."""" (chapter 12). And according to France D. Janov's own admission in the Primal Center's Video Series 2, she enrolled at the Primal Institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates. So it's a fact that Art married a former patient.

My feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub, the content of the Arthur Janov article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry. It isn't really the place to dissect Janov's reputation. I know it happens in other Wikipedia biographies, but in many cases it has got out of hand. I agree with your suggestion on the Primal therapy Talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate History of Primal Therapy article. The Conocer piece doesn't strike me as a sound source of verifiable information, so I put together some links to articles which can be found online:

If you type Emotional Intelligence into Google the No.1 result is Steve Hein's eqi.org website. He interviewed a former patient who attended Arthur Janov's Primal Center in the late 1990's. You can find his interview notes here, labelled """"cautionary note"""".

Janov's bio on the Primal Center website states: """"The latest research conducted at Dr. Janov’s Primal Center on the effects of Primal Therapy on the brain was performed by Dr. Erik Hoffman, former Professor of Neurophysiology at Copenhagen University."""" You can read  what Erik Hoffmann, Ph.D., is doing now at Hoffmann's website.

On this page you can find a transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's account of what happened to him after he left the Primal Institute.

Carol Mither's book, Therapy Gone Mad, identifies case histories from Janov's first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against The Center for Feeling Therapy.  Simon ( )

Thanks, Simon - Why can't you create an account like normal Wikipedians complete with a talk page? I don't think the History idea will come to much, There is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it - especially in view of Cgingold's latest analyses on the Primal Therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals. I have already read the Michael Holden swan song twice - sad case.  

You seem to be applying two standards of evidence. The Primal Therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on Arthur Janov's books alone, which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center. Last September, I wrote in the Primal Therapy talk page: Will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about Stettbacher's method, or the International Primal Association, or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the 1970s? There is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article  for a start, two books about The Center for Feeling Therapy, Erik Hoffmann's bio, and the transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's audio tape which was played a number of times at the IPA convention in 1983. The books by Carol Mithers and Tomas Videgård are already referenced in the main article. I have a copy of Videgård's book, by the way. Also, Professor Steven Rose wrote a one-page account of his research with Arthur Janov in Lifelines:
""""As Janov had hoped, it turned out that before therapy, the quantity of these particular receptors in his client's platelets was considerably below normal. Within six months of therapy, clients' depression had lifted, and the biochemical and immunological measures I was making approached the average for 'normal' non-depressed people of the same age and sex.""""
Further down the same page he added:
""""I obtained similar biochemical results when, a couple of years later, I did a similar study with depressed clients going through other, less dramatic forms of psychotherapy, so I suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory.""""
Having participated in the editing of articles in t",0
I have allways been willing to give all my sources for Patagonia. How can I do that when they errase what I edit and I am blocked?,0
"""
So, by your own admission, there was no consensus for removal. Editors who attempt to classify material must base their organization on sources, which you did not do when writing: """"What is the rationale behind claiming that these 500 years was a single event, and conquerors comprising a wide geographic region from Turkey, Persia, Mongolia, Afghanistan, et cetera need to be bundled up into one wide ranging entry under """"Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent"""".

asssiveego has posted his RfA and I have blocked him for it

Hello. I have blocked Masssiveego for his antics on Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Masssiveego which seems like a clear attempt to draw fire from people bitter with his own antics on RfA, with a minimalist nomination and tongue-in-cheek answers to the questions.

Once again, it's time to bring this up. He's coming close to exhausting the community's patience, in my view. Thoughts? – Chacor 

    Not yet. I would not have blocked him at all for starting the RfA. In fact i think SNOWing this RfA was a bad idea. Rather I would have let it run the full 7 days. Having 100+ opposes might have finally gotten through to this editor that he needs to reconsider his approach. But with the RfA snowed, he's got ammo to say we aren't treating him right, etc. ++Lar: t/c 

        Perhaps, but there just isn't a reason to let trolls stay. – Chacor 

            Is this user a flat out troll? Sure, close the book right away... Or, is he rescuable? if rescuable is it worth the effort? that's how I evaluate the question of whether community patience is exhausted. I don't think ME is a flat out troll. His contributions are light so not a LOT of effort is justified but I'm not convinced he is not rescuable. Contrast with Tobias, next thread.

Do you mean you can read about those work conditions & not see that it's slavery?  Prepare yourself for earthshaking news: the wage system is slavery but most people didn't think so.  Slavery means """"someone who is controlled by someone or something.""""   A boss controls a slave, but a slave also enslaves a boss.   Being offered a wage you can't live on is slavery.   All jobs are being eliminated by machine-slaves,  which makes it more obvious than ever before that all people must have a Guaranteed Minimum Income, although I prefer the word 'residual' to 'minimum'.  Read child labour & try to see it was child slavery into the 20th century, & it still is today since many children work in their parents' business.  When they """"ended child labour"""" that didn't set the children free; they were """"free to starve"""" because what they need/ed is a GMI.  Having children is a form of slavery too: parents become slaves to their children (when they need to eat, bathe, etc) but the children are also slaves to their parents.  So """"no control"""" also means we'll always be slaves to needing food, & we can find ways to eliminate all the work with machines which again means all people need a GMI.  (Actually all people should own all things, because when a few rich people own everything it's obviously slavery; how did every person not know that?  America refused to let any attempts at Socialism & Communism succeed; instead they forced it to fail by starting many wars, teaching torture, & you must read Wm Blum's """"Rogue State"""".  Fidel Castro was right & America was wrong.)  And the BLS is wrong; they always underestimate, because most of those people are probably illegal immigrants from many generations back.  They say every year 50,000 people are smuggled into the US to work as prostitutes (that's slavery), so can you imagine how many illegals there must be in America hidden behind walls, & all supporting a few rich slave masters who travel the world & raise their families on the backs of SLAVES in America.  How can you read about multinational corporations & not see they cause poverty in those other countries, as well as in America?    If Liberia has a population of 3 million & one corporation goes there & """"creates only 2000 jobs"""" then can't anyone see the wage is causing their poverty??  That's just an example, but do you see what I'm saying about the wage is the problem worldwide, not the solution, like America thinks?  When 3,000 people show up to apply for 20 job openings, you know the wage is wrong & it's slavery.  I know I'm a slave, & I know every person is a slave & I'm right & everyone is wrong.  Gerry Spence also says we're slaves in Give Me Liberty.  That's all for now.    02:08, 31""",0

That seems pretty positive to me. Sorry it's not discussing compounded bioidenticals, but the article makes it clear that it is discussing bioidenticals, as does Boothby when referencing the same data. Compounding does not define bioidentical anywhere but in your mind. Yes, they are associated, but that does not mean that they always go together.

Here's another quote from a NAMS post-graduate course[] - """"BHT is principally a construct within conventional HT that can usually be fulfilled by the use of existing commercial products that are familiar to all practitioners.

"I do not agree with you about that at all. In fact, Kerry's Senate Office web site displays in great detail the history of each and every bill that Kerry has sponsored over the last 10 years.

 Now as to the point you make which is that there are also other measures of effectiveness. That indeed can be true, but I can find no data trail on Kerry's Sentate Office web site which supplies me with information about any bills which Kerry, either as an significant amender or as a co-sponsor, helped become law.

"Answer: You use the date July 20 of 1599 AD as Thot 1 and retreat one date back every 4 years, or 30 days back in 120 years. Example, 240 years is 60 days back to May 21 of 1839 AD, or Apr 21 of 1959 AD, then add 13 days in our 1900 or 2000 century to have Gregorian May 4 in 1959 AD. Another 44 years to 2003 AD and 11 leap days takes all the dates back to April 23. Then 2004-2007 is April 22. In reply to the post below which says the Coptic calendar is not Egyptian, the answer is our September 11 as Thot 1 is Julian August 29. Though the Coptic calendar (Egyptian with leap days) was accepted in 284 AD (which Era of Diocletion is the Era of Christian Martyrs so coincidentally the year 6000 of Adam in the Jewish book of Josephus published in Rome), this calendar leap day was created in 27 BC by Augustus Octavius Caesar who inaugurated it in 25 BC when Thoht 1 becomes August 29. Therefore, the Coptic calendar is Julian (not Gregorian). Events against America have been on Egyptian dates. The August 2 invasion of Kuwait is Julian July 20 and the invasion takes place at 30 degrees where the rise of Sothis occurs on that date only at that latitude; this implying Saddam chose the rise to invade. However, they felt world trade controlling oil was USA blame. Another date is Thoth 1 was Feb 26 in 747 BC. In 1993 the world trade was bombed on Gregorian Feb 26 not taking into account that Julian Feb 26 is March 11 (March 10 in leap year). The Coptic calendar honors this date as the half year placing Pamenot 1 on March 10 and the internet terrorists attempt to destroy world trade by constantly revising the March 10 virus.",0

"There are 3 articles.  Contract Bridge, Rubber bridge and Duplicate bridge.  It is possible there are more and that I've missed something.  One article is the parent article, it should include some history of how the game developed from Whist and that article would be Contract Bridge.  That there is bidding should be spelled out in the parent article.  That there are only 15 useable words which partners may use to describe their hand and to arrive at a contract should be spelled out, the concept of strain or demonination should be presented and the rules of play.  But I don't believe it would be appropriate to do more than touch on bidding systems.  Rubber bridge is the way Contract Bridge is scored.  Then, Duplicate bidge adds another layer of scoring complexity in addition to the already present and continually used, rubber bridge scoring. In addition, Duplicate Bridge adds another layer of rigidity to what cards partnerships hold.  In this manner the element is skill is boosted while the element of luck (unavoidably present) is made smaller.  The Duplicate bridge article could get into the bidding boxes, the curtain used in large, international tournements and so on.  But I would very much like to see these articles be friendly and readable so that a person who had never played bridge could read them and could find a logical development of complexity and of expertise required.  So that a green player could view both how to begin to learn to play and where the top is too, that people make their living at playing bridge, that there are international tournements of great interest, that some top bridge players are recognized by various public figures and so on.  So that a person can follow the logical development of being a beginning player, right through to becoming a top player.  And the joy of the intellectual compitition combied with the social intercourse of sitting at a table with 3 people.  We could compare that, perhaps, to Chess which is likewise an intellectual compitition but is less social with each board lasting longer and being less casual.  You know what I mean?  As it stands now a new player isn't introduced to the game in a logical sequence.  This article covers too much ground and brings too much stiffness into the game too early.",0

He was the brother of Jeanne Campo Potamkin and was the uncle of Jamin Potamkin.  There is a Randy Campo Lectureship at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, the most recent taking place Thursday 17 June 2010.  The Randy V. Campo Lecture from June 2008 is on the Bascom Palmer intenet site.  You can hear what other unrelated doctors say regarding Randy there.  The first Randy Campo Lecture, which I attended was not videotaped, but I was there and heard the speaker state, """"Randy was the Michael Jordan of Retina surgeons.""""  Randy's colleagues honor him with an AMA credited lecture, guess if the AMA considers it worth a credit toward a medical degree to learn about Randy Campo by attending the RVC Lecture, Wikipedia should (or wikipedia's loyal vandals) allow the information to be on its site.  Crap it may be controversial to state that President Kennedy was killed in an automobile accident, it is true Kennedy was killed in an automobile, now the controversy may surround that a gunmen or gunmen also had some invovlment in the death of Kennedy, so should we remove reference to the facts and just state that """"Kennedy was killed in a car"""" on the Wikipedia site?  I just can't believe that Randy Campo from the grave is stirring up this CONTROVERSY!    JMNP""",0

(I know, I knowsuch bad taste, ugh, but it's hard to not use these kinds of metaphors when talking about the subject.)  I can understand the concern, but let me tell you my experience about reading this marvelous article.  Moni, you really are courageous for taking this article on.  I stopped reading it as an editor, and couldn't stop.  It felt like I was reading a story, one that captivated me, and as is often the case when I'm reading a story with a lot of players in it, I did forget who everyone was.  However, I was okay with that because that's often my experience when dealing with a large cast of characters.  I forget the details, like who did what and when and to whom, but I either go back and fill in what I've missed or forgotten about, or I was go with the flow and trust that the players are important.  The latter is what happened as I read this article.So this is my long-winded way of saying that perhaps forgetting the cast is part and parcel of the fact that so many people are involved.  Everyone's story is important, and you had to pick and choose what to include here.  I don't think it's something you should concern yourself about, since I'm not sure there's much you could do to remedy the situation, anyway.  And I'm so sure that you should.  Hope this helps.",0

 Wrong information in the article 
There are many wrong info in the article. Here are the followings with proofs from various sources:
1. Government and Politics:
Article:Due to Northern Cyprus' isolation and heavy reliance on Turkish support, Turkey has a high level of influence over the country's politics. This has led to some experts characterising it as an effective puppet state of Turkey.
Sources:1 24.05.2012: """"In the 1995 and 1996 Loizidou Judgments the ECtHR treated the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as a sort of puppet government whose acts fall within the jurisdiction of (and are attributable to) Turkey as an (unlawful) occupier."""" 
2 09.01.2013: """"The situation with the South African homelands was similar and so was collective non-acceptance of the turkish puppet-government in northern Cyprus which has resulted in the turkish republic of northern Cyprus not being recognized as a state.""""
3 27.11.2005 """"It may be argued that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was declared in 1983 and which was only recognized as a state by Turkey and for a short period by Pakistan, is at the moment of writing the only existent puppet state in the world.}} Few political decisions in Northern Cyprus are taken without the approval of the Turkish National Security council in Ankara""""
4 04.09.2004 """"The TRNC is not only heavily dependent on Turkey for funding it is also administratively tied with the Turkish institutions so that in some respects it gives the impression of being a province of Turkey... Most profoundly however in ways that are always strongly felt  in north Cyprus but are not always evident to outside eyes, it is Turkey that calls the shots.""""
Realities:
1. USA Federal Court (09.10.2014): """"TRNC is a democratic republic."""" (Official summary of Court decision; website of Court decision; Decision of Court)
2. European Court of Human Rights accepted all laws of Northern Cyprus without any exception:
Not only the laws of """"Immovable Property Commission of Northern Cyprus (and its related laws)"""" but also all laws of Northern Cyprus without any exception are recognized at European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR):

Thus, the adoption by the authorities of the """"TRNC"""" of civil, administrative or criminal law measures, and their application or enforcement within that territory, may be regarded as having a legal basis in domestic law for the purposes of the Convention"""".
Note: In the related above case, the application of Greek Cypriots was immediately found to be """"inadmissable"""" by ECtHR and rejected by ECtHR! 
That is to say, the applicant Greek Cypriots were expelled just at the beginning of the process. Case was never handled by the ECtHR!
3. The number of university students in Northern Cyprus is more than 70,000 (a country with 300,000 population). There are students from 114 different countries. Northern Cyprus is the top 1 country in the ratio of univ.stud/population in the world. How can such a country be """"heavily dependent"""" on Turkey?

The accusation made by ChrisCh is baseless simply because more than myself have pointed out their objections to his extreme censorship of the Padua College wikipedia listing. I would further like to add my anger that a Wikipedia newcomer, Freedomfighter1112, has been indefinitely blocked for expressing his point-of-view.

It should be assumed that, in good faith, that Freedomfighter1112 would hope to assist the Wikipedia community in a positive way; however, with the actions taken by the two users mentioned previously, he/she has been prohibited from being able to accomplish this desire. We must remember that everyone makes mistakes, and mistakes are meant to be forgiven - especially in the case of a person's first edit.

Well thank you. I am glad that at least you can really look at existing articles, and realise a mistake has been made somewhere and apologise for it, and for that, I shall rest my case. As for the part over the assumption of good faith, perhaps I may just remind, that your introductory comment in my talk page, as well as the revert edit summary you provided are just as inflammatory and a reflection of bad faith to me in my books, and you may similarly wish to reflect a little on how you conduct your edits. To revert another purely due to the """"unnecessarily terse edit summary"""" is simply unacceptable in wikipedia. If you have an issue with my comment, talk it out in the relevant talk page (and I would prefer it to be either in the article's talk page itself or in a more centralised location. This is not some kind of a you vs I issue alone. Others should know what happens in the background too. This is a community, remember?), not revert out of emotional displeasure or just to make a point. That you are """"suspicious"""" of my edits based on past experience in other articles does not vindicate your current action. It speaks of nothing but very bad faith, so you may perhaps do good cleaning up your backyard first before telling others what to do (reminds me very much of global politics for some reason. D).

My comments are unbelievably inflammatory? Well I am sorry, but I do happen to be someone who usually speaks my mind, and I dont mince my words. You will have to get used to my bluntness, I suppose, as much as I have to get used to your behavior as well.

The last I checked, you created the three articles for alliancesm, with NA at the top for each of them. Now please explain to me in what way is NA the home continent for each airline alliance? CO, for your information, was created by me way back on 10 December 2004, and it started off with an alphabetical listing, and it has remained that way until 8 February 2006 when you unilaterally came along and changed the other, callig it """"standardization"""". No one said anything about it after this change? Well I did, and almost immediately. I dont see any avidence of the continent order being switched back and forth at any time of its edit history, and I certainly do not see anyone commenting on the pre-existing alphabetical listing for a good 14 months straight even when NA is CO's home continent.

So now that we know just what exactly is being """"standardised"""" here, are you going to apply them to the three articles you created? """,0

Thank you, I understand.   I became frustrated when 7 articles came up at once by Mdtemp.  After I put in a lot of work into the articles.   I argued found sources, argued again, and just gave up.  One who made it through was James Thompson  whom was an Olympic Alternate 4 or 5 times and 6 time medalist in the National Championships while also being the subject of independent articles   .  Even there, they kept saying he didn't pass manote, when he obviously passed GNG.  I don't believe that the group of individuals were looking at WP:BEFORE where it stated """"D. Search for additional sources, if the main concern is notability The minimum search expected is a Google Books search and a Google News archive search; Google Scholar is suggested for academic subjects. Such searches should in most cases take only a minute or two to perform.""""

I was typically referred to opinions on subjects like wp:manote (even though it say it is a guide) and GNG (which is a policy).  So I read some of these policies and made sure that my articles fit those narrow criteria.  I started to put in minimal writing so that I wouldn't get upset if they were deleted. I used google news and google books as my primary sources as per AFD WP:BEFORE suggestions.     That is why you see a lot more Olympians and Negro League players now from me.  They are automatically considered to be notable.   I was surprised to see some of the martial arts editors  editing the articles on negro basketball and baseball players I created  and .  This annoyed me as it seemed to go into the area of WP:HOUNDING.  I was trying to avoid them and possible confrontations. You are right when it comes to the Eve Aronoff article.  I will fix that.

Andrew, I was in two minds about including AD. The only reason to include it was because people are unused to three digit years. At least I am! ;) Anyway, I'm happy to see it go. I love simplicity, just won't surrender it unless clarity isn't thrown out with the bathwater. As I said, I'm content. Explaining the """"nearest 50 years"""" rule is great. )
Also, I was going to explain the contents were only as specific as chapter. You have done this in a very neat and clear way, thank you! Great to have you at work on things!
Yes, I thought about linking the books or not. The main argument against was that it took so long to enter them! However, the point of linking every repeated entry in a sortable list imo is that people may sort on city, for example, to see manuscripts near their home, say. If they see that Thessalonians is in a university library 125 miles away, maybe they will click on the link to Thess to see what Wiki editors have said about the book. Instead of looking for the first instance of Thessalonians in the table, or trying to decipher the abbreviation they just click on the field in the record they are looking at.
I agree about not over-Wiki-ing, especially in the body of an article, and especially if different words are given the same link. Tables, by their nature are speedy reference systems, I like the idea of giving people just one click to follow up locating a record of interest.
One example of how I might use the table is to add a """"Textual criticism"""" section to articles on NT books that don't have one already. I'd sort the table by the Contents field (I know it's not perfect), view the data relevant to a book and click through to it.
Another use is to check just what 1 Corinthians chapters 10-11 contain. That article actually has links to specific chapters. Some of us know what's in chapters, most won't. Though, admittedly, not all articles on NT books go to specifics on chapters, but maybe in time they will.
Now the work is done, it seems like a pity to lose it. Rest assured, I'm not going to be writing articles with every second word Wikified. ;)  """,0

I have been wondering about Polycheles typhlops. I would have nominated it myself for DYK, if only I had been able to find a good hook. It really is a fascinating animal, but there's nothing (cited) in the text that jumped out as instantly notable. I agree that the """"two species"""" claim is false, and that the reference proves it (planktonic larvae can be easier to find than animals living on the sea floor at depths of >2000 m, so it's not that surprising that species have been missed). I wasn't sure if someone else would find a good way of re-wording it and save the DYK entry; I certainly couldn't think of one, but I didn't vote it down just in case. That DOI is an odd thing indeed. Springer Link definitely gives the same DOI I put in the article, but dx.doi.org doesn't recognise it. It's not even as if it's a very new article that hasn't made it into the DOI database yet. I have added a link directly to the journal article; I am wary of removing the DOI, because it *ought* to be right, although I doubt that it will come back to life.

But the point is, when the admin is as novice as a non-admin user in a topic, any stand the admin takes is hazardous. The admin may get disturbed by the new-user's edit and he starts to wield his powers. Even worse, the admin forms a POV and pushes it through. He has the powers. And the total purpose is defeated. Instead of being objective, he may take it personal and very often quotes WIKI rules, blocks as trolls, reports as vandalism etc. to win. Becoming a WIKIPEDIA ADMIN doesn't make anyone an automatic authority on any topic. 
Its highly unfortunate that, people are becoming admins by doing minor edits and staying for longer periods on wikipedia. Once they get the adminship, the power corrupts these people.

There may be many more. Unless the rules for adminship are amended to prevent this hazard, Sensitive articles continue to remain in the stranglehold of eurocentric admins. But sooner or later, that will hopefully happen. Anyway, now that the admin mechanics is quite publicized, you and other admins may expect more protests",0

Malfunctioning archive bot and improper archive page creations?

I do not know why there have been three additional archive pages for my talk page created, none of which is full, since yesterday.  I just saw this comment of Sept. 10, 2008, because someone or something placed it in an archive page (25) that did not exist last night or even early this morning.  I almost didn't see it at all.  Everyone who posts in Wikipedia is a real person; we use log-in identities to protect our privacy and our private identities.  If someone uses his or her real name in Wikipedia, it is published in this version of Wikipedia and all over the internet.  I have no control over others' practices in choosing Wikipedia identities, and I am not aware of anything that I have done that violates WP:AGF, WP:CIVIL, Wikipedia:Etiquette in my comments in either of the AN/I situations.  Although I have continually posted my concerns in good faith, I have been continually set upon as if I have not.  I assure you that since first contributing to Wikipedia as """"NYScholar"""" in June 2005, I have done my best to learn about and to follow Wikipedia's obviously-convoluted and often contradictory editing policies and guidelines, which are frequently edited and changed by those editing Wikipedia, and often vandalized.  I have done my best to contribute to Wikipedia in good faith and yet be forced (demanded) to respond to in my own view entirely-unfounded and false charges that I have not been editing in good faith.  Despite my requests for compassion and understanding because I have other important non-Wikipedia work to do (which have been in the """"N.B."""" above and were only edited out in the past two days in response to Shell's comments about the """"N.B."""" section), I was continually being forced by administrators and others to reply to them in what I increasingly regard as a dysfunctional AN/I based on both misunderstandings and violations of the AN/I instructions by the user who posted it and by the continual references to a previous AN/I by others, including administrators, extending it when it should have been expunged.

If posting new comments, please do so in my current talk page and do not create or add new archive pages.  The bot may be misfunctioning again.  Perhaps the code needs to be checked again.  When I revised the """"N.B."""" at Shell's request (above), I moved down the template.  Perhaps some is wrong again in it now.  I am manually going to move the comments mis-archived into the current talk page if that is where they belong, and I will move what should have been archived (if anything) into archive 22, which is not """"full"""" as it states in my """"contributors"""" history.

 74 persons conspired against the KIng Osiris 

""""The best exoteric account of the legend (of Osiris) is preserved for us by Plutarch in his treatise De Iside et Osiride written in Greek about the middle of the first century of our era, a large portion of which is substantiated by the Egyptian hieroglyphic texts which have been deciphered by scholars. It may be briefly summarized as follows:

Osiris was a wise king in Egypt who set himself to civilize the people and redeem them from their former states of barbarism. He taught them the cultivation of the earth, gave them a body of laws, and instructed them in the worship of the gods. Having made his own land prosperous, he set out in like manner to teach the other nations of the world. During his absence, the land of Egypt was so well ruled by his wife Isis, that his jealous brother Typhon (Set), the personification of evil, as Osiris was the personification of good, could do no harm in his kingdom; but on the return of Osiris to Egypt, Typhon made a conspiracy against him, persuading 72 other persons to join him, together with a certain Queen of Ethiopia named Aso, who chanced to be in Egypt at the time (74 altogether)... Ultimately Osiris became the king of the underworld and the judge of the dead.""""

Also, the straight hair i see in the tropics is like that of most mammals that live in the heat, sort of rough looking, and not smooth and oily like that of Northern Eurasians, or like Penguin feathers or whatever it is on walrusses. The fact is that there are Mountains up and down East Africa (where we originate), in Northern Africa, and in West Africa, whose populations are usually less heavily pigmented than other groups (Ethiopia is familiar) possibly because of the angle of the UV rays (like elsewhere). It's unscientific to speak definitively on an issue all based on subjective posterings, ie, admixture. Further, the article isn't about admixture but what selective factors may be at play here. Unless you're aim is to tell people whose ancestors may have had nappy hair that they formerly had such, which would not be very possible at the moment let alone smooth.

Dear Todd,

I have looked at your history and you seem to be a real Wikipedia editor. The person who is accused of being a sockpuppet of mine is known to me but other than that we have no connection by blood, business or anything else. 

The attack on every contribution I have made (107) pages covering a wide range of topics has been organised by a group called """"Dissident Action Group Exposed"""". Over the years they have distributed smear letters over the internet saying I am a child molester, blow up churches and other such nonsense. Do a yahoo search if you doubt my word.

Also look at the edit history of the two people I named. They both joined within one day of each other (only about 10 days ago) and have made hundreds of contributions since then. ALL ATTACKS ON AIMULTI.

 More on Gay Games VII 

Hi, Kile!  Forgive me for butting in, but I wanted to add an outside perspective...  You and Marc have been discussing some issues that are very tough to deal with in the context of an encyclopedia - and more so in the context of an open encyclopedia that anyone can edit.  You, as the director of the opening ceremonies (among other roles) are probably the best source there is for information on the subject.  But on the other hand, you're only one person, and you're not verifiable - by which I mean, that information is in your head and it isn't possible for anyone else to look it up and corroborate it.  Someone could ask you, but there again, you're only one person.  You can see the difficulties here )

There are a couple references I wanted to point you to that might help clarify the situation.  The first is Wikipedia's policy on Autobiographies - a similar area where the best source of information is the individual themselves.  And to point out how Wikipedia recognizes the issue at the topmost level, the second is the speech at Wikimania 2006 made by Jimmy Wales, the founder of the Wikimedia Foundation.

So those are my outsider's comments - I hope you continue to be a part of Wikipedia, and I hope you'll take a look at Wikisource - putting the speeches you mentioned on that site would be a great asset!

Interestingly enough, as a careful reader understands, I pointed out that the Hohenzollern succession rights are a disputed issue and that scholars are aware of various contingencies of those rights and lineages. Which of course means disagreement between scholars. Charles was good enough to point out that """"at least one of scholars disagrees..."""". I regard that as further proof of (a) the Hohenzollern rights are a disputed issue, (b) scholars are aware of those Hohenzollerns and their putative rights.  Charles however appears to be unable to specify who is the """"one"""" scholar he meant and what precisely was the disagreement.

"RAF and Commonwealth pilots all wore seat-type parachutes which fitted into the standard pilot's bucket seat, whilst the other crew members all wore chest-fitted removable parachutes. The parachute pack clipped-on to the harness at the front (chest) and only needed to be attached immediately before jumping. For confined rear turrets the pack was sometimes stored outside the turret in the fuselage, the gunner only needing to reach behind him to open the two rear doors of the turret and reach into the fuselage. Where the tail gunner stowed his parachute depended on personal preference and to some extent, on his physical size.

The internal dimensions of the Lancaster and its turrets was somewhat wanting in terms of space, as when the basic aircraft had been designed (as the Manchester) the normal flying clothing was limited to perhaps a Sidcot suit and a parachute. With the increasing later use of such apparel as Irvin jackets and Mae Wests and other impedimenta the average crew member became a much bulkier figure, leading to difficulties in exiting the aircraft in an emergency, the dimensions of the escape hatches remaining unchanged. This possibly accounts for the higher crew losses for the Lancaster compared to the Halifax, which was also much roomier inside.",0

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of: 1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality). 2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree. 3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs. 4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on. 5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times. 6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

"""=Where the analogy holds===

In Canadian law, a secure electronic signature can be used (most) everywhere a notarized signature or Minister's signature is required. In other words, this specific form of electronic signature is considered as strong as the strongest form of """"ink-and-paper"""" signature. (The PIPEDA S-E-S regulations can only be satisfied with digital signatures.)

Why do we care? Because there are places where the analogy isn't an analogy, it's a homology: Present a notarized signature on a paper document and a secure electronic signature on the homologous electronic document to a Canadian judge and the judge will likely conclude that for legal purposes they are they same signatures and the same documents. Neither has any greater or lesser standing that the other.

And this needs to be borne in mind when this page is rewritten, especially when the section on legality is rewritten.

Think of it this way: For anyone other than an autograph hound, a signature is of interest for its legal value. Ultimately, the same is true of digital signatures. The technology may be interesting, but, ultimately, the reason we want to get the technology (and procedures and policy) right is so that these things stand up in a court of law.

Perhaps the page needs to be broken into two overall sections: Technology (just the facts) and legality (with no overall content but references to various jurisdictions.

Alternatively, remove any subjective or legal content, and make reference to appropriate pages.

For example, repudiation is not a fact, it is a legal matter.

In 1982, he joined Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle as the Director of Marketing. After a business trip to Milan, Italy, he tried to get ownership (including Gerry Baldwin) to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas and spices they had long offered. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, the owners refused to roll it out company-wide and Howard Schultz started his own coffee shop named Il Giornale in 1985. Two years later, the original Starbucks management were forced to focus on Peet's Coffee & Tea because of bullying and harrassment and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale. The former owners do not speak favorably of Schultz in interviews to this day.

Schultz renamed Il Giornale with the Starbucks name and aggressively expanded Starbucks' reach across the United States. It can be said that Starbucks popularized espresso drinks such as the cafe latte to many Americans who had previously only ever tasted freeze dried coffee.They later acquired HEAR music and formed Concord Management Group in an attempt at music management and distribution using Starbucks stores. Schultz also became a board member on Dreamworks, trying to establish film output.He began his obsession with Angelina Jolie when she was at a very young age and saw to it that she rose to the celebrity status in her career. It is rumored that the success of the Ray Charles cd fueled Schultz' ambition to murder Charles in an attempt to secure the success of the film. Over the years, he is linked to the deaths of other actors such as Heath Ledger, Anna Nicole Smith, Tupac Shakur, and Notorious BIG. Unfortunately, he is affiliated with a secret group called *Velvet Mafia* in Hollywood. They are rumored to be gay, be responsible for removing Michael Ovitz from his CAA post with a huge power move and stalks young women and men for years to get ideas for their projects. Other members includes David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenburg, Calvin Klein, Tom Ford, and Michael Eisner amongst some others. This has earned him a bad reputation within the Hollywood community. His latest effort to bring his company back on track, he has unaffiliated himself from Concord Management and Dreamworks. However, Starbucks employees have been neglected, mistreated, stalked, harrassed, smeared and defamed under Schultz's management and have repeatedly plagued the company with multi million dollar lawsuits and won. The latest smear attempt came when a 16 year old barista was sexually harrassed by Starbucks management in Irvine, California. In his recent Portfolio magazine in July 2008, he responded to his employees calling him a *psychopath* by suggesting that they should just listen to what the leader of their company tells them. Schultz didn't believe in franchising. Because of this Starbucks owns every domestic outlet with one exception. Schultz went 50-50 with Magic Johnson on stores in minority communities. Others believe the reason why he doesn't franchise I'd because he would like to have access to the video recordings of his employees for private use.

Schultz co-authored a book called Pour Your Heart into It that expounds on his life journey with Starbucks. In his book Schultz admits that he was afraid that """"Starbucks may become another souless big chain."""" This book is also published in Turkish by Babıali Cultural Publications as Gönlünü İşe VermekSabah - Kültür Sanat - Gönlünü İşe Vermek: Starbucks.

Schultz is also the former owner of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. On July 17,2006, it was announced that Schultz sold the team to a group of businessmen from Oklahoma City for $350 million. It was speculated that the new owners would move the team to Oklahoma City some time after the 2006-2007 NBA season.seattletimes.nwsource.com. URL last accessed July 18, 2006. On July 3, 2008, the City of Seattle reached a settlement with the new ownership group and the Sonics did, in fact, move to Oklahoma City.

"Combined Anatolian-Kurgan hypothesis 

I now think that the Proto-Indo-Europeans lived in present-day Turkey.  Yet the Kurgan culture does play an important role in the evolution of Indo-European languages.  I think it was founded by Indo-Europeans which immigrated to the Pontic steppe.  The ones which did not leave were cultural ancestors of the speakers of Anatolian languages.  The language of the Kurgan culture gave rise to all other Indo-European languages.  These include all the ones spoken today.

There were several early splinter groups from the Kurgan culture.  Three of these were the cultural ancestors of the Armenians, Greeks and Albanians.  There may have been more but the languages descended from theirs are so poorly documented we don’t know much of them.

A larger splinter group from Kurgan culture was the Beaker people.  This metalworking pastoral people spread over much of Europe.  The areas were they settled includes almost all of West-Central Europe, the Italian and Iberian Peninsulas, the large islands between them, the British Islands, Southern Scandinavia and probably parts of Eastern Europe north of the grasslands.  With such a widespread culture they soon developed several different languages.  These were ancestral of the Baltic, Slavic, Germanic, Celtic and Italic (including Romatic) ones.

The Kurgan people themselves developed into the Proto-Indo-Iranians, many of which returned to the Middle East.  With the Aryan migration to northern India the Indo-Aryan languages eventually splintered from the Iraniac ones.  This happened not long before these two peoples started to write as Avestan and Vedic are relatively similar.

What do you think about this hypothesis?  No “the Urheimat must be my country because we are the most superior/unique/original” argument, please!  No people in the world are intrinsically superior to any other ones.  It is questionable if any people are “uniquely unique”.  The most original of the living Indo-European languages is probably Lithuanian.  Yet no-one who is not a Lithuanian have seriously suggested the Indo-European Urheimat to be in Lithuania.

  is correct as regards changing one's name.  As per the reference he supplied, in the Republic of Ireland, all that is necessary is that one begins using the new name, and that it not be done for fraudulent purposes.  Doing so is extremely common - how many thousands of women, for example, take their husband's surname on marriage without getting their name changed by deed poll?  Changing one's name in this way is an entirely different thing from having one's Registration of Birth amended, where specific statutes apply.  From the GRO's website: """"Changes to the Register of Births are almost impossible to effect and generally are only done if it can be proved that a clerical or factual error was made at the time of registration.""""  So one can change one's name in common usage from, e.g., George to Jack, but George would remain on the Register of Births, unless you also changed it by deed poll.  My understanding on the case of the transsexual who wanted to have her birth registration amended was that she wanted the gender changed (though I'm open to correction on this).

""""I think we probably share the view that the 'energy comparison' section is poorly written and sourced."""" - we can agree on that, but i would make the point that we should make the best of what we have until better information/models become available.

""""my problem with the AGA document is that it's very misleading and should not be included for that reason""""  - my answer is that the document does not really contain errors but contains some spin as you would expect from the manufacture however the spin is obvious and most people would be able to extract useful information from it despite its flaws. I would argue that reference 3 is also misleading as the data models presented there are to simplistic and will mislead people so using you own argument if you exclude reference 5 then you should also exclude reference 3. Energy models are inherently complex beasts and very simple representations such as 3 contribute nothing but confusion to the debate.

""""Your complaint about a supposed 'Green rant' indicates that you do not have a neutral view"""" - you are reading to much into that comment. Its a response to the fact that the media that I read seems to be full of half baked green ideas which don't add up either from a technical or a mathematical point of view. As a trained engineer I am only interested in arguments that make sense from a technical view not fantasy land arguments that seem to require 1+1 to = something other than 2!

If you read the comment is fee website where Monobiot writes you will see something like 5 to 7 pages of comment on his article almost all critical about his article. The most common one was that he was not comparing like with like. Monobiot makes a lot of interesting points ( I have just read his book HEAT) but when it comes to technical details he is out of his depth and frequently gets things wrong. Read the site for more detail.  

""""But do you not see the difference between marketing spin by AGA, and reliable, referenced data?"""" - yes of course - so provide some - I dont think this article cirrently contain any. It contains information but i dont think is very good information. 

""""For example, you have plucked a figure of 30 years out of somewhere"""" its either in that article or another one on the AGA or Rayburn web sites. When considering some of the costs you have to remember that AGA last a very long time 
so costs and gains have to be considered over a longer time scale than you would for a cheap chinese electric oven which would have to be replaced 3-4 times over the same period.

""""conventional ovens is worse than dismal"""" - I don't agree that that has been proven, the indications are that it is not very good in some circumstances but i think that dismal is to hard a term and yet to be proven. You cant consider thenal devices such as a AGA without considering how they are used. For instance consider 2 AGA , a 2 oven model in a single person household and a 4 Oven model in a nursing home. The first would be a disaster preparing maby only one hot meal a day, while the other would be on the go 24x7x365. Both are AGA, the first setup would be crazy, the second is a market that actually buys large numbers of AGA and they are commercial institutions for the most part, they are run by hard nosed managers and yet they buy tons of AGA why is that if they are as bad as you say? What do you know that all these hard nosed money pinchers don't? I suspect that answering the question for the AGA is very much more than straight KwH

BYW I dont have an AGA or expect to ever own one - I am interested in engineering soultions to global warming ( real solutions not 10:10 stuff) but i dont understand why this whole """"lets bash teh AGA"""" thing that seems to be going on at the moment is coming from?

"XENODONTLIKEIT 

Typically, when Xenophrenic sees a valid edit (by wiki policy) that he disapproves of (for whatever reason), he seeks to get others to remove it. This strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance, or needs the proper context, or isn't the full story, etc. There are many different reasons used, but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense ( > 2 to 1 ratio in his POV) that average editors cringe when they see it. Xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced POV version can ONLY stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper balance. This leads to edit warring over days and even weeks, articles often get locked down. Some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article. Xenophrenic gets what he wanted all along, and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring. Some call this tactic a form of wiki-terrorism, I say it shows that Xenophrenic is quite calculated and intelligent (not a terrorist), even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions.",0

"""I've heard it said that Charles Darwin did not want to publish his ideas because he felt it would hurt his wife, whom he loved.  She was not an evolutionist.

That could be part of the answer. At least, so much can be read in Darwin's original autobiography, which was first published in 1887, esp. in footnotes in the chapter about the development of his own religious convictions. Another reason (also clear from his ab) might be his frequent illnesses, and his zealous drive to publish as much as possible about other biological/zoological fields of research. He was always frustrated he could not do more.Fact is he produced an enormous amount of work!.
A third reason Darwin waited 19 years was that he simply was afraid of being 'prejudiced' (word quoted literally). His theory needed more time to ripen, so to speak. Anyway, maybe this is of some help. Anyone with more knowledge about it,please go ahead.

Imho the first sentence """"Contrary ..."""" should only appear later. One who does not know anything about Darwin reading this page should have a short introduction as first paragraph, not a negation of something assumed to """"be publicly known"""". (Yes, I am picky ;)

The paragraph with the three questions was just very recently flagged for citation, which according to a strict reading of WP:V allows for its removal, at least lacking a consensus override of its removal. After initially resisting, I support its removal. ..... The section flows rationally and informatively, and in keeping with WP's core content policies, either with or without that paragraph. ...

""":Both in current numbers (24%) and in historical context, Roman Catholics are a minority religion in America. Even among Christian """"believers"""", the ratio is more than two to one in favor of Protestants. This is no suprise: of the 13 colonies, only one had a significant Catholic presence (Maryland). Today, of the 24% Catholics, most (about 12-14% of the country) are now Catholic hispanics, mostly in California, Texas, and Florida (probably more, with undocumented Mexicans). The remainder are mostly Irish and Italian Catholics, in the Northeastern cities. Likewise most Protestants in the country are segregated, and live in the South and Midwest. There is a religious segregation in the country that muddies the appreciation of the """"other"""". Of the Protestant/Reformation movement, most are mainline or evangelical/born again/fundamentalist churches. Orthodox are not a Reformation faith, but Mormans and Pentacostals probably trace origins through the chaotic, developing Reformation movement. Of the 20% not now calling themselves Christian, most are agnostic (probably with mostly Protestant roots), but some are Muslim, Jewish, or have Asian-rooted faiths. The main things apparently affecting religious population size are: Mexican immigration (Catholic), mainline Protestant church attendance and birthrate (declining), conservative Protestant activism (increasing), intermarriage (tending toward dominant faith of partners or agnosticism, ergo all """"conservative"""" churches, born-agains, opus dei, othodox jewry increasing). In sum, Roman Catholics may be a plurality denomination (24%) compared to next largest (Baptists), but a Christian faith/movement smaller in size by half than the Protestant/Reformation movement, and again, in historical context in America, not a surprise. -2 November 2005

Note also that that section and Wikipedia:Stand-alone lists#Lead and selection criteria both link to WP:LEAD, as does WP:FL?#2, which says:he lead section should briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it can stand on its own as a concise version of the article. It is even more important here than for the rest of the article that the text be accessible. Consideration should be given to creating interest in reading the whole article.In general, specialized terminology should be avoided in an introduction. Where uncommon terms are essential to describing the subject, they should be placed in context, briefly defined, and linked. The subject should be placed in a context with which many readers could be expected to be familiar. For example, rather than giving the latitude and longitude of a town, it is better to state that it is the suburb of some city, or perhaps that it provides services for the farm country of xyz county. Readers should not be dropped into the middle of the subject from the first word; they should be eased into it. It doesn't matter which List guideline you look at, they all refer back to WP:LEAD.

Fair use rationale for Image:Soyyocdcover.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Soyyocdcover.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

Look here - the admin closed as not abusive enough - what is it I did?

(Ignoring WP:NNC) I believe this breaches WP:CIVIL - when I indicated the editor should read WP:CIVIL they replied 'I did once, and I vowed never to read it again' 4.It is breathtaking the way some editors feel policies don't apply to them. I was not rude to the editor, but I was treated in a condescending and arrogant manner over a very minor matter

The user then preceded to launch a very abusive and malicious attack on me. He linked my 710 contributions [166] and entirely falsely wrote 'Not so ridiculous when you look at his contributions which seem to be all geared around the May elections. This user seems to be on a campaign trial on behalf of UKIP'. This is called blatantly misleading other editors, surely in violation of policies such as WP:AGF, WP:BITE, WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA. I have nothing to do with UKIP. I am not a member of any political party. I am not enrolled to vote in the United Kingdom. So these are ludicrous allegations. I have created 21 pages, 16 non-related to the elections. Articles I have created such as Endorsements in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 are very important and been widely edited and viewed. I have also created articles such as United Kingdom general election, 2015 (Wales) in accordance with precedent. I have worked hard on the project for good and in good faith. Examples: List of European Union member states by GDP growth and Mr Galloway Goes to Washington. I have successfully nominated dozens of articles for speedy deletion. As a new editor, I am deeply upset by how hard it is to edit this site without abuse and being treated like a moron (WP:BITE).

Nothing at WP:SPA points to me. 5.The editor has breached multiple policies.

Editor still going. He has written now 'What makes you think I give a fuck about your political leanings?' (despite questioning them) and removed the ANI notification remarking 'what a waste of time'. What is the point of WP:CIVIL, WP:AGF, WP:NPA, WP:BITE?

What did I say that was uncivil? Mellowed Fillmore said 'It is my view that AusLondonder is clearly not here to build an encyclopedia. He is likely to remain a problematic editor and I'm not sure that any more patience needs to be shown' - yet I have created 27 pages  including Endorsements in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 and List of European Union member states by GDP growth. How can they possibly say that with your agreement?

Which editor would put the article for deletion just to improve the article. if they want to improve the could talk on talk page but there they just justify their deletions and advice me to stay out giving reference to various policies of Wikipedia. i know i have a lot to learn but i am trying to but here they are just putting on an act to delete the article. 

All this is happening because of some pov of Ftutocdg regarding Khuzaima Qutbuddin.

Hi Bishonen, 

Actually, the """"wink-wink, you know exactly what I'm talking about"""" was directed to Jossi, not you.  My questions to you were about the other quotes of Rawats.  I'm very discouraged to hear you say that you find them too ambiguous to know just who he was talking about.  He was Guru Maharaj Ji.  He was the Perfect Master.  He Was God incarnated, Saviour of Mankind and so on.  In fact, Jossi still thinks he's all of that.  If you would please spend just a little time reading the section of EPO or the Gallery of quotes I linked you to earlier, you'd see this in spades.

Anyway, Jossi is a liar through and through.  He knows full well that Rawat was referring to himself. I mean, really, who else do you think he might have been talking about?

"New Criticism Redux 

Dear Moni3 – 
I think you’re on to something when you wrote, “…New Criticism should be represented with emphasis appropriate to how much information exists.”
The impact of the New Critics is still felt today; even Wolff’s analysis is influenced by it. H. Bruce Franklin wrote:

“The hallmark of New Critical methodologyintricately detailed and nuanced readings of textswas actually a corollary of these texts deemed worthy of study, texts filled with elaborate ambiguities and ironies, texts therefore not easily accessible to common readers.” Go read Wolff; you’ll see.

Providing a section on Second Wave feminist “critique” and the New Critics is a balanced - and informative – approach. Both should be expanded prudently; I’ve initiated that project. 

Undue Weight (WP:UNDUE )?  If you take the trouble to read the section, you’ll see it’s related to arguments about, say, “global warming”, where 99.9% of scientists recognize the human causes, and 0.1% do not. Providing equal space for the latter is an example of “undue weight.”  Applying it to a section on the New Criticism is a red herring.

As the Untruthkeeper/Maria opined, “everything in moderation”; except a proprietary approach to editing and a “Dog in the Manger” attitude towards new contributors. 

Oh, by the way, the material that was dumped in the New Criticism was done so without including the reference; rather slipshod, I’d say. Scamper over there and take care of that “edit”, won’t you, Maria? Mysweetoldetc.",0

 I see a bit of confusion here, and it seems to be caused by semantics.  People can argue forever over whether the transistor is """"voltage controlled"""" or """"current controlled.""""  And each side means something different by that.  And each side is trying to win an argument, not trying to clarify matters.  (They already know the truth.  In any religious battle, the first rule is to never question the viewpoint you're defending.)

 Instead, what if we ask a different question:  how do transistors work?

 In explaining the transistor effect, if we drill down through various ideas, we find a central concept:  when the base terminal injects charged particles into the base region, there is no way for the motion of those particles to influence the other charged particles being sent out by the emitter.  There is no mechanism by which the base charge-flow can directly affect the emitter's charge-flow.   Yet if we inject a tiny base current, we obtain a huge emitter current!  The hfe parameter is no illusion.  Base current obviously does control emitter current.  How?  It's because any change in Ib absolutely requires a change in Vbe... and Ie is determined by Vbe because Vbe determines the thickness of the depletion layer.   Base current can control emitter current through a multi-step process involving Vbe and the depletion layer.  Charged particles injected by the base do in fact influence the charged particles sent out by the emitter.  They just can't do it directly.

 So is a transistor controlled by current?  Yes, if by """"controlled,"""" we mean that the emitter current can be changed by changing the base current.  Is it """"controlled"""" by voltage?  Yes, if by """"controlled"""" we mean that the emitter current can be changed by changing the value of Vbe.  And those people who choose one side or the other can fight forever about the """"right answer.""""  They'll almost come to blows over the One True Path to transistor enlightenment, since their own viewpoint is obviously good and true and right, while the opposing side are all a bunch of worshippers of Darkness and Confusion whose blasphemy must be ridiculed.  After all, young students could be misled from the One True Path!  Think of the children!  )

 On the other hand, it's hard to become a victim of either meme if you laugh at religious wars.  But that's a very difficult habit to develop.  Instead, it's easier to become a devout """"Current Believer"""" at the start.  But then the mental grip of that meme is shattered by encountering the competition.  So you become an outspoken """"Voltage Worshipper.""""  With luck you'll eventually be immunized against both, yet accept both.  The """"Transistor Zen"""" practitioner is free to view BJTs from both viewpoints, switching back and forth as needed, while seeing the duality as an illusion and rejecting the notion that a single best answer can exist.

I haven't read the whole thing at one sitting for a long time, so I'm not sure of that. The first paragraph is very confusing on the identity of the designer, which should not even be brought up there. (ID proponents, though, are themselves two-faced about this point.) This subject is very contentious and I despair of ever seeing a fully objective article. When I'm in Wiki-land, I do as the Wikipedians doadhere to the 5 pillars.
Also, I hope you've caught on that the specific variety of intelligent design of which this particular article treats is the ID of the Discovery Institute and its affiliates and sympathizers. (Can't think of a better word than sympathizerfollower, maybe; those who agree with and may promote the idea without actually being affiliated. The community church on the corner, for example.) That means everything will focus on the Johnson/Dembski/Behe/et al axis.

One of the reasons for this, among others, is that interrogational astrology (ie. horary) was not developed until the 2nd and 3rd centuries and this development occurred in India within the Hindu tradition. (See Pingree, 1996, pg. 21)  Horary was not a part of the mainstream tradition of Hellenistic astrology from which Ptolemy and his contemporaries were drawing on, and it did not become integrated into the western tradition of horoscopic astrology until the Middle Ages when the various Arab and Persian astrologers undertook a synthesis of the Indian, Persian and Hellenistic traditions.

 Fred Meyer: Reversion 

I was asked to explain my reversion of your addition to the Fred Meyer article. That addition was composed of four parts. 
First, you claimed Fred G. Meyer to be a member of the Rosicrucian Order etc., providing sources. I won't discuss the validity of the sources here, but that clearly concerns Fred G. Meyer himself, not the stores, unless you can provide a source that states his business was influenced by his philosophical leanings. 
Next, you elaborated on the rosicrucian connection to Hitler. As far as I can see, the main connection to Fred Meyer was that both Nazism and the stores use the colours red, white and black, which is a rather weak link. No source was provided that the store logo may have been influenced by its Founder's rosicrucian connections. Hitler's connection to the rosicrucians was sourced (again I won't discuss the quality of the sources), but was unrelated to the stores. 
Thirdly, you claimed that the layout of racks gives a swastika and that green freight carts are nicknamed """"U-Boats"""", but this, the part most relevant for the stores, was still unsourced. 
Finally, the """"Notes"""" part could have been more fitting for the talk page, but definitely does not belong into the article proper.
Thus, your additions were either unrelated to the stores or unsourced. By the way, the version where you described your addition as """"your research"""" shows another problem: Even if it is true, original research is in principle unsuited for Wikipedia.

If you find any others that I've uploaded, it's not necessary to post anything on my talk page.  I understand what you're saying, although I disagree with one part of it regarding film publicity photos, which were mass-distributed, sometimes without registering for copyright.  We don't know which are free and which are not, so it's not something that can be pursued, and I wouldn't try to claim any specific image falls into that group.     I still see problems with the Blondie image.   For one, it doesn't show anything vital that the article couldn't do without.  They're all living people, one of whom isn't even notable enough for a Wikipedia article, and they're not doing anything.   It only shows what they look like.   If it was a significant moment and if the photo showed them doing something that could not be adequately described in prose,  I could understand.  Regardless of what brought them together, the photo itself gives nothing except to show what they look like.   Given the degree of thought you've given to the actress photos, I don't understand why you accept a fair rationale saying """"they cannot be brought together because they live in three separate areas of the U.S."""" which is a false statement, contradicted by common sense - there are numerous ways they could be brought together - and by the very existence of the photo.  I'd accept a rationale that justified its use, but not that.  Still, you said you may even nominate it for deletion someday, but that it's not a priority, so you're obviously not completely convinced.

- """"Two activists managed to attach themselves to the platform and attempted to climb despite being blasted with water, whilst another activist was unable to attach themself to the platform."""" Aside from the poor style, the poor construction, and the awkward attempt to make it gender neutral, it reads like the person that wrote the sentence wants the reader to cheer for the GP activists. What does it mean """"to attach oneself to a platform""""? 
- """"Russian authorities forcibly took control of the Arctic Sunrise, which was boarded from a helicopter by fifteen Federal Security Service officers in balaclavas, armed with guns and knives."""" Is it unusual that the Federal Service would wear balaclavas or arm themselves with guns and knives? Given the task that they were performing, such a uniform seems routine.
- """"At the time of the boarding, the Arctic Sunrise was in Russia's EEZ but not within the safety zone around the oil rig, and permission was not sought to board it from the Arctic Sunrise's flag state, the Netherlands."""" Does Russia need permission from NL to board a ship that is clearly dedicated to enabling activists to trespass on a Russian oil rig? It's implied. If it's true, it should be noted. If not, it should be removed. 
- """"It is alleged that crew members and activists were punched and kicked during the forced boarding."""" Alleged by whom? Why were they punched and kicked? Were the guards using more than the necessary amount of force to subdue non-cooperative and/or combative arrestees? 
- The use of the monicker """"Arctic 30"""" implies a sympathetic viewpoint. Just because certain media have used the term, doesn't mean that WP should also. Just because certain media organizations are sympathetic doesn't mean WP should be also. It becomes a biased article when it uses such monickers that are intended to create sympathy for those arrested. 
- Nearly the entire """"Responses"""" section is irrelevant except for the responses and requests from the Gov't of NL. Seriously, does anyone really consider it WP worthy that a reporter wrote something on Facebook?
- The """"Greenpeace Announcements"""" section seems like a thinly veiled medium for advocating GP's position. Perhaps a """"Russian Government Announcements"""" would balance the article a bit, but the idea of such a section seems silly.

No, it wouldn't look the same because I would personally revert anything that was unsourced fancruft/speculation before it got a chance to get in and weave itself into the article.

Problems with the article
Apparently this is a very loose term used to distinguish people who have acquired some kind of long term fame or notoriety associated with popular culture.  Hendrix, The Beatles, Elvis, Sinatra, Crosby, Jolson, and so on might be described as """"pop icons"""" because they are strongly associated with, and in some ways personify, the zeitgeist or an era in popular culture.  This includes film and other popular art forms, and sport (De Niro, Monroe, Bogart, Muhammad Ali, Pelé).   It often includes people who died relatively young (Morrison, Hendrix, James Dean).  So far so good.

Then there are people whose work wasn't primarily in or related to popular culture, but whose image has been co-opted as a pop icon (Einstein).  Well, okay.

Now looking at the article, we see a section called """"Notable pop icons"""" comprising, presently, some forty names.  More than half of those names are sourced from a single news story based on a press release produced by a single media organisation in November, 2003. A further seven of them are base on a similar news story from a different media organisation in 2005  The criterion for the list of 100 members given in the first news story, it turns out, is a viewer's poll by a single cable television channel, VH1, from a shortlist drawn up by """"A panel of celebrities and experts – including presenter June Sarpong, newsreader Krishnan Guru-Murthy and GQ editor Dylan Jones.""""  Presumably the experts on the panel asked to remain anonymous.

Further examination of that single source also demonstrates that there are unexplained omissions from our list.  If we assume for the moment that membership of the VH1 list (which is biased towards the tastes and cultural memory of the British viewership of that channel) is a sign of """"pop icon"""" status, where is Princess Diana on our list?  She's number 5 on the VH1 list but completely absent from ours.  Similarly, The Simpsons (VH1: number 6) and Robbie Williams (VH1: number 9) are omitted from our list.

Looking in the opposite direction, Aerosmith is included in our list because MTV  featured the band in a program called """"MTV icons"""", but is nowhere to be seen in the VH1 100 (not surprising as the band, while not unknown in VH1's target market, isn't exactly a household name).  And while VH1 lists first man on the moon Neil Armstrong at 76, his trumpet-playing namesake Louis Armstrong (selected as one of 100 """"Icons of the Century"""" by Variety) is nowhere to be seen on VH1's chart.

There are also problems with the membership criteria of the sources.  I've already mentioned the UK bias of the VH1 list (which goes some way to explain the presence of Beckham and Robbie Williams, both household names in the UK but not so well known elsewhere). The Variety list, for  instance, sought to represent """"every side of show business"""", so relatively obscure figures such as Arthur Freed (who wrote the lyrics for Singin' in the Rain and produced many hit films) are listed as """"Icons of the Century"""".  Clearly the people on the list are there because they're """"iconic"""" in some sense, but not in the sense implied by this article.

Another thing that isn't addressed is the requirement of longevity.  Can we include Britney Spears, who a mere decade ago was an unknown with a recording contract and an audacious concept for a pop video for her debut single? Britney Spears' career has hit an air pocket, and there's no way of knowing whether her image will recover in the public mind.  Perhaps it's premature to describe this relative newcomer as a """"pop icon"""".""",0

 charge of unethical conduct 
Jc37, at my talk page you wrote:
 ...Concerning ongoing disruption regarding the DRV of Erdros numbers. If you continue to disrupt Wikipedia, you may be blocked until the DRV discussion is closed. -  ...
I take it that your opinion is that I am (to some significant extent) disrupting Wikipedia. These points:

 Does the ongoing ANI (I haven't checked it yet) regarding canvassing, pertain? My sense is that the accusation there was satisfactorily answered, particularly by the opposing voters I was suppposed not to have notified. Will you be bringing a new ANI if I continue some particular activity (I'm not sure which, specifically), or will you block me summarily?
 I would appreciate it if you would point to specifics of what constitutes my """"ongoing disruption"""".
 I take it that you do not consider the subjects of my initial complaint (unilaterally overturning a conspicuous consensus) or the consequent rhetoric (persistant and repetitive spamming of """"reasons"""" which had all been addressed, persistant arguement ad hominem, and several insinuations that our responses are unethical or misleading, while the opposing rhetoric is self-evident) to be disruptive? Part of my defense to any accusation of campaigning would be to compile examples of the techniques of the opposition, so at least we could delineate what wiki considers unethical.

He deleted everything I added within minutes, did not leave room for discussion, ignored my Talk page discussion, removed all of my POV templates, did not wait for other editors to take part.  In particular, he removed my 1 sentence 1 source (Outside Magazine) addition to the article, and cited only personal reasons, rather than objective reasons, which is why I did the POV templates.  The reason for blocking me was that I stated he committed """"Vandalism"""".  I stated """"potential Vandalism"""".  I'm new to wikipedia and it seemed he was unilaterally vandalizing a perfectly good 1 sentence and 1 national magazine article.  Seems MONGO was edit warring.  Could you review my simple addition to the article, and review whether he was committing vandalism, etc?  Seems no one is assessing his conduct, and is placing all blame on me.

Thank you for having a look over the article, and your comments, however I have a few questions:
I've expanded the lead, but I'm still not 100% sure about it, could you possibly have a look and give me a couple of pointers?
I think i've addressed all of your ambiguity concerns (founding date, cricket, etc), but I wasn't quite sure which figures/dates you were talking about which weren't referenced? I had a look through and all I could find unreferenced were the number of students at the school, which is now fixed, its probably just me being dense.
I've cut out most of the links from the see also, but I'm thinking of just getting rid of the whole section, your thoughts on that?

Thanks.   [Talk]",0

"I think all Wikipedia Nobel Prize lists must be augmented by this crucial  information. This will also put in perspective the recent inflation of Nobel laureates in the sciences, which is easy to explain: most of the recent laureates had to share the prize while most of the early laureates got a full prize.  The lists of laureates by university or by country must take this into account as well. For example, Glauber (US), Hall (US) and Hänsch (Germany) shared the physics prize of 2005. But we cannot simply add 2.00 points to the US count and 1.0 to the German count. Instead we have to add 0.75 to the US count and 0.25 to the German count (Hänsch and Hall each got only 0.25 of the prize, Glauber got 0.5). Otherwise we'd violate the Nobel Prize conservation law:  The sum of the Nobel Prizes per year is constant; you may divide it among many laureates, but then the laureates necessarily become less outstanding on average.",0

 Article About Sizzla You Can Use 

Babylon has set up a system designed to keep black people enslaved and ashamed of their culture. The system is so structured that the only way for black people, is to look to the east and seek repatriation to the continent of their origin guided by the Trinity of Haile Selassie, Marcus Garvey and Immanuel and thier teachings.

 This is the message of Sizzla and it influences his music to the extent that he is being looked upon as the teacher and the inspiration for Jamaican youths who want to retain the basic culture of their African origins.

Sizzla's songs speak to poverty and hopelessness that pervades young Jamaica and obviously oppressed youths worldwide. Like Bob Marley, a couple of generations before him, he delivers a message which speaks to poverty, homelessness, police brutality, cultural pride and political and religious oppression.

        Born Miguel Collins,  Sizzla is a product of one of Jamaica's uptown ghettos, August Town.

        One of his earliest experiences of how unfair the social system is in Jamaica, was while he was in his mid-teens. In order to get into a Technical High School so he could learn a trade and have a better chance of earning a living, he had to leave High School , go back to pre-high and then apply to get into a High School which taught trades- Dunoon High School, where he studied Mechanical Engineering.

        Dunoon has a reputation of association with some of the best dancehall deejays from the city, including Shabba Ranks and Lady G. So with an inner inclination towards music, it wasn't surprising that while there, he started recording music.

        It was Homer Harris, the same man who gave Buju Banton his first break, who introduced him to top Jamaican saxophonist, Dean Frazier, (Musical Director for Philip """"Fattis"""" Burrell's Xterminator Family).

        """"Fatis"""" was delighted with his potential, decided to record him.

Sizzla, who had originally planned to follow in the footsteps of his mechanic father Aston, suddenly had a change of heart. He abandoned his mechanic training, came under the influence of Buju Banton and Shabba Ranks' cassettes and decided to stick to music.

        The auto industry loss was a tremendous gain for the music industry in Jamaica and indeed around the world.

        Since the start of 1997, Sizzla's popularity within the music industry has grown so rapidly, he is considered a musical phenomenon. His tunes fill the charts and sales have been so trmrndous that every reggae producer wished he had a Sizzla song to release and every sound system wants a Sizzla dubplate to be current.

        Touring with the Xterminator Family and star perfomer Luciano, has gained for him, tremendous experience and exposure and now Sizzla is about to move up the ranks and make his name as a musical prophet and messenger, in his own right""",0

The Ottoman census reflects only the religuious adherence of the population and nothing else

Exactly. So what makes you think that using religion as the primary criterion of nationality is not the closest thing to the truth? Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't, but neither you nor me are in position to decide that. This is why in my version all criteria used in the demographies are explained in detail, without deciding which is right and which is wrong, and that my friend is what we call neutrality. You might as well try and take a hint. Nothing from the Turkish cencus proves nor implies that those Greeks were not Greek speaking. The majority of Bulgarian population had never been adherent to the Patriarch of Constantinople. You're confusing yourself with the small Bulgarian or Slavic-speaking population which viewed itself as part of the Roman nation which had lost its mother tongue over time. Therefore despite religion and language, the greater part of the population of Southern Macedonia viewed itself as Greek (or Roman if you prefer). Then if we can't trust any demography, think of the population exchanges. 50,000 Greeks entered Greek Macedonia from Pirin Macedonia, and some 60,000 Bulgarians left for Bulgaria. Then some 500,000 Greeks enter from Turkey and suddenly, we have some 1 million Greeks in Greek Macedonia? Where did the other half million come from? Mars? Oh, I know, it's a Bulgarian """"majority"""" group that the Greek government is still hiding isn't that so? And now think of the ludicrous numbers that you're trying to pass as the truth: 2 million Bulgars in the entire of Macedonia and the assumption of another million in the south. I mean, use your brain for ones and do the maths - have you ever checked what the population of Bulgaria is today? Honestly some people just can't take the truth. And if neither of that convinces you then think of the Greco-Serbian alliance. Would the Serbs have ever agreed with Greece occupying over half of Macedonia for itself unless that land was not primarily Greek? Serbia was significantly stronger than Greece and in the search of Slavic-speaking lands to assimilate. It would have never happened. If you really want to do something to help your country, I would advise you to go over there and offer your people some physical help. I don't think that making nationalist propaganda of the internet is one of their priorities at the moment.

You recently archived part of the page, which is fine, of course. I told you at that time that I planned to clear the whole page, as I do from time to time.

Moneybomb (money bomb, money-bomb, fundraising bomb, Fawkes bomb) is a neologism used to describe a grassroots effort to support a candidate for election by dramatically increasing and concentrating the candidate's fundraising activity during a specific hour or day. The effort combines traditional and Internet-based fundraising appeals with the additional benefits of community organization and potential significant free mass media coverage reporting the candidate's notable success, if any.
The term was used as early as 2004, but came to prominence in Fall 2007 in reference to the 2008 Ron Paul presidential campaign in the United States, with its record-breaking fundraiser of November 5. The term has also been applied to other 2008 presidential candidates.

Origin
According to The Politico, the term was coined in 2007. The chosen fundraiser date for the Paul campaign in 2007 was November 5th, Guy Fawkes Day. This commemorated a time in 1605 when the English revolutionary Guy Fawkes was captured in an attempt to destroy the British Parliament building with 36 barrels of gunpowder. The Guy Fawkes event had also been popularized by a 2006 film, V for Vendetta, which depicted a modern-day fascist Parliament, overpowered by popular revolution that was led by """"V"""", a Fawkes-like character.

The 2007 moneybomb was the largest documented one-day online fundraiser in political history, bringing in over $4 million. On November 6, Ron Paul's campaign stated that in addition, the free media coverage after the event was worth well over $10 million.

The imagery of Guy Fawkes and its redefinition in the film V for Vendetta has been challenged, since Parliament in 1605 was a constitutional system, but in the 2006 film it had become the symbol of misguided government, so the picture of rejecting such a government was ambiguous. Paul's campaign spokesman Jesse Benton clarified to the New York Times that Paul does not support blowing up government buildings: """"He wants to demolish things like the Department of Education . . . but we can do that very pea",0

With 140 articles about 9 have been deleted.  This isn't a horrible percentage. This is under 10%.  Considering that most of the individuals who were deleted were African American Judo fighters, I pointed out that statistic, to which they claimed I claimed I said they were racist or bigoted.  I never stated anyone was a racist or a bigot.  I pointed out a statistic.  After this issue was closed, one user tried to revive the issue, to which an admin stated """".

 Middleham and other hoards 

Hi BabelStone, thanks for adding Middleham to the list of hoards. Much appreciated! Also, sorry if I seemed at all caustic in my comment about the addition of the Mesolithic site in Guildford - I only noticed that it might come across bluntly after re-reading! Since you seem to have all the right skills, I wondered whether you might be tempted to work more on the Middleham Hoard article or on other English Civil War hoards with support from York Museums Trust's numismatics curator ? It would be great for our GLAM-wiki partnership to establish direct links between curators and active editors (other than myself!). Particularly ones with specialist knowledge. Any thoughts? Thanks   
Hi Pat, I did have a look at the Middleham Hoard article, but I didn't contribute anything as I thought from your message that some new editors were still working on it ... but as it does not seem to have changed much since then I'll see if there is anything I can do to help.  To be honest, I did feel a little put down by your earlier comment; I rather carelessly pulled the offending term out of the air without giving it sufficient thought, for which I apologize.  I don't pretend to be an archaeologist (a couple of digs and a term at university in the late 1970s hardly count), but I enjoy contributing to archaeological articles precisely because I am not an expert in the field, and editing helps me learn more about subjects that interest me.   
Hi! First of all - Wow! Thanks! The Middleham Hoard article has made great leaps! It is massively appreciated. Secondly: big apologies. I've just gone and re-read my comment about Guildford again and feel very embarrassed - I must have been writing in a massive rush. The irony is that I'm personally very keen on improving the coverage of the Mesolithic on Wikipedia! I appreciate your work on this and other archaeology stuff and hope that we can get past this and work together in the future! Thanks for being magnanimous   
You have to be thick-skinned to survive on Wikipedia, so don't give it another thought. I have limited time available for Wikipedia, but I certainly hope to be abl",0

Libelous Content Warning
Errors in reposting of old entry:

I reverted this entry back to the content I posted back in November (making certain modifications since Mills is no longer Insurance Superintendent) because of the following errors and libelous content:

1.  Old entry starts that Mills was from Middletown, but he was originally from the Town of Wallkill.

2.  The police department entry was not cited, and I happen to know that the content listed here happened after Mills had left the Town Supervisor post.

3.  Information about his decision to run for office again is not cited, and the quote """"many political observers believe his ethical lapses will be too great a hurdle to overcome in any future bid for elective office"""" is not cited and has no basis in fact.

I implore users not to make any other changes which are libelous and error ridden.  Thank you!

By the way, there will be 2 villains, Sand man & Venom. Harry as been comfirmed to be the next goblin (Hobgoblin).
So I am wondering, will Venom & Sand Man are to be in it, will Harry be in it? I am thinking Harry might appear in Spiderman 4

But Peter will meet a new girl in his life, """"Betty"""". It is said that someone close to Peter will die in this movie. And I am greatly sure it will be Betty, cuz it's official. Because in Spidy comics, She dies, and dies by the hands of Green Goblin. So Harry will have to be in this movie.

What about Venom? In Spidy cartoon, one the old one, it's kinda like modern, the cartoon that sometimes have 3D buildings. In that cartoon, Spidey had the venom custome before, then abandoned it, and the venom came to Eddy Brook. I am thinking, the ending of this movie, might be Peter leaving the Venom suit, and the suit meeting up with Eddy, then Venom will appear in Spiderman 4

 Apple not such a great example 

Just as English has a sense of """"information"""" that is countable (See information.), spoiling many a teaching example, """"apple"""" can be used uncountably. It is really not very different from """"a grain"""" vs """"grain"""", except in the relative frequency of the mass senses vs the uncountable senses.

For clarity English requires explicit constructions or quantizing or massifying determiners to make explicit what semantic aspect of a word is intended.

"Wal-mart HD-DVD rumor 

Gizmodo cites a forum post that cites 
two pages written in Chinese claiming that a company called Fuh Yuan will produce 20M HD-DVD players for Wal-Mart.  Various sources including Engadget suggest this might be a mistranslation and the article may be talking about Blu-Ray or a dual-format player, or may be unclear.

Via Google News I found blog posts (but not proper news stories) at Wired News and PC World which clarify nothing.  

None of this seems reliable enough to put in the article.  At best, if someone can read Chinese, if one of those Chinese pages is an unambiguous report from an authoritative source saying what format's involved, and if untangling all that doesn't count as original research, maybe there's an edit to be made.  Mainly I post so that nobody has to repeat the exact same digging I just did.

Three or four editors have censored the section in question; ten have maintained it. The three or four are very loud and aggressive, and claim to represent a consensus; that is just the  rhetorical trick known as bandwagoning (claiming that one's opinion represents the popular will, in order to con new people into adopting it, and thus bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy).

But consider this. The censors became so smug that they inspired me to do some research a day or two ago (see my earlier note for date). It took me only minutes to learn that all whites are being targeted as part of a campaign of state-sanctioned racial expropriation and genocide. And so, the significance of the attack on Gordimer actually resides within a context that is staggeringly larger and more important than I had previously known. And yet, the censors are unmoved by this news. Imagine if the races were reversed. They would be shouting from the rooftops about the attack. But they do not want anyone to know about the South African genocide. Apparently, some cases of genocide are more equal than others.

""""Editors who feel this material should be included need to respond to the various reasons offered why it is not, at this point, notable.""""

As lquilter well knows, I have responded many times. He is simply trying to rewrite history.

If you want to insert a statement that marriage (like the other sacraments) was not always recognized as a sacrament, find a reliable source that says so and insert it at an appropriate point.  That appropriate point is obviously not the time of Trent, since by then marriage was not only generally recognized in the Church as a sacrament but had even been several times dogmatically declared to be such.  You'd also have to explain the significance you think you see in the fact that in this respect marriage is in no way different from the other sacraments, none of which was or could be recognized as a sacrament until a theology of sacraments was developed.

As for the latest edit, which said that the Council of Trent reaffirmed the existing teaching only """"from their perspective"""", that is an utterly silly, unsourced, imaginative addition that contrasts with the clear decisive statement of the Fathers of the Council, who certainly wouldn't have dreamt of adding phrases such as """"from our perspective"""" to their clear reaffirmation of the existing teaching!

 External links on ballet 

Hello! External links are often taken as a """"For further reading"""" section, and as such, should complement the article, adding information we could not. As for ballet terminology, Wikipedia has a Glossary of ballet, and as we are working to create free content, it is more beneficial for us to create a better repository of terms and their meanings than to link to a copyrighted collection. Similarly, we shouldn't be linking to content which we should have, or which is only marginally related (physics of all dance is only marginally related to ballet). However, if you meant to reference a section, there's a different method of going about this documented at Wikipedia:Citing sources. The links used would be contained in a ==References== section, and it'd especially help if you could indicate which facts were verified and which weren't. The Ballet article is currently undergoing a rewrite, and any help you could offer would be appreciated (see the talk page and WikiProject Ballet's article improvement page for more information on what needs doing).

Okay, well. First, ufowatchdog.com does not seem like a reliable source. Wiki policy states that trustworthy secondary and tertiary sources are to be used - things like newspapers and books.

 I disagree that """"[you] set our own social norms by concensus [sic]"""".  ([you], meaning the community, not Heironymous).  I agree that there appears to be such a rule, or your claimed practice, but in my experience 'consensus' is honored far more in the breach than the actual observance.  Indeed, one of my repeated criticisms against Dodo was the fact that he certainly didn't wait for any sort of 'consensus' to develop, and in fact he directly prevented such a consensus simply by reverting in minutes or hours, rather than allowing that consensus to develop.  I think, instead, the 'consensus' claim is primarily used in order to attack, rather then to defend.  In one posting, for example, Dodo actually claimed that I hadn't obtained a 'consensus' that would allow me to make an edit!  (I have never seen any other person make such a weird claim, but on the other hand I haven't seen anybody criticize Dodo for that obvious gaffe.)  I viewed that comment as borderline-nuts, and I have seen no indication that any other poster has taken the reasonable position that: Dodo has, himself, repeatedly violated the rules that WP is claimed to be operating under.  
Do I believe that the average WP user goose-steps?  No, I think it's much more likely (see above)that posters tend to be self-motivated, and 'control-freaks' are powerfully-motivated to maintain an actual practice which is very different than is claimed by 'rule' or ostensible practice.  If I had more time, I'd see if I could see statistics on the persons who have posted here:  How many edits?  How many reverts?  Etc.  I feel certain a pattern is present.

"In my opinion, the walkout and split of the IRA and Sinn Fein in 1986 is relevant to understanding Irish Republicanism.  If the split was not relevant, why did Adams and his supporters go to such great lengths to try and keep it from happening?  This includes asking Tom Maguire for support.  When so many founders of the organizations walk out it is significant; recognizing Leinster House was a watershed.  Adams, if I recall, praised Dan Keating for not walking out, only to have Keating later become patron of RSF.

Accusations of editors being Anti-Semites
Greetings, It's been brought to my attention that you are spreading word in a personal attack fashion that those who've recieved a barnstar for their contributions on Islamic topics are anti-semites. I highly recommend that you 1. cease from making false accusations immediately and 2. remove all previous talk pages messages saying as much. If you do not follow this advice you will likely face being blocked as a Wikipedia editor. Sincerely, Scott Stevenson  

Mr.Brock, in reference to your recent incivil post on Netscott's page, and the posts to which he refers above: personal attacks are not allowed on Wikipedia.  It's that simple.  Don't make them.

 Etymology 

The etymology section was completely wrong. The Hebrew consonant """"Tsade"""" results from the merging of (at least) two proto-Semitic consonants. They are still distinct in Classical Arabic, as """"Ṣad"""" and """"Ḍad"""". It is easy to see that """"chamets"""" corresponds to the Arabic root ḥ-m-ḍ, because the Aramaic version (which appears in the Aramaic parts of the Hagada) is ḥamiʕa (with `Ayin), and almost all Arabic """"Ḍads"""" map to `Ayin in Aramaic. In Hebrew, the root means both """"sour"""" and """"leavened"""" (cf. """"chamuts"""" =sour; """"chomets"""" =vinegar; """"chumtza"""" =acid). In Arabic it is used mostly to denote """"sour"""" or """"acidic"""". In any event, """"chamets"""" is not related to """"hummus"""" or """"Homs"""". """"Hummus"""" is """"chimtza"""" in Modern Hebrew, and in one case, """"chometz"""" in the Bible might be """"hummus"""" rather than vinegar, but the root is historically different, and only accidentally did they assume the same phonetic shape. 79.177.167.209  """,0

Professor Simon Wessely and claims of harassment

PERMISSION TO REPOST

Below is a series of correspondence I have recently had with Professor Peter McGuffin, Dean of Psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, London, and John Williams, Interim Head of HR , at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, London.

I have transcribed the correspondence by both, but have the original documents in my possession.

The contents of this correspondence are self-explanatory.

I am publishing this correspondence for two reasons:

1. I consider that I have been defamed, and seek to protect my good name and reputation against defamatory attacks of this nature.

2. This correspondence, sadly, provides merely one example of an increasingly unpleasant and worrying phenomenon. I have observed, over the years, a growing tendency, by some, to make grossly ad hominem attacks on ME/CFS advocates and the community at large. These are logically indefensible, and morally and intellectually unsound: and have had the effect of preventing reasonable, legitimate voices of criticism being acknowledged within the discourse of ME/CFS politics, with adverse consequences for sufferers. This is a phenomenon which I will return to over the coming months.

Angela Kennedy

1. Letter from Angela Kennedy to Peter McGuffin:

1st October 2007

Dear Professor McGuffin,

I am writing to you about a serious matter of defamation which potentially involves a member of your department, Professor Simon Wessely.

I am an advocate for my daughter, a young woman seriously ill and severely disabled by her illness, who was diagnosed with ME/CFS. I also politically advocate for the community at large. I am also a known critic of the ‘psychiatric paradigm’ of ME/CFS, and I undertake this from an academic perspective (I appreciate the above term might be contested, but that is not the issue at hand).

I am currently working towards publication on this issue, having been engaged in academic research for some years. I have a social science background and am an Associate Lecturer with the Open University (although the work I am undertaking in this field is not connected to this institution).

I therefore do have a reputation that might be damaged by libellous, defamatory comments.

In recent weeks, various editors of the Wikipedia online encyclopaedia have expressed an intention to publish claims that Professor Wessely has ‘retired’ from ‘CFS’ research because of ‘harassment’ by certain people within the ME/CFS patient community. The basis for these claims is the Gibson Report, an unofficial, unsourced, un-referenced document, which has been criticised for key inaccuracies, and inflammatory, inaccurate language about the patient community and its advocates.

I, with other advocates, have endeavoured to provide reasons and evidence as to why the Gibson Report is not a reliable source, and why claims of ‘harassment’ are, certainly at present, unsubstantiated and unsafe to the point they should not be published on Wikipedia. One advocate has attempted to clarify, by contacting MP Ian Gibson himself, the source of the comment, within the report itself, that Professor Wessely has retired from “CFS” research, and the claim that this was """"possibly due to extreme harassment"""" [my italics] present within the report. Ian Gibson’s researcher is following this up.

This is an extremely important issue. I, like many in the community, would condemn harassment of academics (particularly harassment as defined in criminal law), particularly as I am myself an academic, and because I have been subjected to criminal harassment before, which I have reported to the police. However, there is also a problem around the use of the term ‘harassment‘: ME/CFS sufferers and their advocates have for many years been subject to inaccurate ad hominem attacks on their motives for protesting the psychiatric paradigm. Inaccurate descriptions of legitimate critique as ‘personal attack’, or ‘abuse’, or terms actually associated with criminal ‘harassment’ are all too common, to the detriment of a patient community with valid concerns.

On September 26th, and 27th, 2007, a member of the Wikipedia online encyclopaedia posted a long attack on myself and others, which included the comments below, on their ‘Admin Notice board’, which were grossly misrepresentative of my work, and which",0

I am not removing legitimate sources, I am removing information that has no relevance to the article. One could say the statement - House music started in Chicago. Then give a viable source. This is true yes, but it is not relevant to the article, that is what I'm getting at. Your reference to a couple of records that provided some 'missing link' may be more relevant on a page on disco. Carl Craigs opinions on the word progressive are relevant and should be included, but this page is really about Progressive House, I think you would agree...that's why I removed the statements about Techno. If you don't understand what I'm referring to, then I don't think you are qualified to be hacking away at other peoples work that isn't incorrect in the first place. I also find it strange that you keep monitoring this page. Every edit I do, it's like your watching my every move. Do you think this is healthy? I've gone away for a month. Let's see how long it takes for you to come back.

Since I suspect you weren't part of the original Progressive movement, I think you should leave the edits standing to give people a chance to comment, instead of hacking away at whatever I write. Another question I have, were you at the Renaissance events at the time the Sasha & Digweed mix CD was released? The word Progressive has everything to do with House music that was played at events such as Renaissance.

Your reference to the gap being filled by MBO & Capricorn, then the beginning of Techno, is false. Chicago House was the big scene in the midwest and this is the influence (and the gap) that the Detroit guys were using to design their version of House music. Larry Heard had everything to do with what Detroit was up to. Experimental type Techno obviously deserves a place in the history, but as far as dance records, It was modelled hugely after what Ron Hardy was playing in the Music Box. The output of labels such as Trax, DJ International, and Jack Trax was monstrous in comparison to the small industrial wasteland scene of Detroit at the time, along with it the labels that were releasing """"Techno"""" - Metroplex, KMS etc. This large volume of output in Chicago is what was filling the gap.

Hello.

Basically the aunt's wedding never happened. This book is centered around the 1800's in England. (I think) Any info leading me in the right direction would help, trying to find the book for a friend.

"""==Name==
I've been studying Satmar for a good bit, and I've been to Kiryas Joel. I've never heard it called """"Sakmer"""". Are we sure about this?  
I've been around many Hasidim for a long, long time too, and I have never heard of Sakmer either, so it may just be baloney and that word should be removed.  
there is a street in KJ called Sakmer

also: look at this http://tovrent.com/satmar/85.jpg

The reason some call it Sakmer is because the name Satmer is based on Satu Mare which remotely referes Saint Mary [NOTE - not true, Satu Mare means simply """"Large Village"""" in Romanian!]. Hassidic Jews have always refrained from sanctifying Christian saints and therefore have created alternative names for quite a few cities. Izak love, when you don't know something, that does not make it balony.   PS, I haven't been """"studying"""" Satmer - I am one, and my maternal grandfather referes to his birthplace as Sakmer (AKA Satu Mare). PPS There is no KJ street called Sakmer. The photo you attached clearly dubbs the Satmar Rabbi """"The Rav of Sakmer"""". For those who study Satmer but have no knowledge of the script which the Satmers use, the word is the one at the lower left corner looking something like this: סאקמער. The third letter from the right carries the K sound. Cheers.

I recently heard in regular chatting from an acquaintence that an ancestor (great-grandfather?) of his called Satmar Sakmer. Why do they not utilize that term anymore? And, I'm done with my hardcore pshat study of different Hasidic groups.  

It's total nonsense, the 'saint mary' story. Satu Mare means 'large town'. My father has been there many times. Wikipedia (yes yes) also says that Satu Mare means 'large town', and that 'saint mary' is something else entirely in Hungarian/Romanian.  
I revised the opening paragraph by indicating the Satmars are one of the largest hasidic groups - it is widely thought there are about 200,000 Lubavitchers, but since none of the hasidic groups keeps a formal membership role, this is all conjecture - it would be incorrect for any group to claim they are the largest, there is no way of knowing. 

About Satmar and NETUREI KARTA. THe Cherem bit is incorrect, as is the bit of a denunciation. Also the part of asking Reb Yoilish to meet with Yasser Arrafat. It's all myth. Yasser Arafat and the PLO were not the public face of the Palestinian cause before Reb Yoilish had his stroke, so it doesn't make sense. I actually asked a chaver of the Satmar Beis Din about the Cherem, and he said it's nonsense. The Beis DIn has not publicly issued a cherem against a person or group of people since its formation in the United States. No denunciation was issued either. It's a made up propaganda piece by the Kakhnik radio station Arutz Sheva. It never happened. No such thing ever appeared in Der Yid, which is the official newspaper.

Actually, it's not like this. In Romanian, """"satu"""" is derived from Latin """"fossatum"""" and it originally meant a village encircled by a moat (in Latin """"fossa""""). """"Cetate"""" is the Romanian word derived from """"civitas"""".  | Talk

Randy, I am not apologizing to you for an obvious joke, so you will have to somehow manage to go on without one. What is truly outrageous is how little you care about the """"embarrassing"""" state of the article (not my words, but those of several editors above), but you care a great deal about making sure there are indents, and tildes, and every one of your trite, nonsensical, kangarroo-court rules has been followed. I am sure your mother is very proud of your Wikipedia J.D. law degree, but you are not getting any more of my time to contribute to your project and correct your obvious falsehoods and text that does not clearly appear to have been written by an English speaker familiar with Heidegger and able to name even a few of his main concepts. Please point me to the place in the article where even one of H's primary philosophical concepts are reasonably explained, so that a reader may have any idea of what he is after. The current page leaves everyone less intelligent and knowledgeable than they were before reading it. I promise you, that you are not getting even one minute more of my time in any event.  This article is so bad that it needs to be gone through paragraph by paragraphy and replaced my new content. Nearly every paragraph in it leaves the reader knowing less true things about Heidegger than the reader knew before. If you would like to actually know something about Heidegger, read the article I wrote. I managed to explain in the lead the main ideas which one needs to know about Heidegger. The current article does not even succesfully explain Heidegger's thought or his importance within the entire article, and inculcates a number of gross and vulgar misconceptions. It would be almost impossible to imagine a philosophy article that was filled with more sophmoric drivel, and reads like a machine-translated text of an undergraduate who has never read the author, and wishes to spread as much misinformation as possible. If you prefer reading an article that seems to claim that Heidegger has only been read in France and is unable to successfully name or explain EVEN A SINGLE ONE OF HEIDEGGER'S CONCEPTS, please by all means, waste your time on doing so. I am finished with this. Adieu.   """,0

Bonjour, mon chéri David! Thank you so much for the kind and encouraging message! I must say that, as a European, I fully agree with your reserves towards the usual American expression of """"best in the world""""; and just like you, it's not anti-americanism at all, just the common uses of a particular country.

I also concur with your appreciation regarding some of the more """"dark"""" episodes and their wording. I tried to be as objective as possible, but always something slips through the net. This shows how valid is to listen to other readers' thoughts and concerns, because a different opinion can always show you were one's work can be improved. The phrase regarding the brutality of McNelly's men that worried you has been rephrased, within the facts presented by the source; so thanks to you, now it's historically accurate and clearly presented.

I've also done a full re-reading of the article to discover any other places where this could happen, but I have not observed any, to my humble opinion. At other parts where brutality and violence are exposed (like the early 20th century), the wording is presented in a much more clear way, I hope: I mention them as """"sordid misdeeds of brutality and injustice"""" (properly sourced), which I humbly believe to be a straight general description without going into particular examples that would take much space. The same could go for """"300 up to 5,000 people, mostly of Hispanic descent, had been killed by Rangers"""" and """"Reports of Rangers abusing their authority and breaking the law themselves became numerous"""" (sourced again). Do you agree with me, David? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

As you see, I've put immense effort in creating and enhancing this article, and I wish to address all your concerns with my best effort until you consider it worthy of becoming featured. Nothing would please me more than seeing all the points that you correctly raise solved satisfactorily. My warmest wishes,  smile! ''''""",0

 Regarding the Harvest page. 

Hello Moe Epsilon,

Wow, looks like you were very busy editing the """"Harvest page.

You referred edit readers to """"Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria items #3(a) and #8).""""  Thank you for the reference.

Regarding #3(a):  I agree that I went way beyond minimal use, although I will say that this was without knowing of the 10 non-free content rules.  My question is, does this mean that you needed to remove all album cover images and music samples?  When I added the images, I was using """"The Beatles"""" article as a reference.  Looking at it now, I see that """"The Beatles Discography"""" is without images, although the main article still contains music samples.  Does minimal use mean """"No use""""? (referring to there being no images at all on the Harvest page).  Why is showing album cover art excessive?  I have a feeling I'm asking a common question.

Regarding #8 (significance):  Is the discography considered a list?  I would assume so.  I guess this would be why no image- photo or song sample is allowed within it.  I would think this rule alone would suffice for removing all of the images I had put in the article, since they were all within the Discography section.  Would it be acceptable to create a separate section for music samples, as in the Beatles article?  If so, how many music samples would be allowed?  25?, as in that article?

I would really appreciate you responding to this post.  I would like to know what you think.  And I would also like to find out if any of the images/samples I uploaded are salvageable.  This would save me time in re-uploading if they are.

Thanks for your time and efforts in editing,

 Should Robespierre be classified as a liberal? 

As per the articles on more controversial topics such as fascism and Marxism-Leninism, I have noticed that they address the controversies involved in the ideology such as the Holocaust and the Great Purge - it is not POV to address these because they are important parts of history of the ideology. However the controversial elements of the French Revolution seem to be minimalized here - especially in regard to Robespierre.

When I added a picture of Robespierre, a user removed it, and claimed that it was doubtful where Robespierre was a liberal and claims that the Reign of Terror was not liberal. First of all, I believe a strong argument can be made that demonstrates that Robespierre being a Jacobin upheld many classical liberal values - albeit in a contorted way like Stalin's sociopathic version of Marxism. In Robespierre: The Voice of Virtue, that seeks to describe Robespierre not merely as a tyrant but as a man with genuine beliefs, it describes Robespierre as being a proponent of universal suffrage, of being an abolitionist (seeking to end slavery). Robespierre was part of a revolution that was associated with many classical liberal goals. Robespierre's Reign of Terror against the Girondists and counter-revolutionaries (both real and suspected) that was pursued according to Robespierre to solidify the revolution. Historian Francois Furet claims the Reign of Terror was deeply ideologically rooted in the idea of promoting """"man's regeneration"""" based on free will and enlightenment, that the Committee of Public Safety promoted that resulted in violence against people suspected of being counterrevolutionaries. The issue of Robespierre's association with liberalism - if he was a liberal or if he was not a liberal - needs to be investigated further here by other users, because regardless of Robespierre's controversies he was an important figure in the Jacobin movement and the French Revolution.

The following was deleted by user#24.168.66.27 this morning.  Why would he delete this post, I wonder:

If anyone is curious, in the interests of creating a NPOV article about surrealism, it should be noticed that both user#63.169.104.2 and user#24.168.66.27 were the main users interested in pushing the Keith Wigdor article forward. If you have any doubts, then check the discussion page for that article.
    
It wasn't long ago that all references to """"Keith Wigdor"""" were removed from this """"surrealism"""" article. This removal occured because of Wigdor's total unimportance to the surrealist movement, for the simple reason that Keith Wigdor is, at best, an emerging digital artist who fancies himself as a being a surrealist, and who has many times attempted to pose as a surrealist. Needless to say, many of the english-speaking surrealist groups listed on this page know about him and refuse to have anything to do with him. Keith Wigdor appears again and again to disrupt all things genuinely surrealist.  
 
It is also interesting to note, if you check the discussion archives of this """"surrealism"""" article, that these same 2 users were also involved with promoting Keith Wigdor as a surrealist, in this very article. Also, if you look at some of the recent, belligerent, trollish, thike-ish posts of these 2 users, it shouldn't be unreasonable to suspect that perhaps both of these 2 IP numbers are being used by Keith Wigdor.

For the 2 no-name users mentioned here, who are strongly associated with or strongly correlated with the antics of Keith Wigdor, it is difficult to imagine that their efforts in building this wiki article will be anything but disruptive and manipulative in the long run. Please treat these 2 users with extreme caution, for they are one and the same, and also happen to be Keith Wigdor, who is playing a sock-puppet game.  22:10, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)""",0

It is clear that the worst proclaimed by the opponents of the Wikipedia is true.

That it is more interested in appeasing the egos of those in charge than pursuing the concept of dispassionate information.

When a female editor is able to suppress the revelation of a complete quote, which refutes her desire that only two words of that same quote were true, because a male editor is too infatuated to reject her perversion of the truth, then the Wikipedia has rejected ANY pretense to being more than what it is, which isn't much.

Posting of personal information
Shortcuts:
WP:OUTING
WP:PRIVACY
""""WP:OUTING"""" redirects here. For the alternate meaning of outing, as in excursion, see Wikipedia:Meetup.
For the Wikimedia privacy policy, see Wikimedia:Privacy policy.
Posting another editor's personal information is harassment, unless that person voluntarily had posted his or her own information, or links to such information, on Wikipedia. Personal information includes legal name, date of birth, identification numbers, home or workplace address, job title and work organisation, telephone number, email address, or other contact information, whether any such information is accurate or not. Posting such information about another editor is an unjustifiable and uninvited invasion of privacy and may place that editor at risk of harm outside of their activities on Wikipedia. This applies to the personal information of both editors and non-editors. It also applies in the case of an editor who has requested a change in username, but whose old identifying marks can still be found. Any edit that """"outs"""" someone must be reverted promptly, followed by a request for Oversight to delete that edit from Wikipedia permanently. If an editor has previously posted their own personal information but later redacted it, it should not be repeated on Wikipedia; although references to still-existing, self-disclosed information is not considered outing. If the previously posted information has been removed by Oversight, then repeating it on Wikipedia is considered outing.

The fact that a person either has posted personal information or edits under their own name, making them easily identifiable through online searches, is not an excuse for """"opposition research"""". Dredging up their off line opinions to be used to constantly challenge their edits can be a form of harassment, just as doing so regarding their past edits on other Wikipedia articles may be. However, if individuals have identified themselves without redacting or having it oversighted, such information can be used for discussions of conflict of interest in appropriate forums. If redacted or oversighted personally identifying material is important to the COI discussion, then it should be emailed privately to an administrator or arbitrator – but not repeated on Wikipedia: it will be sufficient to say that the editor in question has a COI and the information has been emailed to the appropriate administrative authority.

If you see an editor post personal information about another person, do not confirm or deny the accuracy of the information. Doing so would give the person posting the information and anyone else who saw the page feedback on the accuracy of the material. Do not treat incorrect attempts at outing any differently from correct attempts for the same reason. When reporting an attempted outing take care not to comment on the accuracy of the information. Outing should usually be described as """"an attempted outing"""" or similar, to make it clear that the information may or may not be true, and it should be made clear to the users blocked for outing that the block log and notice does not confirm the information.

Unless unintentional and non-malicious (for example, where Wikipedians know each other off-site and may inadvertently post personal information, such as using the other person's real name in discussions), attempted outing is grounds for an immediate block.

Threats to out an editor will be treated as a personal attack and dealt with accordingly.  """,0

 Alleged Cyaxares tomb 

Sources disagree with Kurdo-bigot claims:
At the so-called “Median” stone tombs, which are now recognized as the burial places of late Achaemenid notables (Gall, 1966), there are scroll capitals somewhat resembling Ionic forms (e.g., those on the tomb of Qyzqapan; Gall, 1988, pp. 557ff.; see Figure 57h). 
At Cambridge history of Iran  text also say that scholars incline to post-Achaemenid dating.
Current version claims tomb is """"identified by Diakonoff"""" while in Iranica article  (published years after his earlier works) he doesn't even mention it.

 Narciso Yepes 

Please refrain from making edits to subjects you clearly know very little about. Yepes collaborated with Ramirez, not Bernabe, to invent his guitar. Bernabe (an apprentice of Ramirez) later formed his own shop and Yepes subsequently played a Bernabe 10-string. As for your comment about Yepes's hands, this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why Yepes invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it (which was NOT to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think - including 10-string guitarists and clueless former students of Yepes). I have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available, depending on what best served the music. Do you have these proofs??? NO. So please stick to what you actually know. (FYI Yepes had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first string's D together with the low G on the 6th string by using the left hand thumb. Again, we have the proof of this. It was even published in one of his old Scarlatti editions.)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 129.94.133.166   

 Your discussion at Narciso Yepes 

First, you added information that was NOT CORRECT, except for the reason you gave for Yepes's death. And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most """"notorious""""...

Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. """"The Ten-String Guitar"""" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]

Third, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact """"worthless"""" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' """"short hands"""" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not """"frequently"""" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as """"crutches"""" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!

I question whether we need four population-related columns.  """"Current"""" population is necessary, and density is highly important, but having both 2010 and 2012 population is a bit extra, and including the percentage change is even more extraneous.  What if we reduced it to the version that I've placed at Talk:List of municipalities in Pennsylvania/shorter?  This reduces it by nearly 40KB — the difference is slightly exaggerated because the /shorter page is just the table, without the header and the stuff below the table, but this is a negligible difference.  When we have an extremely long page, reduction by 10% should be a big improvement, especially when we're just excising some rather extraneous elements.    """,0

Fetal Pain (cont.)
It seems that the info in this article's Fetal Pain section is different from the information on the Fetal Pain page.  I propose changing our section to reflect what is on the fetal pain page.  The following is taken from the fetal pain page directly (though edited for summary form):

Fetal pain, its existence, and its implications are debated politically and academically, particularly in regards to the abortion debate.  

A 2005 American study, conducted by neurobiologists and pediatricians concluded that """"...fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester. Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques.""""""""Fetal Pain: A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence"""" JAMA. 2005;294:947-954. Susan J. Lee, JD; Henry J. Peter Ralston, MD; Eleanor A. Drey, MD, EdM; John Colin Partridge, MD, MPH; Mark A. Rosen, MD  With the encouragement of President Ronald Reagan, in 1984 a small group of physicians argued that the ability of a fetus to feel pain appears as early as seven weeks after conception.Robinson, B.A. (2006). Can a fetus feel pain?. Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance. Retrieved December 14, 2005.  Most medical researchers agree pain cannot be felt until the third trimester of pregnancy or until after birth.""""Study: Fetus feels no pain until third trimester"""" MSNBC

There may be an """"emerging consensus among developmental neurobiologists that the establishment of thalamocortical connections"""" (at about 26 weeks) is a critical event with regard to fetal perception of pain.  Nevertheless, because pain can involve sensory, emotional and cognitive factors, it is """"impossible to know"""" when painful experiences may become possible, even if it is known when thalamocortical connections are established.Johnson, Martin and Everitt, Barry.  Essential reproduction (Blackwell 2000): """"The multidimensionality of pain perception, involving sensory, emotional, and cognitive factors may in itself be the basis of conscious, painful experience, but it will remain difficult to attribute this to a fetus at any particular developmental age.""""  Retrieved 2007-02-21.  According to Arthur Caplan, """"there is no consensus among the medical and scientific experts about precisely when a fetus becomes pain-capable.  Some put the point at 28 weeks. Others say 26 or 24 and still others younger still.""""Caplan, Arthur.  Testimony to U.S. Congress, Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties. """"Oversight Hearing on Pain of the Unborn.""""  (2005-11-01). Retrieved 2007-03-10.  """,0

 WP:RFP/R 

Hello, you recently declined my request for this permission, which I completely respect. You listed my mishap with WilyD as the main reason for this, stating that I did several things wrong which I get. The misunderstanding was based on a believed piece of policy in my head which was that editors do not generally remove CSD tags (especially when they had been tagged by an admin) but clicked on the """"contest this speedy deletion"""" button. Now I admit fully I was wrong, and don't know where I even got the initial conception from. I then added the template to Wily's user page (and as you mentioned I changed the default text). You said that I did not consider the possibility that I was mistaken, when I did (why else would I have asked another experienced editor for advice?) and then promptly realised my mistake and set about fixing the problem. I do believe that this was an isolated incident, based on a single misconception in my mind that led to one or two other non-brilliant outcomes. However, I would ask that you reconsider your decline, especially as I made a good number of reverts over the last day or so, and I believe that I am getting it right a good deal more often than not. I understand if you decline, as it was not an attractive mistake to make, but I do ask that you reconsider, as I believe that it was more or less a one-off with no other related incidents in the near past (that I can see).

Abstraction: ``We have developed an exceptionally powerful technique for dealing with complexity. We abstract from it. Unable to master the entirety of a complex object, we choose to ignore the inessential details, dealing instead with the generalized, idealized model of the object"""" Wulf in Shaw, 1981). 
Formality: Rigor at each stage in the development of a system. 

Divide and conquer: Divide a complex problem into a set of simpler problems that can be solved. 

Hierarchical ordering: Order the simplification of the problem in ``divide & conquer"""" in hierarchies. 

Cohesion & coupling: Modularise the system such that interactions within components (cohesion) is maximised and interactions between components (coupling) is minimised. This way, the impact of errors, when they arise, is localised and does not cascade through the system. Diagnosis of offending components is also made easier. 

Information hiding: Each module (or subsystem) must have available to it just the information that is needed by it. 

Conceptual integrity: Consistency in design. 

Completeness: Ensuring that the design meets all the specifications. 

Logical independence: Emphasis on the statement of system objectives in terms of logical functions independent of physical implementation. 

Correctness & Efficiency: Correct in the sense that the design meets all the user requirements. Efficient in that the system accomplishes the objectives with minimum computing resources.""",0

 Cydebot deletion log summaries 

Hi Cyde,

When Cydebot deletes a category that was renamed or merged, could it link to the target category in the deletion log summary?

For example, if Category:Foo is renamed to Category:Bar per a discussion at Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2011 January 1, could Cydebot use the following summary when deleting Category:Foo:

Robot - Moving category to Bar per CFD at Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2011 January 1

For speedy renaming:

Robot - Speedily moving category to Bar per CFDS

I realize that linking to the target category adds extra characters to the text of the log summary, which may become a problem with long category names, and that is why I've suggested dropping the name of the category being deleted. If necessary, perhaps extra characters could be saved by unlinking """"CFD"""" or piped-linking """"Speedily moving"""".

If Cydebot could do this, it would be a help to editors wanting to follow the history of a category (e.g., to update incoming links to a category that was renamed). Thank you,  ''''''  """,0

WP:AGF only goes so far, especially when there is the appearance of an agenda (supporting one's opinion is one thing; mentioning the victim most every time is another). As to the content of the SeaWorld article itself, it needs work ... no question. Clean out the marketing spin and focus on SeaWorld's history prior to its acquisition by Anheuser-Busch (at which point it became part of Busch Entertainment Corporation, which is now SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment). As to """"favorable vs. unfavorable,"""" if that's truly how I felt, such incidents articles wouldn't exist. I've gone through with SpikeJones and other editors to keep everything consistent, first getting involved with them after the monorail accident in July 2009, when this exact same issue came up, and again consensus was that leaving out the victim's name didn't damage the article, nor did it add any significant value to it (at which point, tie goes to """"leave it out""""). After that, it was the rash of lewd-behavior incidents at Central Florida water parks ... again, if I was trying to protect the parks, I wouldn't have allowed the information in, as if it were completely up to me, anyway. Heck, I added a number of them into their respective articles, and I fleshed out others with more details and more source information to back it all up! (In the interest of full disclosure, the victims in those incidents were generally minors, which (a) wouldn't have been named by the news and (b) if some unscrupulous person had gotten a hold of the names, I have no doubt the names would be expunged immediately and nobody who really had the project's best interests at heart would put up a fight. In not so many words, while also incidents, they did have special conditions that don't make them good examples in this dispute.)

These incidents articles are based purely on what's in the local newspapers, with no candy-coating, no PR spin ... save one thing, which has been followed with almost all the incident/accident articles I've reviewed, both theme-park and non-theme-park.

Linux vs GNU/Linux

2004-05-31 23:45, Hi David Gerard

You seem to have removed all the clarifications of the previously vague text.  Encyclopedia's should be impartial and correct.  You have put back all the confused use of """"Linux"""", and removed spelling/grammar corrections.  Really the Linux distributions entry should be clear about what it is and impartial to any of your leanings.  The version you have reverted to is an umbrella description which could be read as matching more than it in fact does.  The text should reflect correct and actual use of the term, including any that others may consider incorrect; it just should not blot out either/or as it does mostly at present.

Ok, and for the other minor revisions you removed:

eg -> e.g.
(""""eg"""" is just incorrectly spelt, e.g. is the abbreviation of latin """"exampli gratia"""" and should be written """"e.g."""" see OED for reference please.)

predetermined -> pre-determined

preconfigure -> pre-configure
(requires hyphen as conjoined words)

PCs -> IBM compatible PCs
(PCs is an abbreviation of """"Personal Computers"""", this case only refers to IBM compatible PCs.  Not Apple PCs for example.  So presently )

""""..targeted for China."""" -> """".. targeted at the Chinese market.""""
(grammar is simply wrong)

In the Xandros section:
commercial -> proprietary
(Are you unaware that GNU/Linux is typically commercial so the """"commercial"""" point is irrelevant, the relevant point is that it is PROPRIETARY commercial software.  There is  no point emphasising  a pointless piece of information.)

cooperation -> co-operation
(requires hyphen as conjoined words)

If you hold some position of seniority here please consider putting my clarifications back in.  At least consider the grammatical and spelling revisions if you are intent on the """"Linux"""" use being unsuitable as present.

Glad to see you did not revert my Proprietary software revision.

My comments in this post are intended to be polite, please do not consider my explanations patronising.

Cheers, now3d

I don't hold a position of editorial seniority; there isn't any such thing. However, the Linux to GNU/Linux stuff is clearly partisanism and POV-pushing. Please reread Talk:Linux and Talk:GNU/Linux naming controversy. And NPOV. In English, """"Linux"""" is far and away the most common name for what you (and I) would prefer to be called """"GNU/Linux""""; pretending it isn't would not (to my mind) be appropriate.

Typos: """"eg"""" you're right on, the others I think are arguable either way. I'll have a look through -  13:00, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

I've had a go. The facts seem more or less in order (I could dispute a few bits), but the whole article is really badly written and needs serious rewriting by someone who's a good writer in English. I'll make an attempt later, but anyone else who wants a go is of course welcome ...

In the distro list, I've attempted to avoid Linux vs GNU/Linux by sticking to the word """"distribution"""", and only included one or the other when it's part of the name or when GNU is actually optional (does Linux from Scratch still tell you how to use BusyBox and uClibc, for instance?).

Further work on this article is desperately needed, and I mean a lot more than tweaks of hyphenation -  16:48, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Thank you for applying those gramatical revisions.  I just added co-operation. Regards, User:Now3d

 Jimbo Wales on GNU/Linux as the correct naming convention. 

""""I would like to offer my opinion. The project to excise all references to GNU/Linux is deeply POV and wrong. It should be reverted completely and totally as quickly as possible.

Female masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.
Lubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient—some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.
Women may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and """"hump"""" the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.

A vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.
Some reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.
A few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.
Those who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation. Sometimes sex therapists will recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, especially if they have not masturbated before """,0

Hello Sir, I wanted to create a page on Mr. Ziauddin Yousafzai, father of Malala Yousafzai. But am unable to create a page on Ziauddin Yousafzai as now it is a redirect. Could you kindly remove the redirect so as to enable to create an article about him. 

Ok, the reason for the need of creation of an article on him is that now he has been appointed as United nation's Special advisor/envoy on Global Education  http://www.livemint.com/Politics/7AmAud6bJ1of9J1fnfNfPN/Malalas-father-named-UN-advisor-on-education.html and also Pakistan’s education attache in Birmingham. http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Europe/Diplomatic-role-for-Malala-s-dad/Article1-984617.aspx So IMHO, this makes him very much notable figure and as he has been nominated for the post of UN envoy, a page on him is feasible and needed. 

Kindly advice. Thanks. Meanwhile wish you all a very happy New Year 2013..:) With best regards,",0

1.  I agree with y'all's impressions of the article.  The major thing is to decide what should be in there and get the content.  Right now, it seems very uneven and ad hoc.

I'd like a little more on the major fields themselves as subheaders, etc.  I bet any one of us would come up with something sort of different, but in any case it would be an improvement over what is in there now.  And if we toss it around, hopefully can cover each other's blind spots and be better than any one singly.  Definitely writing out an outline of topics (perhaps with approximate number of paras) would be a good starting point.

"It's been a long time, SummerPhD 

Remember me? It's been a while, so you probably don't. My original account was GreenBayPackersfan09. That was my first Wikipedia account (I was 11 year old when I first used that account in 2009, and 14 when i lasted used it in 2012). I'm 17 years old now.

I forgot the password to that account, and later used sockpuppets (which I remember you blocked me for, lol). So, how have you been? I've been well.

Are you kidding me? I have been blocked for defending myself against a culprit who has been proven as such in far more ways than is humanly possible to count? Even though the idea of Wikipedia certainly is a genuine one, the way it is conducted is ridiculous. Saying my opinion is NOT an attack, and saying what is TRUE is not an attack but certainly just a way to explain things, as I had done very carefully and thoroughly in my text both now and earlier. I will say it again, no matter how you interpret it. Mario Roering is a culprit with only one single aim in life. He wants to destroy the good name and legacy of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation and its president, Kunihiko Tosa. I am the president of this federation in Denmark and Europe, thus I am the center of Mario Roering's attacks and defamation. These are facts, and the list of violations not only here on Wikipedia but nearly everywhere else on the Internet is too long to list anywhere. I have tons of evidence in mails, papers, letters, pdf-files, copies of homepages etc. to back it all up. Personally I got fed up a few years ago because of these endless and ridiculous ways, with which the Wikipedia admins/sysops are handling this situation. So at that time I chose to simply leave Wikipedia as it was, and leave the articles the way they were, full of defamation, lies and propaganda, all put in there by Mario Roering. I gave it a few years, then this year I tried again. It is obvious that neither Mario Roering nor the admins/sysops here at Wikipedia has changed at all. It is the exact same situation as a few years ago. Other webservices, homepages, free webhosting etc. which Mario Roering has exploited for supporting his crusade, in the same way he is exploiting Wikipedia, has all deleted and blocked Mario Roering from using their services after a short presentation of the facts and evidence etc. Only Wikipedia is still indulging Mario Roering in his ways and methods with no regard to his true intentions and what he is doing to our organization and/or myself. The way I have been treated here on Wikipedia I would categorize as pure and utter slander, defamation and harassment, in which the admins/sysops take an active part, though this might not be on purpose?!?!? What Mario Roering is and is doing, there can and is no doubt whatsoever. Blocking me, only shows, that fairness, honesty and rules only apply to a very few list of people here. Taking this matter to any official long time instance/institute of Wikipedia, only ads to the fact, that nothing will ever be done about it, as nobody cares. You are protecting a culprit, who has done nothing else than attacking, ridicule, defame, slander etc. the name of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation, our president, Kunihiko Tosa and myself as the president of Europe/Denmark. I have a born right as a human being to say my opinion, present the evidence as they are, and I have a right to free speech. If none of these basic human rights are treasured here at Wikipedia, it only shows, that people like Mario Roering and his methods of breaking the law, copyright violations, defamation, slander and generally lying and deceiving to reach his goals are what is treasured here at Wikipedia. For 5 years, I have spoken out, bringing to attention this man's lesser morals and lesser ethics, but every time some ignorant admin/sysop run the errands of Mario Roering, as you have done this time, punishing me for defending myself. If Mario Roering would stop his attacks, slander, defamation etc. and if this would be enforced by the sysops/admins here at Wikipedia, this situation would be solved faster than anyone of you can say Christmas. Nobody is trying to stop it, thus, whenever Mario Roering attacks me, I attack back, not every time, but often. Blocking only me, shows only, that fairness does not apply to me, but if justice was to be served, we should both be blocked forever from Wikipedia. As long as nothing is done about Mario Roering, I will continue to do as I have done, and I can assure you, that Mario Roering has, is and always will continue his culprit ways as he has done for the past 5 years. Thus the Wikipedia sysops/admins who are doing nothing to stop it, certainly only put more wood on the fire. There is absolutely no attack intended in these accusations, as they are facts and every time I have mentioned them, I have provided the proof, evidence, links etc. necessary to back up what I have said. Every time Mario Roering opens his """"mouth"""", you all listen and act by blocking me, threatening me or ordering me to take any dispute further using the official channels. When Mario Roering is blocked he only write a short request for having his block removed, and it is granted. Me, I can never do that. Where is the fairness in all of this?

You can talk about """"possibly missing a valid goal"""" but not that he definitely did, as he was making decisions based on what he saw, not what we saw. The second reference appears to be valid, and should be included when you re-submit the item into the article, in as neutral a tone as possible. Thanks.  (chew)(do) """,0

Also it would have to be paired with fact that the specimen (almost exclusively associated with Y-DNA R1a1) from South Siberia and Kazakhstan (*) had almost exclusively mtDNA haplogroups of west eurasian/european origin especially during bronze age (as far as 1,800 BC). If we link that with the europoid phenotypes with light-colored eyes and hair and pale skin of andronovo south siberians described in the recent article of human genetics 
( http://www.springerlink.com/content/4462755368m322k8/ ), that's meaningful and favors an European origin of these R1a1. 
Especially since no south Asian haplogroups are linked to the spread of R1a1, up to Europe. 
.
Pretty meaningful, especially since such phenotypes are found where high frequency of R1a1 are found in Asia (like 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, east Afghanistan and north Pakistan) -> examples of such clearly europoid phenotypes in these regions of Asia that matches the description of south Siberian of Bronze age (andronovo culture horizon),

Yes, I forgot to address the amendment to include criticisms issue. Based on my reasoning concerning Clinton's statement, the criticisms are equally irrelevant and should not be included (in my humble opinion). To Mdiamante - I realize this is not Lexis. However, I think we can set a good precedent in the legal articles by refraining as much as possible from POV editing. I've always criticized Wikipedia based on its lack of reliability and blatant bias, but when I came across this article I thought """"Wow, maybe this is a topic I can help contribute to without all of the POV nonsense."""" Then, of course, I saw the Dred Scott section and thought """"shit."""" It's not so much that I don't think ANY cases or legal topics should include sections/statements from groups/individuals unconnected to the legal community. Indeed, it would be insane to make such a claim, given the almost-revolutionary impact of some cases - not just on society, but on legal thought. See, e.g., Roe (which, by the way, I was pleasantly surprised with). Rather, I just think some are not, and this happens to be one of them. Perhaps my opinion would be different if old Bill had supported his statement with some sort of reasoning, but he clearly did not. It was just a conclusory assertion; something my mother might say in a fit of anger. But alas, this is not a battle I'm going to wage. I will continue browsing legal articles when I get some time and decide if the POV is decidedly less prevalent than in other areas.

As a close follower of the language-political issues in Finland, I have always disliked this intentional fudging of mother tongue's significance in defining what, if you will, we could call """"ethnic identity"""" especially when it comes to Finnish-speakers.

 About """"Two Chinas"""" 

I re-wrote and expanded the """"History"""" section for several reasons.
 One, I think """"Background"""" is more appropriate since the article is about the term """"Two Chinas"""". There is no actual thing as """"Two Chinas"""". So a section that deals with the background of the situation described by the term is better called """"Background"""" and not """"History"""" - """"History"""" should be used for a section on the history of the term.
 Two, there was a lot of misleading content in the article, such as the stuff about the Ruijin Soviet: I've seen that claim (that the Ruijin Soviet was the first time there were """"two Chinas"""") bandied about in online forums and anti-Communist China magazines from time to time, but it is factually untrue, since China was split between many autonomous entities throughout the Republican period, and the Ruijin Soviet was no different from any of them.
 In re-writing the Background section I was hoping to illustrate that history of division and separation in order to place the final division that led eventually to the current situation in a historical context.

This article is solely written and guarded by Britney's stubborn and standoffish fans; I do not see NPOV at all.

Where is the information of Britney being a no-show at the Allure Mag's interview? Where is the information of her being diagnosed with bipolar disorder?   Where is the information of Britney's former bodyguard speaking out? Where is the information of her being under the influence? Where is the information of Britney spending more time partying (with Paris Hilton, nonetheless) than being with her kids or concentrating on her music career? What about the fact that she was seen without underwear, more than once? All of us KNOW why Britney mangled her VMA performance! She was seen partying in Las Vegas 2 days in a row than focusing on getting her performance right!

"To start: this cannot be discussed with you. You are topic banned from agricultural chemicals broadly construed. As per the article content, DOW are quite clearly a company who specialise in agricultural chemicals, and RE Bhopal - this was a chemical disaster that involved a chemical mainly used in fertiliser. You are not allowed to edit in this topic area.

However for anyone else: coatracking environmental concerns with one company into another companies article is non-neutral editing. Dow and Dupont are not merged yet. Info on past DuPont environmental concerns may be relevant on a combined Dow-Dupont article once the companies merge - I assume at that point someone will either create a new article on the new company, or attempt to merge the Dow-Dupont articles together. From experience and past convention it is likely this would end up as a third article with the Dow & Dupont articles covering the individual histories of the respective companies. Assuming this article is kept as a historical article of Dow prior to the merge, it wouldnt be valid here, would be at DuPont, and would be at an article after the merger.

RE Bhopal: The only reason Dow is even relevant is that activists are claiming Dow is responsible for the cleanup once it acquired Carbide many years later. Which is more than covered by the information included currently. Detailed info on the Bhopal disaster is available at the dedicated article and the article for Carbide (who were responsible for the problem).

Excessive info included above places undue weight on events that were entirely out of Dow's control and unrelated to them except very remotely. Its practically a textbook example of an attempt to skew an article to make a company look worse than it actually is.",0

                           Of our happiness and grief, of our rise and fall,
                           They will be resurrected whenever we recall!
            What would you not do to restore to life the ones you have lost to death? I am not talking about voodoo or some black magic. I am talking about obituaries. These are small memoirs or biographical sketches of the deceased ones which are usually published in newspapers. These may also be in the form of a notice about an upcoming funeral or death anniversary, with details about the subject.

            Death is a loss that cannot be reimbursed, but it is inevitable and it is the truth of life. One cannot escape it. So mourning it will only increase the pain. Instead, by reliving the good old times and cherishing the best of the memories, we can make the distant souls rest in peace. 
            They might have left never to return, but their memories are there to linger. An obituary is the only way of paying reverence and expressing our affection for them, to preserve what is left of them, to make them immortal. 
The advent of technology has made it even easier to make our tribute through online obituary services. Life goes on and for those who have an overly busy schedule; these services have proven to be a boon.
             Ideated and founded by Mr. Rajith Rajappan and his colleague Ruhee Sabins, Oobituary.com is one such site that allows you to upload pictures, visuals, audios and videos to your page apart from the text. It is a platform where people from all over the world come together and share their feelings in the memory of their lost beloved. If you desire otherwise, you can also customize your page and make it accessible to only select friends and relatives and inform them by notify them by sending link to their email ids. After clicking on the link and signing up, they will be directed to your post, where they can comment. This page shall remain active till eternity unless you make a special request to delete your account.

 I assume you are talking of File:The Nines.jpg. I'm unfortunately not blessed with the gift of clairvoyance, so I have to go by what's on the image description page. You used the """"non-free image"""" upload form for it, thus admitting it was not a free work. It was also very obviously a promotional image, of the type that is almost always non-free. You neither bothered to fill in the fair-use data, nor say anything about a license you had. Hardly helpful of you. If you actually do have a license – and I mean a fully free one, and evidence of it – then you are of course welcome to re-upload the file, with proper data this time. If you don't have such a license, please don't bother re-uploading, because even with a fully filled-in fair use rationale it would never stand a chance, being replaceable.  ☼ """,0

I did not say what you repeatedly say I said. You have several times now said I should be blocked for calling somebody a """"cunt"""". You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to """"cancer"""". It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. nableezy - """,1

I haven't even read his latest reply at User talk:142.161.182.190. Maybe I will read it a few days later and reply then. But it's fruitless replying to him because he's so stuck on the fact that he's right even in the face of overwhelming evidence that he's wrong. He thinks like this. He doesn't understand at all that we follow what the sources say, except for when it suits him. And that he insists that the information in the Lesbianism in erotica article about studies showing that men are more sexually aroused by lesbian pornography than heterosexual pornography makes my head hurt. He acts like we are presenting opinions as fact, when all we are really do is presenting the findings of several studies  not one, but several. In his opinion, we shouldn't include this information because he doesn't consider the evidence strong enough. Yet he considers """"just googl[ing] the most purchased adult videos,"""" """"see[ing] what they're about"""" and this """"would correspond to male arousal quite well"""" to be strong enough evidence. Most heterosexual men buying heterosexual porn doesn't mean that most heterosexual men are more turned on by heterosexual porn than lesbian porn.

Dennis Brown, I saw your advice for User:MikeFromCanmore at User talk:142.161.183.162.

"This edit
This was reverted. When u use web news sites such as Tamilnet to esatblish facts outside of WP:SLR articles u will run into it. That's why I stay away from it as much as possible. You really do have to read WP rules very carefully such as WP:RS & WP:Verifiability. It says {[Quote|Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.[4] Reliable sources are necessary both to substantiate material within articles and to give credit to authors and publishers in order to avoid plagiarism and copyright violations. Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article and should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require high-quality sources.

In general, the most reliable sources are peer-reviewed journals and books published in university presses; university-level textbooks; magazines, journals, and books published by respected publishing houses; and mainstream newspapers. As a rule of thumb, the greater the degree of scrutiny involved in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the evidence and arguments of a particular work, the more reliable it is.

Academic and peer-reviewed publications are highly valued and usually the most reliable sources in areas where they are available, such as history, medicine and science. Material from reliable non-academic sources may also be used in these areas, particularly if they are respected mainstream publications. The appropriateness of any source always depends on the context. Where there is disagreement between sources, their views should be clearly attributed in the text.}} That's why we use Tamilnet as a QS not RS. You have thousands of peer reviewed academic books to establish the same facts using google books. No one will fight you then.",0

 Working It Out Tour 2010-2011 

The Working it out Tour started in 2010 with Traci K Shoop taking it to the next level of fitness.  By adding music with muscle and modeling.  She presented herself through the east coast and some west promoting health and music.  Presented in part for association FPLA to raise money  helping with her in transition and team artists and athletes become members to showcase to be promoted.  Traci's music was a hit on her teaser song Kiss me love me...with holiday added starting in December featuring her very first christmas album """" Tis the Season to be Sexy"""".  This album earned her credentials for a peoples choice nomination where voted amongst some of the top pop artists like Susan Doyle and Mariah Carey.  In this tour she went around presenting a way to help with hard times by giving back to support her coming back out from supporting the troops.  It landed her even top awards with Karaoke social networks. When making the top charts in with her """" Be My Santa BAby"""" it inspired her to bring out for the tour for kisses with the United States Entertainment organization with the service members.  With allowing her to get a chance to mission to meet and greet soldiers during the war time to give morale and become a long distance pen pal.  She herself committed 14 years as a spouse and served under contract training soldiers and families during the times when most effected by stress and abandonment.  Traci's goal as an artist and pro athlete was to bring as many people on the team to help with promoting them during transitional times asking other non service artists who were working to try and contribute financially or through contributions.  But to also honor the ones who like her served not under combat but through missions and it earned her loyality pin, coins and awards with national congressional committes. Where she placed on the board. The true inspiration to push to try and break from the low income of serving and being honored and recognized truly with demanding to be heard.  This tour was of course a struggle with many of the financial reasons and not allowing to spread the truth of what really goes on and how it effects families.  The way some are not truly appreciated on both ends when helping while others in the entertainment receive huge amounts of money and media exposure with little to ever be left for the ones who also work for their freedom.  To also showcase true health and fitness through the arts and science of things.  Which actually helped land her first emmy nomination in two categories in 2010.  

And also nominations with the carolina music awards and the independent music awards.

I'm happy to help, but unfortunately I won't have time to deal with this in any detail for about 10 days.  I agree that Stevecyberbunny'''s edits are inappropriate, but I don't agree that they're vandalism: edits are only considered vandalism if an editor is attempting to harm the article.  In this instance, I think the editor believes he his correcting inaccuracies.  In my opinion, he is adding material not supported by reliable sources.  While this is inappropriate, it's technically different from vandalism.  For example, if no reliable, published source explicitly says Matt the Knife is, as he put it in an earlier edit, """"facing scrutiny,"""" or that his records have been challenged, then the article shouldn't say those things either.

First I have to ask you if you have any connection to the subject in the article, because that will limit the ways in which can mitigate the problem.

I've personally chosen to multi-license all of the  and  contributions under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License so that other projects, such as WikiTravel, can use our articles.  I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all your contributions (or at minimum those on the geographic articles) so that we can keep most of the articles available under the multi-license.  Many users use the {{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}} template (or even {{MultiLicensePD}} for public domain) on their user page, but there are other templates for other options at Template messages/User namespace.  If you only prefer using the GFDL, I understand, but I thought I'd at least ask, just in case, since the number of your edits is in the top 100.  If you do want to do it, simply just copy and paste one of the above two templates into your user page and it will allow us to track those users who have done it. For example:

Option 1
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}
OR
Option 2
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}

 Saath Nibhaana Saathiya 

Hi again. I understand your willingness to help clean-up the (perhaps) poorly maintained articles of Indian television shows. I myself have contributed towards helping make the Saath Nibhaana Saathiya article somewhat more readable, although I haven't yet begun the momentous task of cleaning up the """"Plot"""" section, which would involve either watching several episodes or collating sources for episode descriptions. It is something that I will try to help clean-up shortly.

However, I have rearranged the cast table once more. My reasoning for this is that the actors names have never been promoted by the channel. They have always been referred to as their characters. Visit the Star Plus website (only the characters are mentioned)... look at the opening credits (only the production team is referred to)... and look at the promotional programming such as the Star Parivaar Awards (the actors names are never mentioned, and they accept awards dressed as their characters). This does imply that the name of the character looms larger in the public consciousness than the name of the actor, no matter how frustrating it may be from an encyclopedic point-of-view. Therefore, the character name is the most relevant to readers/visitors of Wikipedia, and it is these names that should be credited first, not the actors.

We only know the names of some actors thanks to sources such as The Times of India or other websites referenced on the Saath Nibhaana Saathiya page. Let me know.

(By the way - what did you mean in your edit description, """"third grade book report""""? I don't take kindly to being insulted. I'm merely trying to make the page functional and relevant, like you, and petty insults don't help matters.)

This article is about the first Pahlavi Shahanshah who toppled the Qajarid dynasty.

But not as surprising as the tone with which you have assumed.
 

As for Germany, you are not really in a position to compare the brutality of Kemalist autocrats in the Third World (Where much of the society was still held at a tribal level and required strong leaders to commence modernization on a national scale), with the cold-blooded campaign of eradicating """"Untermenschen"""" in the name of Aryan purity (Of which, you are nothing but thieving Germanic apes) during the WW2. Now that is what I call a stain that will never rub off. The same West Germany sold chemical weapons of mass destruction to Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war, where tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers in Iran still suffer from their effects.

And speaking of Gaddafi, the same NATO that hail themselves, ironically, as """"liberators of Libya"""" (In spite of causing civilian casualties) now want financial concessions from that war-torn country! Disgusting Westerner is still a disgusting Westerner.

Contrary to your inane ideas, you do not own me or Wikipedia. Do not tell me to be silent, or tell me how to write! And do not think that you can dictate what appears in Wikipedia!

The following statements will be personal. You have made that necessary. I made no personal reference toward you, or anyone else. However, you made an inaccurate, subjective attack against me. Note that I have never made any edit whatsoever to the entry in question. I only expressed my concern one time on the discussion page. And you continue to censor and vandalize my statement.

Yes, I realize that you immediately removed my comment because of your own racial prejudice. That is known as censorship. That is why I immediately reposted it, and why I am doing so again.

You obviously have a very limited knowledge of the English language, and might more appropriately edit the Spanish-language version. Your statements here, as well as the others that you sent to me personally, are false, incorrect, inaccurate, misleading, rude and belligerent. I did not attack you or anyone else. And my assertions are completely correct. You criticize my comment, even though you are not even capable of reading and understanding it. Your writing is unintelligible, and your allegations are unfounded. Try to at least read and understand the one, referenced, sentence. Martin did not """"found"""" a book, and he did not publish a foundation. The Ricky Martin Foundation has NEVER been published in ANY language. It certainly was not """"first published in Spanish"""". This one statement, alone, exemplifies your profound ignorance. You do not know the meaning of the word """"found"""". You have no idea what a foundation is. And you have absolutely no familiarity with the Ricky Martin Foundation. You are merely upset that I objected to the unnecessary, irrelevant use of Spanish on this English language wiki. Your objection is racially motivated and illegitimate. While I do not intend to elucidate the myriad of other examples, suffice it to say that a similar analysis would apply to every statement that you have made. You attempt to present yourself as an expert on everything, while in reality you are clueless in regard to most things.

Further, you try to condemn me for doing exactly what you are doing. However, I did not do those things. You presume to educate me, while it is painfully obvious that you are only a very poorly-educated person. You accuse me of making a personal attack that does not improve the article. But you are making false statements in order to advance your personal attack on me. The truth is that I have never made any edit to the article.

The arrogance of stupidity is astounding! I strongly suggest that you do not attempt to censor me, that you do attempt to acquire at least a rudimentary education, and that you do try to follow your own advice.66.166.137.98  """,0

I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

"pakistan can help the food security issues.  
pakistan is one of the rich most land on earth.poeple here have all the resources to grow food but they are limited by few factors,
1)..poor financial capabilities
2)..lack of education and probably more of orientation
3)..lack of institutional support
4)..traditions and customs
5)..poor electoral and ruling system
if these problems are addressed,pakistan will not only be able to overcome its own needs of food but also will be able to export food and food products thus helping the world to overcome the issues of food securities.
i put an example in front to make my point more clear.
muzaffargarh canal,,which runs through the centre region of muzaffargarh district is no doubt the hub of our agricultural system but it poses following problems also
1)the canal basin and margins are made of mud and not bricks or stones,,,resultantly a huge quantity seeps through and creats large pounds of stagnant water ,,regions called ,,same,,in local language..this huge amount of water is precious and would benifit the region if used for irrigation in tales of branches of the canal
2)..these areas are equally fertile if this issue is sttled and production of food will be doubled by eliminating this issue
3)..50 %of the cultivated land yeils much less than its capacity,,because of higher water table in the near by areas again due to seepage of water through canal
4)the land which is free from the above cited issue yeilds lesser due to non availabilty of water in the irrigation system timely..
thus by taking a single step of making the canal basin cemented floor.",0

I am not native but many of my friends and family are.  I see AIM in the same way as I assume many people in a variety of countries see their uprising residents on the national news.  The citizens screaming and calling for justice may not be speaking for the population as a whole; but they are the ones that make the news.  I think before you guys make opinions based on what the media tells you; you should find out if the average tribal member agrees with Russel Means or Leonard Peltier.  You should also research how much time they actually spent on the reservation.  Again I am no expert but from what I know growing up here is that AIM and many others like them were extreme liberals that were not necessarily speaking for the society at large.  I just feel that this is similiar as basing views of the Muslim world based on the extremest you see on TV.  I would like to see someone who actually was a neutral member of the Lakota tribe that grew up here to set us all straight and until then to take both sides with a grain of salt.

Typically, when Xenophrenic sees a valid edit (by wiki policy) that he disapproves of (for whatever reason), he seeks to get others to remove it. This strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance, or needs the proper context, or isn't the full story, etc. There are many different reasons used, but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense ( > 2 to 1 ratio in his POV) that average editors cringe when they see it. Xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced POV version can ONLY stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper context. This leads to edit warring over days and even weeks, articles often get locked down. Some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article. Xenophrenic gets what he wanted all along, and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring. Some call this tactic a form of wiki-terrorism, I say it shows that Xenophrenic is quite calculated and intelligent, even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions. Talk

 Zero-Hysteresis Transformerless tube amplification 

In this edit on 19 Mar 2014, Drmies removed this text

Zero-Hysteresis Transformerless tube amplification  In 2009, Milbert introduced a tube guitar amplifier which eliminates the traditional audio output transformer (and all traditional power supply magnetics) by using Berning's patented ZOTL circuit to almost perfectly (and bi-directionally) mate power tubes (in any combinations) and speaker load, resulting in transfer characteristics being accurately and fully conveyed between tubes and speaker(s).

and asserted, """"(Zero-Hysteresis Transformerless tube amplification: no verification, no suggestion that this esoteric brand needs special mention in the general article (only differencetransformerless))"""".

It should be pointed out that there are many advantages offered by the patented ZOTL Technology, including ultra light-weight (due to no audio output or bulky power supply magnetics); automatic standby capability; ability to use any common vacuum tubes in any combinations (and have them automatically biased); freedom from 60 Hz powerline hum; ability to automatically drive any practical output impedance(s) and also total-opens and dead-shorts even at full power without destruction (of non-existent traditional audio output transformer) due to high-voltage flyback, arcing and consequent insulation breakdown; and an unequaled purity of tube tone due to the complete elimination of all otherwise inescapable audible parasitics.

 Middle Bass Island 

Norman,

you have removed the link to the main Middle Bass Island web site several times. That means you don't even look at the contents of the items you remove, which is rather petty and incredibly arrogant.

The site started as a non-commercial site and contains a great deal of island history as well as many, many island pictures. It's one of the most popular sites in the Lake Erie Islands.

Please take a look at """"Site Map Page 1"""" and """"Site Map Page 2"""" before removing the link again. Saying that the hundreds of pages listed there have only commercial value is idiotic.

The site was started out of love for the Lake Erie Islands and Middle Bass Island and the fact that it now carries a number of ads for island businesses does not change the fact that it is mainly a site with island information not available anywhere else.

So what is your real rationale for deleting it again and again and again???

Hi Harebag!  Welcome!  When I saw the article on the Pigeon Force Police 
Department, I thought it was a joke.  It is real.  I also started a new article on Larry Buendorf.  He's a secret service agent that wrestled a presidential assassin to the ground.  Any suggestions for improvement, let me know.  As for your article, I suggest a little background.  Mention the city and state name.  Fix the link.  Good Luck on editing!  

Additional suggestions for Pigeon Force PD: Who's the chief? Any major history? Big crime solved? Any controversy or major lawsuit against it? When was it established? Was the area patrolled by the county sheriff before then and then the city was established (if so when?).  These are just tips.  Otherwise, there is a risk that someone will petition for the article's deletion because there is a board for that (thus destroying your hard work).  That's the reason that I wrote quite a bit about my new article first rather than just start out with a few sentences and add to it slowly.  I do plan to add more to my article, though.

religious discrimination
we are struggling to justify the existence of this article, since no government discriminates against """"Neopaganism"""". At best, they discriminate against fringe religious groups in general. All flavours of neopaganism fall under this heading. Saying that religious discrimination may take place in states where there is no complete separation of church and state isn't biased in any direction, it is strictly a tautology intended to elucidate the nature of 'religious discrimination'.

 Spanish heraldry 

As a respected contributor to the above article, you're probably best placed to deal with the issues with it. If you want to take it on, I believe there is a lack of: inline citations in particular; good English; and specificity - parts of the article explain heraldry in general, and are not sufficiently (IMHO) to be included in the article (eg. most of the Definitions section).

 BCN-SIA discussion 

First, sorry because my poor english.

Hi, i don't want to start a undo-war or something like that, but the avionews post is only a rumour. It's a propaganda speech from a Milan SEA not a declaration of any SIA officer.

I've talked with the SIA spanish comercial manager and he says me that the italian SIA officers inmediatly deny that issue, nor the SIA-BCN cancellation, nor the FCO-MXP flights traspassing... and all is a simply propaganda from Milan in this moments of crisis. This was also confirmed by SIA London regional headquarters...

Unfortunately, I haven't found any italy/UK SIA press relase dennying the Milan SEA president affirmations but i think that informations that I have are enough to question the avionews article.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Because of that, I have """"twicked"""" the comment from """"until summer 2009"""" to """"probably until summer 2009, in which they could codeshare with other Star Alliance partners""""
In the article, the text refered (Today the SiA flights carry out the Singapore-Malpensa-Barcelona route but in short time the flight will be reduced to Singapore-Malpensa route, while the continuation to Barcelona will be assured by Lufthansa Italia), is not referenced as Bonomi's words but as an explanation by Avionews.
The comments is not anymore an affirmation but a puntuation between brackets. Sincerely, I fail to see your urge to remove it. Cheers. MauritiusXXVII (Aut Disce, Aut Doce, Aut Discede!).

"My explanation
Hi,
I'm glad you like the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section. Thanks!
The reason for my edit is that the paragraph you are referring to:
 Some of the leading providers of multitracking software for a personal computer....
is repeated twice in the article. 

If you read the History section's last paragraph you will see it there. Then if you read the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section, you will see it there as well with a slight addition.

I deleted this paragraph from the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section, since it had to be deleted from either one of the two sections. 

The reason I deleted it from the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section is because the History section has a line about how multitracking software has been written for personal computers:
 At the same time, with the power of the personal computer increasing, multitracking software was written for it ... 
And this is where this paragraph was originally.

If you see the edit differences between my deletion and your addition, you will clearly see the paragraph appearing  twice.

If you think that the paragraph belongs in the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section instead of the History section, that works for me too!

Hope you will find my explanation adequate.",0

There are two different issues with the introduction.  The first is style - this is supposed to be a very easy-to-read introduction.  The description as intersecting spheres is covered in much detail later in the article.  Since the article is already very long, perhaps another description is not needed in the introduction.

The second issue is the number of satellites needed.  This is 3 with an accurate clock (a ns or so will suffice).  This gives the distance to 3 satellites, which is enough to determine position.  (These will be 2 solutions, but only one can be close to the surface of the Earth, so this is not a practical problem.)

"It's a good question. I've kind of gone back and forth on it over the years, but I've been finding lately that when I've been updating licensees as a result of an acquisition, I've been linking the licensees to the owner's page more often (or at least when I remember to do so). In fact, while I was FCC-less today, I was starting to look at categorization of the larger owners, which is kind of related. The only reason I did the iHeartMedia linking today was because I checked my Watchlist last night for the first time in a while, and saw that there'd been a bunch of changes made in error to the licensees a week or so ago. I figured that while I was cleaning them up anyway, adding the link made sense, and then it was suggested to me that the redirects made more sense than the piping.

Yes, I'd say each of the state pages should absolutely be uniform, just the same as how the alphabetical lists are uniform and the frequency pages are at least uniform-ish. I'd lean toward linking all of the columns other than the frequency, although I wouldn't suggest redlinking licensees where the owner doesn't have a page. That said, that's just my opinion - it's a question that should probably be put to the project, to see what those who are still active in the project think.

 Plot: 

The film opens with Lord Voldemort stealing the Elder wand from Albus Dumbledore's tomb and shooting a large bolt of lightning into the sky. It then cuts to Hogwarts which is no longer a colorful castle of magic, but a shadowy concentration camp surrounded by Dementors with the students being marched through the Entrance Courtyard. Severus Snape stands in the top of the castle and watches the students with a blank expression.
At Shell Cottage, Harry Potter sits in front of Dobby's grave, gazing into the one way mirror. He suspects that there is a Horcrux in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts so he, Ron and Hermione strike a deal with Griphook: he will get them into Gringotts Wizarding Bank to find the Horcrux if they give him the Sword of Gryffindor, a bargain to which they reluctantly agree. Harry then questions Ollivander, who examines and identifies the stolen wands of Bellatrix Lestrange and Draco Malfoy. While he confirms that Draco's wand is safe to use, he cautions Harry about Bellatrix's wand, as it is """"unyielding"""" and might be dangerous unless its allegiance has changed. Harry then asks him if he knows about the Deathly Hallows and Ollivander claims he does not think they exist, although Harry knows he told Voldemort about the Elder Wand and is determined to kill Voldemort first.

With Harry and Griphook under the Invisibility Cloak, Hermione disguised as Bellatrix and Ron as a foreign wizard with bushy facial hair, the trio and Griphook apparate to Gringotts. During the first phase of the mission Harry and Ron are forced to use the Imperius Curse on Bogrod to cover up Hermione's unsuccessful impersonation of Bellatrix. They manage to get into the vault despite their disguises being removed by The Thief's Downfall, and inside the vault they find Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, the Horcrux, but set off the Geminio curse, causing everything they touch to multiply exponentially. Griphook takes the sword from them after they get the cup, saying that he never said he would help them get out, only in. He runs for it and calls security, the trio are almost crushed by the gold and captured but Hermione gets them to jump on the back of a dragon kept as a security measure. Setting the dragon free, it wreaks havoc killing several goblins (including Bogrod), crashing through the roof and flying off with the trio on its back. After jumping off the dragon into a lake, Harry has a vision of Voldemort furiously killing Griphook and many other Gringotts employees and personnel at Malfoy Manor for allowing his Horcrux to get stolen. Choosing to keep Nagini by his side, he summons his followers and orders them to invade Hogwarts to ensure the Horcrux he hid there is still safe.

Having sensed Voldemort thinking of his Horcrux and Hogwarts through their connection, Harry tells the other two they have to go there and destroy it before Voldemort can get to it, and that Voldemort seems to be getting more fragile with each Horcrux destroyed. They apparate to Hogsmeade but immediately trigger alarms set up by Death Eaters, waiting for Harry. The trio are almost captured but Aberforth Dumbledore gets them safely into his home and berates them for coming to the village. Harry discovers that it was him who had been watching them through the mirror shard and him who sent Dobby to rescue them before after seeing the Two-Way mirror hung up on the wall. Aberforth provides them with food and tells them to give up on their mission, go into hiding and save themselves. Harry said that he trusts Dumbledore's judgement that the task has to be seen through no matter what, but Aberforth insists that Albus had left them a suicide mission and it was hopeless. After Harry insisted on finishing what he had started, Aberforth summoned Neville Longbottom through a secret passage behind Ariana's portrait to bring them into Hogwarts. Bruised and beaten by the Death Eaters of the staff, Neville and most of the students have been hiding in the Room of Requirement all year. They welcome Harry in with tremendous applause and jump at the idea of helping Harry finish Voldemort but Harry still doesn't know what the Horcrux looked like or where it was. After saying it might be connected to Ravenclaw, Luna suggests that Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem might be it, despite no one alive today having seen it. Ginny arrives and after gazing at Harry for a moment tells everyone that Snape was now aware of Harry's break in and wanted everyone in the Great Hall.

In the hall, Snape orders anyone who may hold information regarding Harry's location to tell him immediately or face punishment. Harry then reveals himself after hiding within the crowd and rebukes Snape for standing where Dumbledore once stood as Headmaster, ordering him to tell the students the truth of how he betrayed and killed Dumbledore as Order Of The Phoenix members enter the Great Hall.

Indeed numerous Iranian media pointed that out right away.  That is why I support the idea of including """"Jewish"""" at the beginning of that sub-section of the article.  It is not to """"single out"""" Pilz because he is jewish per se, it is because both Iranian media as well as officials from Foreign Ministry have called it a part of the on-going Zionst smear campaign against Iran.   Pilz' """"early anouncements"""",  had claimed that both final candidates of the Iranian presidency were mentioned in his """"extraordinarily reliable Agent D"""" report.  So no matter which candidate won, he would have smeared the winner.   He had anticipiated that Rajsanjani wins (like most people expected) so he had initially put the focus more on Rafsanjani.  As an Iranian, I also feel this is coordinated. It is indeed hard to explain how the major Western media would be so quick to report all those allegatoins (which so far have turned out to be false) without even a cursory investigation. How could for example, AP, Reuters and AFP all three make the same mistake at the same time? And it wasn't even on just one allegation, it was on multiple.  So multiple News Agencies, making multiple mistakes that a pro would hardly ever do, all at the same time?  And I have seen a pattern like this for years on numerous other anti-Iran smear reports.  Also, you might notice how so many people involved in this very article are Jews or at least their edit history clearly shows their pro-Zionist stance.  I don't think that is accidental either, they are voluntary """"contributors"""" to the same  smear campaign because they view Islamic Iran as a threat to Zionism.  The same people also have an """"interest"""" on the Rafsanjani article and probably many other Iran-related articles.  """,0

"""Read this Article

It all started about 3 months ago. An innocent girl was diagnosed of (curable) kidney cancer at Eko Hospital. All was well from the beginning, she was admitted and went through the operation of removing one kidney (primary source of the cancer). After all the fear for the worse, prayers and the pains she went through, the operations was successful and all was well again. She started gaining back her weight, cracking jokes and doing every continued living normally.

She was discharged from the hospital, and was told to come back in the next couple of weeks to start (radiotherapy treatment) (Doomed)
We all know what radiotherapy involves and there is nothing wrong in the treatment, but the manner the patient was been treated using the new radiotherapy device, with little or know knowledge of how it operates.

She has to go through a one month of the radiotherapy treatment, 6 mins per day. Monday to Friday every week. Now she's lost plenty of weight, loss of appetite, always in pain, vomiting and diarrhea and every radiotherapy symptoms you can think of. By now, the fear in the family is intensely growing.

I believe a patient in that kind of situation should be in an intensive care of the hospital in question, but eko hospital sent her home with some paracetamol. They said, in the next couple of weeks she would be fully okay and they insisted in her continuation of the treatment.

By now, everything you can think of is happening to this little girl, she's as skinny as you can describe it. From time to time she asks if she's going to survive this, and everyone around her said yes based on what they were told at Eko Hospital, one person accidentally said, """"madam I'll tell you the truth, your day is doomed and she will not make it, just take her home and pray for the rest of her life."""" patient mother confronted the doctors with this matter and they said that """"the head nurse that shared that information does not work in their department and knows nothing about what she's talking about"""".

To cut the very long story short, on the 2nd of October, yesterday, she has to be rushed into the hospital, she said """" I don't want to stay at home, I want to be in the hospital, I believe I will be okay when we get to the hospital"""" When they got to the nearest hospital to their home, they refused her why, because they do not have loads of cash at hand at that moment in time, they progressed further to the next hospital where they required instant deposit as well. Then finally progressed to a further hospital where instant cash is also required.

She herself begged the last doctor, because she doesn't want to go home. Now the time is 1.am all at home trying to make this poor girl comfortable as she was in pain all over, this is a very bright 19 year old girl for God's Sake. 2 am, now she's now twitching all over, and mumbling some word we do not understand. the last sensible sentence she made was """"you, you, you have new clothes, I'm happy for you o, I will tell my daddy and my mummy they will buy clothe for me too""""

They had to rush her to EKO Hospital, at the early hours of the morning, like about 4.30 am, right outside the hospital she was confirmed dead!

She'll be buried today Wednesday, October 2007. Another potential Nigerian youth gone.

Although, she's gone, I want you guys to know that this is something that can happen to anybody. Though cancer is not actually the course of her death, but the treatment given to her and the manner the treatment was used.

Key Points
Misleading Information by eko hospital to patient family
throughout this ordeal, only 1 blood transfusion was done.
On her death certificate primary course of death """"Malabsorbtion"""" secondary course of death """"renal failure"""" Note not cancer.
This is poor negligence, this girl would have been alive if not for the negligence.

I want the medical lawyers in this forum to shed some light, at the moment, take me as a very angry man, because the 19 year old angel is my baby sister.

Update1
At the burial ground a doctor had to be called out on emergency, because when her friends asked to open the casket to see her face for the last time, she was sweating. All hope high again, like there's going to be another miracle of the century, we were all confused and wondering why someone confirmed dead will be sweating.

Though we'd thought that it's possible because' she'd just been brought out of ice,  But when a doctor arrived he reconfirmed her dead, and he said that the sweating is possible due to some reasons he mentioned, 

Anyway we've buried her now, but another question arises, was she actually dead or unconcious when they confirmed she was dead?, Cos the staff that",0

 God created everything in six days and rested on the seventh  

The article states that """"The text of Genesis relates that God created everything in six days and rested on the seventh.""""  And I agree if you do a casual reading of English translations.  However, some commentaters, notably E. W. Bullinger, argue that the six days describes the creation of the new world after the """"world that was"""".  I have researched and understand Bullinger's argument.  I will present it here.

NIV:

Ge 1:1  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2  Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

KJV:

 Ge 1:1  In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

Now, the English word """"formless"""" in the NIV and the english words """"without form"""" in the KJV are translations of the Hebrew word tohu, G/K Number H9332 and Strong's Number H8414.  The Strongs Concordance lists one of the meanins of toho as """"to lie waste"""" or simply """"waste.""""  

Likewise, the english word """"empty"""" in the NIV and the english word """"void"""" in the KJV is translated from the Hewbrew bohu, G/K Number H983 and Strong's Number H922.  Strong's Concordance provides one of the definitions of bohu as ruin.

Consequently, it is argued that the verses could be considered something like ~ """"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2  Now the earth was waste and ruin, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.""""

Furthermore, Bullinger's observations continue to, and link 2Pe3:6, which states (KJV) 2Pe3:6 """"Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.""""  Bullinger believes that this is a reference to Ge1:1-2, and not the flood during Noah's time.  He concludes with """"The creation in eternity past, to which all fossils and remains belong.""""  (Companion Bible, page 3).

Consequently, the articles should include, in my opinion, the fact that some theologians reject the young Earth on literal grounds.

See the Bullinger's side notes [].

Also, a quick google search will show that other literal interpreters [] with Bullinger.  

To summarize:  The article should be changed to reflect the fact that some literal interpreters of the Bible do not think the Earth is roughly 6000 years old.   Vacuous Poet""",0

 Reviews and meta-analyses...get your secondary sources, folks! 

There are 398 papers that fall under the """"Reviews"""" tab at PubMed on the query """"Homeopathy"""" (out of 3545 total papers). Below are a selection of interesting papers (that my institution can access) from the last couple of years, with money-quotes from abstract conclusions. I stopped after a couple dozen, travelling back to ~2002; this list isn't close to exhaustive, but it may prove useful for discussion & article building. Any responses should probably be made in a new section, or a subsection of this one, just for navigational clarity.

There is currently little evidence for the efficacy of homeopathy for the treatment of ADHD.

...some homeopathically prepared remedies show promise for reducing infarct size and associated impairments...Individualized homeopathy may even play a helpful adjunctive role in treatment of sepsis. However, a great deal of systematic research effort lies ahead before most of the options discussed would meet mainstream medical standards for introduction into routine treatment regimens.

...experiments with a high methodological standard could demonstrate an effect of high potencies. No positive result was stable enough to be reproduced by all investigators. A general adoption of succussed controls, randomization and blinding would strengthen the evidence of future experiments.

The evidence from rigorous clinical trials of any type of therapeutic or preventive intervention testing homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments is not convincing enough for recommendations in any condition.

The [studies] were generally of low methodological quality...Homeopathic medicines, tested in HPTs, appear safe. The central question of whether homeopathic medicines in high dilutions can provoke effects in healthy volunteers has not yet been definitively answered, because of methodological weaknesses of the reports...

The results suggest that, for several treatments, the risk-benefit profile is encouraging...For other therapies the evidence is weak or contradictory: homeopathy...

Complex Homoeopathy...showed inconclusive results.

effectiveness of homeopathy can be supported by clinical evidence and professional and adequate application be regarded as safe.

 My reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the Nicosia Discussion page....l 

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

So I think I understand why my original post was deleted - basically because I was unable to enter the correct article within the 90 seconds from creation to deletion.  If this is correct, can you please tell me if this article would be acceptable.  I plan on adding bio's for all the museums artist's, so please let me know where, if any, I am not in compliance with wiki.

In which case if somebody does otherwise, are subject to some type of law violation. If this is accurate, then what you're advocating is tyranny by definition, not freedom, nor liberty.

That website is of ex-BKs so they have lots of information about BK.
