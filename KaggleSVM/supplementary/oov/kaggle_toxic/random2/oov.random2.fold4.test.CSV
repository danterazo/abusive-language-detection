"""I can't offer an offical document either, that the classical language category was introduced by a constitutional decree, but there are many notifications, that are not published on the internet, like the official notification, that Tamil was declared """"Classical language"""". However, there are newspaper reports, which confirm, that the classical language category was introduced by constitutional decree. So this is enough to prove it:

http://www.deccanherald.com/CONTENT/Aug142008/editpage2008081384442.asp

Also i found a conversation of the Indian parliament, which illustrates the importance of the classical language status for India, where Mr. Shivraj V. Patil compares the status of the scheduled languages to the status of the classical languages:

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: Sir, the demand for declaring Kannada as a classical language is pending before the Government since 2004. The same answer has been given earlier also. My submission before the House is that the Kannada text and recorded history belongs to 252 BC. The first Kannada literary work Kavirajamarga was created in 850 AD and it refers to some writings earlier than that. The 12th Centaury Kannada Bhakti Movement in the form of Vachana or oral expression is unparallel. In contemporary kirtana which subsequently became Karnataka Sangeet is an enduring contribution to Indian music. Sir, the epigraphical material in Kannada, numbering over 25,000 inscriptions in stone and copper, are rich in style and contents, which are not found even in Tamil inscription. The UNESCO records Kannada amongst the prime scripts of the world. Sir, Kannada is among the first living languages of the world in the history of continuous writing system spanning three millennium like Hebrew, Chinese and Tamil.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY (CONTD): Sir, the recognition was given to Tamil. We do not grudge it. Now, Sir, when the world recognises Kannada, in India...

MR. CHAIRMAN: Please, put your question.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: ...step-motherly treatment is being given to Karnataka. Agitations are going on in Karnataka. About three days back, about one lakh people gathered. Everyday, it is going on. Has the Government recognised this? Is the Government going to take any action on this, and by what time?

SHRI SHIVRAJ V. PATIL: Sir, Kannada is a very rich language, ancient language. The matter is before the Committee of Linguistic Experts
constituted by the Ministry of Culture. This matter is now with the Ministry of Culture. They are looking into the matter. There are demands made by one other section of the society with respect to their language. Now, these demands are being looked into by the Expert Committee, and after the Expert Committee comes to any conclusion, the Ministry of Culture will take a decision in the matter.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: Sir, in reply to Unstarred Question No. 1381, it was stated, """"The Ministry of Culture had received presentation from various quarters for declaring Kannada as classical language. A Committee of Linguistic Experts has been constituted to examine the claims of any language classical language status. This Committee will advise the Government in the matter."""" This answer was given on 6.3.2006. Subsequently, to me also, the Minister of Culture has replied saying that it has been referred. Now, the question before the House is as to how long it will go on like this. There is a limit to the patience of the people also. They are losing their patience. You may not believe, but they are condemning and criticising the Parliamentarians and saying that Karnataka M.P.'s are dormant; they are inactive.

MR. CHAIRMAN: Please, ask the question. Don't make a statement.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: How long will the Government take a decision? After being referred to the Expert Committee, there has been a lapse of one year, what action is going to be taken by the Government?

MR. CHAIRMAN: Mr. Poojary, this is a supplementary question. Please, ask the question. Don't make a statement.

SHRI SHIVRAJ V. PATIL: As a matter of fact, this question should have been sent to the Ministry of Culture. But, because, the notice was given to us, and the notice was given at the last moment, the question was accepted and we are replying to it. As a matter of fact, it is only the Ministry of Culture which is in a position to take a decision with respect to this, and I would like to say that the language should unit; language should not divide. Many languages in our country are rich languages and they should be a source of our unity rather than division. So, it would be necessary for all of us to tell our brothers and sisters in the States that on the basis of language, division should not be created. Because the languages are rich; because the languages are ancient; because...(Interruptions).

"The reasons I dont contribute to Wikipedia anymore 
Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology. I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance.

"Hazel Eye Myth==

The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some insatnces can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. 

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America and areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green within the gold and/or on the outskirts when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.

As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown. 110.174.147.166

"I think you don't see what I mean. My concern is not with the content but with the terminology. The word 'basin' has three definitions: a structural/tectonic one, a sedimentary one and a geomorphological one. All three seem in some way to apply to the London Basin (and the exact boundaries of the London Basin may differ depending on the definition!). The word syncline only has one definition, a structural one. The original sentense called an apple a kind of pear. 
I agree with you that the synclinal structure is essential and should be discussed, preferably in the header of the article. But a syncline is in itself not a sedimentary basin. It is a structure on its own. The occurence of a syncline at the core of a basin is, however, usually not accidental. When strata are folded, someone may of course think the synclines will form a basin. In nature though, uplift is never quick enough to create structural basins in this way, certainly not at the scale of the London Basin. Erosion will remove the anticlines and sediments will fill the synclines almost instantly (instantly in geologic time). As folding continues, so will erosion and sedimentation. Eventually a structure will form which is both a structural syncline and a sedimentary basin (a basin in the sense of: a place where sediments have accumulated). This model is called syn-tectonic deposition (or syn-depositional folding). As far as I see, this may well be the case for the London Basin, but I am not sure since we haven't found conclusive information in the sources yet.
There is another way how the strata can be folded into a syncline: pre-tectonic deposition (or post-depositional folding). It is important to find out which of the two models applies. The test will be that in a syntectonic basin, the strata will wedge out in the direction of the edges, while in a pre-tectonic basin, the strata will on average have the same thickness everywhere. The outcrop pattern on the geologic map doesn't show the difference, because the map is not detailed enough.
That the older strata of the Chalk are also folded by the syncline is clear, but I don't see what that has to do with the basin on top of them?",0

I don't understand post signing but I think note 117 ending the section on Justice Verma Commission is very misleading.

This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add  on the top of the page (below the existing db tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.",0

A Blog Or Not a Blog, that is the question

Editor Canderra argues that the sources below are blogs and has deleted the material. The material is still not present in the article but no other editor has bothered to confirm or deny these assertions (For whatever reason).  Please take your time now to review the section and check the sources for yourself, lets see if they really are blogs.

New York Sun writer, Williams Myers, labels Che as a """"sociopathic thug"""". Other US newspaper critics have made similar remarks. They point out that Che Guevara was responsible for the torture and execution of hundreds of people in Cuban prisons, and the murder of many more peasants in the regions controlled or visited by his guerrilla forces. Contrary to Che supporters, these critics also argue that Che was a blundering tactician with no recorded combat victories. They claim that Che failed medical school in Argentina and that there is no evidence that he earned a medical degree.  They note that Che murdered individuals on dubious grounds and took their property, seized private manors for himself, and distributed property among communist bureaucrats rather than the peasants. The also state that he not only oversaw the prison, over which he ordered the execution of hundreds if not thousands of Cubans, but also helped institute forced labor camps when volunteerism failed. Finally, these critics believe that Che was a major failure at managing the Cuban economy as he """"oversaw the near-collapse of sugar production, the failure of industrialization, and the introduction of rationing—all this in what had been one of Latin America’s four most economically successful countries since before the Batista dictatorship."""",,

Some critics, such as Che-Mart, have merchandised their dislike of Che Guevara by marketing t-shirts poking fun at both Che Guevara and his supporters, for example, pointing out what they percieve as an irony: Che Guevara as one of capitalisms hotest selling images.

They are not blogs.  Put the material back in.""",0

 Song move 

You gave me some good advice about moving and redirecting pages. Thank you.

Unfortunately, I made a real mess when I tried to move """"Let It Snow"""" to """"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!""""  When I did the redirect, I accidentally mistyped the title as """"Let It Snow! Let It Snoe! Let It Snow!"""" (notice the """"Snoe"""") and forgot to look before I leapt. If that wasn't bad enough, I then went to the Redirect page for """"Let It Snow"""" and, instead of leaving the misspelling alone, I changed it to redirect to """"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!"""" (the correct spelling), thus creating that page, which did not previously exist. Thus, when I tried to change the misspelled name to the correct name, I of course got the error that the other page already exists.  

Not to mention that there were some double redirects when I looked in """"What links here,"""" which I was going to start to fix until I realized how badly I messed up the original move. (It turns out that someone had renamed the page in 2005, with no discussion, from """"Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow"""" to """"Let It Snow,"""" a move I would have vehemently protested if I'd been hanging around here at the time.) 

I need some help to undo this. The simplest thing would be to delete the current """"redirect"""" page for the correct title and resume from there, renaming my misspelled page and then looking at the redirects again, but I can't delete pages, and I know the rules about cutting and pasting.  """,0

 Are you an admin, Lomn? If so, a little help? 

An admin by the name of User:Freakofnurture seems to have had a really bad time lately and when I try to reason with him and make him feel better towards me, nothing good came out of it. Evidently, other parts of his life landed him """"on the warpath"""", therefore, he has gotten enraged at me for comparatively small things.

I got worried when I messaged him in IRC the other day but he never replied. He reverted an edit of mine (even though it fit the subject), so I decided to leave a message on his user talk page. As I'll post below, I was trying to make him feel better, at least towards me (although I guess I tried to make him feel better overall.) See? It just blows up in my face. Then he tells me to leave him alone. Not only did that throw me into a depression, if he wants me to leave him alone, then he should do the same to me by not watching and going after my edits. As of right now, if he goes after my edits in any way, he just reminds me of how he so bluntly and uncompassionately shunned me, ignored me, and did exactly the opposite of what I wanted from him.

I was about to post it onto WP:RFC but a guideline states that at least two people had to fail to resolve a dispute first.

So to kind of reiterate: What I want is for Freakofnurture to treat me in any way that doesn't invoke negative feelings in me, or if he still wants to leave me alone, for Freakofnurture to let another admin watch my edits and go after them if necessary. In any case, I don't want to feel hated nor shunned by this guy for any reason, even whenever I simply see his name.  

Here is the conversation between him and I. In what sentences did I mistakenly make him feel worse?:

 Bad Mood? 

You seem to be in a bad mood constantly, starting from that one night. You never responded to my PMs on the IRC chat, and I saw your userpage. Is something bugging you in real life? I hope things get better for you man.

But, the resulting view seems to imply bias in your preceding considerations. For instance, you've assumed I wanted Roux gone, when there's never been any such expressed desire from me, either im- or explicitly, neither before nor now. It also seems that you've excused Roux for some of the behaviour you admonish me for (not to say I feel I should be excused from anything I've done).
If I may express my opinion, Roux is a good editor, but generally only when working alone or without opposition or critique; yes, I bare my own biases, but I come to that conclusion having seen his interactions with others in addition to my own experiences, and recent events seem to show that it isn't changing. It is my sense that in these circumstances he genuinely believes himself to be a victim, and, seemingly sensing some threat, responds to the most gentle criticism with the most vicious vitriol. While that can cause some problem in itself, the preverbal shit hits the fan when thrown into the mix are stubborn individuals who don't buy his claims of innocence and casualty, after which the intensity of the conflict increases exponentially. If it wasn't already obvious: I am one of those stubborn persons, believing we alone are responsible for our own actions. Thus, I honestly don't for one minute buy that Roux was """"driven"""" to do anything; he chose to participate here in the manners that he did, both good and bad, and he chose to leave; just as I chose to participate in the manners that I did, chose to leave, chose to come back, chose to leave again, chose to come back, and choose to admit much of my editing habits were the wrong way to go about things.

I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am.

I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22.

 Dear AndyTheGrump, if the PUBLISHED and REFERENCED decision of EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECtHR) on Armenian """"Genocide"""" is not a PUBLISHED RELIABLE source, then what is a reliable source??212.174.38.3  

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

It is NOT an alphabet, no Indian script is an alphabet! An """"alphabet"""" is a writing system which conveys a (near) one-to-one correspondence between sounds and graphemes. This includes the representation of EVERY VOWEL AND EVERY COONSONANT. In the Indian scripts, consonants are the basic symbols and vowels are written as diacritics, and they can be before, after, above, or below the consonant depending on what the vowel is. Also, there is one vowel (a) which is inherent and is not written unless it begins a word. Also all consonant clusters are written as ligatures, which an alphabet does not do. This script, and every other script from India, is what's called an ABUGIDA. An abugida is NOT AN ALPHABET. You don't have unwritten vowel sounds in an alphabetic system! Hebrew and Arabic are not alphabets either, they are ABJADS, since they normally do not write vowels at all, no matter which vowel it is. But systems that do write vowels as DIACRITICS (NOT independent letters) are abugidas.

"'Neutral POV' in conflict with mainstream scientific consensus? 

This article, like all Wiki's, purports to have:-

i) 'Scientific focus: Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and its content on scientific and quasi-scientific topics will primarily reflect current mainstream scientific consensus.'

and

ii) 'Neutral point of view as applied to science: Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, a fundamental policy, requires fair representation of significant alternatives to scientific orthodoxy. Significant alternatives, in this case, refers to legitimate scientific disagreement, as opposed to pseudoscience.'

Surely there is already a cultural bias, in the West, reflected in its science, which effectively imposes some kind of Conversion therapy (or its opposite?) on its citizens: there is a manufactured consensus, arrived at by undemocratic and concealed means, that 'it's okay to be LGBT,' which doesn't come clean about the physical and social consequences.80.229.223.248",0

I deleted this:
 Using contemporary computational technology, it would take on the order of 10250 years to exhaust all possible 2-colourings of graphs of size 43. (However, many of these colourings are isomorphic to each other, and an intelligent algorithm that only checks unique colourings could get the task done in as little as 10220 years.) Brute-force enumeration ceases to be practical much earlier: the number of unique 2-colourings of a graph on 18 nodes is already an intractable 1.788*1030.
The main reason is that it is simply not true. Nobody would try to look at all possible colourings one at a time as there are much better ways.  Looking at all colourings is not possible for graphs of size greater than 13 (and very expensive for size 13), yet many larger Ramsey numbers can be found exactly via computer search. In other words, this type of calculation does not correctly indicate the difficulty of searching. A secondary reason is that blogs are not permitted as sources in Wikipedia, see WP:BLOGS.",0

 I heard you like hamburgers. 

  The Hamburglar is a McDonaldland character who features in McDonald's commercials. He is a close friend of Ronald McDonald, Grimace, and Birdie. Even though he has always attempted (and failed) to hoard all the hamburgers in McDonaldland for himself, he has always been looked upon as a valued member of the McDonaldland community.

History
Despite a few changes made to his appearance over the years, he has always been endearingly loved by fans all over the world. A pint-sized burglar who first appeared in March 1971 and was one of the first villains on the commercials. He was dressed in a black-and-white hooped shirt and pants, a red cape, a wide-brimmed hat, and red gloves. His primary object of theft was hamburgers, hence his name. The character, like Grimace, started out as a villain, only he was old, had a long nose, gray hair, and was called the Lone Jogger in some 1970s commercials, sporting a shirt that said """"Lone Jogger"""". Hamburglar spoke in gibberish which was often translated by Captain Crook.

He was revised in 1985, when his look changed from a trollish old man to a red-head Dennis the Menace-type child who spoke and wore a shorter-brimmed hat and a black cape with yellow on the inside. His previously-unintelligible muttering was now the familiar """"robble robble."""" In """"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald,"""" he took on a new, sporty appearance wearing green goggles, a leather jacket, striped shirt, shorts and sneakers. He loved playing tricks on his friends and still loved burgers. The last appearances of Hamburglar on television were prime time commercials promoting the dollar menu. Hamburglar was voiced by Howard Morris in most commercials, Charlie Adler in some 1980s commercials and """"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald""""; and Carl W. Wolfe in some 1990s commercials.
Hamburglar 2015
In 2015, new images were released by McDonald's depicting the Hamburglar as a grown man wearing a fedora, a macintosh jacket atop a black-and-white t shirt, with black jeans and with high-top sneakers. He still has a mask, but his face now also sports a good half-inch of designer stubble. The character will be in commercials for the first time since 2002.   """,0

Shorne, sorry to break it to you, but referring to the Holodomor  and the famines in Russia in general  as a holocaust does not diminish the holocaust against the Jews. Unless, of course, you wish to say that eliminating the social class of peasants is in some way trivial, and hence it would trivialize the killing of the Jews as an ethnic group by association. 

Calling the holodomor and the related events a holocaust rather puts those events in the right perspective: there WAS both CALLOUS and deliberate killing of the undesired class during the holodomor that was NOT principally ANY different from the shoa. Have a look at Hannah Arendt's writings and you will see what I mean. 

However, from your comments regarding the alleged 'bias' against left-wing pov's here, I assume that you are in fact somewhat of a Soviet apologist. Since I am myself a social-democrat, I can't say that there is any kind of bias against left-wing POV's here. Rather, there seems to be a fortunate tendency towards limiting both right-wing and left-wing extremism. Or, in other words, wikipedia seems to have adopted a cultural most befitting to an open society, and rather hostile towards totalitarian ideas. 

How fortunate.

Oversourcing
Hi, I thought I should explain why I reverted the edit you made to Warwick Castle, especially considering it takes a lot less effort to hit the revert button than it does to go through and prune references. I understand that you were consolidating references since just one is used for most paragraphs. However, per WP:V """"material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed"""". Therefore I think it's better to have a generous amount rather than just one per paragraph. Moreover, if someone was to add information to the article from another source it could wrongly appear that all the information in the paragraph before the reference comes from the new source (unless of course the editor was careful to duplicate sources).

 Cybercopyedit, Optics, Alhazen, etc. 

Hi. About Cybercopyedit's changes to Optics: This isn't sockpuppetry. I complained that his previous username did not comply with policy and he handled it by creating a new one, which is one of the recommended ways to deal with that problem. 

I think he may have a valid point about Alhazen's book. The article's previous statement that the book merely """"documented the then-current understanding of vision"""" does not appear to be supported by the reference that was already cited in the article. I took a quick skim through the parts of it that are freely accessible earlier today, and it appeared to show that Alhazen's work significantly expanded on the previous understanding of the subject. Based on that one reference (not contributed by Cybercopyedit as far as I know), it appears that a stronger statement of Alhazen's contribution is warranted. I'll take a closer look when I have a chance.  """,0

Re: Giovanni's mother (The Woman Boss)
I see in a recent edit you made to Giovanni that you made a hidden (is that the word? I mean those tags that have the """"!"""" sign in them and are visible only in the edit box) question concerning the bit in the article about Giovanni's mother. (i.e """"WTF is this?"""") It's true that this is not exactly mainstream knowledge, so let me explain:

In Japan, a """"radio drama"""" (which as I understand it is basically a Pokémon episode without the animation) was produced, which was about the story of Mewtwo until the events of the first movie. Part of the radio drama was the short """"Birth of Mewtwo"""" video that also exists in English.

The story is narrated by Giovanni, who tells us about when Team Rocket was led by a very beautiful woman that he then identifies as his mother. This woman is referred to as On'na Boss, meaning the Woman/Female Boss. Jessie's mother Miyamoto, a TR agent, brings to her attention the existence of Mew from a recording in the Andes, and On'na Boss sends her to investigate. Miyamoto eventually finds Mew, but is subsequently lost in an avalanche and never heard of again. The story then continues with Giovanni's own attempts to find Mew one generation later, whose results we all know. Hope this cleared things up without being too long-winded!  """,0

 Speedy Deletion of """"Girl Power (Video)""""  

Hello, 

I recently established a page for Sadie Benning's video """"Girl Power"""". I've been notified that the page was challenged for its presumed insignificance (not enough """"notability""""). Considering the fact that feminist artists have been excluded from the mainstream art establishment and essentially omitted from history, I understand why one might thing a page dedicated to one of Sadie Benning's video MIGHT NOT have """"enough notability"""". However, I would easily respond by mentioning that ALL of Sadie Benning's video, ESPECIALLY her video """"Girl Power"""", played a pivotal role in the formation of Girl Power as a concept, radical feminist politics, and the Riot grrrl's commitment to the child icon. This video has been discussed amongst scholars and academics who focus on everything from art history to gender studies and from new media studies to sociology. If Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedic database that indexes """"notable"""" historical and current events, then it would only make sense to include a page on this highly influential work that has greatly contributed to the emergence of feminist 90s politics and art. Any attempts to delete this page will be excluding important information about a widely-acclaimed video that has ONLY been excluded from historical documentation databases because of the artist's sex.""",0

Hi there, this is a difficult one & I can see both sides of the coin. I've tried to see if there is a consensus by looking through Category:Redirects from alternative languages but I'm still not sure. I have always read the """"redirect from another language as being more related to things such as Kyiv (topical one that one - read the talk page! - but I digress), or Das Wohltemperirte Clavier rather than a literal transalation of every article's name in to other languages, particulary those with non-Latin character sets.  This is why I feel that the two (Mandarin?) words/phrases you have mentioned equally fall in to the territory of unlikely/implausible phrases for a person to type on the English language Wikipedia. But the bottom line is that I am one admin & one opinion (which is a valid opinion but equally is far from unchallengable). The redirects were speedily deleted so as there was no deletion discussion there is no community consensus for their deletion which means that you are free to recreate. If they are renominated for deletion I will recuse myself from the process and we'll see what others think. Sound OK to you? Kind regards,  talk

I was just reading this section and realized that there is no reasoning provided by the users on why not to have a controversy section regarding the following two citations. Please let me know if anyone disagrees and why?

Encyclopedia of Religion Swaminarayan Movement Ed. Lindsay Jones. Vol. 13. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2005. p8889-8893. COPYRIGHT 2005 Gale, Cengage Learning Hanna H. Kim.

BAPS activities are not always without controversy, as in its open support of the Sardar Sarovar dam project in Gujarat. For its supporters, the Sardar Sarovar dam and the multi-dam Narmada Valley Development Project of which it is a key component are intended to increase power capacity and provide irrigation, cleaner drinking water, and flood control; for its opponents, the dam is environmentally and socially disastrous and is purchased at the cost of submerging a high percentage of dalit and adivasi villages. The wealthy BAPS organization is criticized by dam opponents for acting to protect its class interests, including those of its land holding members. In response, BAPS followers who are familiar with the Narmada controversy point to the various village relocation and community rehabilitation projects voluntarily instigated and funded by BAPS.

Also the Introduction to Swaminarayan Hindusism book states """"Also the Introduction to Swaminarayan Hindusism book states """"The history of the Akshar Purushottam Sanstha has not been with out controversy and division. In AD 1966 Dadubhai Patel and his....""""

In addition to BAPS's break from the original Swaminarayan satsaṅg, other schisms have occurred. In 1966 a handful of East African BAPS followers broke away and founded the Yogi Divine Society. Additionally, sādhus from the original movement have left to form their own institutions that sometimes (e.g., Swaminarayan Gurukuls) but not always (e.g., Swaminarayan Gadi) retain an affiliation with their gāddī.

Are these citations not enough to warrant a section dedicated to them?   05:56, 30 March 2015""",0
"I am writing you because you have been disrupting wikipedia for the past week. I'm not sure if you even understand how your edits are disruptive, so I'll try to explain. Wikipedia operates under the neutral point of view. This means that we must represent all notable and sourced points of view on a topic (and be sure not to give undue weight to minority views). Your edits seem to be pushing a Christian POV, by removing certain articles from Category:Jesus while adding others to Category:God. I think the two clearest example of this is in this and this. Where else would we categorize an article dealing specifically with Jesus than in Category:Jesus? There is no reason to remove article just because they come from a Muslim or JW or Jewish point of view. Normally, if you make an edit, and someone else reverts it, that means there is no consensus for your edit (and therefore, you shouldn't make it again. Excessively re-adding controversial content is considered edit warring, and you can be blocked for this (see WP:3RR). What you need to do in these situations, is go to the talk page of the article and discuss your proposed changes to try and convince others and raise consensus to support your views. Users simply cannot force controversial edits into articles, that isn't how wikipedia works. I'll also note, that because of our NPOV policy, I see no reason or rationale to exclude many of the articles you have removed from the category Jesus.

I know but only some stations had it the 11th. The 11th was only a sneak peek and then the season officially started on the 14th. If you look at tv.com it has it listed as the 14th. Also since some stations had there program sechedules messed up, I say lets have it say the 14th. I did get a hold of WGBH and they did say it was a sneak peek. The site just said when the season was kind of starting. Also, the episode aired omn the 11th and then reaired on the 14th with the rest of of season.

Obama previously appointed her husband for green jobs, Van Jones. He previously led the San Francisco Center for Human Rights, focusing on social injustice and collective rights. When the 1992 fires in the Los Angeles race riots, revolutionary essay he wrote: """"We are fighting for justice, our goal is to change the system! Yes, a great revolutionary moment finally arrived.

Now Davis persuaded the young Obama, which raised his white grandparents from mother's side, the more stressed his black identity and his first name used but not Barry, but Barack.

Obama's wife Michelle during her studies at Princeton is famous works, which described two possible position on the Negro in American society: integrationist and segregacionistický. Integrationist means of the values of American (ie white, capitalist) society and may be a way to success. One can, however, it also in its look as a betrayal černošskosti.

Relations between him and the reverend married Obama's been warm. Barack Obama in 2008, however, distanced himself from Reverend Wright.

In the past, there were also some doubts about the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate [20].

 Dan56 POV bullying 

Hi Khanassassin-

I read your intelligent, and respectuful comments on Aaliyah's talk page.  Unfortunately, Dan56 seems to be trying to control every minute detail which I've edited.  He has reversed anything I do.  My main contention, like yours, is his subjective views on """"Critical Reception.""""  It's simply not true that Aaliyah received """"Highly Positive"""" reviews.  She received """"positive"""" reviews, as you stated, or """"Generally Favorable,"""" according to Metacritic.  If you don't mind, I'd also like to point you to a talk page from Nicki Minaj's album, """"Roman Reloaded.""""  Several editors there accused Dan56 of being """"biased"""" against Minaj, which I'd have to say does seem to be the case.  The Album received a score of 60 from Metacritic, which several editors wanted to show as """"generally positive,"""" because two highly influential reviewers, Rolling Stone and Spin, lauded the album.  Dan56 used Metacritic to """"verify"""" his POV that the album was """"mixed,"""" and then went on to revert any attempts by the editors to inject any positive reviews into the the first paragraph of the """"Critical Reception"""" section.  Here is Dan56's response to me, regarding my attempt to make the correction on Aaliyah:

This was reviewed in FAC (""""excellent"""" is cited in the source). Metacritic is not the be-all, end-all of review sources (they happen to omit several reviews from notable publications that are included in this article that they would now have included, such as Slant Magazine, The Guardian, Chicago Tribune and The Independent). Your other changes were reverted as well.

However, when trying to sway the editors on """"Roman Reloaded,"""" Dan56 says this:

We are being objective, which is why you're revision is not being accepted. You're trying to overemphasis two reviews to make them seem more flattering of the article's subject, and tactlessly rearranging positive criticism ahead of quotes from mixed reviews, which Metacritic clearly shows are the majority (yellow anyone?) 

I simply wanted to note what a score of 76 reflects on Metacritic, and Dan56 will not allow it.  What gives?
Thank you for your time.

For Andrewa

1) """"12-string"""" is vernacular, embedded in our business from the catalogues of the original manufacturers (the last people interested in logic or organology) and later """"folk"""" nomenclature (never scholarly nomenclature). [The same holds for the B.C. Rich company's catalogue referring to its coursed instrument as """"the 10-string guitar"""".]

2) Any instrument with at least one non-single string should use """"course"""" for clarity by any serious musicologist.

3) Intruments with 10 single strings should be termed """"10-stringed guitars"""" rather than """"the 10-string guitar"""" because there is no one 10-string guitar (with the definitive article).

4) I suggest you start a new article and title it '10-stringed guitars' under which you differentiate the various types under sub-headings accordign to their number of courses. The baroque guitar would fall under 5-course, the B.C. Rich instrument would fall under 6-course. 

5) I suggest a non-guitarist baroque lutenist should mediate this and offer an opinion on the established musicological use of the terms course and string. 

6) We must recognise that """"12-string guitar"""" is an exception to and deviation from a well-established musicological/organological convention, and not the rule according to which we should re-write the terminology. We should also recognise that the term 12-string guitar enters not via musicologists or scholars but via guitar manufacturers and was later taken up mainly by folk musicians. In contrast there is an extensive scholarly history of referring to instruments with at least one PAIR of strings as coursed, not (single) strung/stringed. Now, I am not suggesting re-naming """"12-string guitars"""", but it is a mistake (and folly) to try to oppose centuries-old scholarly conventions and to take the exception as the rule and re-write the terminology of organology.

Secondly it is not my claim that there are 250,000 Cornish people so what are you going on about? All i have added of late is that a recent survey found that 44% of the Cornish populace thought themselves Cornish rather than British or English.

Thank you, Dave, and thank you for your welcome on “My Talk”.

“This section was started with discussion of """"bias in favor of Darwin's theory"""" raising the issue of misrepresentation of Darwin by anti-evolutionists, and as discussed above, we have to give due weight to the overwhelming scientific majority view on the basic subject of evolution.”

I certainly agree with that. 

But on the issue of using “realised”, I just have a couple of things to say. But as a preamble, if you like, I want to make the distinction between a theory and the reality that scientists etc test it against (I’m not being insulting, I assume everyone knows this already, but I’m making a case). Scientists don’t “prove” theories are true. But by conducting experiments they falsify the “bad” theories (again I assume you know this and obviously this is in agreement with the philosophy of Karl Popper).

Now,  I think it’s bad practice to state things in such a way that a theory sounds like it’s the “truth” (meaning in perfect agreement with reality) because it destroys this distinction (between theory, or scientific fact, and reality or truth. To say that “X realised that Y”, where Y is a theory, is suggesting that Y is “in perfect agreement with reality”. Now, I think the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” does correspond perfectly with reality, but I also think we need to remember that it is still a theory (nothing is proven, remember, according to Popper) consistent with the general scientific method and perspective I already briefly outlined. Of course, in the case of evolution, someone arguing like this sounds rather silly  - it sounds like you’re being pedantic bordering on obsessive. Of course not all theories are the same - Popper would argue that theories that have “survived” criticism and rigorous testing are more “corroborated” (but never fully verified). But even if you wanted to make some exceptions, like the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors”, for the sake of scientific consistency, I think we should refrain from using “realised” in this context (incidentally, in regards to making exceptions, I certainly wouldn’t make any exceptions in respect to the sources given by David Wilson - these seem to me to be much more egregious cases of the word “realised”).

Anyway, so much for theory. As far as concrete help is concerned, have you thought about deleting “who realised that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” altogether?  You probably know more about the history of evolution than I do, but I thought that this idea didn’t actually come from Darwin (I could be wrong, of course). But if it does, what about “Charles Robert Darwin FRS (12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist who first proposed the fact that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and also the scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection” or some variation on this?

you demanded some facts.  here you go;
Dursun Karatas was not born in 1953, but 1950.  most of the infos about Dursun Karatas at internet suggest he was born in 1953.  it is definately wrong. if you look at original Devrimci Sol court documents, you will see he was born 27 March 1950.  he has enrolled to Universityof Istanbul in 1967 at the age of 17.if he was born in 1953, it means he enrolled to university at the age og 14 which is not possible.  

In 1978 he founded Dev-Sol (Revolutionary Left, precursor of DHKP-C).[2] Karataş' group was based in Istanbul.[3]

this is not a fact.  the organisation was not based in Istanbul.  He was representative of Devrimci Yol in Istanbul branch when he established Devrimci Sol, splinter organisation from devrimci Yol.  Even turkish texas ranger that you used his report as a """"fact"""" states it, if you carefully read it.  Devrimci Sol is not based in Istanbul, but all over Turkey, especially, Adana, Izmir etc.

Karataş was jailed after the 1980 military coup. In prison a political reorganisation was undertaken. The Dev-Sol inmates at Bayrampaşa prison refused to follow orders and boycotted court invitations. 

This is not true as well.  They have boycotted the torture and inhumane processes in prison.  Of course, torture is not mentioned at any documents or internet facts, but does not mean ut was existed.  The organisation protested torture in prison and Devrimci Sol started a hunger strikes, 4 inmates (sorry, terrorist for you and turkish texas ranger, bearing in mind, one of the terrorist lost his life during hunger strike was imprisoned with the accusation of putting up posters in the walls, punishable with 6 months imprisonment nowadays), lost their lives.  

In prison Karataş wrote Haklıyız Kazanacağız, a work which included analysis of past mistakes of the Dev-Sol movement and lists of enemies of the organization. It was published in two volumes in 1989, spanning more than 1000 pages.[3][4][5]

He did not write it, but all Devrimci Sol prisoners.  As a matter a fact Sinan Kukul prapered the book.  If you read the book earlier version you would see. (don't use sun glasses when you read it).  Lists of enemies of the organisation..... what a fuck is that.  there is no such thing in the book.  their past mistakes......  the book consisted with Devrimci Sol ideologies, its aim etc.      

He escaped from prison in 1989.[6] After escaping from jail, he went into exile in Europe.[4] In 1989-1990 Dev-Sol carried out a series of attacks. However, on July 12, 1991, Turkish police was able to dismantle several cells of the organization. Karataş fled to Europe. In April 1992 his wife Sahabat was killed by Turkish police.[3]

Following the police crackdown on Dev-Sol, Karataş was kidnapped and detained by the second-in-command of the movement, Bedri Yağan, on September 13, 1993. Karataş did however escape from captivity, and Dev-Sol was divided. Karataş and his followers reorganized their movement as DHKP-C.[3]

following police crack down....   very funny, second in command bedri Yagan,.... this is a joke not fact.  Bedri Yagan was experiencin some problems theredore whatever his duties with in the organisation was removed before his action.  see Devrmci Sol Dava Dosyasi.  turkish texas ranger mentioned this in his report.

 The Pit and the Pendulum is a 1961 horror film directed by Roger Corman, starring  Vincent Price, Barbara Steele, John Kerr, and Luana Anders.  The screenplay by Richard Matheson was based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name. Set in 16th century Spain, the story is about a young Englishman who visits a forbidding castle to investigate his sister's mysterious death. After a series of horrific revelations, apparently ghostly appearances and violent deaths, the young man becomes strapped to the titular torture device by his lunatic brother-in-law during the film's climactic sequence. The film was the second title in the popular series of Poe-based movies released by  American International Pictures, the first having been Corman's  House of Usher released the previous year. A critical and box office hit, Pit's commercial success convinced AIP and Corman to continue adapting Poe stories for another six films, five of them starring Price. Film critic Tim Lucas and writer Ernesto Gastaldi have both noted the film's strong influence on numerous subsequent Italian thrillers. Stephen King has described one of Pit's major shock sequences as being among the most important moments in the post-1960 horror film. (more...) """,0

Come on guys. The section on Turkey is highly biased and provides more space to the justification of Pelosi's attitude to the proposed bill on the so-called Armenian Genocide and doesn't give the other side to provide any justification why the Prime minister of Tuyrkey has negative attidue on this bill. I think that for the neuturality of this article, the section on Turkey shall be extended and editors shall give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue.

Otherwise, this section seems like an election platform of ms. nancy prior to elections.

I have been trying to extend this section, but pro-Nancy editors and probably her office staff are deleting all my additions without any justification.

Biased section on Turkey

""""Turkey On October 11, 2007, regarding a proposed House resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi said that the measure would be brought to a vote because """"While that may have been a long time ago, genocide is taking place now in Darfur, it did within recent memory in Rwanda, so as long as there is genocide there is need to speak out against it..."""" [27] Turkey's prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations. [28]"""""""" —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6 (talk) 

Stop with the damn accusations of pro-nancy and elections. If you knew anything about American politics you would know how silly that sounds. You have been warned twice on your talk page to be civil and not use this talk page for a platform. You also have the ability to edit the page yourself, but I doubt you will be able to keep a neutral tone. Also, remember that this is a page about Nancy Pelosi and not about Turkey and and the Armenian Genocide. Turtlescrubber  

""""give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue""""? This is not the POV by Nancy Pelosi or US House of Representatives Committee, but a tragic event recognized by the most of democratic societies and countries. And surely this biographical article is not the right place for such an """"explanations of other side"""" (simple denial of the anti-human crime). Andranikpasha  
Andranikpasha, your nickname expalins who are you? YOu are an armenianorigin person. Andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody Armenian militia killing Turks, Kurds and Azeris, with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of Kurds, Turks and Azeris after they returned from the war in 5 fronts. So your response is absolutly biased, because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the Armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation.

As to the fact this is not the page for the other side, this shows how much you are anti-democratic and biased on this issue. This is against the Wikip3edia neturality principle as well. You give one side an opportunity to jsutify her action, but the other side only one general and useless sentence. I wouldn't be surprised if you are a pro-Pelosi person. Please, don't accuse others with stupidity and etc. I know quite a lot about American politics and how it is run. I completed my studies in US. This is for your education and information.

If I don't see any more jsutified response I will go an and extent the Turkey section and also create the Criticism section. Raman, Massachusetts —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6 (talk) 

The section is grossly biased in favor of Pelosi-s pro-armenian stance and justification. She wants to sell something which didn't happen due to funds she receive from the Armenian lobby. 
She wants to compare the armenian killings with those of Jews genocide and Rwanda genocide. She forgets following differences between these events. 

Nationalist Armenians were at war with the Turks in 1915 (both in Anatolia and Caucausus), and the Armenian generals and guerilla leaders who commanded them are still honored as Armenian heroes today. Military leaders like Generals Andranik Oznanian, Garegin Nzhdeh, Drastamat Kanahyan (“General Dro”), and Garo Pasdirmaijan (“Armen Garo”) are largely unknown to Americans whose knowledge of Armenian history is limited to the orthodox genocide literature, but well-known by Armenians. Here, again, the analogy to the Jews of the Holocaust simply does not fit. There are no statues to the Jewish generals who fought the Nazis in Germany in 1942-43, because there were none. 

And there is such a biased section on Turkey. the editor andranik, an armenian by origin, who carries the name of the armenian terrorist and nationlist milita head accuses",0

 Restricted biotech a characeristic of nanopunk?! 

The 2nd sentence in the article reads the following:
""""The genre is similar to biopunk, but describes the world where the use of biotechnologies are limited or prohibited, so only nanites and nanotechnologies are widely use (while in biopunk, bio- and nanotechnologies often coexist)""""
I'm really doubting the truth content of it. Basically I don't think that it's a characteristic of nanopunk that biotech is limited or prohibited even if some novels feature that. Additionally I'd rather say that this is a characteristic of biopunk with which a contrast is seeked here. Also """"so only nanites and nanotechnologies are widely in use"""" is a non sequitur - it's not a logical conclusion that """"only nanites"""" and nanotechnologies are widely in use because biotech is limited.

When someone says their right to post under GDFL is being infringed and they are being libelled, we should take that seriously toocall up the Foundation lawyer. The actual fact is that any hypothetical cases of either kind, with no compliant, and which there are unlikely to be damages are cases no lawyer in the world would argue.

Hi Darius, a part of the reason I think the genocide looms so large, and deserves space in a 3 paragraph summary is because it is still a """"big deal"""" and current event topic.  There are laws being drafted in Turkey restricting freedom of speech on this issue even as they try to join the E.U.  Major motion pictures like Ararat which cover the genocide cannot be shown in Turkey, sometimes due to the government, sometimes due to terrorist threats.  So perhaps when there is an admission, and the topic fades out, the time will have come to relegate this solely to the history pages.

Meanwhile, no two genocides are alike, but the Armenian/Jewish ones have a great deal in common.  The scale of both surpassed a million, both ended in the murder of over half the population and expulsion of the rest, both were done under cover of world war, both had nationalistic and religious overtones, while targetting a minority known for industriousness and wealth, and the similiarities go on.  The """"neutrality"""" of information has only been an issue because unlike post-war Germany, which was thoroughly defeated, Turkey, which had signed a treaty of Sevres which stipulated an independent Armenia who's borders were drawn by President Wilson of the USA instead had an internal revolution, changing all their treaties so as not to even mention Armenia ONCE, and then began a massive government campaign to rewrite history.

"""Update: The Oreskes abstracts

 

Naomi Oreskes claims to have analysed 928 abstracts she found listed on the ISI Web of Knowledge database (1993 – 2003) using the keywords """"global climate change."""" However, this claim is incorrect: while the ISI database includes a total of 929 documents for the period in question, it lists only 905 abstracts. It is thus impossible that Oreskes analysed 928 abstracts.

 

In my original critique, I used the same ISI database and the same key words as Oreskes but used all documents listed therein. While Oreskes did not specify the method she applied in her study, she later confirmed that she had limited her search to “articles”, while I included “all document types” in my initial assessment. This difference appears to explain the discrepancy between the “928” abstracts Oreskes claims to have analysed and the 1117 documents I found and considered, although her figures don’t add up, one way or another.

 

Some commentators have argued that these differences undermine my main criticism while they validate Oreskes' claim. However, as I have stressed repeatedly, Oreskes entire argument is flawed as the whole ISI data set includes just 13 abstracts (less than 2%) that explicitly endorse what she has called the 'consensus view.'

 

In fact, the vast majority of abstracts do not mention anthropogenic climate change.

 

I have posted all documents and abstracts listed in the ISI database under the key words “global climate change” (for the period 1993 – 2003) below, arranged by year. Check for yourself! Make sure you differentiate between implicit and explicit endorsement of the IPCC consensus (“[M]ost of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations."""")

Dear Alexikoua, I am wondering whether there is any informative value in citing the so-called """"1910 census"""". This is not an official census, it belongs to a series of documents that had propaganda value, in the sense that it was createed in 1919 to help the Greek delegation persuade other participants in the peace conference to yield to its demands and maximize Greek territorial gains in Asia Minor.

I would also be thankful if you could please provide your source for the numbers you cite in the 1914 Ottoman census table. The reason I am asking is that I have Karpat's book right in front of me and some of the numbers differ somewhat. For example, Greeks of Adana vilayet amount to 8,537 in Karpat (1985), pp. 172, 188, not 12,000.

Finally, I would like to add a word of caution, if I may: as I found out reading a note in Kostopoulos, Tasos (2007) Polemos kai ethnokatharse, p. 171 [I can confirm this in a couple of days by comparing Karpat's book, pp. 170-189 and Alexandris, Alexis (1999) """"The Greek census of Anatolia and Thrace (1910-1912): a contribution to Ottoman Historical Demography"""" in D. Gondicas - Ch Issawi (eds.), Ottoman Greeks in the age of nationalism, Princeton, pp. 58-65] despite having the same name, the boundaries of vilayets vary between Ottoman censuses and that of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the 1914 census not including certain sanjaks, like Kutahya, Afion Karahisan, Canik (=Samsun), Eskisehir etc, in vilayets. For these minor, but existing nonetheless discrepancies between the two to be eradicated, it is advisable to adjust one of the two administrative divisions to the other's a model being provided by Kostopoulos, (2009), pp. 170-1.

Well, not that i don't appreciate what you said, but even so, allow me to reply. 

Today there were the funerals of Enzo Biagi, a freeman as few remains in a world more and more without any respect for freedom (seen as a 'threat for the established order'). The oil price is flying to 100$ and this should led to think more seriously to our absurd world. But let's go:

1-there is someone that is costantly pointed at the 'words' while others are pointed on 'facts'. Since you call my comment 'above' as non-polite, obviously you miss why i could be not friendly with someone that not miss a time to complain in Arbcom every time we discuss in any sense. This is 'polite' and wikilove for you? To me it not looks so. Since i am a volonteer here, not payed (as all the collaborators as well), you cannot pretent i act like all the conformists here have established, and obey to Bzuk or BillCJ every time saying 'yes master, yes master, like you want master'. And surely i wouldn't take EH as 'bright example'. Sorry, the manner in which they acted not displays any reasonable friendly-acting. So it's hard pretend to me to be so kind with gentlemen that not even bothers to explain why they does this and that revert.

2-Another thing that show dramatically well some things: 

Take for instance, the first paragraph after the header """"Technical description""""...the paragraph ends with the sentence """"the only real all-around fighter that served in AMI, but this was not without limitation in every task."""" That's a very subjective statement, and, since it's making a judgement, it really needs a citation so that the reader can understand what the source of that statement is. As it stands right now, however, because it is not cited, it merely looks like opinion on your part, which would be right to remove/revert.

All the G.91R page explains continuosly why this plane was 'limited' and 'mainly successful as recce'. I cannot understand how this thing, considering all the datas and stuff given, can be 'questioned'. Rather than criticize me just try to get a look about the JAS-39 Gripen. 

Basically, questioning this fact shows apalling comprension for all the article, because it's a statement well placed inside the meaning of this work.

3-Washing your hands and not bother about to collaborate with me is not surely a 'nice' manner to do. Strangely enough, this is 'justified', rather than be a guilth. So, basically, every thing i do or not do is wrong, while every thing you do or not do is right. With these bases, expecting a costructive dialogue is just funny. You have been 'offensed' by the vanification of F-104S adjustements (because i after done some more contr.). This is the only thing you did in over a month of 'collaboration'. Too easy, my dear, to self justify all times like you. Easy not bothering to collaborate, while the guilth is mine that already lost my time to contribue gratis to this ency.

4-My contributions should be alway quoted here and that. But being serious, there are a lot of pages without any or almost any references. I dont' understand why i should be whipped to post 500 kb. The issue about F-86 data touched the buttom of the sea and dig it too. I cannot cope with someone that not even read online sources with absurd reasons.

5-The continuos accuses, diffamations and so on about me are not liked either. Perhaps the problem is that Wikipedia takes herself too seriously in the last times? Perhaps that be called 'traitor' or 'harmer' is not friendly? Obviously you rate these accusation as 'righful critics'. But not i.

I remember very well that you accused me without any proof to make copyviols, even with funny interpretations of Goebel PD text (that i stated as not mine, the only time i used other texts in all the MB written for the sake of Wiki). I wouldn't have a judge like you in the real world, believe me.

6-The fantastic wikioz world, 'tooooo perfect' to be 'questioned'. But to me and some others, this looks not exactly true. There are a lot of burocrats, hipocrites and trolls, or simply there are a lot of guys that basically fears the others and are ready to 'defend the Revolution' with zealot fanatism. Questioning even the basical celebral activity and even the basical freedom of spreech, questioning even the simply syllogism. 

All this is due because, as always in these cases, from French revolution today there are always many 'revolutionary guards' ready to show their 'loyalty' to the 'cause'. So wikipedia prefers executes guys 'out of the chor' instead to admit to have some 'contradictions'. This is the usual manner to act. And i have no love to who call me 'wiki.harmer' just because i show that i 'know' my stuff, not only 'have read it somewhere'. This is why Goebel and many others keeps away from",0

Finally created an account here, I'm the one who made the tables. Well, I think that my version of the Title History looks better and is better to read. But maybe I'm the only one who thinks that way? I'd like to hear other opinions.
I changed the look of the tables a bit, do they look okay?

I have made two versions of the """"Title History"""" tables now. You can see the other one at Stone Cold Steve Austin. I think the table in Austins article is a bit long. The table in Benoits article might be unfriendly for users with lower resolutions. What do you think which table should be used for the Title Histories for the wrestlers?  12:54, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Do you really need a mini-paragraph for every PPV title event Benoit has?  I mean, in a year, is anyone going to care that Benoit had a US title match against Orlando Jordan at the Great American Bash?

Having a detailed account of every Benoit appearance on SmackDown! is not only tedious, it's unnecessary. -  

Regarding Benoit having """"Super Tombstone Piledriver"""" as a Benoit does regularly, um, no. At one time, a very long time ago, he was doing piledrivers as part of his moveset, but he hasn't done a piledriver, super or otherwise, in many years, dating even well before the ban on dangerous moves in WWE. At this point, anyone who even knows that Benoit did a piledriver at one time should be rewarded for their knowledge of very miniscule trivia. I'm removing it. Someone can consider adding it in as trivia if they like.  

Quotes I WILL MAKE YOU TAP OUT come on he says that!   err

I think Benoit does actually have the record for the longest time in the Royal Rumble. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rumble#Royal_Rumble_Records  ToneLa

IMO, the Personal Life section needs a little bit of an overhaul.  There's the background as to what led to him and Nancy having an affair (Kevin Sullivan told them to travel and appear in public together to maintain kayfabe, to the point of having Nancy grope Chris in bars) leading to the various """"Kevin Sullivan booked his own divorce"""" comments over the years, Nancy changing her name legally to Nancy Benoit (I'm 99% sure of this, as Dave Meltzer, who's friends with Benoit, exclusive refers to her as """"Nancy Benoit""""), and I'm pretty sure he and Nancy had a second child together.   

At the end of the World Wrestling Entertainment section (where it discusses Benoit's neck injury) it states Chris injured his neck in a match with X-Pac. However, I remember reading a quote by Benoit himself where he stated that he actually injured it in a match with Austin (while taking a stunner) and the superplex in the Triple Threat at KoTR simply injured him further. Can anyone verify this?

Midwest Accent
I see that you are deleting my corrections regarding the General American accent, in the article """"Midwest,"""" which quite wrongly implies that General American is owned lock stock and barrel by that region.  It's nonsense. The General American accent is spoken all over the north, from Seattle to Connecticut. You are going to have to come up with some citations which realistically and accurately show that the northern accent originated in or is unique to the Midwest, before I'kk allow you continue deleting my writings without a fight. It certainly is not unique to the Midwest, a region which was not even settled by English speakers until barely 150 years ago, after the northern accent was known to exist in places like Pennsylvania and upstate NY, and Connecticut. It really bugs me to see the Midwest taking ownership of an accent which began in the Northeast. The original author blunders badly by lumping the accents of certain urban areas of the northeast in with the rural areas. Anybody from my region, the Syracuse, NY area, formerly Albany, NY, knows that our accent it totally indistinguishable from that of the Midwest. I challange anybody to put a group of Midwestern speakers side-by-side with upstate New Yorkers, and tell which is which. It's impossible, it's the same accent, utterly and completely the same. And we've been speaking this way since before the Midwest was even settled, so it's nonsense to say it's a Midwest accent.""",0

Cruft in trivia section
A backstage segment featuring dancing is certainly fancruft that doesn't belong. It being a reunion of sorts (and it being at WM) doesn't make it any more notable at all. The dance segment didn't affect any of the matches and certainly doesn't help the article.  
I suggest moving to the notes section.   3:16 
It's always been in the notes section, that's not the problem here. The problem is: it's a backstage segment. Backstage segments aren't notable, and don't affect the matches or anything... why add this one over others? Just because it was a reunion isn't a good enough reason in my opinion. People certainly could argue the Boogey Man/Trump segment was notable, as it featured the first time the 2 had interaction (or just on the fact Trump appeared). It's fancruft and serves no purpose except that some people might think it's """"interesting"""". That's not enough to keep it on the article.  
Oh I didn't see that. Hmmm... let me see what I can do with it...   3:16 

I think that we should just add them to the other talent section if they aren't there already and not mention the dance. It was pretty pointless, and doesn't seem necessary. Peace,  The rid 
While I agree that the Boogeyman segment wasn't notable, this segment had the return of Slick (first time in like 15 years) and a bunch of other WWE legends. It being a reunion and at WM does help its case IMO (especially the reunion part). You are saying being a backstage segment is the problem, so you wouldn't be objecting if they had done this on the stage or in the ring? If we mentioned them in the on screen talent section, what would we put down for them so someone else doesn't remove it. It also got covered in most reviews and coverage of the event (coevering the notability part). Being cruft is an opinion; being a reunion featuring over a dozen legends and covered by almost every review makes it worth at least mentioning.  

Eh, the return of Slick is pretty important. I'll change my vote to Weak Support, as I had forgotten about that point. Peace,  The rid 
Covered in almost every review? I find that very hard to believe. Provide some proof. Also: so what if it's covered? The matches are reviewed in the reviews as well: that doesn't mean we will start listing highlights for each match. I also recall there being a guideline on Wikipedia about it not being a democracy: meaning not everything should be determined by a vote. I somehow think if this fancruft was gone: no one would be re-adding except for TJ. From the edit history: it seems like he was the only one re-adding it back. That certainly shows that people don't care about it. A few talk page posts in favor of it: isn't much consensus to keep it on the article.  
 and  among others. Other people have added it back, I just get to it first usually.  
Considering OWW is a fansite, only the Slam link is reliable. Anyone can write a review and mention it: fansites aren't a reliable source. I've seen no edit history of anyone else re-adding it back, so I'm still going to believe no one else has (until I see otherwise). If I need to bring an admin into this, I will. Because in my opinion: it's a content dispute between me and TJ, as no one else seems to care much about ONE LITTLE crufty thing. Slick returned for ONE appearance, post it on the Slick article and leave it at that.  
I could find more if I tried, that was in a quick 1 minute search. I could flip it and say only you think it should be removed. I don't see the big deal. It's not cruft, it's notable (based on what counts as being notable), an",0

By stating """"Comments about the opinions and supposed motivations of other editor will be removed"""" you are completely missing the point. We have some people in the Australian community (both on and of wiki) who only call the round ball game football (or maybe association football) and get offended/upset/angry by the word soccer due to previous negative connotations of the word. Others use the word football exclusively for another code, most commonly Australian rules football, and only use soccer (without any intended offence) for the round ball game. Then you have another group who are happy to use either term, depending on context or to avoid any possible ambiguity. What proportion of the population is in each group depends on location, age, era, ethnicity/cultural background, etc. So there is no single consensus.  I'm for soccer if it avoids confusion of codes (such as a in a multi-sport stadium article or a suburb article), but using football is ok if a dedicated article (such as a team or player article), all with a piped link to association football (a term which is rarely used and can also be ambiguous in parts Australia with Australian rules football games played in competitions named Associations such as the Victorian Football Association). Extrapolating the no move decision in that RM about a single parent article to apply to every mention of the sport is invalid, in my opinion. Achieving a true consensus is near impossible because we aren't a homogenous society.

The days loses were as already given. Specifically Spitfire claims were not discussed, so the Spitfire's percentage of the kill total is unknown, which is conveyed in the article.

More importantly, citations have been given for for the Order of Battle figures. Your lack of understanding of how any historian presents his work work is palpable. OOB are given in lists, as you should know, so your """"give me a quote"""" tone is rather silly. Caldwell makes it quit clear that these lists are incomplete with regard to strength returns given. He gives known strength returns. As for Total German day fighter strength, again this estimated by Caldwell (as strength returns for all 6 years are obviously incomplete). He points out, and totally refutes your claim that the bulk of these machines were deployed against the oilfields in September 1944. 
1,000 in the defence of central Europe were available for operations at this time, while 1,800 alone were available for combat in the west. German fighter units in Romania in September 1944 were mixed in with Eastern front units by June 1944, making it impossible to tell just how many fighters were operating in the """"oil"""" capacity at this time. Even considering that all E.F fighters were at some point deployed in Romania they only reach a combined total of 2,250 compared to a total of 1,800 plus 1,000 for the other two fronts (negating even the Med.

"Saying that Largoplazo only nominated the article for deletion because of deletionist tendencies is hardly uncivil and is entirely valid considering that he just nominated the article for deletion again, even AFTER I added more sources to it.  He's clearly aiming to take advantage of the fact that I can't currently edit the Articles for deletion page to defend the article, which is patently childish and uncivil behavior.

For example, if I were capable of editing the Articles for deletion page that he just created, I would note that the film has been covered in all sorts of notable sources, like:

http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b78523a6f - British Film Institute

...to name just a few.  I would also point out that several notable people were involved with the film, like the VERY notable Tuli Kupferberg, who stars in it.

But I can't edit the page because I'm blocked right now, and he nominated the article for deletion again only after you blocked me - because he wanted to make sure I couldn't edit the Articles for deletion page.

 Singer List? 

Hi. I have an idea that would allow people to view various prospects for Scott Weilands replacement in an easier way rather than just posting sentences in the """"Split from Weiland"""" section... How about someone ends the """"Split..."""" section with a closing paragraph about Scott leaving and then they form a new section titled something like: """"Rumored replacement singers"""" or something like that.

It is easier to find names rather than searching through a section of the article that doesnt even have a title relevant to the fact that VR is looking for a new singer...

 == Issue on images still unresolved == 

I appreciate your inputs in Image talk:Monkey3.jpg and I agree once in a while I might sound rude (purely unintentional, since I put facts blantly). But SlimVirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone.

Slim is not a """"he"""". Given that she named herself after a Javanese princess, perhaps you could take the hint and note that she's a woman. Also, I don't think you were simply blunt. I think you were rude to Slim. I recognise it's a fine line but given that I've mentioned it to you, perhaps you'll take more care to stay on the right side of it?

She has suggested in an email to me, that she is in talks with another editor. Now, I don't know who this other editor and i certainly don't like this secrecy. Instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. She could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.

Perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. I think that would be reasonable. I have a high regard for Slim and I don't think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.

Inso far as the images are concerned, I had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by PETA and its assocites.

So you have a dispute. You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary. I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.

This should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.

The BUAV is not a """"controversial organisation"""". It is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of British society. A viewpoint doesn't become """"controversial"""" just because you don't share it.

Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints - 

But you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.

thus I requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.

I don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.

As far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have """"agreed"""" to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.

First of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith. Perhaps you're not aware of that policy. Yes, you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.

Once I pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.

Yes, okay. Trust her AND ask for proof.

Both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.

I'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.

If she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information.

''I think that's a bit dramatic but I agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. However, she is not a """"copyviolater"""" trying to destroy Wikipedia. Partly, I think she simply didn't understand your problem, and that was in part a failure of your communication, and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesn't handle disagreement well. So perhaps you could recognise that and be more helpful than combative? I know",0

hey, ddv, you're just stirring around the elements emphatically, making an awfully lengthy show but proving nothing.  you can't call an ancient egyptian a black man and keep a straight face.  can you?  have you studied it at all?  (and i mean outside of the propaganda site bibliographies).  egyptology is a respectable field but people like you make a circus out of it.  your arguments are shifty, imbalanced and halting.  trying to prove your point, for example, by indicating an article as if it should be taken for sooth, in an encyclopedia you openly proclaim """"racist,"""" not to mention published before world war I, is ridiculous.  in the real definition of that word: worthy of ridicule.  the same with referencing historical commentaries long removed from actual events, to prove egyptians were black men, when we have real egyptian records and artifacts to examine.  herodotus a reliable source on eighteenth dynasty egypt?  hello.

i can't say i understand the impulse.  egypt was a repetative place; always the same sculptures, always the same rituals, always the same supplications, always the same monuments to egos in stone.  its colonnades inspired later architects in greece and rome, but for all its monumentality egyptian architecture wasn't worth much more than that.  is it because you suppose egypt was the first real civilization?  look up ancient sumer.  

all the while . . . the heart of the world is africa.  we evolved there as a species.  erectus to sapiens.  after that, we diverged.  biodiversity.  environmental adaptation.  and now we're a little differently hued standing next to each other and of slightly different skeleton.  why should that not make us brothers?

"First I want to mention that I deeply appreciate your candid, frank, and friendly response.  It is refreshing to meet another Wikipedian who doesn't see any need to bite someone's head off just because of a mistake, whatever the size.  Not that most Wikipedians do that, but cordiality is still nice.  Yes, I agree that I should resist the urge to correct other people's comments.  For me, the ill will is a much bigger factor, especially because I always try to be very careful to never change the meaning of a comment, but it is still a risk, as you say.

You're right, the edits are old and the link eventually gets you there.  These are trivial changes, but I find value in them.  It is true that the servers don't spend much time on redirects, but I still would like all links going directly to the article they refer to.  Not that that will ever happen to all of WP, or even EN WP, but I can help.  Actually, I started fixing the redirecting links to that particular page because I wanted to make sure there were no double redirects, which would be a problem, and one worth fixing.  Being a perfectionist, I decided to go ahead and fix all the redirecting links instead of just the double redirects (I want a nice, clean Whatlinkshere page, with no indentions ).  A large percentage of the redirects I am fixing are on (main) namespace pages, not on talk pages, and in those cases I also fix the visible spelling of the link when it is wrong, since that should be right.  So I am doing what you were saying about fixing the article pages.  On talk pages (and even in archives), I have been fixing the appearance as well as the link target, but I think I'll change my policy based on your well-made point: I'm only going to change the link target, nothing about the appearance.  Does that seem reasonable?

I am interested in AWB, but I haven't really looked into it much.  Thanks for the tip.

My login problem is a toughie, as far as I can tell.  What happens is this: I click the register/login link at the top right of the page.  I enter my username and password.  It says I have successfully logged in, and even shows my username, etc., in the upper right.  But then, as soon as I switch to another page, I am logged out again.  I have checked my cookies, and I am accepting cookies from all Wikimedia projects that I'm working on.  It is possible it is a firewall problem, but I have no idea how to fix that.  And it isn't just at the school where I work: I can't login on computers in cybercafes in the area either.  Maybe they all have the same type of firewall or something, but I never had this problem until around December 2006, which was about the time our school changed its ISP.  I don't know if that is related, but if that is the case, it seems strange that I can't even login when I'm off-campus.  A bit of a puzzler, isn't it?

Dear EdJohnston,

 Please find UST Global leadership team in the link http://www.ust-global.com/leadership.aspx
Do you really want to have external links that have outdated/wrong info about an article in Wikipedia? Wiki is an Encyclopedia which is most popular in the world and widely used for collecting accurate information about anything under the sun. Anyway Business Week has updated the content to the actual facts about the leadership team of UST Global. FYI the link to the same http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4298931. I think now you might have understood why I was removing this link before, when it was carrying outdated information.

 Can I ask you to check few pages in Wikipedia itself regarding UST Global content and find what i am trying to say here? This is very important. Could you please check the link http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UST_Global&limit;=500&action;=history.

This link takes you to the earliest revision history page of UST Global. Please find when this page was initially drafted and when did the user Steve Ross started editing the page. This wikipedia page was started in 2005 and Steve came in to picture by 2007. The most interesting thing here you can find is the first few edits by Steve Ross. He added himself as co-founder of UST where right now he wants to mention himself as founder of the company. Don’t you find that this user is inconsistent with his edits and this proves that his intention is to advertise himslef? Also could you please check whether this user has contributed anything else in this Wiki page other than adding his name in different roles of UST Global?

All you want to know about UST Global is available in their website (www.ust-global.com).
Also I want to repeat here that I am not here to violate any rules or policies of Wikipedia. I just want to point out the anomalies in this Wiki page. Could you please listen to my request. This is genuine.",0

"Personal dissapointment

This article will never be a FA nor a good article. It also had been the victim of some wikipedia rules that don't apply to other articles on this encyclopedia. When I first started to edit on wiki I was quite enthusiastic but later this feeling faded. For example the artcle had been moved to a name that is not used in the world of football. Steaua had always been known for its official name: FC Steaua Bucureşti. This name is used worldwide to refer to Steaua. I personally found this situation annoying and I suggest that a move should take place. I mean, the other Romanian football clubs with Bucureşti in their naming were not moved and those awkward wikipedia rules applied only to this article. 

Here are some examples about football clubs that have articles based on their official club names:

 Sporting Clube de Portugal
 Associação Académica de Coimbra - O.A.F.
 F.C. Internazionale Milano
 Olympique Lyonnais
 Deportivo de La Coruña
 Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata

 Most Haunted 

I'm concerned about the references to the """"Most Haunted"""" show in the Cultural References section.

Although """"possessed"""" is in inverted commas, I think it would be more accurate to say that he """"appeared to be possessed"""". Acorah was supposedly """"possessed"""" by some """"spirit"""" every week and in fact, he was later dropped from the Most Haunted shows after the team became convinced he was making things up from bits of information he overheard during filming. Thirdly, some of the audience say they see """"dark beings"""" and other such things on the webcams every week - not just in this programme. I think it really would be better to limit the Most haunted reference to the fact that it was the most watched programme on television that night, as the rest of it is unsubstantiated speculation that trivialises the subject.

Not at all. The context I'm using is similar to that of bootstrapping node. How does your computer become an internet node from the ground up? To oversimplify, you can frame the question in this context: if someone wants to have control (not merely contractual use of, but principle control) of a particular range of IP addresses, how does that person actually go about obtaining that control from ICANN and the powers that be? Within reason, this actually isn't possible. You would have to have the resources of a large corporation or government agency to accomplish such a goal. It is these large bodies that own the networks which interconnect with each other; everyone else is just renting access to one of these networks.

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

When you saved the logo from the """"official"""" site, , you probably saved the file as """"doop.jpg"""" (since that's what the site calls it).

The opinions Tisthammer is insisting on adding are NOT about Josephson OR about Natasha Demkina. They're about Profs. Hyman, Wiseman, and me. Josephson has nothing really to say about Natasha.

 mgts 

Next generation wireless networks are evolving into """"all-IP"""" architectures, and SS7 over Internet Protocol (IP) is becoming more prevalent as intelligent gateways become the de facto technology used to interconnect wireline and wireless networks. The MGTS™ is the leading product for testing wireline and wireless network convergence. It is a multi-user, multi-protocol programmable test system that emulates any SS7/PSTN entity or SS7 application database, and measures the functionality and performance of signaling and media gateways. The MGTS uses powerful underlying platforms, a diverse line of network interface cards, and an extensive library of protocol test modules to significantly reduce product development time, lower production costs, and ensure conformance to telecom industry standards.

MGTS reduces product development time by allowing multiple users to perform their tests concurrently. Early in the product lifecycle, the MGTS can emulate prohibitively expensive or difficult to locate network equipment. Farther along, the MGTS can support load testing to measure how much traffic the equipment can handle. MGTS also supports traffic flow monitoring between nodes in live networks. The MGTS is a flexible platform that can be customized to provide the test scripts, software protocols, and hardware needed to solve each new challenge.

Testers can create complex, multi-protocol test sequences using the Protocol Adaptable State Machine (PASM™). PASM is a complete development system that constructs common test cases by defining protocol message formats, sequencing, and operations. PASM can create any type of protocol message for use in test case sequences against a device under test (DUT). With PASM, users can easily and simultaneously test circuit and packet switches over multiple interfaces. The created test cases can be executed in either simulation or load mode for functional and system integration testing. PASM helps significantly reduce the time needed to develop comprehensive 3G, VoIP and SS7 load tests.

The MGTS supports a wide variety of applications:

    * Design and feature verification: Does the device being tested provide the desired features and functionality?
    * Conformance Testing: Does the device conform to industry standards?
    * Interoperability Testing: Will the device work with other equipment in the network?
    * Load and Stress Testing: How will the device perform under load and overload conditions?
    * Installation and Acceptance Testing: Is the device ready for installati""",0

Hello, MusicTeacherClub. I appreciate your efforts and thank you for contributing to our encyclopedia.

I'm sorry to inform you that you're contravening Wikipedia principles, namely Wikipedia is not a publisher of original research and accounts must not be shared. Unfortunately, this may lead to your being blocked or your contributions being removed.

Wikipedia tries to aggregate information that reliable sources have previously published; we do not publish original research ourselves. If we allowed that kind of thing, we would be putting two fundamental tenets—WP:Verifiability and WP:Neutral point of view—in jeopardy. I advise you to save copies of your articles to your computers, particularly Learning-Disadvantage Gap, as it may be deleted from Wikipedia soon.

A less fundamental problem is that shared accounts are not allowed. I don't really know why (I'm pretty new here); maybe we've had problem editors hide under group accounts in the past. Whatever the reason, the fact that you are a group of people sharing one account is grounds for blocking.

I'm sorry to bear bad news. I wish you good luck in finding a publisher.

"First rate - capitalisation 

Rif, I can see where you're coming from with the capitalisation of first rate (et al) but we need to work within the MoS unless you find a consensus in favour of a change.  For that reason I'll put a note at WikiShips asking people to come and have a look at the discussion at Talk:First-rate.  There you will find the reasons I believe capitals should not be used laid out clearly.  In the meantime, I feel strongly that the article should continue to reflect the approved usage, and I would ask you to keep the (wiki-correct) lower case variant until the discussion is complete.  

On another note, the article currently sits at First-rate (with a hyphen) with a redirect from First rate (without a hyphen).  I think we're both in agreement that this should be the other way round, and I suggest we move it as soon as the discussion on capitalisation is complete.  Another thing we agree strongly on is the insane use of pennant number as a disambiguation for modern ships - fine for US Navy, but madness for the RN.  Who searches for HMS Ark Royal (R07)?

Alex, thank you for your reply.
I could indeed use a break from this case, but yesterday was a very eventful day, as the case closed and then AGK answered a question I'd initially posed on August 22, meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which I had a chance to respond to the FoF, and then when it made the response, it not only confirmed the """"judgment on content"""" aspect of the FoF, if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with Arzel in which Arzel not only ignores the content of academically published RS, he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the Formisano text, for example, had been under direct discussion.

Regarding the perceived legal threat, I had no intention to make a legal threat. That was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case, starting with NewYorkBrad's comment on my FoF on August 23, to which AGK refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday, more than two weeks later. There were also email exchanges between myself and NYB and AGK, which I will have to forward to Jimbo Wales at some point, after clarifying one point made by NYB on his talk page.

The import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as I make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that AGK aspires to become an attorney (or whatever they're called in Scotland). It is secondly an indication that I have taken the time to register at Wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments I had made about """"the court of public opinion"""". And when did a little looking around there, finding an entry about NYB, for example, who had advised AGK that he didn't see any misconduct in some of the points of the FoF, so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. 

If the reiteration of material deleted by AGK from his User page within the past two weeks is """"outing"""", then that is a policy I shall have to examine. Note that I am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.

There's much more to say on this, but I need to get a couple more hours of sleep. I have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at Jimbo's talk page, but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation, not even contrasting the complete lack of an FoF on Arzel, for instance, with the response provided to me on the PD talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.

If this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions, and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished, I would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system.  連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0

 How they do it. Revealing how vandals prevent accurate information on Poppers, that they disagree with, from being posted here! 

I just figured out what's going on  what these guys are doing to those of us who want to edit the poppers page by adding more accurate and meaningful information, but which they do not agree with. If you can find the time, I urge you to go into the """"history"""" of the poppers section or page (click on the """"history"""" tab at the top of the page), and then go to the bottom of that page. There you can click on the largest number, and essentially see ALL the history of this page  from the day it was created!

I just spent time looking at it, and a clear pattern emerges. To be kind, there are some pranksters among us. More realistically, and at worse, they are vandals. Some of them appear to be working in concert with each other to make arbritary changes to the edits of people they don't agree with. They literally  and very quickly  'revert' the versions back and forth among their own versions, all the while essentially vandalizing the credible information that more knowledgeable people have posted. Then, when the unsuspecting editors realize something's going on, that their edits are being deleted almost within minutes of their having posted them, and when they try to figure out how best to react and deal with the problem, as they begin the inevitable complaining and asking of questions, they are harrassed and threaten with having their accounts 'blocked'; or they're falsely accused of violating various rules of Wikipedia, upon which they are often then threatened with even more sanctions against them.

It is precisely this kind of unethical, irresponsible and despicable behavior that was exposed in the world wide media earlier this week. Had I not seen the news reports which described exactly this kind of activity being rampant on Wikipedia, I would most likely have never figured out what was going on.

Now the article has Melee with its listings for armour and weaponry, then Mage with its listings for armour and weaponry, and then Range with its listings for armour and weaponry, which is still a total of six.  We have gone from two main headings to three main headings.

The direction we want to go needs to be decided.  Do we want to talk about armour and weaponry as topics and then break them down between the various classes?  Do we want to talk first about the class (styles) of combat and then break them down between armour and weapons?  My thought was, obviously, the first choice, while QuagmireDog seems to think it should be the second.  I do not think that either is more correct than the other.  They are just different ways of thinking about it or looking at it.

 Emile Durkheim 

Why have you removed the edit to the suicide section in Emile Durkheim's page which mentioned that egoistic suicide is also known as egotistical suicide?  This is a productive edit, as many editions/translations refer to only one term and not the other.  Readers should be aware of the relation between the terms.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 192.246.234.74   
It's redundant. Egotistic- and egotistical-suicide are the same thing.   
That is the point to stating that it is """"also known as"""" the other term.  The words are not the same: egoistic refers more to a general self-centered nature while egotistical refers more to a self-centered way of thinking and speaking.  Look up the terms and you will see that they are not perfect synonyms.  The implications of both terms on the semantics and the basic message of Durkheim's theory is significant.  This information - a matter of 5 words - should be included in Wikipedia's article.  Both are valid terms with different implications.  It would not be the first time a Wikipedia article lists multiple terms for the same thing.
According Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary they're the same words. 'He performed an egotistic suicide for egotistical reasons', same thing.   
Unless that was a typo, you just used exactly the same word twice.  The difference is between EGOISTIC (one 'T') and EGOTISTICAL (two 'T's).  Look up the two words in Merriam-Webster.  —Preceding [[Wik",0

"""It does not matter if they disclaim it's truthfulness. What matters is if they adhere to its teachings.

Some of these would say the Book of Mormon is the word of God, others may not. However, they adhere to its teachings and would thus be classified as adherents to Mormonism.

 Italian 

Hey Sajoch, if you can discuss things relaxed for a bit, I do have a question I'd like to ask a Ladin from Bolzano.  I always hear about the Italians coming and taking over.  But, can you explain to me who exactly are """"the Italians""""?  As far as I know, Italian in the modern sense is simply a citizen of the Italian Republic.  Going back a few hundred years ago, I suppose people might say they are a people """"of Italy"""", or the Italic peninsula.  But, I'd say that even to this day, many people in Italy don't refer to themselves as Italian first.  Aren't the people of Sicily, Sicilians?  The people of Napoli, Napolitani?  As far as I can tell, the """"Ladin"""" are the people of the region we happen to call Trentino-Alto Adige, and also the Romansch speakers in Switzerland are speaking essentially the same (or a VERY similar) language.  It would make sense that this pocket of Europe has its own particular language, and a language which is old-Latin based.  So, when you say you are Ladin, and not Italian... to me that is no different from someone saying they are Sicilian, and not Italian.  Then that brings me back to my original question: who is actually Italian?  Isn't the Italian language the Tuscan language actually?  So are Italians actually the people from Tuscany?  I know that Trentino is said to be majority Italian, but the people there speak Italian in modern times because it is the national language.  They still speak their original dialects like Nones, Solardo, etc.. which are actually Ladin languages.  You know that, right?  So are the people in Trentino Ladin people, or have they transformed into Italians because the Italian Republic has a National Language?  I'm just throwing these questions out there, as someone interested in my own history.  I mentioned this once to noclador, """"who are the Italians?"""" and all the discussion got me was him giving me the link to the Wikipedia page on Italians.  My guess is that some of the questions I was asking blurred the lines of a politics he would rather dream is black and white.

"Conferences are a problem I've been meaning to work on. There are only a very few conference series in the world for which there are truly substantial third party references, but there are many of great importance: the situation is similar to journals. In practice, tho we don't word it that way, the effective criterion for journals is that papers there are highly cited (as measured by the impact factor from  Journal Citation Reports). This can apply to conferences also. The difference is that for most conferences, the papers there are preliminary results and not rigorously peer reviewed & therefore  not highly cited as compared with journal papers by the same authors. There are two classes of exceptions: ones where the papers are major review articles in the field, and ones in engineering where they are the basic means of publication.  I'm not sure about this one. Ido not think it is  one of these exceptions, and I think the publications are mainly just abstracts, as is common with many conferences.  I would need to check, & I  cannot do it this week.  
But personally, I would include in WP articles about all journals used as references here, and all major conference series, however, I doubt this would have consensus.  The compromise solution is therefore to write the articles about the sponsoring society and have a section on the conference. That is probably the best thing to do here. 
The main thing I think we want to avoid is writing articles on individual conferences in a series. This would amount to our being a nonselective index or bibliography. '''''' ( talk )",0

You are a clever bloke who can bat this backwards and forwards as well as anyone, but I think that anyone genuinely objective would think that you were over-the-top.

You follow me a bit too closely.  I concur with every single Wikipedia rule without question, but feel that they can be manipulated and used selectively by editors; and that some administrators sometimes go too far then won't back down, and a few seem to enjoy it.  If I could find a way technically, I bet I could also find five Wiki users and possibly administrators to support me over Christian.

First: the policy that was mis-quoted here on this page applied to Harrassment:

It required an un-involved administrator to invoke. You are clearly not.

Second: the community explicitly rejected censorship of records in the public domain. There was no consensus found to censor such knowledge from our encyclopedia readers. """"No consensus found"""" = rejected idea.

Third: The correspondence is unequivocally, irrevocably and famously in the public domain and is clearly allowed by the arbcom editing principle referred to above.

"""::I would say that the process of """"lumping"""" and """"splitting"""" is intimately connected to phylogenetics (not to cladistics) by the fact that reality is ambiguous, both in a momentary and in a historical perspective. This is actually the problem that cladists think is connected to the Linnean systematization, and try to solve with cladistics. However, cladistics does not solve the problem, but only transfers it into concepts, erroneously equalizing time with space. The problem (i.e., ambiguity) is actually the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. This statement is extremely difficult to understand, although it is perfectly clear: the problem (i.e., ambiguity) is the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. The problem to understand it may be due to that it is a difference, since a difference is unsolvable. This problem, that is, this fact, is consistently incorporated into concepts in a systematization of the Linnean kind (i.e., categories of categories). It means that the possibility for lumping and splitting is both necessary and unavoidable. An unambiguous conceptualization is simply impossible. The question whether this fact means that reality is ambiguous has to be answered with: yes. There is no way to escape this ambiguity. Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  ]

 Posible vandalism at Catalan people Article 

Hi,

I'm sorry to continue bothering you with the same matters, but following a very polite dispute about the factual accuracy of the lead paragraph of this article in the talk-page, two annon users 81.37.144.56 and 83.56.176.180 (but I really believe it is a single one user sockpuppeting User:Martorell) are constantly removing references without a single explanation as can be seen in the Revision History.

I asked the admins to block the article to annon users for a while, but I would ask you to to run a CU whenever you have time. Because if it really is user Martorell (and I'm sure it is him as he hasn't edited since march, 6th, this will go for ever untill someone bans him. Thanks for your help.

In short, you have to be kind of a weasel about it. Insted of giving your side, you just notify the ones you think will support you, with neutral-sounding wording, and let them draw their own conclusions.  14:36",0
"Could you please explain... 

Could you please explain why you redirected Military Commission to Military Justice?

Were you unaware that one of the huge controversies over the USA's use of military commissions to try the Guantanamo captives was that they were a new distinct system, separate from its traditional military justice system?  The Military Commission system had no established rules of evidence, no established precedents.  This is why rather than being the speedy system that was promised, these cases have dragged on for almost a decade.  

Legal critics predicted these problems back when Bush tried to create the new Military Commission system.  They pointed out that the USA already had two perfectly adequate justice systems, its civilian justice system and its military justice system.  The military commission system, they pointed out, was a brand new, third justice system.

One of David Hicks's lawyers described, with disgust, why he wasn't available to give Hicks his advice, when Hicks's was presented with a plea bargain deal on the eve of his commission.  Hicks's lawyer who had flown all the way to Guantanamo, from Australia, described being told he could not participate any further in Hicks's defense, unless he signed a draconian document that would have imposed heavy punishment upon him, if he broke any of the commission's rules and procedures.  Fine, he says, please let me read those rules.  He then described his shock and outrage when he was told that he couldn't be given a copy of the commission's rules and procedures because they hadn't been written yet.

Did you make this redirect on your own, sole judgment, or was it made after discussion with others?

Frankly I think this redirection was a bad idea, very misleading.",0
"""It should be noted that none of the """"leaders"""" mentioned here were tribal presidents, or even anyone from the upper ranks of the tribes (according to the Rapid City Journal).

""",0
"""

On another point, the article includes a quote of Rawat's supposedly drawn from his first website:

In an article named Journey that he published in his personal website on January 1999, Prem Rawat writes about this apparent contradiction: People through the years have tried to place me in a mold, and from the very early years I have not been able to oblige them. When I was very young, people were looking for the """"old silver-haired Guru with flowing white robes."""" I was only eight. When people were flocking to India for their search, I was in the West. When people were looking for sophisticated discourses, I spoke of simple things. When people wanted nirvana, I said, """"You need peace."""" When people said, """"Tell us of the scriptures,"""" I said, """"Look within you."""" When people asked, """"What is your qualification?"""" I said, """"Judge me by what I offer."""" To this day, some people see me the way they want to. After all, I guess it is rather inconvenient to see things as they really are. I have evolved, but my message stays the same. Externally, I have changed but within me, something stays the same. In that same article Rawat states that people wanted to see him as a figurehead and as a leader but that he does not want to be one or the other, and that all he wanted to do is speak to those who wanted to hear him, and impart the Knowledge to those that sought it. He also said that if people like what is given, to practice it and if not, to leave it.[14]

However, the attribution link takes one to Rawat's current site instead.  If there is no proper attribution here, this passage should be deleted, no?

That said, I'm dumbfounded at how the Tea Party case turned out, specifically (though not exclusively) the sanction against user:Collect. I had not followed that case while in progress. I knew it existed, but the first time I looked at it was after I saw the request for appeal by Collect. I decided to trace through the case, to see if I could understand how the committee reached their sanction. I traced through  my observations at  a talk page post to NW. Short version, I saw virtually nothing in the evidence, and virtually nothing in the workshop, so I was puzzled by the strong sanction. 
The response, and I quote:
You said:
I think that for the large part, the evidence and workshop phases were ignored in this case 

In some fairness, the sanction itself listed some diffs, but I find them short of compelling. 

I think some discussion about process is in order.(Talk) """,0

"WebGlobix deletion 

At first the article on WebGlobix you deleted was marked G7 blatant advertising, the next time I looked it was marked as (A7 (group): Group/band/club/company/etc; doesn't indicate importance/significance) by Orange Mike. 

I guess I should be happen that the article went from a G to an A but clearly Orange Mike doesn't appreciate the nuances of desktop virtualization. Especially a product that doesn't use Terminal Services or only transmit drawing commands and mouse events only thereby only requiring a small resource (memory/cpu) footprint. It is such a big deal that the Department of Defense uses it for its Global Command and Control processes. That is a big deal in VDI. The desktop shadowing feature is totally cool. 

We use it and I like it and that is why I think it should be included people need to know what is out there. They can judge for themselves but without information they will have no opportunity. WebGlobix is better than Citrix because we used to have Citrix and it was a pain.  Citrix is such a big deal but it is very expensive and takes a full time person just to administrate it. We have neither that kind of money or time.

Well in any event I didn't see any interaction with my comments or maybe it is because I need to login to see them but I hope when you guess hand off stuff that it is at least reviewed by someone who understand the process being discussed so they can appreciate the relevance.

"I completely agree with you, we cannot expect aliens to interpret pictures, movies, sound and text the way we do. Even if they would be able to see the same spectrum as us, it remains doubtful if those images will mean anything to them at first glance. However, the point here is to convey information. While we can look at a picture at all wavelengths, it is only in the visible spectrum that information on this picture (patterns and variations) start to appear (at other wavelengths, its blank). An analogy would be satellites using SARs to pierce the cloud cover of Venus and image its surface.   There is little information in the visible spectrum but lots outside of it. If the information is encoded in a digital form (eg: RGB) rather than displayed using our technology, then they will interpret it in colors they can see as this encoding is not relative to a specific spectrum. Still, they should be able to figure out what king of colors we meant to encode in the first place by looking at the probes themselves and the markings on them. I think that the aliens will be able to make sense of this information easily. Regardless, I completely agree with you. It will take them years to analyze what we have sent them and make sense of it (ie: convert it to something they can relate to), but if they feel as lonely as us, then I trust that they will invest the resources and time.",0

In Canada you have  one month to register a child, in Portugal for those born abroad there is no time limit to register.

The problem I have with the consensus version:
1. It is not a consensus, not everybody agrees

No, what you said before was that the term """"is not used in Ireland"""".  You're now admitting it is used - if rarely (I happen to agree with you there!).  Government policy doesn't cover geography.  And as demonstrated, government policy doesn't appear to cover FF senators and TDs (but then, that's not new...).  AFAICR, the Dept of Education essentially said """"Not our problem"""" when a teacher (?) complained to them about Folens using the BI term in its atlas and told the complainant to get in touch with the publishers directly.  To me, what smacks of a post-colonial inferiority complex is the drive by a vocal minority to expunge the term from every Irish-related article.  I rarely if ever use the term myself in everyday life (I prefer Ireland and Britain or Britain and Ireland), but if it does get used - meh!  Big deal!  I don't think it as a conspiracy to undermine sovereign Ireland, put us down, offend us, somehow claim our territory or subsume us back into the union, the way some people on here seem to take it.  Britain and Ireland, though, isn't a geographical term - its two different islands! I'd rather just say the Shannon is the longest river in Ireland than the longest in B & I - though my preference would still be to use the worldwide common name for the island group.

I see. Then, very regrettably, Wikipedia is crippled from its birth, suffering from an inherent, incurable disease: its disregard for truth. Such policies theoretically allow the building of articles comprised mainly of false contents, simply by providing ample references that in turn are false, claiming they are """"reliable sources"""".

 Choosing an easement curve 

I'd like to be clear about:
(a) which curves are actually used in practice ...
(b) in the various railways administrations; not just North American but also others, e.g. Australian, European, Indian etc.  (This would help with NPOV.)

My main concern is with (a).  Although the article mostly discusses Euler spirals, it seems to give the impression that's the only curve used, under varying names.  However, consider this quotation (from the AREMA reference in the article):
There are several different types of mathematical spirals available for use, including the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate.  Of more common use on railways are the Searles, the Talbot and the AREMA 10-Chord spirals, which are empirical approximations of true spirals.
This reference is, of course, discussing common use on American railways; but even in this limited context, it appears there are at least three ideal mathematical spiral forms involved: """"the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate"""", along with various practical approximations to them.

The article would ideally give the history of the use and adaptation of these various spiral forms.  Doing so would provide a solid illustration of how technological innovation was both necessitated and encouraged by the Age of Rail - a valuable insight into the social impact of rail.

I'm guessing that the AREMA reference probably continues on from the quote above to give some further detail about those approximations, their inventors and their history; but it may not.  In any case, can anybody provide suitable references to help flesh out this story?

CNN tilted more to the left than did FOX News. The conclusion that CNN’s headlines were perceived as more liberal than FOX News’, rather than FOX News’ headlines’ being perceived as more conservative than CNN’s, is supported by the finding that overall, the headlines from FOX News were rated slightly on the liberal side of neutral. If FOX News’ headlines had been perceived as biased toward the conservative viewpoint, then the overall ratings should have exceeded 50 percent.”)
>Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, Harvard University, & Project for Excellence in Journalism, “The Invisible Primary – Invisible No Longer: A First Look at Coverage of the 2008 Presidential Campaign,” p. 32  (noting that “The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates—by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral.”)
Please note that at the beginning of the CNN article (fourth paragraph down), the following statement appears: """"Among the general public, CNN has a more centrist perception.” The source for this proposition is FAIR, FAIR being a “progressive media criticism organization” whose “target invariably is bias on the right” . Needless to say, FAIR is not a reliable source. Will you please help me to get rid of this statement on the CNN article?

 Your edits to Robert Byrd 

I had to revert your edits to the above article for a number of reasons. First of all, articles must conform to WP:NPOV and be writted from a neutral point of view. This applies to critics of his record and supporters that seek to apologize for his past actions. As per Wikipedia policy, the burdern of proof would be on Byrd's critics, and not the senator, regarding whether or not he is still involved in the Klan. Any such implication without a source that he is still a member would, therefore, violate WP:V. Also, the placing of the comment in the first paragraph would violate WP:LEAD. 

Furthermore, the part about Marshall and Thomas is in fact in the article, as (regardless of what his backers may feel) pertinent to his record and is written according to WP policy. While the comments about the other nominees are arguable, you could, if well-sourced (which wouldn't be hard to do), find a quote from respected conservative civil rights activist Niger Innis that called his opposition to Rice and others """"racist"""". You could say something like """"His opposition to (whoever) was Labled as racist by Niger Innis, a spokeperson for CORE.""""

Speedy deletion of Demockracy
 A tag has been placed on Demockracy requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for musical topics. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

I am not saying notability won't matter. I'm saying women are under-represented, while they are still notable. It is hard to justify that these ladies are way more important than those guys who are left out. So the question is, are we willing to see some female representation? Remember that, there are very few female Wikipedians here and I'm afraid there was no participation from any female editors here, which I'm afraid may have induced gender bias in the polling.

The report found that police, social services and charities were failing to properly investigate this """"hidden issue"""" and that a quarter of offenders reported for child grooming since 2008 were Asian, an apparently disproportionate figure, but Peter Davies, the head of Ceop, was quick to clarify that the findings did not provide a national picture because of incomplete data, and cautioned against extrapolating anything from the results.

Again - I'm not sure that this section needs to exist. Also from the outset it is misleading. CEOP constantly monitor for and act upon child grooming  - they didn't suddenly decide to start after this case.

"""== It's not emo. ==

I had posted a topic about a band that has been labeled emo, only for someone to delete it. Stating that """"it is completely off topic, unproductive, unrelated to this article, and that belongs in a discussion forum"""" Hello, this is a discussion forum for the emo page, if we have an issue with something on it, it's suppose to be displayed here and talked over. Do not delete peoples post because YOU think it doesn't fit to YOUR standards, it's for people to talk on.

With that, I repost my statement to WHY Coheed and Cambria are not emo.

First off, I'd like to take the time to say. Read this, and don't reply UNLESS you are agreeing, or are going to change this matter. If you are just going to sit there and whine because you are wrong about something, I don't want to hear it.

So here we begin...

Each song that Coheed and Cambria has made, has gone in flow with a comic that Claudio Shanchez (Lead Singer) has thought of in that brilliant mind of his. Some might claim some of the songs emo due to a few lyrics. Well, how else would you explain a painful moment, or happy moment in a story? A rhyme about whatever the heck """"junk in a trunk"""" is? No, you'd have an explanation of the characters pain and happiness.

Perhaps you should read some stuff from wiki itself. 
Within The Amory Wars page, (The comic made by Claudio)

""""The story follows the adventure of Claudio Kilgannon across the fictional solar system, far in the past known as Heaven's Fence, in an attempt to seek help from his Uncle, after his parents are tricked into murdering Claudio's siblings, and then murdered themselves by the Supreme Tri-Mage and ruler of Heaven's Fence, Wilhelm Ryan.""""

All of their songs came from a point in the story, if you had known the story, you'd not tag them as emo at all. Because in fact they are not, it's a story. Get over it and stop with all of this """"scene"""" stuff. 

It's all a story, unlike other bands that cry and scream about """"I want to die, no one understands me, I have it so bad, My girlfriend left me because I am whiny""""

Understand what I am pointing out?

Emo is the most ridiculous label ever, yet sadly it is here and people wont let it die willingly. 
So, why not research bands before you label. While you are at it, read the Coheed and Cambria comics, they are quite the epic. This now ending my humble opinion on this matter of why they shouldn't be in this """"Emo label"""" scene.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Doesn't matter if they are or aren't emo.  They're listed here as a band that has been called emo.  In fact, that's the point of the paragraph - to demonstrate how nebulous the term is.

If you want the related Wikipedia guidelines - all we have to do is supply a reliable source (per WP:RS) that confirms that C&C; have been called emo.  Source.  That's it.  That's all we need.  Any amount of rambling about how they are or aren't emo is irrelevant.  

And you trust MTV? The people that don't even play music anymore, pathetic. Well, I counter your source with mine.  Source.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Did you really read what I wrote?  It doesn't matter if they're emo or not.  We're not using C&C; as an example of an emo band, we're using C&C; as an example of a band that's been called emo.  They've been called emo, so they're mentioned.  Period.

(BTW - click on the """"tag"""" page of your """"source"""".)  

Honestly, I read it. But I don't give a damn what you wrote. Apparently you are one of those """"I must be right, or heaven shall fall"""" type of people. But, yet again. So you're making your own rules for Wikipedia now? You know, the public place? ....Cute.

A Few Things I Wanted to Say
I don't understand why everyone thinks Cockney can only be spoken on the East End.  It seems to be much more of a working or lower class accent found all over London (maybe not """"all over"""", but certainly not just the East End).  If you listen to sound clip for example, you'll hear a man from Peckham.  Peckham is not in the East End, instead it is in South London, and yet he is more Cockney than anyone I have heard in my life.  It says in this article as well that most characters on the sitcom Only Fools and Horses are Cockneys, and yet that takes place where else but in Peckham.  This article also says that Snatch contains Cockney accents and yet Jason Statham who plays one of the main characters in that film and seems to speak with one of those accents, is actually from Sydenham, in south-east London.    

What are some differences between the so-called """"South London"""" (south of the Thames) accent and """"North London"""" accent?  I just find it annoying that locals claim to be able hear differences between the two and yet they never can describe those differences when asked.  It makes one doubt whether such differences even exist.  It's kind of like how New Yorkers claim to be able to distinguish between Bronx accents and Brooklyn accents, Irish New York accents and Italian New York accents, etc., but when asked what those differences are, they can't give you an answer.  It's all b.s. if you ask me.   """,0

White light is a wavefront with power(energy) equally distributed across the visible frequency spectrum. When the wavefront has power levels distributed at different frequencies so that some parts the spectrum have more or less power, then we call that a color. The wavefront that impacts the eye to produce the sensation of Magenta has high power levels in the lower and higher frequencies and low power levels in the center frequencies. It is just one wavefront but shaped in power intensity vs frequency. There is no such thing as different colors of light waves, only a wavefront that has a power vs frequency shape. As such there are not incoming different frequencies of light to produce a color, its just one wavefront. No separate blue or red light enters the eye to be combined and produce a color. The color is inherent in the energy distribution of the wavefront which stimulates the frequency sensitive biological receptors in proportion to the power levels within the wavefront.

It is for this reason that Magenta is (as are all colors) spectral. It is the energy vs frequency distribution of the incoming wavefront that produces the perceived color sensation. Any color you like can be produced by a single tunable light source through modulation.

One wavefront .... not seperate incoming light colors.",0

 UPDATE 

I don't have time for another long post, but I would like to share a site that you can use.  http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/shilohshepherd.htm

This site also includes 

ARBA = American Rare Breed Association
APRI = American Pet Registry Inc.
NKC = National Kennel Club

However, my research has proven that many other """"registries"""" are also selling papers for Shiloh Shepherds!!  These include, but are not limited to .....

Other All-Breed Registries: 

The following is a list of some of the other all-breed registries in existence in North America — Caution should be exercised when dealing with a breeder who registers with any of these registries, especially when the breed is recognized by any of the major all-breed registries listed above. Many breeders use these registries because they are not able to meet the more demanding requirements of the CKC, AKC, or UKC. 

The information shown in quotations was taken directly from the registry's web site and speaks for itself as to the goals of some of these registries. 

American Canine Association (ACA) — """"America's largest veterinary health tracking purebred canine registry."""" — Note: In the """"Find A Puppy"""" section of their website, dog/puppy seekers are referred to pet/retail stores. Very little information is available on the website regarding their goals or mission as a registry. 

American Purebred Registry (APR) — The APR issues registration certificates for dogs and cats. They start a pedigree file with the information the owner sends them. Once APR accepts an application, a registration certificate is issued and the animal is considered registered. APR is a record keeping agency only and does not sponsor dog shows, field trials or competitions of any kind. On the application, the owner certifies that the dog or cat is a purebred representative of the breed. They take the owner's word for it and no proof is required. 

America's Pet Registry Inc. (APRI) — """"An internationally recognized association of responsible pet owners, breeders, distributors, veterinarians, retailers, pet product manufacturers, and other concerned parties dedicated to the humane care of animals, the preservation of quality bloodlines, and the individual's right of pet ownership."""" APRI recently re-incorporated as a for-profit corporation. — The APRI promotes and encourages the sale of dogs and cats through distributors and retailers. """"America's Pet Registry, Inc. was begun as insurance for the pet industry..."""" """"APRI offers free dual registrations on dogs from reputable registration services to professional breeders. We classify a professional breeder as one who has three or more breeding females and who regularly sells puppies in the pet market."""" 

Animal Registry Unlimited (ARU) — Some statements found on the opening page of their website: """"We register all pets and animals."""" """"We guarantee that your pet or animal can be registered with us."""" """"Providing a registry for the development of new breeds of useful pets and animals. Unlike many organizations we encourage the development of new breeds."""" 

Continental Kennel Club (CKC) — Note: This registry is also known as the CKC and should not be confused with the Canadian Kennel Club — These are two completely separate registries.) — The Continental Kennel Club recognizes 450 breeds as purebred. The Continental Kennel Club has a section known as """"Miscellaneous Breed Registration"""" which allows for the crossing of two purebred parents of different breed types to produce hybrid puppies. Registered as MISC/BREED1-BREED2 and isolated from purebred registrations, they are distinguished from other breeds on registration certificates by having """"non-purebred"""" printed on their registration certificates. In addition, the Continental Kennel Club has a section within their club for developing new breeds. Stock used for these breeding programs is listed in the """"Development Class"""". The Continental Kennel Club has implemented a classified section on their site where club members can advertise their breeds. If you have a look at some of the more popular breeds such as the Cocker Spaniel, some of the kennels advertising there include breeders of cock-a-poos and other crosses. The Continental Kennel Club's website provides very little information regarding their goals or mission as a registry. For more information, however, there is a very thorough web page at: Continental Kennel Club FAQ.

 Outback gothic 

With this edit, an editor recently reinstated some text about Australian horror films. In the edit summary, it was stated """"First, a film doesn't have to be internationally famous to be part of the Australian film culture. Second, the theme of outback gothic has been dissembled for no reason because it listed a couple of less famous films."""" I took a look at the only citation in the reinstated text, and I see a key problem - it doesn't support the text in the article. The source doesn't support the sentence """"A major theme of Australian cinema has been survival in the harsh Australian landscape."""", it doesn't use the term """"outback gothic"""", and doesn't mention most of the quoted films, such as Wake in Fright, The Cars That Ate Paris, Shame etc etc. In fac the only sentence which the source supoprts is the one that was already in the article before the edit was made: """"Saw (2004) and Wolf Creek (2005) are credited with the revival of Australian horror."""" For now I am reverting the edit.

 How to Get the Wiki-Astrology Page Back Online & Honest 

One of the best ways to get the Astrology Page back to good use was mentioned by Chris Brennan, who wisely thought that a Wiki-project on Astrology would help. I agree with Chris. Astrology is most likely the oldest, and best documented science in the history of humankind, leading to the invention of mathematics, medicine, and many other disciplines taken for granted by conventional science. Moreover, the history of astrology is also well-documented, even in the United States, where it must be remembered that it is an historical fact that the Founding Fathers of the U.S. not only practiced astrology, but used its principles to set, and then build Washington D.C., aligning the capital with the fixed stars in the constellation Virgo. The expert astrologers, and those with the knowledge base have worked hard, and seriously to improve the page; however, the arguments that seek to """"debase"""" astrology from a POV has disrupted the Wiki-Astrology page based on the failure to not accept historical facts while promoting a """"pseudo-science"""" viewpoint designed to blot out over 5,000 years of historical and scientific fact. A balance, with facts, surely can proceed, and Chris Brennan's idea of a project would help to combine diversifed views into cohesive subject matter that seeks to enlighten the mind, rather than to darken it. Welcoming views that seek to expand the knowledge base, rather than to shrink it through personal POV, is the best course. """,0

"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now.

Removed from """"THEOLOGY"""" portion as it does not fit the title. Please discuss whether this fits under critism or political headings.

In many respects, the Jewish Messiah becomes nothing but a catalyst, even a figurehead, for Paulinism's own agenda. Paul's new religion had the advantage over other salvation-cults of being attached to the Hebrew Scriptures, which Paul reinterpreted as forecasting the salvific death of Jesus. This gave Pauline Christianity an awesome authority within the period culture that proved attractive to Gentiles thirsting for salvation. MacCoby, Hyam, The Mythmaker, Paul and the Invention of Christianity (ISBN 0-06-0155825)

A.N. Wilson, among others, contends  that Paul invented the Eucharist A.N Wilson, Paul:The Mind of the Apostle. (The contention that the eucharist originates in the religion of Mithras has been widely canvassed since at least the 2nd century when Justin Martyr disputed the allegation .)

He argues, likewise,  (ibid.)  that the idea of justification by faith was his and which can be contrasted with passages in the gospel and elsewhere where doing the will of God is paramount. 'Not everyone who says to me """"Lord, Lord"""", will enter the kingdom of Heaven but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.' - Matthew 7:21)cf. James 2:18ff  

Those who characterize the tenets of Catholic Christianity as """"Pauline"""" compare it with its alternatives, beliefs that Christian theologians called heresies.

It is argued that the Paulines were responsible for the marginalisation of James, the leader of the Jerusalem church, in favour of Peter. The small scattered Jewish Jerusalem Church was disbanded in 135 with the banishment of the Jews from the region by the Romans, having been decimated during the Jewish revolt of 66-70AD.

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

Aha! So Kayla and Kailina are the same; but there's more to be explained. After checking some more sources I think we can be sure of the existence of at least two separate Agaw dialects/languages (just like Bender 1976:8 says; but unlike Ethnologue and Sommer 1992): first, Qemant-Kemant-Chemant-Kamant-Kimantinya-Kimanteney, and secondly Kayla-Kaila-Kailinya (ethnonym Betə Israel (cf. Mann & Dalby 1987:16), xenonyms Falasha/Felasha from Ge'ez 'immigrant, stranger'; Yihudi (cf. Ethnologue 1992 as cited in Sommer 1992). Kemant could be extinct by now (Sommer 1992 mentions that """"according to Gamst, Kemant is threatened by extinction""""). In any case, a huge language shift is going on here; all speakers are bilingual in Amharic and according to Ethnologue, only 1650 native speakers of Kemant were left, out of an ethnic group of about 170,000 people in 1998. Endangered, to say the least.
Quirin (1998) leads me to believe that an important reason for Qemant and Kayla being separate languages is that their speakers (coming from a common Agaw base) developed separate identities from the beginning of the 14th century on. However, apparently there's a lot of fuss going on in Beta Israel historiography (cf. e.g. ) and I don't know enough about it at present to judge sources like this (though Qurin seems to have done his homework).
Anyway, a third dialect seems to be Qwera/Quara/Qwarina/'Kara of Kwarasa'/Hwara/Hwarasa; this one appears to be extinct (cf. Ethnologue). It seems to have been related more closely to Qemant — Gamst (p.c. to Sommer, Sommer 1992:358) proposes that """"Quara, Quarinya, spoken by a few Falasha in Quara (to the west of Qemant-land), is nearly the same language as Qemant.""""

"Umair Ashraf ('Flores hymn') is the Departmental anthem of Flores, (Flores Department) which is an Administrative Division of the country of Uruguay.

Cultural note

Uruguay is notable that as well as its national anthem, various of its departments have also adopted their own anthems in an effort to promote civic identity and responsibility.

Writer and composer

The words and music of the anthem are written by Danilo Pallares Echeverría.

Description

The hymn consists of three stanzas, two of eight lines and one of nine lines. 

They describe and celebrate the Flores Department's beauty and the achievements of its people. These are linked to the patriotic values of the Uruguayan nation. 

Beyond Uruguay, universal values of humanity are evoked as being encapsulated in the Flores Department.

"'As a result ingestion of excessively high levels of saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids in order to assimilate enough omega-6 fatty acids is common'. 

What does that mean ? 

Does one require excessively high levels of saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids in order to assimilate omega-6 fatty acids? 

Or (excluding the issue of ideal Omega 3/6 ratio) is there a direct link between the intake/absorption of saturated, monounsaturated, omega 6, and omega 3 fatty acids, and if so, what is that link, and is it desirable or undesirable? 

I have re-edited part (as follows) - which you may wish to consider:

Triglycerides 

Excess saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids are unused and accumulate in the body in the form of triglycerides. 

Reducing triglyceride levels - Options

1. Moderate the consumption of saturated and monounsaturated fats, alcohol and carbohydrates
2. Aerobic exercise
3. Increasing the intake of omega 3 fatty acids (fish, and fish oil)
4. Reduce the intake of omega 6 fatty acids
5. Niacin (vitamin B3) megadose
6. Statins 
7. Fibrate drugs (with reservation, see following)

Carbohydrates 

Carbohydrate consumption increases insulin production, which in turn increases triglyceride production [4]. According to the American Heart Association, diets with carbohydrates constituting more than 60% of total caloric intake can increase triglyceride levels[3]. 
Exercise and reduced carbohydrate consumption prevent insulin overproduction. 

Omega 3/6 Ratio

Triglyceride levels are reduced by Omega-3 fatty acids from fish, flax seed oil or other sources. The recommended intake is 3 grams/day in US, and 2grams in Europe. Ideally, it should consumed in conjunction with Omega-6 fatty acids - but with the latter at much lower levels than typically found in Western diets.[5]
With the exception of Japan, most westerners have an omega-3 intake that is too low, and an omega 6 intake which is much too high - the ratio being about 12 in France, and up to 80 in caucasian US and Canadian populations.

Fibrate Drugs

Whilst fibrate drugs reduce triglycerides substantially, their side effects preclude their use as a first line treatment. One such drug, clofibrate has been withdrawn from the North American market because of the increased risk of mortality.

Alcohol 

Alcohol abuse can cause elevated levels of triglycerides.",0

 BLP, ethnicity, gender

Well, as I predicted, they've diverged over time. And now the wiki-lawyers are arguing that """"policy"""" trumps """"guidelines"""".  Since the BLP policy doesn't specifically mention Ethnicity and Gender, while at least a half dozen guidelines do, it's been disrupting WP:CFD, and WP:EGRS, and quite a bit else.

Could you take a look at the main (above), and see whether you support adding Ethnicity and Gender into the policy?

Wikistalkers by erstwhile administrators deserve severe sanctions

I have been wikistalked by an administrator Hu12 and his coconspirator, Barek.  The dispute arose because I had put in a link to a Central Michigan University timeline on lighthouses in Michigan in an article on Marquette, Michigan  the link was perfectly appropriate, and was not a commercial site or spam.  I received a note from Barek saying he had deleted the link on the Discussion page.  I told him it was a perfectly fine link and that his action was ill-advised.  The next thing I knew, Hu12 intervened.  The two of them started Wikistalking me together, removing not just the link, but removing the link from every page where I had put it.  Additionally, they started doing blind """"Undos"""" and obliterating large portions of articles that I had contributed.  There was no reason for any of this.  When I protested their course of action, they suspended my editing privileges.  This was done precipitously.  BK Conrad has investigated this matter, and deems the blind edits to be 'unfortunate.'

I complained to BK Conrad, an administrator.  He undid the suspension, but did not deal with my substantive complaint about this administrator.  He suggested that I could contact you.

I would also add that Hu12 deleted my complaints to him from his talk page (I put them back), and has now (conveniently) archived the pages.

Additionally, one of my correspondents, Asher196, had noted in the history section of an article that the deletion was unwarranted.  I contacted him and reported the Wikistalking.

Indeed, what you will uncover, should you choose to look, is that Hu12 and Barker were engaged in wholesale eradication of my contribution from articles, sometimes to the point where the article virtually disappeared. There was no excuse for this.  It is the very definition of Wikistalking.

As I said, when I protested this, I was suspended.

I have done a whole lot of editing here.  Many thousands of edits.  I have never before been accused of spamming the system.  I wasn't doing this here, either.

While I agree with BK that it would be best if I could just avoid these bullies, the matter is not so easily resolved.  They sought me out.  They attacked me.  They abused their administrative privileges.

While I could turn a blind eye to this, it will only encourage this untoward behavior.  When Czeckoslovakia falls, Poland can't be far behind.  Someone needs to report this and stop this untoward and unspeakable behavior.  Based on my reading of Hu12's talk page (before it disappeared), the man has attitude problems that have surfaced before.

Wikistalking by administrators will frustrate the contributors, and cause them to quit Wikipedia.  They've already done that to me.  Let there not be a repetition.  The very lifeblood of your organization is at stake.

I have attacked copies of my correspondence to and from BK Conrad and Asher196.

If you need further information, please advise.

I will send this to Asher196 and BKConrad, so they are informed of my complaint.
  Stan

BK:
Thank you.

However, this has soured me, and I will cure myself of my wikiaholic behavior. I quit. They've achieved their victory, and Wiki will lose my modest contributions.

That being said, I think you should look close at what they edited, and come to your own conclusion. They gutted whole articles. This was WIKISTALKING and they went FAR beyond what they complained about. This was search and destroy, pure, simple and unvarnished. It was a clear abuse of power. I will not abide an abuse of power, and will not let this rest without their being brought to justice  they are bullies, and this was wrong.

I for one would not stand silently and idly by while the Wehrmacht makes the Jews disappear into the railroad cars.

Moreover, their actions showed an intent (and attempt) to bully me into silence about their misconduct. It was a cover up.

Accountability in this system is important. Those who abuse their powers do not deserve to be trusted to hold the reins. They deserve the severest sanctions, and should be stripped of administrative privileges.

What they did here was very destructive of the goals of an organization that depends on the good will and volunteer efforts of contributors.

The solution to this is very simple. Find a source which says this isn't genocide. If you can't, then the article can't say that it might not have been genocide. Do you think you're the only person who has ever wanted to write something that can't be supported by WP:RS? I can think of a hundred occassions when it has stopped me contributing something I consider blindingly obvious. But WP:RS is the only way to keep Wikipedia halfway honest.
To address your criticism of the article, I point out that governments, for obvious reasons, are reluctant to issue a direct order to commit genocide even if genocide is their aim. Even Hitler didn't issue a direct order to gas all of the Jews in Europe. That doesn't mean that the Holocaust wasn't genocide. They will also always claim that the genocide was quid pro quo, or an unavoidable part of a war they are committing. The Kosovo war is an excellent example of this.
But many people today seem to think genocide, brutal warfare, terror actions and large massacres are the same thing and can all be called """"genocide"""" when you like. No way. During the Rwanda war, Madeleine Albright famously said that genocide wasn't being committed, but that acts of genocide were. How many massacres make a genocide? You seem to think it is obvious that this episode of massacres did not add up to genocide. But the point at which many massacres become genocide is, tragically, subjective.   """,0

"Please view my video and pass it on to your friends and colleagues. The more viewers I get, will support my case in the court of public opinion and pressure the three involved companies, Chrysler, Compuware d/b/a Professional Services, and Combustion Components to settle my 11 year homelessness.

Search: Corporate Blacklisted engineer

   

I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer for almost 20 years collectively for the following companies; Pratt and Whitney, Williams International, Ford Motor Company, and as a contract engineer for Compuware d/b/a Professional Services at Chrysler Corporation in Auburn Hills, Mi. It is the latter two to which I am forging my complaint as they told prospective employers, my private investigator and my newspaper reporter, that I was not employed by them, thus blacklisting me, and preventing from all future employment.

 

I believe that they did this to me because I found fault with one of Chrysler’s automotive designs that could have resulted in a safety issue, that they did not want to fix and it was easier and cheaper to get rid of me.

 

I took my case all the way to the Supreme Court in Washington, DC and in Boston’s Federal court ….all courts denied me justice. A lawyer representing Chrysler offered me $1000 to settle the case about 2 years ago which I refused since I felt it was like a slap in the face compared to the injustice they have caused me.

 

Your viewing of my video will greatly help to end my 11 yrs of homelessness by increasing public awareness of my case and consequently, will send Chrysler, Compuware and combustion components a direct message that I am not giving up and refuse to go quietly into the night.

 

Thank you for your time and consideration,

 I'm accused of having multiple accounts by Noclador in his bizarre digging up of diffs (man, this guy has no life whatsoever) and then that sticks as me using sock puppets?  He makes these statements like, """"Furthermore there is socketpuppetry: user:Viewtool, user:Account101, user:Wikifun-usa, user:Nospu, user:Infinity88, user:Jamesbozen, user:Rossifumi-gp and user:Mud-miner were all incarnations of Icsunonove with which he tried to manipulate votes regarding the naming of locals in South Tyrol ceckuser results at bottom of this page"""".  What?  I never used any such accounts.

Noclador
 It is amazing that Wikipedia lets this person, who is obsessively attacking another user, continue without criticism.  This person has such an extreme amount of time on his hands that he attempts to catalog diffs against another user, even surmising (with absolutely no proof) what accounts may belong to a user that are literally years old.  That this user has a Myspace page like Noclador, that has a statement such as """"noclador is ever victorious -)"""" should demonstrate what small-minded intentions he has in life.  I do pity him.  That users like PhJ and Gryffindor back him up are no surprise.  Gryffindor, as I've said before, is one of the most unethical Administrators I've ever witnessed on Wikipedia.

 Errors in Listing 

There are a number of errors in this list.
The short 25 pounder is an Australian designed & built pack gun. It fired standard 25 pounder ammunition & was designed using the standard 25 pounder (which was being licenced built in Australia at the time) as a starting point but little else in common.
The M777 is actually a combined USA/UK origon. The weapon was designed in UK & all the titanium parts are made there, the barell is designed & made in USA & the finished weapon is assembled there (Britian does not at this point field this weapon)
Two different imperial sized guns are listed with the same metric dimensions which can't be correct (I believe the 8"""" gun is correct but not the 9.2"""" gun).
I don't believe any of the L5 pack howitzers are still in use. The army reserve stopped using them some time in the 1990's.
The F2 mortar is a UK/Canada design. Australia announced in 2012 it was looking at replacing the current F2 motar, therefore I would be very supprised if it only came into service in 2010 (it was designed in the 1960's).

"""

 From WP:ANI 

Hi, all.  Now that I know that this discussion exists, I'd like to contribute.

I'll say three things briefly, then answer any questions.  First, I have no intention of making any phone calls in the future.  Second, I am absolutely certain that my actions in no way threatened the privacy of any editors and therefore was not an example of WP:OUT.  Third, please note the context of this accusation.   

 Ok, here's the context: your supporters feel that the phone call to someone's place of business does not belong in the RFC.  Fine then, based on the section of WP:NPA that I have quoted both in our discussion on my talkpage, and I believe I left it in the RFC, this is an issue that requires immediate intervention - if there is indeed action to be taken.  Indeed, when I became aware of the situation in the RFC, I should have brought it here myself.  You have had about a full day since the end of the interactions on my talkpage to reflect - based on the above, I'm not sure you used the time wisely. (talk→  ←track) 

A couple of weeks ago, I voluntarily revealed the fact that I did this research, while carefully avoiding any revelation of private information.  My motivation was to demonstrate that yet another checkuser conviction was mistaken.
Weeks passes without a whisper, until the now-departed User:Paularblaster digs it up to try to add substance to an unpersuasive RfC/CU that he and Schrandit launched.  There was no haste or cause for it, just an ax to grind.
Now, I said outright that I won't be doing this again, and whether or not you agree with the action, there was never any potential to harm anyone, much less an intent to do so.  All this talk about a """"chilling effect"""" is well-meaning but simply mistaken.  No matter how you add it up, the situation is one that requires calm reflection, not urgent action, because there's a risk of knee-jerk reaction without actually understanding what happened.
Now, I'm going to ask you, Bwilkins, the question you refused to answer before, and which you deleted from your talk page.  Bwilkins, how could my phone call have caused anyone to lose their job?   

(@ CarolineWH) Do you understand why we would be concerned with your off wiki sleuthing, and how that could have a chilling effect?  In other areas it would be bad enough, but considering that you are editing abortion-related articles (some of which likely document the murders or stalking of abortion providers) makes it more so.   

If there was ever any risk of private information being revealed, then I'd agree.  But there wasn't, so no, there is no chilling effect.  As for abortion, it's a red herring, as the two editors I researched had nothing to do with the issue.  I would add that this is not a matter of stalking someone I disagree with, but confirming that they were innocent of sockpuppetry.   

(ec):It was uncalled for sleuthing. You clearly indicate investigating the workplace of either Spotfixer or Phil Specter, even if it eventually didn't turn out to be their workplace. Had it happened to me, I would consider such intrusive investigations into my private life just to one-up me in a content dispute, harassment. Despite saying you won't make such phone calls in the future, I see no indication that you understand how serious and inappropriate it was.  

If I had determined that either of them were Spotfixer, I'd have bit my tongue to protect their privacy and allow RfCU to properly convinct them.  The scenario you described would indeed be chilling, but it has nothing to do with the reality of what I did.  Again, unless you can show how my actions were even potentially harmful, it's hard for me to consider them either serious or inappropriate.  I agreed not to do it again, but that doesn't mean that what I did was wrong.

The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by """"mainstream"""" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the """"mainstream"""" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails. Gregjay (talk)

Hi there.

A while ago, you requested feedback in WP:FEED. Because it has been a while, and you'd received at least some response there, I have now archived the replies in Wikipedia:Requests for feedback/Archive/26. Please do not edit that page though; if you require further feedback, add a new request on WP:FEED.

I am trying to clear the backlogs; it would help us a lot if you could look at the requests from other users on WP:FEED and add any comments to help them out. Anyone can respond there, so please do take a look, and comment on the articles from other people.

I agree with George Profulis, a respected local meterologist. New Jersey is hit by a Category 1 or 2 storm directly (landfall) about once every 100 years (last in 1903, putting us 6 years overdue), and by a Category 3 or 4 landfalling storm every 200 years (last 1821, 188 years ago, coming due soon). Major storms passing within 50 miles off our coast ('38, '44, Donna, Belle, Gloria) causing a """"direct hit"""" are far more common, and can be just as damaging and deadly. I would say that a repeat of '44 today, would cause Katrina-like damage in the Northeast. New Jersey might be small, but it is also the most densely populated state in the nation. Many of the homes, especially those along the shore, are only a few feet apart.  A good storm surge like seen in '44 would devastate 100 miles of prime real estate that is far more valuable per square mile then that along the Gulf Coast. Also, strong storms passing to our west (Gale of 1878, Tropical Storm David in 1979) can put N.J. in a storm's right front quadrant, the most vicious part of the cyclone""",0

Thus, a phrase like 'DC voltage' becomes 'direct current voltage' which doesn't make much sense at all.  Further, a 'DC current' becomes 'direct current current' which is redundant.  We EEs commonly refer to the DC component of a signal thereby equating the term 'DC' to the time average of a time varying signal or, if we are in the frequency domain, the 0 Hz component of the signal.  Additionally, we talk of DC voltage or current sources when we mean constant voltage or current sources.  Finally, we refer to DC circuits when we mean a circuit without memory (the voltages and currents in the circuit do not depend on past or future values of voltages and currents).  There are probably other examples where the term 'DC' has become shorthand for something other than a uni-directional current.",0

Bradford City Hall
Hi.  Thanks for your question.  I'm ashamed to say I've never been to Bradford City Hall, even though I wrote the article on it.  I'd love to go.  I did speak to a local journo who said that it was OK to take photos in there, though.  (Some town halls are a bit weird about photos; no-one has told them about panoramafreiheit.)  Anyway, what I could do for you is to phone Bradford Council tomorrow and if I'm lucky I'll get some bored employee who would just love to leave their desk and look at the windows.  People never look at anything, and you can bet your life someone is working beneath your window day in, day out, and hasn't noticed it.  If I forget, keep reminding me until I do it.  It would be a fun job to go and photograph it.  I need to do a winter photo of Bradford Industrial Museum, anyway - you can't see the jolly thing for trees in summer.  
 Update: I rang Bradford City Hall, and they had not heard of any such memorial window.  Someone kindly investigated for me, and they rang back today and said that it's a mistake, and there is no architectural feature such as a memorial window dedicated to this lady.  There is a movable installation within the building, incorporating a display dedicated to her and to other local heroes.  I'm told that this is in a public place and that I can visit it.  I shall photograph that for you when I can - hopefully during the next couple of weeks - but I'm sorry there is no window to photograph. I guess that there is a slight possibility that there may be a memorial window in a church somewhere, and that could explain the error, but I don't know how to investigate that.  
 Thanks for your reply.  I've just heard that I may be able to visit the City Hall tomorrow.  I'll see what I can do.  
 Update: Just letting you know that because Coronation Street is filming in the building for the next two weeks, it will not be permissible for me to get into the building to see the display which includes B.J. Harrison. The staff have tried to fix it for me today, but cannot.  I'll try to do it in two or three weeks' time, though.  If I appear to be delaying or forgetting, please kindly give me a reminder.  Thanks.

 Tudeley and treacle 

Hi there.

The problem with the treacle mine entry is that although it is amusing it does not add much to the general content of the page.

If you were to expand the Tudeley article to include a lot more information about the place, and then add your (quite amusing) treacle mine ref for good measure I would have no problem.

But when the article is just 120-odd words in length, to devote 10% of them to treacle mines seems disproportionate to me.

I would like to assemble editors who are against that decision, and also formulate arguments against the decision. There is a discussion on my talk page between me & another editor, and my argument was, for example: Parker is a surname of English language origin (in turn from French). It may be borne by individuals of various ethnicities/nationalities, but that doesn't mean we must add the cat Category:Latvian surnames or Category:Italian surnames to Parker, just because some individuals of that ethnicity/nationality may have the name (of expatriot origin, etc.).",0

This article is indeed biased due to the use of adjectives projected upon the EDL. Within the wiki talk page there appears to be sufficient evidence that the characterization of the EDL has not been fact-based, but in some cases the opinion of opposition groups. This very argument is taking place on the talk page of the UAF where they have successfully garnered favorable edits to their own description with the omission of the term left-wing, yet the EDL ‘s group type currently stands as “far right-wing”.  Even when the nature of a topic is agreeably abhorrent, the moment one describes said topic with words such as atrocity or (insert)phobic, the subject has become tainted with opinion.  As the world descends upon Wikipedia to learn about these groups due to recent events; it is vital that factual information be provided. I’ve never heard of the EDL until a few days ago, yet someone like myself, untainted by prejudice; can see this article is biased at face-value. Lacking an omnipotent author, the introductory description of the EDL should largely come from how the EDL describes itself. Any evidence to the contrary should be cited properly where Wikipedia provides. I don’t see how journalistic opinionating and scholarly opinion is anything more than just opinion.67.168.126.47  17:57, 27",0

  Addiction is a choice made by the user 

The following is at the start of the article:

This can make freebase drugs even more powerfully """"addictive"""" than their salt equivalents, bearing in mind that addiction is a choice made by the user.

That addiction is a choice made by the user rather than a dependency caused by alterations in the brain's chemistry is clearly an unorthodox view to say the least, so I propose removing it ASAP.

In other words, you are asking if you and your cronies were unsuccessful at shutting down the discussion of the issue, on a different page (EURO), in part by employment of your ham-handed authority to shut me down for a few days, which you did 6 months ago.  No, you were not successful.  In part, this was also due to the fact that your cronies failed to actually address the issue:  They were apparently so enamored at their power to call you in to abuse your authority, they didn't find it necessary to actually present winning arguments...you know, DEBATE.  You, yourself, were unwilling or unable to participate in the debate, too.  But that means that there is no basis at all to allow you to give your input, in any way, into this matter.  You must admit to these people that you really weren't interested in the subject, you were just brought in to be a thug, a torpedo, to shut down the debate.  You must also admit that you were stalking me on WP:  Tell them what mechanism you used, so they know what you did.  (The fact you used that mechanism will show them how illegitimate your motives were.)
The reality is (remember reality?) that according to the remnants of their archived webpage, EURO did not argue for """"white supremacy"""", """"white separatism"""", """"white nationalism"""", or any other """"ism"""" I can imagine would be relevant.  The problem is, Political Correctness rears its ugly head, yet again, and persons who display less-than-sufficient obeisance to the fascistic-left will be shut off, shut down, and maybe even shut away.

=The vandal Labongo attempts to distort the truth daily in Wikipedia

User Labongo states:  """"your requests for references have been answered hundreds of times.""""

Notice, how you again reveal how hopelessly goofy you are, user Labongo.  Can you show us one occasion where what we have been after has been offered to us ?

No one has asked as an attachment for the Kven text a list of references which disagree with the information offered.  This is the absurd case now.

We need to see where exactly those offered sources agree with the written text offered in the Kven article.  Those sort of pinpointed and exact - easily verifiable (as Mr. Mikkalai wants) - quotes and sources are offered in several key points of the Diki Wiki's text.  For us to ask you to understand the difference in that approach is too much to hope for, it appears.  

You appear to be too young for this sort of conversation, it seems safe to state.  

In the case of user Driakko's text that sort of showing of exact book and page information and - importantly user Labongo - exact quotes on those pages from known and credited historians and/or other scientist cannot be provided.

Read the bold text from the above sentence.  That is what is wanted, not what you claim that has been requested !  Please, read what our messages exactly say.  After you have done that, please stop setting words in the mouths of others, and particularly in the mouths of historians in relation to the Kven text. 

Perhaps just for you - and the types of you - it is important to repeat yet one more time:  We have never asked - and we are not asking now, and we shall not ask in the future - a list of related books an/or historians who have written about the topic.  Instead, we are asking for it to be pointed out where exactly those given sources agree with text pushed for Wikipedia.

We are familiar with the sources offered.  They appear to disagree with the text of user Drieakko !

What part of the word """"disagree"""" do you find hard to understand ?  We recommend for you to stop writing in Wikipedia, and instead for you to attend your school classes !

 About Disputed ethnic origin of persians 

The papyri from Tebtunis record several sites in the Fayum, which appear to have been founded as ethnic communities in the third century BCE. These include the """"Village of the Syrians"""" (Syrôn kômê), """"Village of the Arabs"""" (Arabôn kômê) and Samareia, which contained a sizable Jewish population and was probably named after the city in Palestine. 

Although ethnic designations like Boeotian, Macedonian, Syrian, Arab and Jew probably refer to geographic origin, """"Persian"""" proves problematic. Its precise origin or significance is disputed. In the early Ptolemaic period it seems to describe people with Greek names functioning in a Greek context; although they enjoy a privileged status, they are counted separately from Greeks in tax lists. In late Ptolemaic and Roman contracts, """"Persian of the epigonê"""" refers to the legal status of a debtor who had waived certain personal rights in order to secure the collection of a debt.

Persians 
6 June 12 BCE
 
In this Demotic contract, summarized in Greek at the bottom, Pakemis son of Pakemis, acknowledges the loan of the dowry of his wife Tameische (Greek, Tameischis), daughter of Sokonopis, and promises to repay it. Here """"Persian"""" does not seem to indicate descent, but describes a man with the status of a debtor. In this example, the subject has an Egyptian personal name, but """"Persian of the epigonê"""" is just as frequently used to describe people with Greek names.

"Hi Mary. I'm not going to bother adding anything to the Trance page, as that fellow Roux and his minions monitor what I say, to silence it before the public gets to read it. I suspect this has to do with the somewhat decline in Trance popularity starting in 2008. Last year I would go on this page to write about the trends of Trance, and they experienced a backlash, as their chosen leader (Armin) had not lost the polls yet. They couldn't believe that the trends could possibly be changing for the next generation in the dance scene. They experienced personal feelings of hatred towards me, thinking I was a House only propagator. In reality I am actually a Trance DJ, but don't tell them this, as it makes the whole situation even more fun for me. That said, there is no point in me adding stuff to the page because it will be deleted. I am currently writing a very complicated article on dance music if you want to proof read it, find a way to provide me with an e-mail address if you want.

The history of Trance is very complicated. For one thing, to put it simply, Trance isn't really a genre of music. (I hate to put it this bluntly and it kind of sounds crazy). This is why you can't find information. The Snoman section on Trance in his published book is mostly false hopes. When people do write about it, it is often from the perspective of industry interests who have equity stakes in the genre, so they often 'invent information' in attempts to keep the label in the media. Most of these clever music terms are the inventions of the English ) Sneaky buggers.

As Armin puts it, it is more 'A state of trance' like his show is titled. This observation is correct. It doesn't matter what its called, as long as its good. What he means when he says Trance is a state of mind, is that it is not some formulaic equation that determines what is and what isn't. All of these labels are just styles and buzz-words. You will find difficulty locating written information on Trance because it is just another offshoot of House, one of the many. The articles that you will find are probably from punters who came out of the Tiesto generation. Tiesto is in fact a House DJ, but don't tell punters this, or they may commit suicide. Many have currently experienced heart attacks or early menopause, when they found out Tiesto went back to a House sound now. Good Luck.",0

I have repeatedly expressed the opinion that the most idiotic, as opposed to merely lazy, thing that Tyson has been revealed to have done was to listen to Bush's Biblical quotation and write a note to himself (which in the event he was too lazy to locate) to the effect, apparently, that Bush had clowned himself by taking credit for star names that were actually Arabic. So, since I wrote the words you complain about, it should be obvious that they are not intended to make Tyson seem in any way correct. I would be in favor of making this clearer by quoting someone to the effect that attributing to Isaiah the intent to take credit for star charts drawn up a millennia after Isaiah's death is profoundly stupid, but I was in a hurry to replace a vacancy on the page and an appropriate source didn't spring to mind.

Re the definition of what is obsolete, that is simple. Every concept is built based on some data. When new data have been obtained, the concept must either accommodate these data or explain why these data can be ignored. The concept that fail to do so is deemed obsolete.

However, after discovery of the red shift by Hubble it became obvious that this theory is inconsistent with these data. Now this theory is believed to be obsolete.

Request for Comments on Current events
Hello Fsotrain09 –

I'm trying to get some discussion going on two proposals regarding the current events page, but so far have gotten little to no response. Since you have recently edited the current events page, I'm asking for your input on these two proposals:

One proposal (this is the big one) involves putting the daily events from the current events pages into article-templates, a lá the monthly pages from 2003 to 2005, as well and having a consistent number of recent days on the current events page instead of a monthly archive. This would allow for the current events page and the respective month pages to be updated simultaneously without the monthly archival. For more, see the current events talk page. 
Another proposal involves merging the content of the regional current events pages (such as British and Irish current events and Canadian current events) into fewer continental articles. For more, see the current events WikiProject talk page. 
Your input on one or both of these issues would be appreciated. joturner

Guantanamo detainee
Thanks for the suggestion.

I have been wondering how to organize the data.

The DoD, and the Washington Post lists tried to shoehorn the names into the English style first name and last name format. It didn't work very well, because names can have so many different transliterations. And some nations, like Yemen, have areas where people can have a tribal name, that looks like a surname to us. Maybe sorting them by first name, within nationalities, would be better.

I'll work on it.  Geo Swan

Hey  Just a friendly reminder to be sure to use an edit summary that says """"prod"""" when you propose an article for deletion. It's always good to use edit summaries, of course, but it's especially helpful for proposed deletion, because prod tags are not supposed to be re-added once they are removed, and the easiest way to tell if a prod tag was previously placed on an article is to look at the edit history. Also, in this case, I marked the article for speedy deletion; when it applies, speedy deletion is better than prod, because it requires less attention. I left the prod tag there, though, just in case anyone denies the speedy deletion (which I doubt will happen). Anyway, thanks, just letting you know! Mangojuicetalk

Right. Well, here's what I've done just now. 

Changed section heading """"modern philosophy"""" to """"philosophical topics"""", to move the article more in line with Lac's proposal. The text there still reads in a historical sort of way, but that shouldn't distract the presentation of the broader themes and ideas presented. A single paragraph in the philosophical topics section was transferred a section up into the historical section, under the subheading """"modern western philosophy"""".
A bit of text in the rationalism-empiricism subsection misleadingly implied that Locke was a """"naturalist"""", and Hume the first empiricist. This is obviously wrong, so I changed it.

Something problematic: the sentence """"During this era, religious philosophy did not play a large role in the struggles that occupied secular philosophy"""" is either misleading (assuming """"secular philosophy"""" to mean """"not on the face of it pertaining to issues of God, etc"""") or trivially true (assuming the same to mean """"completely non-religious philosophy""""). Assuming the former, and assuming we take """"this era"""" to mean """"the Modern era"""", it counts as a counter-example that Descartes was completely religious; that God was his one of his clear and distinct solutions to the dilemmas in the Meditations. Locke's generally secular outlook on politics had great stake in religion: the man thought atheists were not to be trusted, and was at pains to advocate religious toleration on grounds that did not have to admit the fallibility of religion. The more stark example of Berkeley, already mentioned in the text, is an understatement: it is not just his disputes with Newton, but rather, absolutely anything that Berkeley said, which could not be divorced from his religious views (including his theory of vision). Malebranche is another example. It's my impression that there wasn't a genuine """"cooling off"""" from appeals to religion until the late modern period. So I recommend the sentence be scrapped.

Blueboar, you cannot be that naive.  I suspect that you have realised that you have stepped over the mark.

By even suggesting, in a widely read public forum such as this, that the GLdF is an irregular Grand Lodge is the vilest and most vicious attack that any Mason can make upon the Grand Master, officers and members of any other Masonic jurisdiction, and it is unforgiveable.

Your Grand Lodge does NOT state anywhere in the public domain, that the GLdF is an IRREGULAR Grand Lodge and I challenge you to demonstrate to us where yu say it does.  Not your word for it, a reliable source i.e. The Grand Lodge of New York itself.  Prove me wrong, I won't mind.

What is clear is that The Grand Lodge of New York is bound by the policies of The Conference of Grand Masters of Masons of North America which has specifically removed any claim to be the arbiters of Masonic regularity, quite rightly, and good on them.

Take a look at their 2007 and 2008 reports.  They are on their website and in print in black and white.  Incontrovertable historical evidence.

And then you come along.  And you arbritrarily vilify The Grand Lodge of France and The Grand Lodge of All England.  Bear in mind that I have been, and we are, in contact with the Conference and its Commission on Information over these very issues.  They have graciously received our submissions and their statements have been carefully worded accordingly, to include ALL Grand Lodges throughout the world.

This is their and your current OFFICIAL policy:

2007: """"It must again be stated that the Commission does not determine the regularity of a Grand Lodge; it only evaluates the facts available to determine if the entity meets the standards for recognition, as adopted by the Conference of Grand Masters of North America, and reports those findings to the member Grand Lodges of this Conference for their use.""""

2008: """"We must state again that even though a Grand Lodge may practice regular Masonry, we only determine whether the Grand Lodge meets all the standards for recognition, as established by this Conference.""""

Not our words, or the Grand Lodge of France's words, their words.  The Conference of Grand Masters of Masons of North America (including the Grand Master of The Grand Lodge of New York) is NOT the arbiter of Masonic regularity - OFFICIAL POLICY.

This is an encyclopedia.  There is NO place for personal prejudices and political edicts from any partisan Grand Lodge, yours or ours.  History rises above that sort of thing.  If you want to express political opinions then write a book and publish it under you own name, but don't call it history.  History is neutral.

We can cooperate on the history of Freemasonry on Wikipedia, but we must first agree to eliminate partisan politics or it is a complete waste of time.

By the way, the """"Antients"""" Grand Lodge, properly named The Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons According to the Old Institution is the UGLE.  Please read The Charter of Compact 1813; it is quite specific on this matter.  Enough said.

And in your version of French Masonic history you have completely ommitted to mention our Lodge which was instituted and based in Paris c.1718 but certainly no later than 1720.  You probably don't know about it, but it is this sort of ommission which may be rectified if you calm your passions and your prejudices and get down to the serious business of reporting Masonic history.  It is a very big, and I believe important subject which is not served by insisting on UGLE political correctness.  The UGLE is NOT Masonic history, it is a small part of Masonic history, and in this case represents a minority of Freemasonry in France.

And finally, I can assure you that the Grand Lodge of France couldn't give a fig for the opinions of the UGLE.  Do you consider, even for one second, that if they were the least bit concerned about what the UGLE thought of them that they would have entered into a formal Treaty of Amity with the Grand Lodge of All England?  You must think about what you are saying before you blindly leap into expressions of baseless opinion.

"Regular disclaimer on vandal User:Rovoam 

Dear fellow Wikipedians,

This IP is just one of a whole army of anon IPs used by a well-known vandal User:Rovoam, who without exagerration deserves to be included in the history of Wikipedia as THE most persistent and obsessed vandal that has appeared in Wikipedia so far.

This person has been extremely persistent and obsessive in vandalizing numerous Azerbaijan and Turkey-related entries, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, Arran (Azerbaijan), Urartu, Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan (disambiguation), Turkey, Kura-Araxes culture, Nakhichevan, Safavids, Karabakh, Khojaly, Khojaly massacre, Stepanakert, Khankendi, Ganja (city), Baku, Demographics of Azerbaijan, .az History of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani language, Azeri, Caucasus, History of Turkey, Oghuz Turks, Ottoman Empire, Turks, Ottoman Turks, Turkic languages, Turkic peoples, Mannaeans, List of Azerbaijanis, and even Template:Europe (removing Azerbaijan and Turkey from the list).

He also vandalized user pages and talkpages, including User:Tabib, User:Tony Sidaways, (user page and talkpages), User talk:Rdsmith4, User talk:CryptoDerk  (talkpages), User:Weyes, User:Dante Alighieri, User:Chanting Fox.

Since the person uses wide range of IPs, it is virtually impossible to stop him by blocking. In the past he's been blocked numerous times but each time returned with a new IP. That's why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages (some of them more than once).

Rovoam started his actions in Wikipedia from introducing nationalistic POV edits in Nagorno-Karabakh yet back in February 2005. His aggressive discussion behaviour, unilateral un-agreed changes to the entry, and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors, with myself being his major opponent. 

The conflict was formally decided after Arbitration committee placed him under one-year revert limitation and personal attack parole . However, this decision made Rovoam even more radical and obsessive, as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt Wikipedia, perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me (?for exposing him and proving him wrong?..). 

This person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. He is not the usual sort of vandal, but is rather knowledgeable in what he's dealing with. He could have been very valuable for Wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms. Rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means. His edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious. 

As I have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to User:Tony Sidaway, User:Codex Sinaiticus, User:Isomorphic, User:Who, User:Dbachmann, the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms. Only then will he understand the whole senselessness of his actions.

"One Modern Jewish Take
This article is taking an allegory too far. Most Rabbis acknowledge the Epic of Giglamesh as the original source material and value the science that says a global flood is pure bunk. Has the fact that a global flood would kill all the fish in the oceans? I am sad that this is singled out as the article of the day. People need to understand that for centuries Noah's Ark has been used as an obvious attack on science. Today it is religious fundamentalists' favorite method of attack upon evolution. - Sparky

Actually, my goal is to make a neutral POV present in these articles, which involves removing the biased edits made by you two users. You have both consistently  made very controversial and unfounded edits in this and similar articles based on your own agenda, yet you accuse others of doin the same without acknowledging your own ridiculous POV edits. I am not denying the link between Iberia and the British Isles but it is the same link shared across western and atlantic Europe and there is no special relationship with regards to those two respective regions. The relationship is only based on the Y-chromosome and Mtdna inheritance shared with all Western European regions. It needs to be reminded that there are subgroups to the r1b Y-chromosome marker and the regions have differential values in both y-chromosomes and mtdna. There is very little to no evidence of autosomal and x-chromosome analysis, and when viewing the y-chrom./mtdna percentages in these populations you need to look at them as a whole. R1b is found across western Europe in high frequencies, but it does not mean the populations are necessarily very related to each other. There is no genetic evidence yet of a Neolithic link between the British Isles and Iberia since R1b traces back to a Paleolithic Iberian refuge. The Neolithic and following periods were quite different between the Iberian and the British Isles and the Neolithic Y/chrom. and Mtdna percentage is much larger in Iberia than in Britain or Ireland. You also must not rely so significantly on references by Sykes or Oppenheimer since they have not brought any new genetic evidence to the subject and only cite studies in their books that have already been out for quite some time and are already found cited in these articles. I've read through both books and they really do make hasty, unfounded and biased conclusions that do not necessarily coincide with the results of the studies they refer so much to. There are also books already out, and also some to be released in the following months, which  contradict and refute many of the """"findings"""" or """"conclusions"""" of Oppenheimer and Sykes. Their views are also a minority among population geneticists and anthropologists because the majority acknoledge that many more studies on all sections of DNA need to be carried out to fully understand the origins of various peoples, let alone declaring any solid conclusions or findings. I do agree that I should discuss my edits when I make them and I will endeavour to do so from now on so it is easier to compromise on the fidings in this article.  """,0

"Another Explanation of the Error

Before we open any envelopes, it doesn't seem unreasonable to assume that if the envelopes are said contain A and 2A (without distinguishing which envelope contains which amount), then all values of A are equally likely − because we have no better information. However, it does not then follow from this assumption that, given A is found in the first envelope, the other envelope is equally likely to contain (1/2)A or 2A for every conceivable value of A (which is something we have implied in the subsequent calculation of expected value). 

Why?

Because, for any specific amount of money from which to fill the envelopes, given we have found A in the first envelope, for all values of A we can always find (1/2)A in the second envelope, whereas it is only possible to find 2A in the second envelope half the time.

See it like this: If the specific amount of money is M say, then we can find A to have any value up to (2/3)M, but the second envelope can only contain 2A for values of A up to (1/3)M ie. half as often.

So, given A was found in the first envelope, the chance of finding (1/2)A in the second envelope is 2/3, and the chance of having 2A in the second envelope is 1/3 − not equal as we had assumed, even though all values of A are still being assumed to be equally likely.",0

The trouble is that that version was hype too.

I note also the heading is """"reception"""" - none of it is talking about how Ethereum has been received, it's just a list of press clippings.

I am not very experienced in Wikipedia, but I feel this recent incident with the park ranger is a significant event, as important as him shouting baby killer at someone. The reason I believe this is that I have been the unpaid Park Ranger working the barrier and taking the abuse of the general public during prior shutdowns. Now, most of these people are frustrated and confused. They don't understand that it is not a decision the ranger at the barrier made, which is keeping them from entering, but a decision made by the leaders of the nation. When one of the leaders of the nation who caused the incident berates a person making barely above minimum wage, basically at one of the lowest levels of authority over that opening or closing decision, OVER AN INCIDENT HE HIMSELF CREATED that is an unprecedented level of hypocrisy and posturing for the cameras. He thought he'd look like a defender of the veterans, and fool people who couldn't reason well enough to realize he caused the very situation.

Vandalism is any addition, removal, or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia. The most common types of vandalism include the addition of obscenities or crude humor, page blanking, or the insertion of nonsense into articles.

Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated. Not all vandalism is obvious, nor are all massive or controversial changes vandalism. Careful attention needs to be given to whether changes made are beneficial, detrimental but well intended, or outright vandalism.**

I have read that particular book, and I'm confused by what you say. Of course the film jumps from person to person; the progression is of ideas, not poeple to be interviewed, which allows for a cohesive meaning to the film. In fact, the film presents information very similar to that of the book in question, except it is not essentially a propaganda piece aimed at one particular medium, but an exposé of an industry, targeted at the practices of several media.
I'm also a writer, and a prodigous reader. I had read most of Seuss' children's work by the time I was three, most of Dahl's children's stories by the time I was six, and read The Lord of the Rings when I was twelve.

The problem is, while there are examples of androcentricity in language (although its effect on cognitive and social processes is debatable), the examples she cites are not, and she makes the rather fatal mistake of conflating grammatical gender with """"natural"""" gender and the diachronic with the synchronic analysis of language. She also seems to accept an extreme version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis completely uncritically, although the hypothesis is never even mentioned explicitly in the draft. It's pretty clear the author has not had any formal training in linguistics (or in the languages she has attempted to analyze), and appears not to have consulted the rather vast body of academic literature on androcentric language. Or perhaps she had, but decided ignore the inconvenient conclusions?

Edit warring? Show me where! Because I was not.  

Rlevse, you really are a racist you know. Also, I'm Not even an Arab! lol Furthermore, Do not put words in my mouth. GOT IT?? Your just so blinded by your hatred its incredible and laughable. )   
If you look at the history of the article, you can see that you repeatedly undid others' edits despite there being no conesnsus for your edit. That is edit warring. When there is no consensus for your version, the correct procedure is to restore the article to the status quo, discuss the issue, and change the article again only if you gain consensus for your edits. Furthermore, comments such as the above are unconstructive and are not conducive to a positive atmosphere.   

Firstly, I would really like to thank you for your kind response here! ) As for me calling Rlevse """"racist"""", that's what it looks like from the way he seems obsessed with keeping out any Lebanese claims. About edit warring: The edit warring article says this """"Edit warring is the confrontational, combative, non-productive use of editing and reverting to try to win, manipulate, or stall a discussion, or coerce a given stance on a page without regard to collaborative approaches"""" and also, """"Typically a user who edit wars is ignoring editorial norms, reverting rather than taking due consideration of the points made by others."""" But it also says: """"It states that a user who makes more than three revert actions (of any kind) on any one page within a 24 hour period, may be considered to be edit warring, and blocked appropriately, usually for a 24 hour period for a first incident"""".
Now there was no edit war going on, on the article in question.

As you can see, my first edit was at  00:27, 31 August 2009 which was when I added the note. The edit right after that, was me, improving the note I had added. Right after this second edit, Rlevse reverts my edits. After he does so, I revert his revert and ask that he keep it the way it is while the topic is in discussion. That was it. There was no edit war. 4 Reverts = an Edit war. That was only 1! And even if you wish to count all the edits, that was only 3 and not 4!

"""Happy Town is a little town based in Newtownards Northern Ireland. It was founded in 2011 and currently has a population of 200, but this is increasing everyday. 

George Bartholomew Tumbledown has been the Mayor of Happy Town since the day it opened. 

He is single and even though he talks a lot in public he is too afraid to talk to pretty girls when they are on their own and doesn't have a girlfriend. (He does fancy Nurse Milly, but she doesn't know this and Mayor Tumbledown is too shy to speak to her.) 
As Mayor his main job is to make sure everyone is happy and smiling and smiling and happy. His motto is """"Turn your frown upside down, everyone is happy in Happy Town"""". He wants everyone to """"Have a Happy Day"""" and you can often here this being said throughout the town.
Everyone is Happy Town just loves Mayor Tumbledown and he loves being their mayor. He does have to be careful though as Principal Grump wants to take over the town and banish singing and dancing and make smiling illegal.
Mayor Tumbledown loves resting to his parlour where he reads books by the fire with a great big mug of Coffee and a delicious hand made traybake after a long day working at the Happy town mini market. He loves visiting the Happy Town football matches and having a great chat with PC Nick about the cheeky tricks Naughty Norris gets up too.

Naughty Norris is a cheeky, but nice, primary school boy who attends Happy Town Primary. His Favourite colour is red.

He loves playing practical jokes,especially the older kids, from Happy Town High. He likes playing football but only if he wins. His favourite drink is a slush puppie he has been known to drink 12 in one day! but he did end up being sick in the Happy Town Library and PC Nick wasnt too impressed. 
He lives with his Mum and Dad and his favourite person in the WORLD is his Auntie Nurse Milly. 
He is scared of Principal Grump and never wants to go to Happy Town High if he is still the headmaster. (If I were Principal Grump I would be scared of Naughty Norris.)
He loves meeting new friends in his special Norris class on a weekday morning,as he understand that friends can make Happy Town a great place to stay Happy. 

Nurse Milly is the best Nurse in all of Happy Town and she just loves her job.She often brings her nephew Norris to work with her, but he likes to play tricks and hide her equipment!She is a very good nurse and is always smiling and rumours are she even has made Principal Grump smile once! (But we can find no evidence of that and Principle Grump is too scary to ask.)
 Her favourite colour is green and will always wear green shoes! 

She hasn't got time for a boyfriend although lots of boys want to be her friend and she just loves spending time making things and looking after people who are sick or have, maybe, lost their smile. She loves to join Mayor Tumbledown and PC Nick for catch ups over Coffee and watch the girls from Happy Town high perform in their shows. 

PC Nick is a great worker at Happy Town. Not only does he police the streets of Happy Town but he works as the Fire Engine Driver and Customs Officer at Happy Town Airport. PC Nick is such a great Police Officer that they have no crime bar the odd naughty trick Norris gets up too.The Jail in Happy Town has never had to be used (thankfully) so Mayor Tumbledown has let it be used as a room for all the children to visit during their birthdays!

He is single and has never been brave enough to ask out the one true love of his life, the girl he fell in love with since they were in Nursery School together, the lovely Nurse Milly. He does really enjoy his little coffee sessions with Nurse Milly where he always gets a vanilla Latte and a Rice Krispie bun. 

Principle Grump is the headmaster at Happy Town High. He hates signing and dancing and often has the girls in detention when he catches them signing and dancing against his orders! rumours have it that he cant sing or dance and thats why he doesnt like it, but no one has been brave enough to ask him, not even Mayor Tumbledown.

He wants to be Mayor of Happy Town one day and then he will ban all Happiness, music and dancing, cancel all parties, and make it illegal to smile and even make people brush their teeth everyday! Mayor Tumbledown and his friends make sure every election that this will never be the case! especially because great things are yet to come from Mayor Tumbledown and Happy Town.

"Deleting: Max Katsarelas 

It upsets me terribly that you found it necessary to delete a page created for Max Katsarelas.  You obviously didn't read my rebuttal to dispute the deletion. You display the insight of a 100 year old women that has suffered from Alzheimer's for 20 years. You don't even deserve a user page you PC using paper pusher.  I've said it once and I'll say it again- it's people like you, with little to no creativity and a desk job from 9-5, that get your kicks out on start up wikipedians. Your power is falsified and if ever one day something happens to the infrastructure of the internet, you'd be shit out of luck like a milkman in the 1980's. Additionally, why don't I tag your username for a copyright infringement? If it's true that you're a fan of The Simpsons, then I may never watch the show again knowing someone of your character partakes in the humor of Homer's comedic stylings.

So as you probably read through this and decide you're going to delete everything I have just taken the time to write, I'd like to know a few things. 

1. Do you have one of those computer chairs that has a toilet built in? If you did, I would understand why you were upset and tagged the article for speedy deletion- you had diarrhea. Aint it just the worse?

2. Are you married or still living in your mother's basement? It was a little unprofessional for me to call you out for living in your mother's basement, because, hey, most wikipedians do anyways. However, the point is, if you spent as much time reading through the edits of wikipedia as you did chasing tail like a real man, I'm sure, in fact, 100% positive you would not have tagged Max Katsarelas' page for deletion. I think it's time you get some poon. You don't know what poon is?  Here you go, read about it.

3. Do you put your wikipedia skills on your resume? Just curious.

4. Do you have cyber with any of your fellow wikipedians? 

For the record, I will continue to post Max Katsarelas' page up because I have kept the copy I wrote and I want to prove to you and my fellow visitors of the page what little lives you wikipedians have. 

Good Day.",0

Fair use rationale for Image:Leonidas_01.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Leonidas_01.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

I have to agree that a description for this publication is magazine or professional magazine. As stated earlier, financing is not a concern as it appears to be common practice for academic journals to charge a subscription, unless it is an """"open-access"""" journal. However, based on the available ACCU description I am not seeing """"peer review"""". As stated above, an academic journal is usually very clear about its peer review process. In addition, a journal's description of its peer review process is clearly recognizable. The description given at the ACCU is hazy or fuzzy at best, but personally, I do not think it indicates a peer review process. Without a peer review process this cannot qualify as an academic journal. As Headbomb pointed out, it may be reviewed by peers and is of high quality, but it does not appear to be  a formal academic peer review. It might even be described as a """"professional-technical"""" magazine. Here is an article about an actual peer reviewed magazine Computer (magazine), from the IEEE Computer Society.

"""== Changes to intro ==
I changed the intro making it very simple and clear.  
Wow! I suppose that I was totally wrong about that one!  

A comparable analogy to an IP address is a telephone number. On a telephone network, the phone numbers must be unique. Generally speaking, each location has one phone number that allows anyone to dial that phone directly by using their unique phone number. Likewise, a computer is assigned a unique IP address which let's any other computer to connect directly to it by using their unique IP address. In reality, it is possible for a location to have multiple phone numbers (perhaps primarily larger businesses) and a computer can also be assigned multiple IP addresses which is pretty cool.

V.S.

A computer’s IP address is very much like a telephone number; they are both unique and allow communications with local or remote network devices. Much like a multi-line telephone, a network device may have multiple IP addresses assigned to it.

Consider that a telephone number is """"persistent"""" rather than """"transient"""", and the telephone number, in conventional telephony, to a physical pair of wires. The pair of wires may change due to repair or moves to a new location, but the telephone number stays the same. 

A DNS name is persistent while an IP address, if dynamically assigned, can be transient. The closer analogy to telephone number is DNS name, not IP address. The IP address, in turn, may map, on a LAN, to a MAC address.  

I think the latter is better suited but what do I know, anyhow?
 

""""local or remote network devices"""" makes no sense for telephones.  Shorter is not clearer.  

Local and long distance call makes no sense? What about LAN vs. WAN connection?  

Local and long distance calls are an artificial dichotomy created by phone companies so they can charge for larger network usage.  LAN, MAN, CAN, WAN, etc. are also an artificial categorization also for administrative purposes.

Telephone calls between countries, between (North American) area codes, between exchanges, and between lines in the same exchange are quite different in terms of the hierarchical switching model in use. In like manner, the concepts of IP address aggreggation/supernetting versus subnetting are quite distinct.  

Local or remote phone numbers do not make sense and neither does local or remote network devices in IP addresses.  The closest is the localhost but that's entirely different.

Like I said, your shorter version is much less clear because you're using incorrect terminology.  

Dear Cburnett: I made new and improved changes... Thanks  

First: a street address is too complicated.  Second: a phone number is too complicated.  Third: a book index is too complicated.  What's next?  My opinion of this is that you really want to dumb down this analogy.  Each step you change the example to make it simpler but at the same time to the point of using incorrect terminology.  This is getting really tiring.

Explaining a technical concept does not require using grunts, chest beatings, and wall paintings.  

Cburnett: I really liked your last edit; the concept that is, and I made some minor changes that I feel will enable the reader to better understand the basic concept of an IP address via minor syntax changes.  

Great, but why do you keep deleting the colloquial usage?  
 I removed it because it was not significant; why explain """"what an IP address is not"""" in so many words? Although I do agree with your accurate statement about """"IP"""" being incorrectly used as an abbreviation for """"IP address"""", it is merely not applicable as an introductory item - this is why I clinically deleted it.  

Cburnett: I removed the """"colloquial usage"""" line.

In response to Bduke's question 2 above, I think that it has become very difficult on wikipedia to say anything general about Guiding and Girl Scouting because someone will always point out that some Guides are boys. This is a fair point, but I think it has become overdone. If you take a look at the WAGGGS website, it's all about girls. Not girls and a few boys. They say of themselves """"The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts is a worldwide Movement providing non-formal education where girls and young women develop leadership and life skills through self-development, challenge and adventure."""" Their catchphrase starts """"Girls worldwide say..."""" WAGGGS has not felt it necessary to change its name. This is not because they don't realise some WAGGGS member organisations take boys, it's because taking boys is an anomaly, not the norm.

 No extra autonomy given Canada 1867 

Referenced sources given in response to request for citations clearly indicate that no extra autonomy was passed from Britain to Canada. Some editors deny this.
Forsey 
""""By the time of Confederation in 1867, this system had been operating in most of what is now central and eastern Canada for almost 20 years. The Fathers of Confederation simply continued the system they knew, the system that was already working, and working well.""""
 The system Forsey is referring to is [responsible government] which was attained in the 1840s. Fathers of Confederation adopted the same system. Some powers already assumed by Legislative Assembly were passed to the federal level of government. No new powers came from Britain.   
Heard 
At its inception in 1867, Canada's colonial status was marked by political and legal subjugation to British Imperial supremacy in all aspects of government - legislative, judicial, and executive.  The Imperial Parliament at Westminster could legislate on any matter to do with Canada and could override any local legislation, the final court of appeal for Canadian litigation lay with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, the Governor General had a substantive role as a representative of the British government, and ultimate executive power was vested in the British Monarch - who was advised only by British Ministers in its exercise.  Canada's independence came about as each of these subordinations was eventually removed.
 What part of """"colonial status"""" and """"political and legal subjugation to British Imperial supremacy in all aspects of government"""" is ambiguous? Where is the """"dominion status"""" here? """"Dominion"""" clearly implied subjugation to the Imperial government in 1867.

"proposal to create a separate Elverson Building article 

When the Inquirer was in the Elverson Building, its longtime home at Broad and Callowhill, it was understandable for Wikipedia to have a single article covering both the newspaper and the building (though, in my opinion, it would also have been fine to have separate articles as, for instance Comcast and its building do).

You do realize that a vast body of literature and academic works refers to the places in Ukraine solely by their Russian names, especially in historical contexts? Hard as it may be for you to believe, but an average Western reader would not necessarily know that """"Kharkiv"""" and """"Kharkov"""" refer to the same place. Including Russian names in the lede helps clarify this point, makes cross-referencing historical literature and Wikipedia articles possible, and generally improves our readers' experience. Call it the heritage of Russian imperialism or whatever, but the fact remains that including Russian names in these articles is better for readers than not including them.

"""::*Reverts back to old original profile* I have had a think about this since my last comment: Your assumption is that any editor that tries to enter an opposite viewpoint to that of TM is somehow also being """"disruptive"""" and “difficult”. This is far from the case although this is how it might seem without deep analysis. Looking at the last 2 days for example, myself and other (what you might describe as anti POV editors) have – following discussion allowed two “pro TM edits to be allowed back into the article despite the fact they may not be “resource compliant or NPOV (See for example Orm Johnson on “cults” where I made the revert!) Also notice that”anti” editors have disagreed over the wording of so called “anti TM” sources meaning that they became more neutral in tone (see physiology section.). However, this has not been the case with other “pro” editors”. What this means is that another editors – even neutral ones – come across as seeming otherwise 

Where different points of view exists this must be cited in the article – this is the nature of an encyclopaedia and has been since the first one complied in the Enlightenment. You are also correct that other factors of the Tm organisation do indeed need discussion; however, to me the most important is the research. This is because, reading this article, one would assume that there is a general consensus in the scientific community that TM meditation – or indeed any meditation –has large and demonstrate health benefits including, increasing your life expectancy, curing cancer, and prevent coronary disease! However this is clearly not the case. I understand that as webmaster to NSR  (and thank you for the honesty of at least adding this to your profile) this maybe difficult to believe as your much cheaper form of mediation relies on the research of TM to promote it – but the research that supports such findings is blatant nonsense and no such agreement exits within the scientific community. This needs to be highlighted I am afraid. However the TM organisation will try anything to deny this. .

 Stop the partisan bickering!!! 

I have done a review of all the sources for this article, and here is a synopsis (all emphasis is mine):

NYT: 3/17/03  """"An Israeli Army bulldozer today crushed to death an American woman who had kneeled in the dirt to prevent the armored vehicle from destroying a Palestinian home in the southern Gaza Strip, witnesses and hospital officials said.""""

CNN: 3/25/03  """"An Israeli bulldozer killed an American woman Sunday who had been protesting its use to destroy Palestinian houses in Rafah."""" ... """"Other witnesses, however, reported that Corrie had scaled a pile of dirt but then lost her footing and fell backward behind it, out of sight of the bulldozer operator. The bulldozer continued moving forward, covering Corrie with dirt and then crushing her.""""

BBC: 6/27/03  """"... Rachel Corrie died in March during a protest against the demolition of a house in the southern Gaza Strip. She suffered multiple injuries when an Israeli Army bulldozer ran over her and later died in hospital.  However, the army said that military police investigating the incident found that Corrie was killed by earth and building rubble falling on her as she tried to climb on a pile of earth while the bulldozer was operating.""""

Seattle Times (AP): 3/17/03  """"The International Solidarity Movement said Rachel Corrie of Olympia, Wash., was in the line of vision of the bulldozer driver Sunday as she stood in his path to try to prevent the demolition of a Palestinian home in the Rafah refugee camp. ... The Israeli military said Sunday that Corrie's death was an accident. It said small windows in the bulldozer's cab restricted the driver's vision.""""
 
Haaretz.com:  """"A 23-year-old American woman, Rachel Corrie, a college student from Olympia, Washington who belonged to the International Solidarity Movement in the territories, was killed yesterday by an IDF bulldozer during a house demolition in Rafah.""""

Guardian (UK) - 4/14/03  """"An Israeli army investigation into the death of Rachel Corrie, an American peace activist, has concluded that its forces were not to blame for her death. ... Corrie, 23, was crushed to death by an army bulldozer in Rafah, Gaza, as she protested against house demolitions.""""

Jerusalem Post: 1/5/06  """"An IDF investigation into their daughter's death ruled that it was an accident, but members of the pro-Palestinian International Solidarity Movement for whom Rachel, 23, was volunteering at the time of her death claimed that the IDF bulldozer driver saw Corrie and drove over her as she and a small group of ISM activists tried to stop him from razing a home.""""

Observer (Guardian) (UK): 1/23/03  """"A peace activist with the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), Corrie knelt in the path of the Israeli machine to prevent it demolishing a house near the Egyptian border in the southern Gaza Strip.""""

These 8 sources are the most reliable mainstream sources current in the article.  They agree on these basic facts:

Corrie was killed by an IDF buzzdozer;
She was protesting house demolition by acting as a human shield;
The IDF investigation concluded the death was an accident;

It seems to me that various editors on one partisan side of this debate here are trying to whitewash this article by repeatedly inserting weasel words such as """"she believed was about to destroy ..."""" while editors on the other partisan side of the debate are trying to insert extra detail about (e.g.) home demolitions, that properly belongs in the article on that topic (i.e. the widespread nature of it, etc).

I do not understand all of the byzantine rules of Wikipedia yet, but I find this whole situation ridiculous  I agree that the article should limit itself to facts that directly bear on Corrie, and not the larger Israel-Palestine conflict or home demolition (or arms smuggling) issues, but also that the lead should state plainly that Corrie was killed while trying to obstruct home demolition, and that the IDF has stated that the death was an accident.  All the rest of the weaseling is just plain wrong, and borders on the pushing of subtle (and not so subtle) propaganda from both sides.

From what I read, partisans from the pro-Israeli side have been sent here to influence this article, and I have no doubt that there are partisans from the other side as well.  Can we just oust the partisans and say directly what the eight mainstream sources above say?  Tom Ketchum 

Tom, I will read your final paragraph to indicate that people were sent here, and I believe it was mentioned in the Camera controversy.  I will assume that you are observing",0

That wasn't an appeal, of course. But I'm dissappointed Cailil. This reply was the sort of lazy, hackneyed tripe I would expect from the average joe that that hangs out at ANI, or from the sort of petty pointless admin who runs around dolling out the stock phrases like this and blocking socks without even bothering to look at the edits they make, the sort of admin where you can be sure that for 90% of their daily activites, thinking about whether they're even benefitting Wikipedia or not doesn't even enter their thought process. You just thanked Black Kite for the """"heads up"""", which you would never have even got if it wasn't for me, the evil rule breaker. What's up with that? Can you deal with that Cailil? Can you deal with the idea that someone like me can in your eyes be 'breaking a rule' on Wikipedia (which, I might add, you still haven't even proven), while also apparently benefitting it by shining a light on the continuing bad behaviour of HighKing. You can't in all seriousness expect to come here and expect me to listen to this sort of crap, when you've discredited it with your own actions elsewhere. I saw Jimbo talking recently about how he vehemently disagreed with someone's claim that Wikipedia was very bad at dealing with whistleblowers. What say you? Or is it all just rhetoric to you? You could unblock me yourself if you really wanted, nobody forced you to make this block. Not even Black Kite thought it was necessary, which is saying something, as he hands out blocks like confetti. I don't have any issue with promising you that the next time I want to make a complaint about HighKing, I'll use this account, if it satisfies your need to be able to track my history, if it satisfied your need to enfore a rule, even though doing so is entirely pointless in this case. But it's almost like you want people like me to sock, it's almost like you want me to break the rules, it's almost like you think it helps to have HighKing running around blaming all his woes on socks, when you know it's just one of many ways he tries to deflect attention from his own edits. What is the official story now, btw? He seems to have caught on to the fact that there is more than one person who is critical of him, yet you seem to be taking the retrograde step of going back to his old theory that we're all the same person. Can you really not see how your approach only exacerbates the issue? That it only makes eventual resolution less likely, or at least add another couple of years onto the final reckoning of just how well Wikipedia was able to deal with the sort of behaviour HighKing is by now the textbook example of. Or have you just been working around Sandstein for far too long, and you've completely lost your higher brain functions and can now only operate literally to the rule book as he does, the freak that he is. Maybe if you were truly honest about the fact that who we are doesn't make a blind bit of difference to whether or not you are doing what you should be with regard to HighKing, you wouldn't find yourself having to make these sort of replies, which must surely make you feel just that little bit shameful. You cannot really be happy that you feel have to say things like this to people like me, things that are so obviously intelectually dishonest that if it wasn't already the case, you just know we're not going to take a blind bit of notice of them? Because like it or lump it, whether you treat me as the enemy or as a whistle blower, I'm not going away, not until the HighKing situation is resolved one way or the other. And neither is anyone else by the looks of it. I don't even care if the resolution is that he becomes a good editor. That's how foolish it is for you to continue on this track. I'm not harassing HighKing in any way, shape or form, and you have still yet to establish whether I am an illegitimate sock or not. This is why you avoid the central issues like that when answering for blocks like this, instead preferring the sort of non-reply reply given above. It's just poor, Cailil, very poor.   """,0

 For Richard 20Feb07
Unfortunately Haar 2005 – reviewed the book this is not about explsion 1944-1948(1950) it is about ethnic cleanings before 1945 done by Germans and scientists who supported this ideas.
Overmans book 2000, “Deutsche militärische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg.” Is strictly about German military losses nothing more – nothing there about expulsion?

I confess that I don't know what Nitschke has to say on this subject.

She says: “Of around 12.4 million Germans within the lands of post-war Poland in 1944, six million fled or were evacuated, 3.6 million were expelled, one million were verified as Poles, 300,000 remained in Poland as a German minority, and up to 1.1 million died (p. 280).”
Thus that means TOTAL: 1.1 millions deaths.

She also says: “Though estimates of the dead range widely, as many as ‘’’a million Germans’’’ perished during flight and expulsion from Poland in 1944-45.”

It means in years 1946 - 1950? 100.000. Take for consideration that so call wild expulsion started on May 1945 and the 1944 and first part of 1945 was actually the flight.

Next she says: “In the long fourth chapter, Nitschke turns to the expulsions, which came in three waves. During a period of """"wild expulsions"""" from May to July 1945, the Polish military drove up to 400,000 Germans across Poland's new western border.”

“The second wave of expulsions came after the Potsdam conference, but before the """"organized transfer"""" of remaining Germans began in early 1946. From August to December, 1945, Poles expelled close to 600,000 more Germans in poorly organized transports.”

“The final phase involved the transfer of 2.25 million Germans in a process coordinated with British and Soviet authorities in occupied Germany in 1946 and 1947.” """,0

The Decision to Come to America
We lived very nicely in Skala. We always had a servant and we had a new house that had just been built. We lived very nicely until the fire. Everybody tried to save their own property and it was windy and the fire spread all over the city. Our house didn't go because it wasn't directly in town. But all businesses and everything else went. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]

After the fire, it was a time of great migration. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Gross]
[Note: The """"Great Fire of Skala"""" is believed to have taken place in 1899.]

I came to America because my father didn't want I should become a soldier and eat not kosher stuff there in their army. My brother Sam came before me. He sent me the shiffskarte, ticket. And he sent me some money to come here and I paid him everything when I started to work. [Yankel (Jacob) Wiesenthal]

All the enterprising young men came, because they were poor and to escape the army. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Brill]

I don't remember my father [who died when she was young]. My mother wanted to come, but only the three of us were left in Skala, my mother and Ada and me. My other sisters [who already were in America] couldn't afford to take us together. So I was the first one. I came just because Jake went [she accompanied her male cousin]; otherwise I wouldn't go. I was a teen-ager, thirteen or fourteen. I didn't want to come to America. I was crying. [Chana (Anna) Menchel]

We came because we couldn't make a living there. It would be a shame for the girls to go as maids in Skala. There was no way of making a living. [Hudya (Ada) Menchel] 

 
From Skala to Hamburg or Antwerp

7. Emigrants took the train from Skala We went by train, all the way from Skala to Hamburg. [Yankel (Jacob) Wiesenthal]
We got the boat in Antwerp. First we went by horse and buggy to some neighbors in another town and we stayed overnight there. And then we went by train to Antwerp. Another thing I remember, of course, we were third class and they stopped for a while for you to get water. There was no water on the train. So I remember my mother left us three kids on the train and she had a kettle and she went to get water and I nearly died. The others didn't know the difference. I felt sure the train was going to start without her. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]
 

 
In Hamburg
We stayed overnight in Hamburg before we went on the ship. I remember I was really very young. I was a kid. And when we came to Hamburg, I was afraid. I only wanted to go to sleep with my cousin Jake. So he says to me, you can't go to sleep with me. Don't forget, you're a girl; I'm a man. You have to sleep with the girls. This I'll never forget. [Chana (Anna) Menchel] 
8. The emigration hall in Hamburg, early 20th century 

 
Aboard Ship

9. Aboard ship We were three children and we had one berth. All the four of us slept together in one berth. With our mother. You know how narrow those berths were. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]
We were in an upper berth. And there was a very rabid Polish lady coming to America in the berth below. She probably didn't like it that there were four people above her and she started out with a real hatred of us. Anyway, one day I wet myself and some of it went through. So then the woman went to complain to the captain. And she said, """"Not only did this woman's child wet my bed, but she stole my best blouse."""" She accused my mother of stealing her blouse and they came and looked among my mother's possessions, but they didn't find it. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Gross]

 

We came through steerage, of course. Somebody else was in the room with us and my mother said in Yiddish, I hope my daughter doesn't get sick. But I was very sick and so was my mother. [Hudya (Ada) Menchel]

I went on the boat twelve days. I took care of Anna. She was sick already and I had trouble with her. We",0

This is a non-trivial problem. Many perhaps most of the 5,000 editors with the highest edit count are likely to have diverse editing habits, I can think of two FA writers in that group, one who also has an awful lot of categorisation edits, another spends a lot of time on AWB. Any analysis of those 5,000 would need to work out the proportion of their edits that were of various types. Then there is the issue that you are not likely to have access to their deleted edits, and that a few of those editors have opted out of being analysed. But most importantly, the 5,000 accounts with the highest ever edit counts are not going to fully overlap with the currently most active 3,156. ''SpielChequers'' 12:48""",0

Hello. I'm just contacting you since I've seen that you have paid attention to this in the past. An editor named  has recently placed a rather long rant on Talk:Fergie (singer)‎. Basicly it seems that they have decided that the consensus to keep it was not a consensus because they say so. That the sourses previously decided to be reliable are not for the same reason and that looking up information and then adding it to wikipedia constitutes original research. I am not an expert and don't want to create and edit war. I am just wondering what you think. My opinions are well known and I am trying to not just assume that I am right but I thought this had been settled. This person doesn't seem to be offering anything but the same old reasons to keep it out. the reasons that we had disscussed and then decided to keep it in.

Ryan, I don't know whether it was Greg or you or someone else, but we seem to have gone back to requiring users to enter nine preferences/comments and sign each (one for DA, four each for the other two).

 Bosniakophobia article 

Hi BigHaz, yes, I said it once, but I wanted to give more detailed explanation second time, so I think my opinion should also be taken into consideration both at Bosniakophobia Srbophobia talk page. Thank you. 

Protest

Why did you take my vote?
Why did you cross """"delete"""" two times?
This way you censored my vote not once, but twice !
I will complain to other admin's for your clearly illegal behaviour!  

Context Note: The discussion here refers to the user's comments at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bosniakophobia. He had posted a bolded """"Do not delete"""" on three separate occasions, and I struck two of them out for the sake of clarity when the AfD was going to be closed. He still has one of his three """"votes"""" (inasmuch as they are in fact votes), which is as many as everyone else involved. The """"more detailed explanation"""" to which he refers isn't in fact present, as it is in fact roughly 50% of a longer explanation that he had already posted. Again, in the interests of clarity, I struck this out.  - Schreit mich an 

 Okay 

Concerning your comments on my TalkPage, now that you gave enought explanation, fair enough.
Although I wish you somehow merged all comments together instead of crossing them, but anyways. I see that Serbs are winning against nomination of Bosniakophobia as an article @ Wikipedia. What Serbs did BigHaz, and you need to understand this from factual and fair view of perspective, they (Serbs) invented word """"Serbophobia"""", then nominated her on Wikipedia, and other Serbs came and voted """"YES! Keep it!"""" and now thousands of """"wikipedia scrapper pages"""" are basicly spreading this word as a cancer over the internet. So, let's delete both Bosniakophobia and Serbophobia, because NONE of these words is in English dictionary ! So why keep Serbophobia? Why? Please tell me your reasoning. Please! Thanks.  
I would have merged the comments if there'd been anything to merge. As it was, one comment was a duplicate of the other, which meant that there was precisely nothing which could gainfully have been merged. In terms of Serbophobia, you'll note that I have not expressed any opinion at all in that AfD (even I have my limits when it comes to the murky world of Balkan ethnic politics). However, I will investigate the matter further, since you've asked.  - Schreit mich an 
Contextual Postscript: Having looked into the murky world of Balkan ethnic politics slightly further in the interests of making sure that I wasn't shooting off my mouth about something that multiple people were doing, I noticed at the Serbophobia AfD that the above user had in fact done much the same thing that he'd done at the Bosniakophobia discussion - although with the opposite intention. I repeated the process of striking the duplicate """"delete"""" votes. One of the delete votes had a relatively long and potentially important rationale attached, so I didn't strike it. Of course, anything that's struck out is still patently visible to a closing admin or contributing user, and more legible via the editing screen if legibility is a problem. One of these days I'm going to have to make good my promise to myself of learning Serbo-Croatian.  - Schreit mich an

I do not wish to start WP's equivalent of a Witch Hunt (by alleging socketpuppetry) but please would someone inform me what is the correct forum/mechanism for airing my belief that Brixton Busters is not really a new editor (entitled to a certain degree of latitude and a greater degree of assuming good faith) but has, instead, recently edited on English Wikipedia using a user account not called """"Brixton Busters""""?

"""Changes to this Page - Open discussion ==
Since my first contribution over two months ago, I have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. After an initial consultation with an administrator I decided to """"be bold"""" and start a """"démenagement"""" of all that had nothing to do with the city of Paris. I was met with opposition over a link - and after being complained about I thought it best to put things back the way they were until I could get a good feel of the """"general concensus"""" of the page's contibutors. I have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling.

My goal here is not to """"control"""" anything, as was complained to one of the administrators - I would like only to contribute to making a better page. I have learned much from other Paris pages and pages concerning French history - namely those concerning the French kings - but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement, so I had little to do there. This page, on the other hand, I find lacking, and see many things that could be improved.

The most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information - far too much for a general """"Paris"""" page. The search function is a very important element of Wikipedia, and with this in mind, much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. Those looking for """"Paris economy"""" will type exactly that into the search window. The same for """"Paris history"""" or """"paris fashion"""". Here I am but repeating what I have already written below.

In short, in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of Paris, or one totally ignorant on the subject  - in other words, one who knows only enough to type only """"Paris"""" into the search window - I propose to move the more """"specialty"""" information to their own pages. My apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information, but this would be better suited to a """"specialty"""" page of its own. This would even be a positive move, as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page.

The irony of the sort is that, though I contribute to Wiki, it won't be to this page in any quantity. My specialty is the history of Paris, and I cannot even think to add that knowledge here - Paris' history has a page of its own. Just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are.

Here I would like to contribute in the interest of clear information. I hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement - please answer with any ideas you would have. With this post I would also like to """"sound the board"""" - to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page, as what I have seen to date leaves room for doubt. In your answers, I hope for evidence to the contrary. 

Please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all.

For the paragraph:

Some judges are also known to rule against precedent on principle. A judge (or even an interim appeal court) may rule against a precedent that is outdated. The judge may feel the decision needs to be overturned due to more sophisticated legal reasoning. Such a judge may wish to help the law evolve by ruling against precedent and thereby indirectly inducing a losing party to appeal. The appeal court will then have an opportunity to review the lower court's decision and may adopt the lower court's reasoning, thereby overturning previous case law. This may also happen several times as the case works its way through intermediate appellate jurisdictions.

 Requested move 6 November 2015 

:Enchanted (2007 film) →  – This was the title until recently when the article was moved, presumably to accomodate the creation of Enchanted (1942 film). However, I found few if any sources indicating that the 1942 Czech picture was ever called """"Enchanted"""", so I moved it to its original title, Okouzlená. That makes the date is unnecessary here, as there are no other articles for films titled """"Enchanted"""".

HI. These are exciting times are they not? What I had in mind two years ago on here seems to be gradually taking shape. The project is better and more organised than ever.

I;m keen to encourage editors to edit Latin American film although this seems to be a sadly neglected part of films on here.

 Disparity between Traditional Jewish Dates and Academic Dates 

User:PiCo, I will desist from making edits in this current article, since I feel my input might be misconstrued or disruptive, and that, of course, would not be my intent. However, please be apprised that there is a vast disparity between the traditional Jewish method of calibrating years based on a carefully guarded oral tradition, as opposed to modern methods used primarily by Christians who rely heavily upon the modern academic methods applied in dating chronology. The two are still reconcilable, but it will take a vast amount of effort and a person of """"long wind"""" (patience) and extreme diligence to even begin to explain where the discrepancies have """"crept-in"""" to ancient chronologies. The Jews insist that there were only 210 years of slavery in Egypt, although the 430 years mentioned in the Hebrew Bible are merely counted from the time of Isaac's birth, until the departure of Israel from Egypt. You see, """"strangers in a land not theirs,"""" really begins with Abraham's seed in the land of Canaan. Anyway, my view is not to interrupt your work, but to let it proceed on course. I would, however, have preferred to see you mention more about the """"other method"""" practiced by mainstream Judaism, whether it is accepted or not by Christian or academic circles. This would have given more balance to the current article. I have an inkling that someone will eventually start another article dealing only the Jewish tradition of biblical chronology.

If I might say, for us, the Scroll of Antiochus is considered a reliable source.

 CERTAIN FLAWS WITH MODERN SCHOLARSHIP:
 
I wish to point out something about modern scholarship that I think we should be aware of. Research has been carried out in France by a certain Christian Robin and André Lemaire on the subject of the 
Queen of Sheba and King Solomon.
 
André Lemaire wrote: “The hypothesis of a Sheba in Northern Arabia at the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE (Noth 1968: 223-224; Würthwein 1977: 121; Eph‘al 21984: 88-89, 227-229; Garbini 1984; Sarkiö 1994:190; Mulder 1998: 509-510) has no basis and is generally abandoned (Robin 1992: col. 1109-1110, 1118; Avanzini 1996: 13; Kitchen 1997b: 128.”
 
He also writes: “The first mention of Sheba in Neo-Assyrian texts is to be dated mid-8th c. BCE with the story of a caravan of 200 camels coming from Tayma and Sheba to Hindanu (Middle-Euphrates) (Cavigneaux – Ismaïl 1990: 339-357; Frame 1995: 300; Younger 2003: 279-282; Holladay 2006: 319-321).”
 
Contrary to modern scholarship, it should be noted here that, in Jewish tradition, king Solomon did not begin his reign in circa 1,000 BCE, as purported by modern scholarship, but rather in circa 843 BCE, as we find in Jewish tradition. Likewise, in Jewish tradition, the first Temple was destroyed in 422 BCE, rather than in the erroneous date used by scholars of the western world to fix its destruction, i.e. in 586 BCE. Modern scholars totally ignore Jewish tradition and wrongly put historical events at least 200 years earlier, which accounts for the discrepancies in calibrating these important events and not finding historical records to substantiate these events.
 
The one major flaw in their critical view of Jewish texts is the belief that if they cannot find an archaeological document affirming a certain event mentioned in the Bible, for them it is as though the event never happened. This is a fallacy in logic.

To begin to tackle this tremendous difficulty with modern scholarship and Jewish tradition, we must first lay down a premise that will follow us all throughout this discussion, and that is the fact that historical records have been kept by Jews since ancient times, and they have often preserved these very written accounts of events by marking their dates in the Seleucid Era counting. This is vital, as without which information, it will be virtually impossible to determine the sequence of events and to correctly compare them with dates in the Julian / Gregorian calendars. 

The Aramaic """"Scroll of Antiochus,"""" known in Hebrew as """"Megillath Benei Hašmonai"""" (The Scroll of the Sons of Asamoneus), is a curious document, alleged by Rabbi Saadia Gaon in his Introduction to """"Ha-Eggron"""" to have been written by the elders of the schools of Hillel and Shammai in the Chaldaic language, meaning, a document that dates back earlier than the book Seder Olam, composed by Rabbi Yose b. Halpetha in the 2nd century CE. In that book, the """"Scroll of Antiochus,"""" we find this remarkable remark, viz., that """"from the Second Temple's rebuilding till the 23rd year of the reign of Antiochus Eupator, son of Antiochus Epiphanes, who invaded Judaea, there had transpired 213 years in total.""""

"- Everyone is missing some valuable information / pitfalls.  Let me explain:

1.) The Federal Governemnt does not automatically repay any loan deficiency, a lender can file to have any deficiency paid them via the Federal Government i.e. the FHA reserves the right to pay or not pay any shortfall

2.) These loans are extemely expensive for seniors and until regulated or limited more heavily I think they should be avoided i.e. upfront costs are absolutely too high!

3.) You may get 60% to 70% of your equity in monthly installments / payments but, you are also loosing equity in that the interest (you are not paying) is compounded on the back of the loan.  Interested is paid on the principal balance (growing each month) but also compounded on top of interest on top of interest.  So, when you get to the end of the loan you may have given up 30% to 40% of your homes equity to obtain a fraction in a monthly payout / installment.  It would be wise for seniors to sell instead of taking on this risky loan program.

4.) Seniors / borrowers of Reverse Mortgages also get hit with a monthly fee.

I think the pitfalls need to be clearly listed here so that seniors can see all the facts.  The fact is that they are only givin' the positives.",0

Manchus

In April you reverted my edits with the comment that """"This paragraph was vandalized from previous revisions. It drastically changed from its original source."""".

Whether the changes are justified or not, they were not vandalism as they were explained at the discussion page for Manchus (""""Manchus and political football""""). Before reverting edits on the strength of charges of vandalism, I would be grateful if you could check the talk page and first address arguments made there.

My objection to the statement that """"Much recent scholarship in ethnic identity emphasizes that ethnic categories, rather than being static and objective, are fluid and subjective"""" is the fact that this could apply to ANY ethnic group, and could thus be placed at any article on any ethnic group. Making this specific point only at the article on the Manchus sounds like a rationalisation or excuse. It sounds highly defensive, as though there is no real basis for asserting Manchu ethnic identity other than the over-subtle distinctions of academics. We know that Crossley argued from this point of view, but is it necessary to incorporate this in the article? It's almost as if the article were saying """"We know the Manchus are not considered an ethnic group, but if ethnicities are regarded as fluid and subjective, we can perhaps recognise them as such"""". 

The Qing dynasty was based on an apartheid-like situation where the Chinese and Manchus were kept apart. During the Qing the Manchus retained a consciousness of being a separate ethnic group, even after they mostly switched to speaking Chinese. There are still Manchus today who retain a consciousness of the separateness of Manchu culture, quite apart from the state-sponsored ethnic categories. So my point is, why do we have to bend over backwards to try and justify a viewpoint simply because it is at odds with the current consensus? Is there a need to be so pointedly defensive just in the case of the Manchus?

I note that articles about other sitting Justices have been similarly """"enhanced;"""" and I also believe those changes are no improvement.  

In support of my view that this edit should be reverted, I would invite anyone to re-visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists.
 A1. Benjamin Cardozo
 A2. Learned Hand

 B1. John Marshall Harlan
 B2. John Marshall Harlan II

The question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not.

Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. 

Less humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.

At a minimum, I'm questioning this edit?  It deserves to be reconsidered.   """,0

As far as I can tell, learned people don't express their opinions as either """"Vatican II is infallible"""" or """"Vatican II is not infallible"""".  Everyone is pretty much agreed that ecumenical councils exercise their infallibility via the promulgation of dogmatic definitions, so the question really is whether Vatican II promulgated any dogmatic definitions.  Even the famous Pope Paul VI quote that traditional Catholics always cite uses this terminology:
“There are those who ask what authority, what theological qualification, the Council intended to give to its teachings, knowing that it avoided issuing solemn dogmatic definitions backed by the Church's infallible teaching authority. The answer is known by those who remember the conciliar declaration of March 6, 1964, repeated on November 16, 1964. In view of the pastoral nature of the Council, it avoided proclaiming in an extraordinary manner any dogmas carrying the mark of infallibility.” (General Audience, December 1, 1966, published in the L'Osservatore Romano 1/21/1966)

 Texas Tech seal images 

I note that you reverted my replacement of Image:TTU Seal.svg, Image:TTUS Seal.svg and Image:TTUHSC Seal.svg with Image:Texas Tech CoA.png in their respective articles.  The reason I replaced them was twofold:

First of all, it simply seems to me that, at least for the TTU and TTUHSC articles (not so sure about TTUS) the Coat of Arms would more accurately reflect the overall visual identity of the institutions in question; according to the visual identity guidelines at , """"[t]he Official Seal and Signature are [...] reserved for use by the Office of the President of Texas Tech University and are used to represent the official business of the university"""", whereas the academic Coat of Arms is intended as a """"unified identity for all academic entities within the Texas Tech University System"""".  Using the Coat of Arms instead of the seals in our articles would also seem to reduce the (admittedly small) chance of them being mistaken for official documents of the university, and complies with the advice (which, while we are not bound by it under fair use, it would seem courteous for use to follow) that """"[t]he Official Seal and Official Signature may be used only for documents and publications that represent official business of Texas Tech University"""" and that """"[d]ocuments that are not official and formal should use the appropriate Academic Signature"""" (i.e. the Coat of Arms).  It also allows us to use a single image for all the articles, not to mention, in my opinion at least, showing the interesting part of the logo more clearly without the distracting border and text around it.

The second, and more significant, reason for the replacement, however, was that, while I'd originally uploaded those SVG seal images in good faith, believing them to be acceptable with U.S. fair use law as well as our policies, upon further reflection I'm not longer as convinced of this as I was.  In particular, while there are reasons for arguing that the SVG versions are not too detailed to pass criterion 3(b), especially given that they're freely available from the TTU web site anyway, I now feel that, regardless of the acceptability of their absolute level of detail, they are nonetheless replaceable by less detailed bitmap images, and therefore fail the non-free content criterion 3(a).

Thus, I no longer believe those images are appropriate for Wikipedia, and do not want myself to be associated with them.  As their uploader, I have the right to delete them; the reason I chose to tag them as orphan instead of deleting them directly is that I wanted to keep them around for a while, in case someone did object to the change, and did not want others to end up tagging them (and warning me about it) while they were there.  That said, I still don't want them to stay around forever with my name in the upload log; if you want to, despite the issues I outlined above, you're free to reupload them (or bitmap versions of them) under a different title, thereby assuming the responsibility of asserting their compliance under our policies and U.S. law.  I no longer want that responsibility.

Oh, and regarding the use of the TTUHSC seal at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso Campus, I'm pretty sure that blatantly violates our non-free content criterion 8.  It's not like that article really needs (either of) the images, anyway.  —  """,0
"""

 Referencing 

I'm beginning to feel that the improved article would benefit from using the """"sfn"""" template refs. The advantage of these is that they allow precise page numbers to be used for each ref, but at the cost of an extra click being required to get through to the full ref, and any online text of it. The majority of the refs here need updating, and there is an excellent set of very recent papers (several above etc). Some are long and cover large parts of the subject: eg Wolfgang et al. """"Recent Progress..."""" is 24 pages of text, really too long to refer to without page numbers. Equally one doesn't want to clutter up the references section with the full title details up to 20 times.  

I must say I've never used the sfn templates before, though I normally prefer plain short footnotes for the reasons above. See Help:Overview_of_referencing_styles#Shortened_footnotes here for an explanation of how they work.

Hi there!.. I'm just curious by your recent entry in the Philology introduction.

Could you add maybe one more line to define what you mean by 'commonality'? Do you mean: commonality of academic opinion? agreed upon terms of what the a particualr word might mean in a historical context? And I'm guessing that the factors you indicate that are important are the origin and age of any given word. I really cant quite see what you might think was insulting about the introduction... (I didnt write it by the way)... I think the point of the intro was to define where the word 'philology' came from... In latin it means 'grammatica'... Greek? I recall that 'philo' means love, and 'logo' ... well i dont know... But the origin of the word i imagine can have a number of sources... That is what makes words interesting and vibrant to me.

"Lucretius, you do not understand that there are a lot of super-duper physicists, some Nobel winners, that have also overreached and put forth crackpot ideas.  William Shockley is one example.  This 1931 contribution from Eddington is documented and it is speculated by many that he was publishing a spoof or hoax in the similar sense of the Sokal Affair.  Perhaps he was serious as in the Bogdanov Affair, but whether or not it is a spoof, the content of that publication is at best numerology.  i'll let this sit for a couple days to see what other input there is, but the fact that Eddington said this stuff is, in fact, numerology (whether he was serious or not) and the article needs to say it.",0

"Yes, I am Russell Noftsker.  I had noticed over the years that the errors and loss of detail were compounding concerning the reported events surrounding Symbolics, Inc.  As the principal founder and keeper of copies of written records concerning many such events, I though it would be useful to pass along some of that detail.

The particular events I commented on concerning Richard Stallman were the product of Symbolics’ employees still using computers in the MIT AI Lab.  Our employees had begun to notice that software which they had authored and placed under the Symbolics' copywrite notice had started showing up in the software released to other licensees but without the Symbolics copywrite notice.  One of our employees, Dave Andre, extracted MIT Lisp machine screen session copies from various Lisp machines in the AI Lab and found that Richard Stallman had been the one removing the Symbolics copyrights and giving our software to the other Licensee, LMI.  Andre made paper copies of the incriminating screen sessions.

These paper copies and the above explanation were presented to me by Dr. John Kulp, our VP of R&D.;  When John and I presented paper copies of these screen sessions to the AI Lab Director, Prof. Patrick Winston, and insisted that he stop his employees from breaking copyright law, he called Stallman in and barred him from entering the AI Lab and from using its computers.

Richard Stallman and Richard Greenblat, as I recall, took the position that although the MIT Lisp Machine technology license under which Symbolics, Inc. and Richard Greenblat's company had obtained their rights to use and sell the MIT technology, the “intent” of the license had been that enhancements would be shared freely among licensees and MIT.  Of course, when I negotiated that license, I had intended and stated carefully in the license that licensee produced enhancements would be copyrighted and not made available to competing licensees.

Greenblat had represented the AI Lab as well as his own company, LMI, during the negotiation for the license which both LMI and Symbolics ultimately executed.  Wording to express this particular issue had caused Greenblat considerable difficulty but he had been forced by the MIT administration to accept it just as Symbolics wrote it so he knew well what was intended and that the intent had been clearly expressed in the signed licenses.

This incident played a key roll in causing Stallman to spin out of the AI & Lisp field and to tackle creating a public domain copy of Unix.  Gifted as he is, my colleagues and I feel it is useful for people to know what motivated Stallman’s change in course of action and to get a sense of how opposed he was and may still be to conventional business and business law.

Although I have not laid hands on the documentation for this event within the last two decades, I believe that my copies are still in my possession and the Dave Andre, John Kulp and Patrick Winston can verify the details cited above.

Perseus missile - Description or Characteristics?
Your lack of English comprehension is appalling. Your edit summary reads, """"the section here describes the missile, not just lists its characteristics. Standard way of naming sections on similar articles. Also, i would be happy to compare GRE scores"""". You are making this oh so easy for me, but for your benefit I will simplify things by hypothetically replacing the missile with a person. If I were to describe a person - perhaps on a police report - what would it entail? Height, weight, hair and eye colour, age? Yes, but I may also go on to describe the persons observable behavior, actions and tone of voice etc, to the best of my ability. This is a fairly standard example of what would fit a description. 

The articles original sub heading - Characteristics - encompasses a more diverse and flexible approach to the subject, for example distinctive features or a distinguishing quality unique to that particular missile (or person!). It goes more in-depth, a wider representation of the subject. However, as defining Characteristics are very descriptive in nature, it is easy and common these days to make mistakes, just as you have clearly made the mistake of getting muddled with the correct use of description and characteristics (as represent by your edit summary).

Difference between a description and a characteristic?
Description: He is tall, 6ft 6.
Characteristic: It is his height of 6ft 6 that distinguishes him.

 Four Edits in 24 hours: True.  But it takes 2 to Tango. 

{{unblock|reason=You asked about the State Bar article, and that's fair.  In chronological order, on September 2 the article was """"protected."""" Why? The history shows that from August through November (4 months) the article was protected because the user SantiLak repeatedly vandalized the article.  The edit history, also shows that SantiLak reverted the article without any discussion whatsoever four times within 24 hours. He was warned previously by an Admin, but just took the warning off his Talk page and continued the pattern. Yesterday, the pattern continued.  I was merely attempting to keep the material from being deleted again without discussion.  If you find me in violation, I respect that. But at least, hold SantiLak to account as well because the history clearly shows he reverted 4 times in 24 hours, causing the article to go into protected status.  It’s up to you.  Whatever you decide, have a great day there’s nothing personal about this for me.  I just hope an article about a public entity does not get stripped to the point where it become little more than an advertising brochure bereft of noted criticism of that entity by the courts, mainstream news sources, and even former employees.  It’s a public entity, not a real person.  Some latitude seems appropriate, and some discussion before taking out huge chunks of information four times within 24 hours. 

Here is a clear showing of the article being protected after SantiLak vandalized it 4 times in less than 24 hours.

 Islamophobic material 

A cursory examination of the content of the blog shows a great deal of openly islamophobic material, in contrast to JIDF's self-description as purely opposing anti-Semitism on the web and even the moderate material is overtly slanted in a hateful direction. For example, a headline in response to the Fort Hood massacre is """"It's Islam, Stupid"""". It also supports conspiracy theories that Obama is a """"secret muslim"""" .

I saved it...and this is what I got...change the stuff with me...help...before I like FUCK THEM UP WITH ANOTHER POEM.

so far...

CorpseFucking Art (C.F.A.) are an Brutal Death Metal/ deathgrind band, from  Italy formed in 1993. Their lyrics focuses mainly on gore and Humor.

Biography

The band was formed in Rome in 1993. With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitars, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first demo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation.

Cryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7"""" Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal oriented. As the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal riffing with techno and industrial parts, splatter movies - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene.

Though, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.

In 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split CD with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new artwork.

After being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi. Between the recording and the long wait to the new cd to be out, the band takes part in a lot of live performances including festival in Frankfurt with Lividity, Gorerotted, Inhumate, Pigstry, Nunwhore Commando 666, Mastic Scum, Master and Damnable and the rest of Europe in places like Sweden, France and Italy. The band is currently, in 2008, recording a new studio album and is aspected to come out early 2009.

 Wikiquette 

You need to check both of the IP's talk pages and their edit history then you will see why I am concerned.  In parallel with this we have what looks like another sock attack on the UK page (someone else is looking at that - the raising suspicion stage).  The IP edits here are very similar to previous sock puppet attacks hence my asking the question.  If you check back on this history I have done my best to avoid sock puppets, trying to get IPs to admit up front if they have edited, even trying to get one long term sock puppet rehabilitated.   I understand your reaction and your wish to establish your self as a mediator (I do a lot of that at government level myself - including Canadian provinces) but we are dealing with a complex set of pages here which are permanently subject to attack by IPs, edit warring, sock puppetry etc. etc.  You would probably need to have the scars of an active and concerned editor on these pages to understand just why most of us will check (as I did) the minute a new editor emerges.  When they use different IP addresses within a day of each other, refuse to ask questions and use features of Wikipedia it took me a year to discover then a degree of suspicion is reasonable.

Instead of spending more money to meet the demand, demand is artificially lowered through denial of treatment or waiting times.  This is rationing in the normal sense of the term.

This page needs to be edited down to a handful of sentences and then merged with Nose, if not altogether deleted, due to the fact that it is merely a slang term with denotions of eugenics and discredited pseudosciences such as phrenology.  The author(s) included a long paragraph by a discredited 19th century scientist named Samual George Morton, of which only five words (""""the nose large and aquiline"""") pertain to the article itself. As Wikipedia's own article on Morton says, and as most medical/science students are taught, Samuel George Morton is often thought of as the originator of """"American School"""" ethnography, a school of thought in antebellum American science that claimed the difference between humans was one of species rather than variety and is generally seen as the origin of scientific racism.
The paragraphs in this article are drawn out to unnecessary lengths so as to provide the appearance of substance; particularly the Buddhism one, which uses 53 words to say that statues of Buddha should have long noses. No reference is given.
So-called hooknose snakes have upturned """"noses,"""" not downturned """"noses"""" as raptors do, thus meaning they don't even have hooknoses as the author of this article describes, thus making their inclusion truly puzzling.  I use quotation marks because neither snakes nor birds even have noses in the sense of the ones humans/primates have. Snakes """"smell"""" by using their tongues and the Vomeronasal organ inside their mouths; a snake's """"nostril"""" holes are used only for breathing. Some venomous types use their additional larger """"nostrils"""" (actually glands called pits) to sense heat, not odors.
The fact that such noteworthy intellectuals as Ashlee Simpson and Paris Hilton have recently had rhinoplasties does not even mean that they had, or have, so-called """"hooknoses."""" Nor does the fact that a fictitious half-man/half-ungulate creature living under a bridge in Kentucky supposedly has one, though Wiki's article on it makes no mention of a hooknose, nor has it of course ever been photographed. It bears pointing out that factors allowing the genetic merging of ungulate and human DNA apparently intrigue the pseudoscience-oriented author(s) of this hooknose article. 
Overall, no tangible factors make the term """"hooknose"""" worthy of its own entry in a fact-based 21st century encyclopedia, other than as a disambiguation page redirecting to an entry such as Pseudoscience.  This is a textbook example of an unneccessary article manufactured out of several disparate and unrelated sources by using a smoke and mirrors technique.  Why not just merge it into Nose and let real scientists/doctors hash it out, rather than secluding it in its own peripheral entry based on pop culture/hearsay/non-science?  Hooknoses are an """"I know it when I see it"""" type of thing, with no set way of being measured.  If it were quantifiable by a certain mathematical formula, then it would possibly qualify for inclusion here.  (For example, if a nose is downturned by an angle of precicely x degrees or more in relation to its main slope.)  But no such formula exists.  It is a purely arbitrary, colloquial term, with a different definition to everyone.  For example, everyone has a different definition of """"fat,"""" but there is a medical definition of obesity, calculated using a Body mass index formula.   There is no such formula for noses.  Additionally, the link given to www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620b.htm does not count as a reliable source, as it is a religious, non-scientific organization making dubious and unreferenced claims.  For the record, I am white, agnostic, and have a small to medium nose with no """"hook.""""

 Do you know the superracist """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" in Turkey? Do you know that some Wikipedia Users are doing valdalism by showing themselves as the advocates of the Five Pillars of Wikipedia ? 

Sinanoglu is not only a chemist, the """"moreover"""" and """"the"""" more important, he is the icon of the """"Turk Superracism"""". The person who is subject of that article (Oktay Sinanoglu) published autobiographical book in 2001 in Turkey by using the fake titles of the “World’s Youngest Professor”, “Lord of U.S.A”, “at the peak point of science in U.S.A”, “The Turkish Einsten” etc. so he gained a lot of prestige in Turkey and a few million Turkish student accepted him as their idol and having been believed the fake titles of Sinanoglu are exactly true they occured the “Sinanoglu Youth Movement”. The last ten year (2001 – 2011) Sinanoglu became the “Hero of People” by using these fake titles that he published them in his bestseller autobiographical book. Today, by contributing a few million college student, the “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” was like the superracist “Hitler Youth Movement” in Turkey and Sinanoglu became the icon of the """"Turk Superracism"""" everywhere. By reading the autobiographical book of Sinanoglu, large amount of college students became “superracist Turks” under the influence of Sinanoglu’s megalomanic and fake titles. So, they are conducting the election campaign: “Sinanoglu must be the President of The Republic of Turkey!” Eight years ago, the first edition of this article was written by some members of “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” as the summary of Sinanoglu’s autobiographical book and this Wikipedia article was used by them in Turkey as the proof that the titles of Sinanoglu had been accepted as exactly true by whole world, so every Turk must believe that this titles of Sinanoglu was exactly true. That was the begining and the developing of the """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" in Turkey. Did you understand now why I was interested and why I am working to edit this article by using verifiable documents over 200 references? Please look at the edit history of the article. You will see a lot of vandal attacks to clean my editings. The last vandal attacks came from “Salvador21”-“Khazar2”-“Bobrayner” If you look at these users pages, you will see that these users are Turks and they are related with “Ottoman Empire” articles in wikipedia and they advocated “New-Ottomanist Imperialist Ideology” that Sinanoglu propagated this ideology in his autobiographic book. As a result, the some members of the superracist """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" cleaned the all words of the article which is writen by me and they provided to put blockage to my editings by showing themselves advocates of the Wikipedia Five Pillars. The “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” are in joy that Wikipedia blocked my editings. And now, they sing a song: “Long Live the Five Pillars of Wikipedia!

I see what you mean, but I don't think you've quite put your finger on the problem. It seems to me that the later use of the term is a kind of long tail trailing from the mediaeval usage, so I don't find  it a problem talking about the former in an article about the latter, any more than I see it as a problem talking about film adaptations in articles about books. But you're right that there is something wrong with the hatnote. The problem is that by saying, """"This article is about the historical Principality..."""" we imply strongly that there exists a later principality, which should be covered in some other article. But there isn't; there's just a tail of usage. So you're quite right that we need to change the hatnote, though not I think to """"... is primarily about..."""" which still implies that there's some other principality. But then, do we even need the hatnote at all? We already have, as the last sentence of the introduction, """"The term principality is sometimes used in a modern sense to denote all of Wales, but this has no constitutional basis."""" Is it too much to hope that a confused person will read that far? If it is too much to hope, then what we need to change in the hatnote is the definite article (which is what implies that there exists some other Principality of Wales). We could do something like this: """"This article is about a historical entity (1216-1542). For use of the term """"Principality of Wales"""" to describe Wales after 1542, see below.""""

I thought it wise to diversity the group by including some Wikipedians who have different perspectives, like Fred and Martin, and some who are longtime contributors but tend to stay out of Wikipolitics altogether, like JohnOwens and the Anome.

By the way, if you're serious about limiting the number of developers, you may wish to prune the list to exclude people who were once very active but are no longer involved.  It isn't healthy (or secure) to include a bunch of emeriti on such lists.

Speedy deletion of Shree Swami Abhiramdasji Tyagi
 A tag has been placed on Shree Swami Abhiramdasji Tyagi requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. —  (say whaaat?!)

"Kmccoy, I agree with you. If you look at my changes today, I included only the birth dates of the two children who are now adults (one of whom has a Wikipedia article already) with three independent sources for Track’s birth date of 20 April 1989, and I included the birth date for baby Trig, since he was SO MUCH in the news last year. I was trying to find a compromise position. There is no consensus here for including or for excluding, and, if you read previous talk pages, you will see no consensus there either.

In the spirit of erring on the side of more information (Wikipedia’s mission is to inform, after all), I made today’s revision. The immediate reversion, wiping out all birth dates, except that of little Tripp Johnston (certainly the most irrelevant birth date of all), is a bit risible and does not demonstrate any consensus either. As for the sources, I shall find better ones, but that argument is a red herring. No one has found any other birth date for Track other than 20 April 1989. All the sources (weaker or stronger) agree on the birth date.

I have read WP:UNDUE. It supports including neutral factual information. Birth dates fall into that category. I really don’t see where the problem is here. I shall not continue to include the birth dates in the article, but this demonstrates that Wiki-articles need more consistent management.

Hi. While it's great that you want to contribute to Wikipedia, there is a whole host of problems with your article which you might want to consider. First, you have eliminated the redirect to another page, but haven't put in a hatnote or anything that will indicate to the reader where that page is. But the main problem is that there are no reliable source references that either establish the subject's notability, or support any of the text that is written. The official website, blog, twitter etc - none of those count. There have to be independent third-party sources about the guy, otherwise the whole thing will get deleted. I suggest you get onto that as soon as you can. Let me know at my talk page if you have any questions. Cheers,",0

"Payment? How? 

In the bookkeeping text I'm studying it says: hours worked times rate of pay minus taxes deducted is net pay. In the specific example the employee was paid about the federal minimum wage. Looking at it from the employee's point of view it seemed nowhere near enough. Looking at it from the employer's point of view it seemed impossible, because it had to come from not only charging more for products than the company bought them for but also from people actually buying it and being able to buy it.

Cristina,

Am I allowed to wish you a Happy Valentine's day, or is that verboten?!

Anyway, how are things? Have you moved into the new apartment yet? If not when? I'm really looking forward to paying you a visit and seeing it for myself - and of course you and Kerim! Don't forget when you are settled to send me some pics of the place.

You asked about Connie and Elvira. They are both well thanks. Tomorrow Connie will visit her parents for a couple of weeks to celebrate the New Year. It must be amazing to be in China for their New Year - it is such a big event. I know travelling and hotels in China at this time is a nightmare, but I still think it would be an unforgettable experience. Maybe next year..  Life in Peru is good; no news though. I'll phone Elvira this afternoon and then see her on messenger this evening after German. Are you and Kerim going to do anything special today? Romantic meal with wine and candles, followed by a quiet walk under a moonlit sky?! Or will he come home late from work, drunk and with lipstick on his collar?  ;-)

Is next Monday a bank holiday for you? It is here but I'm not too sure what to do. Claire has invited me to Lake Constance, something I need to think about. Or I could spend three days studying German -(  Blöödy German. If Europe wants one common currency, then why not also one common language? (Not French - Sorry Kerim!) To be honest I don't like my German lessons. The teaching format is, for me, very unconventional. There is very little reading and writing - almost nothing. Instead we are 'supposed' to learn through talking and repeating. While I know this will be perfect for some, not everyone can learn in this way. I sure you know the three ways people learn: aural, visual and kinestic. Well I know I'm a mixture of visual and kinestic. And when it comes to learning a language I have to see it written on paper, write it several times and actually use the words. Also she, the teacher, is not supposed to talk in English. Which begs the question how can she explain something complex without explaining to us in our own language. OK, enough moaning about German!

Thankfully I am not suffering from spending yesterday evening in the gym. I am hoping that I become addicted to the place and that I *have* to go to get my 'fix'. Tomorrow I have a fitness assessment which will be interesting. Next week will be the induction and I shall be given a program to follow. They also have lots of classes which is one of the reasons I chose to join this gym. Along with the muscle/fitness classes they also have more relaxing classes: yoga, pilates, etc. which I quite like. I find listening/understanding the class instructor hard enough in English, so to do it in German will be amusing! The gym I go to is in the centre but there is one closer to my home; not too sure how to get there though. Elvira wasn't pleased when I told her the showers and saunas are mixed! You know how jealous those latinas are ;-)

OK, time for me to leave you in peace. Please give my greetings to all and you take care. I shall be in touch again soon.

Besitos,
Dave",0

My nephew had a presentation on the book title """"Plague"""" of David Orme, and found so little on Wikipedia about the author.

This article should be eligible for appearing on the main page as a """"Did you know"""" entry, if it is nominated it soon; it is supposed to be nominated within 5 days of being created or significantly (5x) expanded.  

The instructions for nominating it are at Template talk:Did you know.  Basically, all you need to do is take this code if you created a new article:
{{subst:NewDYKnom| article= | hook=... that ? | status=new | author=  }}
or this code if you expanded it
{{subst:NewDYKnom| article= | hook=... that ? | status=expanded | author= }}
and write the hook, a concise and interesting bit of info from the article beginning with """"... that"""" and ending with a question mark.  The info from the hook has to be present in the article and supported (in the article) with a citation.  Someone will double-check to make sure the source says what it's claimed to say.

Once you've come up with a hook, fill in your username as the author and fill the title of the article, then add the above code, including your hook following the """"hook="""" part, to the top of the appropriate section for the day the article was started on the DYK template talk page.  The code will produce an entry formatted like the others.  After that, just keep an eye on the entry; if anyone brings up an issue with it, try to address it.  I'll keep an eye out as well.  If everything goes well, it will appear on the Main Page for several hours a few days from now.

"I am the author of Qutbi Bohra article. I had written this article just as an informative content for wikipedia and my intentions were to update the information regarding a new sect that was formed. I am a writer and have written many articles in different media. I love to write. I came to know of Wikipedia editing very recently through a friend when he showed me how wikipedia works and editors can make contributions. It was a time when i had heard of Qutbi Bohra and when i searched the internet i got evidence regarding the same in 3 newspapers mentioning it and a newsletter. This satisfied the noteablity ans verifyablity condition of the article. I gathered information regarding the sect from the community members whom i know and have recorded my discussion with them, with their permission. Further more i also got information regarding some past acts of Khuzaima Qutbuddin which were defamatory in nature but would prove the formation of the sect. But i did not use it as per the rules of wikipedia. I have written the entire article from third person point of view, as usually written for publications and have provided supportive evidence in most of the cases and due to frequent coercing by Ftutocdg i have also written a complete article,'succession issue' to explain the actual situation which Ftutocdg is trying to hide in his bid to get the Qutbi Bohra article removed. The reason that he is giving is just his point of view that he is trying to impose on the article. He has regularly done vandalism to this article and also has done the same to many Dawoodi Bohra articles along with some other editors in his group. As mentioned by Ftutocdg you can check the contribution i have made to Wikipedia, i have done all my edits with thorough study and reliable references. I would also like to suggest you to please look into the contribution of Ftutocdg and his group of editors they have just created a lot of chaos using the dark side of the very principles of Wikipedia the helps develop an article. I am sorry to say but i have spend more time giving explaination to Ftutocdg than write or edit an article. Whenever i login i first check whether he has vandalised the article or not.

 Aztec society 

Gidday Richard, I note that you've swapped some text about between Aztec society and Daily life in the Aztec Empire articles. I think it's fine to rationalise the arrangement on these topics, however I have some reservations about the latter of these two articles. It was one of a brace of Aztec and Maya articles (see for eg Mayan Trade, Mayan Food) all created around the same time in September by about 4 or 5 first-time editors, and they all have the hallmark of coming from some more extensive essay on the subject area. I'm not saying that there's copyvio involved here, my guess would be that it's almost like some joint class assignment has been broken up into separate articles. They are based on reasonable material, but they contain a number of evident misinterpretations and have more of a school essay feel to them. They need considerable work and rearranging, and in some instances I really wonder whether it is worth the effort as they cut across topics already covered in the main Aztec/Maya articles.

Just so as you know and something to bear in mind if distributing their contents across other articles. The images which came with the Daily Life article are also I believe mis-tagged as the contributor's own work, when clearly they seem to be taken from elsewhere.

Thanks for your helpful comments. I would suggest one of my own for you: use proper capitalization and punctuation when making comments on Wikipedia.
You are correct, I would not argue that """"the widespread possesion (sp) and use of guns is FOREIGN to puerto rican (sp) culture"""" - but I also would NOT argue that it is common in """"American"""" culture - by any definition of """"American"""" culture. (What do you mean by """"American"""" culture? a culture shared by all nations of the Western Hemisphere? that shared by the USA, including its insular territories? that shared by the mainland USA alone?) I have never possessed or used a gun, nor do I personally know anyone who has. Thus I should be culturally identical to my fellow U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico, in this regard. I'm not sure what you are trying to suggest with this example, but it is straightforward to claim that the English language is a part of the culture of the United States, because its use is pervasive throughout the country; but it is something altogether different to suggest that the possession and use of firearms is a part of the U.S. cultural identity - there is wide variation in attitudes toward this supposed """"cultural trait"""" from person to person, from region to region, and yes, from state or territory to state or territory.

 Long reply I'm afraid - hope it's helpful.

 It's possible - no people are flawless. But in fact it very rarely happens. I've been asked to investigate about 6 or so cases this last 9 months, by Irpen, Giano, Bishonen, at RFAR, on ANI, and others, but in most of those - in fact all but one or two in a nine month period, the channel actually functioned exactly as one would wish it to. The one case it didn't, I myself reported in full to the community at ANI, with full summary of the IRC dialog, so that it was made public in detail (a blocked admin had sought an unblock on dubious grounds, another admin had unblocked trusting that without sufficiently checking for themselves). 

 The problem with using """"IRC!"""" as a smokescreen is, those who go there know in fact it's extremely rare, so naturally it loses credibility and is seen as a way to further a """"politicized"""" agenda by those who have bad memories of IRC from years ago. We have an agreed structure to address problems in the channel, yet """"for whatever reason"""" those who feel there is a problem never actually come to me (or any channel operator) to have it resolved. They instead pass logs round, a move guaranteed to shed more heat, but not actually solve the problem. That to me says a lot; a person genuinely with a concern would ask to discuss it, and aim for resolution, just like any other dispute. These cases though are never used for dispute resolution, but only ever for dispute escalation. That seems to say something. 

 As for your specific question, again, yes, it's possible. But unlikely. Administrators, who undergo a quite strict and probing debate over their conduct and understanding of wiki-attitudes, are quite a varied bunch. They include diverse views - Bishonen, Lar, Coren, 1==2, myself, Carcharoth, to name but a few at random in this context. Any and all admins can go to that channel, and some 60 - 70 users on average are regularly there at any given time. They cover extreme diverse views too - to the point that no one stance can get much if any of a toehold there if it isn't proper. There will always be strong voices around. 

 RFA candidates will not be """"representative of the community as a whole"""". The community includes many vandals for example, under-represented at RFA, and many who understand policy well (probably over-represented at RFA). What is possible to say is, the users at #en-admins are probably representative of those users the community has deemed sufficiently trustworthy in judgement and clued in on wiki ethos, to use the tools. This shows in a few ways  for example, an outburst by a user (rare in itself) will often be addressed by general refusal to endorse it, and letting one or two users speak for everyone, or resolving in private chat to actually educate people how to handle things better, and that works very well. On-wiki, you'd get more people inclined to shout than fix. En-admins as a channel tends to look to fix problems by resolving them. When problems are visible, they get addressed. 

 They're also rather long suffering and (I suspect) used to the idea that bad faith will exist no matter what they say or do, and used to having their words pored over in a manner that nobody else would expect on-wiki, and misrepresented if necessary to create smoke. That's not ideal. It's a bit dysfunctional, as it encourages others to stir up problems that have little to no merit, make a large noise over a tiny number of tiny matters (major drama, someone used a bad word once and then when corrected by others agreed it was wrong a few minutes later, for example), to shout rather than approach those who might help, and so on. That kind of foolishness and """"hype"""" helps nobody.

 Lastly, it's worth noting that critically minded users play a very valuable role in that they can approach channel operators if they have concerns, on the spot, or indeed speak up in the channel. When they do, if it's merited, it is usually supported, and would indeed be the best way to effect disapproval or correction. I strongly encourage this, because I greatly suspect the number of cases that would be raised and found genuine would be very small, and they should be raised openly in the channel when noticed. But they probably only happen extremely rarely. To take an extreme case, suppose someone is present, believes an action is wrong, but says nothing, does nothing, and instead complains to a third party (non admin) who lacks all knowledge, but whom they encourage in a belief they have been conspired against. And all the time not broaching it in the channel, nor to any of the channel operators who have made their names known for exactly this purpose last month. This does the community a disservice. Such matters should be named openly to channel users, or privately to channel operators, if they are felt",0

"""Giambigarchy ==

Born on January 8, 1971 in West Covina California was a man who would grow to become a giant in the game of baseball. [|Jason Giambi]would move to the New York Yankees after winning the MVP award in 2001 with the Oakland Athletics. There he would never truly live up to his potential, until the year of our lord 2008. Going into the 2008 season that New York Yankees had a positive outlook returning countless all-star veterans, including [|Giambi], mixed with a crop of young talent not seen in the Yankee farm system in years. As the season progressed the Yankees did not reach the expectations of themselves, fans, and the entire front office. As the Yankees stumbled along, one of the bright spots was the fairly consistent play of [|Jason Giambi]. Minimal expectations had been placed upon him for the year, and his contributions had been important to the team staying above .500. With his fan popularity growing, he decided to try something that some may call ugly, but others may call the pinnacle of a potential religious or governmental view. As the fans and himself refer to it as, """"the stache"""", it has become an icon for not only [|Giambi], but the entire Yankee team. With other players such as Andy Pettite and Johnny Damon joining [|Giambi] with the facial hair, than shaving away, it was clear that this simple patch of lip fur was here to stay. Despite some claims that """"Just For Men"""" has been involved in the increasing color and thickness of said """"stache"""", there have been no official remarks from [|Giambi]. The infusion of the """"stache"""" into the everyday life of Yankee fans has formed the potential for a governmental ideology, justly named the Giambigarchy. It is a simple view which includes drinking plenty of beer, and growing incredible upper lip fur. A view that may conflict with the current Republican/Democratic debate for the upcoming election, but surely a view that would not start any wars in Iraq, or drive gasoline prices over $4.00/gallon. We of the Giambigarchy way of view encourage you took to take a long look at your own """"stache"""" and ask, """"Do I represent myself the way [|Jason Giambi] and his facial attributes do?"""" That is the only question required for acceptance of the Giambigarchy point of view, and we recommend any fan ask themselves that question. The governmental form under the Giambigarchy is a very open-minded yet structured form that allows for the basic freedoms of its followers, and party members, yet remains an extremely fun-loving and positive outlook on life that other religions, and governments have failed to achieve. The savior [|Jason Giambi] has led by example to bring together his followers, encouraging them to live their lives with what is referred to as """"stassion"""". This is a twist on passion, as of course one must dawn the proverbial mustache. This very close knit, and increasingly popular group has reached a new way of life, and the numbers of proud followers are completely staggering. Established in May of 2008, Giambigarchy registered members have reached to a total of 13,422 (as of July 5th, 2008).

Bugging America

The Liberties of the Subject

By WERTHER

The overwhelming balance of recorded history has been marked by despotism. When homo sapiens sapiens transitioned from hunter gatherer to agriculturalist, he gained literacy, solid dwellings, and other accoutrements of what is commonly considered civilization. But he experienced a sharp decline in personal liberty.

The reasons for this are commonsensical. Disputes between tribes of hunter gatherers could be resolved by one or the other simply pulling up stakes and relocating to a new territory, there being few material impedimenta to prevent them. A settled agricultural existence, on the other hand, implied permanent villages, granaries, and land boundaries to be defended against depredation. The need for defenses implied a national security state. Agricultural surpluses not only necessitated armed defense, but allowed a division of labor leading to policemen, soldiers, bureaucrats, and tax assessors, the latter of whom would confiscate a percentage of the harvest.

The evolution of labor conditions also implied a different mental outlook. The hunter gatherer was an independent contractor (if not brigand) who ranged over extensive territory and worked alone or in small groups. The agricultural laborer, by contrast, toiled in one spot, making his comings and goings more subject to regulation.

If the land was not his, he became dependent on the Big Man's favor. Given the increased population densities in regions where agricultural societies developed, he could only rarely strike out on his own: the good land had been already taken, and game animals cleared or hunted to local extinction. [1]

With the rise of what Karl Wittfogel call """"hydraulic civilization,"""" [2] the screw of oppression turned once again against personal liberty. In order to build the extensive earthworks necessary for the state to survive the next drought or flood, the rulers of these proto-superpowers subjected their subjects to enforced toil and off-duty regimentation which rendered them no more free than so many draft animals.

It is unlikely the rulers of the states in the Valley of Mexico, the Nile, the Euphrates, the Ganges, or the Yang-Tze had much toleration for the complaints their subjects, who were enslaved, enserfed, or otherwise regimented for the greater good as defined by the states' rulers. These complaints, had they been permitted, would have constituted freedom of speech.

Nor would the rulers have given credence to a peasant's assertion that the interior of his crude dwelling, and the contents thereof, were inviolate from the inquisitiveness of the state. He, the peasant, simply had no rights a ruler was bound to respect (to paraphrase what a former Supreme Court Justice once said about slaves in a famous ruling in 1857); the only limit on a ruler's power over his subjects was the former's fear of rebellion should discontent overflow.

Of the two rights discussed thus far, freedom of speech and freedom from arbitrary search and seizure, the latter is fundamentally more important to human beings' maintaining a status above that of mere hive animals. This is not intended in any way to disparage the desirability and necessity of free speech. But there are practical circumstances when free speech is not exercised by reasonable peopledue to reticence, shame, or its merely being not worth the effort. Or when one is married.

Much obnoxious and exhibitionistic behavior is rationalized as free speech, while more urgent matters are suppressed: how many hourly employees feel free to say what they really think of their supervisors, and is the resultant lawsuit really covered by the First Amendment? But asinine reality TV blares on. Out of politeness or discretion, most intelligent people censor their opinions about politics, in-laws, bosses, and religion when they are in the public commons.

The inviolability of one's person, and one's dwelling, is more basic. What would the average person resent more: being told he cannot ask questions of the President of the United States at a staged event, or being ordered to be strip searched in public? Or, for that matter, have his house ransacked? That is the principle at issue. The lesser freedom is essential for political discourse, the greater freedom distinguishes us from dogs. [3]

Respect for privacy, for oneself and one's fellow citizens, is the benchmark of a sense of an individual self. The majority of psychologically well adjusted people believes that there are facts and circumstances about them that just do not bear the glaring searchlight of public revelation. Some things are simpl",0

 Wikipedia lying liars & their lies...  http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America.",0

 B Kobres concedes work of Dr. Rex Curry http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html 

B Kobres has conceded the historical discoveries of Dr. Rex Curry concerning symbolism under the horrid National Socialist German Workers' Party. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html  Even after conceding that the information could not be disputed, B Kobres nevertheless indicated his desire to suppress the information in order to maintain the intellectual errors that Kobres has mistakenly perpetuated in his past. A google post also covers the topic at

Wikilings do their dirty work anonymously, hiding behind names that do not identify them because they are ashamed to admit who they are and what they do. The practice is so widespread on wikipedia that people like Kobres have inspired and acquired the term """"wikilings"""" and """"wikiling writers"""" as a reference to their bad behavior.  B Kobres deletes valid responses to the personal attacks and kookiness of himself and other """"wikilings""""; but, B Kobres does not delete the personal attacks and kookiness of other wikilings who write with him. Kobres protects the personal attacks and kookiness of wikilings who write with him. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html  B Kobres deletes accurate information about the discoveries by Dr. Rex Curry that expose the history of Nazism in the USA.  http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html  Wikilings delete anything, including even links, to accurate information. They delete accurate information that is posted on “discussion” pages, which are supposedly for discussion, but are not. Discussion pages are where wikilings insult people and then delete responses to the insults. Wikipedia is a completely untrustworthy source of information because it enables wikiling administrators to delete accurate information, but also to ban people who post accurate information, in order to prevent accurate information from being re-posted.""",0

I'm going to waste my valuable time to answer your charges, because right now the world doesn't need me.  I have no clue why you refuse to add a colon so that you can indent, but I'll ignore your refusal to be a good Wikipedian, because my job isn't to convert you into a civil person.  That's your choice.  I have not participated in the Clinton article in the past because I have personal insight, and I cannot be NPOV, but I will comment herein.

Admiration for Khrushchev, a man who had nuclear missiles pointed at the United States:
""""a reformer and fascinating character..."""" page 162, My Life, hardcover.

Nikita Khrushchev was a reformer given the fact that he replaced Stalin.  He was also fascinating.  By making these statements, there is no indication that someone is a Communist.  I admire Steve Yzerman, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't make me a hockey player.

Admiration for Karl Marx:
Clinton gives an adorable story about visiting the grave of Karl Marx in London while plotting his """"conscientious objector"""" status to avoid serving his country in the Vietnam conflict.  Evidently he had a problem with putting an end to the communist-led genocide in Vietnam.

How many conscientious objectors were there to the Vietnam war?  Thousands?  I don't know the fact.  As for going to the grave of Karl Marx, it is a tourist site.  It does not make someone a communist.

There is furthermore a cute anecdote about visiting the USSR while that state was developing and distributing weapons to kill Americans in Vietnam and elsewhere, see pages 167-171, My Live, hardcover.

Cute anecdote?  I'm glad a future leader of the US visited the USSR to learn about it.  We were not at war with the USSR at the time, he had a legal visa to enter the country, he did not help build the weapons, etc.  

There are lies about Richard Nixon all throughout this book.  He accuses Nixon of being a """"segregationist"""" even though his administration started affirmative action and the Minority Business Development Agency within two months of coming into office.

I think Congress put Affirmative Action into law.  A lot of politicians in the 60's were segregationists.  And if Clinton made an error in his biography, wow, I'm pretty sure that never happened in the past.

Clinton also fails to mention that the Republicans began the civil rights movement immediately after the Civil War (during which they led the Union armies) and out-voted the Democrats on every significant piece of civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s: the civil rights acts of '57, '60, '64, '65, and '68.

After the Civil War, the Republicans were the progressive party and the Democrats were the party of the South.  Ancient History.  As for the more recent Civil Rights acts, Northern Liberals of both parties ensured the acts were passed.  And Lyndon Johnson basically flogged his party with the body of JFK to force passage of these laws.  The Southern Democrats who fought the acts are now Republicans.  Wow.

The Republicans out-voted the Democrats in favor of these bills by margins of about 20 to 25 percent despite Clinton's dishonest caricature of Republicans as """"segregationists.""""

See Above.

Moreover, he accuses Nixon of being a traitor on page 141 of My Life.  Well, at least Nixon did not abandon his country at a time of war and never criticized the United States on foreign soil.

I'm an ex-Navy officer, and I've criticized this country.  I'm glad he did.  The Vietnam war took the lives of too many kids, it was poorly run, etc. etc.  

Clinton wrote about his admiration for Hispanic people in """"My Life.""""  Recently, Al Gore went to Saudi Arabia to say that Muslims are being terrorized in the U.S. by the Bush administration.

Huh?  You see something wrong with Hispanic people?  And what's Al Gore got to do with your rant about Clinton?

But it didn't seem to bother these civil rights champions when they sent a ridiculous commando squad to seek out Elian Gonzalez, a seven-year-old LEGAL immigrant who committed no crimes while living with his family in Miami.

Discussed that.  You were wrong.

OK, I fed the troll.  I apologize, but I couldn't stand it any more.  I'll take some drugs soon.""",0

What you were up to, you mean. From the beginning you're personally attacking me and harassing me, and this is the only way you found to try to claim ownership of articles.
And yes, it's highly suspicious that you seem to monitor everything that happens between the IP and me. At worst, it shows that you're actually tracking down my edits, ie harassing me, at best, it proves you are the IP because without any communication with me or the IP, there is no way you can be aware of anything in so much details(unless you're harassing me). And no, that you happen to hear about this matter right after it occured, while nothing suggested you were active here for 2 days, cannot be coincidence.
And finally, please, Buspar, stop playing on words. This is what the admin that took in charge your SSP case stated, and nothing else: """"Looking at contribs, User:Buspar and User:Xuanwu are very probably the same user. Technically, they cannot be socks, as one username was created after the other stopped editing"""". 
This statement is based on the technical definition of sockpuppetry, meaning that a person is using different identities at the same time. The admin only noted that the 2 accounts were not used simultaneously, but nonetheless acknowledged that Buspar and Xuanwu were the same person (""""Looking at contribs, User:Buspar and User:Xuanwu are very probably the same user."""")
The admin, however, never confirmed that you were not the IPs Onethirtyeightdot suspected you to be. If you've seen the line """"No, Buspar is not 130.49.157.75"""", then please source it correctly.

So, what do we have ? An admin confirming you're likely to use several identities, an anonymous IP acting in exactly the same way as you do, having the same personal issues with me, editing the very same articles as you do, reverting back into articles the very same contribs that you made, and it also seems both you and the IP seem to have a telepathic link allowing to know every issue occuring with the IP without you being contacted by it beforehand.

As I've said, I'm offering to peacefully resolve this problem. 
I am sincerely convinced that Buspar is the IP, because I've noticed the very same edit pattern, because both users contribute to the same articles, and both users seem to have a personal issue against me and both seem to systematically revert my contributions as soon as they concern article about illegal downloading.
Thus, this is not randmon bad faithed accusation. This is only what I sincerely believe.

However, if it is absolutely proved that Buspar and the Ip are not the same and that Buspar and the IP don't behave in similar ways, then I'm ready to make excuses to both users and to stop identifying the Ip as Buspar. 

But if someone has any doubts about the IP identity, or if someone clearly acknowledge that Buspar and the Ip have the very same behavior and edit pattern, then that's all I need. I won't continue to call the IP Buspar, on the condition that an admin clearly acknowledges the IP¨as being Buspar, and that Buspar in his future edits, only revert edits of mine and talk to me under his Buspar username.

 Silesians 

Andrew, I have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you. I have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the English Wikipedia. I am sorry you had a negative experience with the German Wikipedia, but that is a separate project from this English project. Assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the English Wikipedia; I advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. I inquired about Silesian/Polish because Silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. I am not sure what you mean by """"reverting the article upside down""""; my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. As I do not anticipate being able to copy-edit the article further, I am removing it from my watchlist. Good luck with the article. Olessi  

Thanks for you comments, and in fact fruitful discussion. You are right that the work of a person is most important.
However, there are much present and past propaganda, which destroy the peace. If only some people would show objectivity and patience, as you did, it could be clear up. To mention nationality is however important, since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. (Unfortunately, nations or ethnic groups will still exist. I have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them, and fair competition. Seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.)
I am conscious that English and German Wikipedias are separate projects, but you see, when I approach German Wiki, Dzierzon article the Polish relevant article was attacked by some German/Silesian/Polish guy. It cost me more then here on En Wiki to settle the Pl article well. So sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude, possibly I explained more my excitement.

With Silesian is in short like this: Originally, they were Slavic tribe, spoke Polish, as I mentioned. For some 300 to 500 hundred years there were under German governments. They had bad time as you possibly can imagine. Many of them married with German and were/are of course confused who they are. You know, the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course Polish-German conflicts continued. Finally in 1945 Poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. Even those who honestly considered himself Polish Silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. There in Poland was complete disorder. Soviets and Communists arrived, most of them real simpletons any way. “National” government - just pro-soviet mafia, was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. Polish borders were shifted. We lost some 20% of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west Poland. You can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all, some of them completely simple people. They spoke different Polish dialect also. On top of this in the post war, pro-soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. Well, I do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately I am. This is like gangrene on fresh wound, literally. Thus many of the native Silesian could be robber in Poland, which they wanted so much. I believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be Germans.

Now, the present time, some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. However, there are many Germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal Polish affairs - despite the final border agreement between Poland and Germany signed on 14 November 1990 and governments effort to improve relations.
Finaly I have to say, I beleave that Polish are hospitable and very often naïve. Not many realize that politic need caution. Those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. Some procentage remember lectures of history, and objectively, too many Germans are toublemakers. I am also convinced there exists something like national character. You can have obviously you own opinion, let me have my own.
Returning to Silesians it is something close to squaring the circle . I wish the true Silesian all the best but I do not want Fith Column  on Polish terytory in addition.

Sorry if I used posibly ofencive """"reverting the article upside down"""" that was in the heat of the battle, wich I still have with Ge Wiki. They just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext. That sucks.

Sorry and thanks again. Feel free to contact me any time you need.

For the sake of anyone reading this in the future, expected value is actually fairly easy to determine.  A (barely) simplified version of the formula for this discussion is: Number of Decisions * Average Bet * House Edge = Expected Value.  On a single number, single spin bet of $1 as the table suggests the EV according to that formula is 1 (decision) * 1 (bet) * 0.053 (edge, rounded) = $0.053.  For 10,000 spins at $1 the EV is $530 meaning the casino wins $530 as stated.  

To determine the player's edge for a straight up bet take the chances of winning (1/38) multiplied by the payout (35) plus the chances of losing (37/38) multiplied by the loss (-1).  (1/38 * 35) + (37/38 * -1) = -0.05263 or a loss of $0.05263 per dollar bet.  If you do the math this is the same edge for any double-zero wheel bet except for the top line.  As a random side note, to quickly determine the payout for any combination of numbers: 36/(numbers bet) - 1 = payout.  For example a street is three numbers so 36/3 - 1 = 11 therefore a street pays 11/1.    08:24, 17 February 2012",0

No one in the mp3 is identified as being one of the Gaedes, or even a fan of their music.  Prussian Blue and the Gaedes are never mentioned in the mp3.

Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

What is this source? Who wrote it? It looks like a hodgepodge of blurbs about antifederalists in PA pulled from somewhere, but I'd be interested to know by whom and from where this stuff was culled. As to the article text w.r.t. the Pennsylvania minority, presently it reads as follows:

""""Another non-military usage of the phrase is found in a one-man Pennsylvania """"minority report"""" published after the ratifying convention [cited to Uviller and Merkel who in turn cite to other RSs, with selected quotation from the """"minority report""""].""""

At least until this discrepancy is sorted out, I would advocate changing the text of that passage to something like:

"""" Another non-military usage of the phrase is found in a Pennsylvania anti-federalist """"minority report"""" published after the state's constitutional convention: [followed by selected quotation from the """"minority report""""]

Just to be cautious here, I'd recommend a citation to Uviller and Merkel, and another WP:RS representative of the position that the minority consisted of, what was it?, twenty-something participants/signers, whether they were in fact part of the convention or not. ... Kenosis (talk)

Well it is clear that my position on what is proper to cover in this article does not fit with the vocal majority here.
I maintain that the article, in its current form, reads like a sanitized Vatican press release.  Even if all of the arguments I've presented here are seen to carry no weight, I fail to see how the wealth of reliable sources that I've sited have been so readily dismissed as irrelevant, giving not so much as a single mention within the body of the article.  And aside from the one's I had highlighted, there were plenty of reliable sources reporting on the December VatiLeaks Dossier, with that document's connection to the resignation decision.  I find it shocking to see so many editors here to not want a single mention of any of that.  So the decision for now is to continue presenting an article on Benedict's resignation as though there was absolutely no connection to any of the scandals, and to pretend that all of the reliable sources that do point to such connections don't exist.

 Scarborough Nicknames 

While I don't really want to expand on this section, there are in fact some web references to Scompton:

You know you're from Scarborugh when...
Busta Rules

There is also a wikipedia page called Canadian slang which references Scompton as well as a couple of other nicknames not mentioned in the Scarborough article. I used Clusty search engine to find these references. Up to you whether you want to put this reference back. I don't care one way or the other.

Regards,  

You're absolutely correct.  Serves me right for editing before my first cup of coffee in the morning.  I found nothing relevant for Scompton, but when I redid the search later, I did get results thru a search for Scompton AND Scarborough. I ought not to have deleted the entry based on a Google search turning up nothing.Personally, I generally don't see any value in having a section for nicknames for the municipality.  But there is obviously precedent for having it (e.g. Toronto).  The problem I have with these sections is that they end up including obvious entries (like """"Hogtown"""" for Toronto), but then also up end up including nicknames that may be used in some circles but don't have particularly wide usage.  The particular problem here in the Scarborough article is that so many of the nicknames have such a negative connotation  perhaps that's just a reflection of public perception, but I do believe that it does, to a degree, give the reader the wrong impression of the place.  Frankly, I am just waiting for someone to add """"Scandahar"""" to the list. I'm not from Scarborough, so I will leave the list in the hands of folks who have a better sense of whether its inclusion is justified.  Given your edits to the article, you are probably better placed to make that call than I. Cheers,  """,0

""""Remember, one of the rules when it comes to technology is Moore's law, that the computing power that can fit on a microchip doubles just under every two years. If this trend holds true, as it has for the past several decades, Australia's Force 2030 will be operating in a world in which our information technology will be a billion times more powerful than today. Notably, this isn't an amorphous """"billion"""", as Dr Evil would pontificate in the movie Austin Powers, but literally taking the power of our current computers multiplying it by 1,000,000,000. But imagine if that law doesn't hold true, and Moore's Law works out at only a hundredth of its past pace. Then the computers that power robots in the era of Force 2030 will only be a mere 1,000,000 times more powerful.""""

Ironically, his grasp of numeric quantities is probably even further off than Dr. Evil's.  If """"computing power"""" doubles every two years for twenty years, the resulting increase in computing power would be just 1024 times more powerful (2^10 = 1024 see http://www.google.com/search?q=2^10&ie;=utf-8&oe;=utf-8&aq;=t), not """"a billion"""".  And if computing power increased at 1/100th of its current pace (i.e. instead of doubling, increasing at one-one-hundredth of 2 = 0.02 per annum), the resulting increase in power would be just 1.02^10: computers would be 1.21899442 times as powerful as those today.

All this would probably be more relevant if he even managed to get Moore's Law correct in the first place.  Moore's Law did not relate to """"computing power"""" but to the density of transistors in a given area.  In practical terms, a doubling of the number of transistors /= doubling of computing power... so we CERTAINLY aren't going to facing armies of Terminators, a """"billion"""" times more computationally powerful than the robots of today!!!

 Re: Gonzoe deletion 

Hi,
I am responding to your recent deletion of the page GONZOE, and in reference to my request for undeletion.
Ronald Moore (professionally know as Gonzoe) is a recording artist signed to our label Blocwize Ent.  He is a prominent west coast rapper and a billboard charting artist.
He is an official member of the Outlawz who recorded several tracks with Tupac Shakur and appeared on the 'ALl eyes on me' Tour, and he was signed to Ice Cube's label Lynch Mobb who released his Gold Selling group album Kausion.  Not only is Gonzoe
an important figure in west coast hip-hop, but he is extensively verifiable.  He has various projects available on http://itunes.com/gonzoe
and much information that verifies his identity can be found across the web in forums, blogs, and websites.  He is CURRENTLY on the cover of two prominent west coast magazines (murderdog and ozone), and i would be happy to provide links to these if necessary.

wikipedia's censorship

I looked up Bash Back (The sodomite terrorist group that attacked the Church in Michigan) on wikipedia  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_Back) just to see what liberal bias they would have. Under the section """"Antifascist action at 2008 Milwaukee Pridefest"""" Wakopedia says """"In response, Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group."""" the """"hate group they are talking about is the NAZIs but then if the NAZIs are a hate group then Bash back must also be a hate group so I edited it to say """"In response, The hate group Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group.""""

Since they also didn't have any topic for the new terrorist attack on the church I added a few lines & was attacked by the Admins. So they added the following paragraph
2008 Disruption at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, MI

Bash Back! members disrupted a Sunday sermon at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, Michigan on November 9th, 2008. They dropped a banner in the church, threw thousands of fliers, made out in front of the congregation, yelled """"Jesus was a Homo"""", pulled the fire alarm and initiated pro-gay chants. Mt. Hope is an Assemblies of God church which holds and promotes """"ex-gay"""" events and preaches that homosexuality is a sin.

I edited the first line of the paragraph to read """"Christaphobic Bash Back! members disrupted.... & added the following footnote 

""""Christphobia (from Greek Christós: Messiah; phóbos: fear, phobia) is an irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against Christianity.""""

I took the defanition word for wors from Wakopedia's definition for Homophobia & just changed the Homo/Christos & Homo/ Christian parts.

For this I received the following note from the admin

This is the last warning you will receive for your disruptive edits, such as those you made to Bash Back. If you vandalize Wikipedia again, you will be blocked from editing. Please maintain a neutral point of view. ukexpat (talk)

I suppose the terms could have originated with the three  """"see no evil,"""" """"speak no evil,"""" and """"hear no evil"""" monkeys, but that would be just a guess.  Even so, there must exist those who speak only what they want to speak...

One of the editors of this page, whom I shall refer to as """"Monkey One,"""" cannot seem to see facts as facts... even after I have repeatedly rewritten the lead to read in support of his assertions, researched his sources to verify his own claims, offered suggestions to improve (strengthen and render impervious) his content, and even spelled it out in more than one sentence that I did not desire to derail the content of his article -  no matter what I say or do, said or did, I am still  and have been accused of being out to tear it all down.  Moreover, because I won't give this editor sources to support his position that I oppose his work, I am somehow inferior an my every attempt perceived as a """"red herring.""""  

The user clearly has established himself as the canine pack's alpha male (or herself as the alpha bitch)...

I have my own talk page if you want to ask me something, asking me on someone else's is ridiculous. Why can't you use """"Though historians disagree""""? Because you haven't supplied a strong reliable sources showing there is disagreement on the status of Punch. That's why. The article already reflects that historians disagree about when the institution of slavery was started, so no, I'm not opposed to it as long as it's properly sourced and is accurately reflected in the article. To use that language in regards to Punch's status or the significance of his court case is a violation of WP:NPOV and WP:OR. Like I've been saying from the beginning, find a reliable source and then the article can properly include that source. Like I've told you before, feel free to take this to dispute resolution if you want. I would, but you've made so many numerous red herring arguments that I wouldn't want you to suddenly feign ignorance and pretend that you never argued such a thing. So pick the argument or assertion you want, and take it to the proper noticeboard. Also, I didn't reference plagiarism at all. You're the only one who fallaciously made such an accusation. I've only said that emails are often not verifiable and don't count as a reliable source. Please make a stronger effort in reading comprehension before levying accusations...egregious accusations.

A person can only take so many of these types of allegations before he begins to believe the attacker is serious.

I tried making some improvements, but I left the issue along about the quote from Chase. It's a hard one, cause he makes clear factual errors in his description of events, and I almost want to add an {{uncited}} tag on his comments. I agree that the quote absolutely cannot be included without clear statements afterwards showing that he was wrong, but that is hard to do without looking like you're dragging him through the mud. The quotation should not be excluded either because Chase's statements are themselves so noteworthy that they need to be included as a follow up to the story of Jensen, and evidence of the continued attitude of the group that followed Jensen.

no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that """"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot"""".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says """"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY"""" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.

If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said """"What language is that?"""" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.

Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between """"nigga"""" and """"nigger"""", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a """"black person"""". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying """"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.""""?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word """"nigger"""" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word """"nigger"""".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.

I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.

"Abuse of 'authority' 
Not to burst your petty little power trip, but it isn't exactly fair game to ban someone just because he was right and you were proven wrong. When someone accuses another of being an 'anti-semite' just because the ADL has labelled him as such, I want to point out to to the Wikipedia audience that however horrible it may be, 'anti-semitism' actually originated from the United States, not Nazi-Germany, though it later adopted it from the likes of Madison Grant and Charles Davenport. Wikipedia's own article on Henry Ford states as much, yet when I bring it up in a Talk section, I get accused by the likes of you for vandalism and banned.

It is the sheer height of hypocrisy that you can go around calling people like me a 'crank' and 'conspiracy theorist', yet I get BANNED by you just because I call you a 'deceptive little creature', which you clearly have demonstrated you are. You can CALL ME all sorts of names, yet I in return am not allowed that privilege. You are deliberately colluding with THF and Collect (two other sockpuppets on Prescott Bush's page) to get rid of as much 'inconvenient' information as possible. Perhaps it's just because you're really clueless and really don't know alot - that would be at least the half-way respectable scenario, and the least weighing on your conscience.

You want your audience (who I presume you want to delude, that is, unless you really DID NOT KNOW Henry Ford published The Elders Of Zion) to remain in a paradigm - without ever knowing where anti-semitism originated from and what a joke it is to see the ones who PROMOTED the concept of 'racial purity' and 'Aryan superiority' to Hitler to remain free of persecution. You use that 'ploy', that 'slogan', 'anti-semite', 'crank', as a silencing technique. It's a deceptive con-game, especially when you never get at the heart of the matter - where the anti-semitism came from, who started the ball rolling, and hey, guess what? The source of origin is a very unlikely one, and very unfortunate and inconvenient indeed for the self-righteous Americans always eager to trot out charges of 'anti-semitism'.

Unfortunately for you, and your sources, Prescott Bush's collusion with the Nazis is a well-established fact, and is well-documented in numerous high-profile books on the subject, including Trading With The Enemy: An Expose of the Nazi-American Money Plot. What you have constructed thus far are 'strawmen' arguments and falling back on 'guilt by association'. You peddle establishment sources as the ultimate harbinger of truth, perhaps KNOWING or NOT KNOWING the complete collusion of mainstream news with the establishment. More unfortunate for you, still, is that President Calvin Coolidge, Woodrow Wilson, Margaret Sanger, the father of JFK and countless other Americans clearly believed in the Nordic/Aryan races' superiority and viewed the Nazis as good. Worse still is that FDR refused to take Jewish refugees from Nazi-Germany. Even worse, university professors were making statements in 1936 to the tune of 'Hitler is beating us at our own game - race hygiene and sterilization'. This is all documented in books such as Edwin Black's 'War Against The Weak' - and don't come with your silly, puny little slogan such as 'conspiracy theorist' just because you don't care and don't want to know.

Unlike you and your petty insults and one-liners, I can back up all these claims with facts and more. I can only conclude that you're a weak-minded yuppie who really does not CARE about the facts, but whether or not you can hang out with your equally deceptive Wikipedians, gain some 'street' credits and keep people in a deceitful paradigm while slandering people who want to break out of your make-believe reality. And of course, being an American, you want to uphold this concocted, grand noble myth that you're the good guys and you fought Nazism. I can only tell you haven't looked into the eugenics history of your own country, or the Royal Institute of Intl. Affairs Conference of 1938. You didn't read Edwin Black's War Against The Weak, haven't you? You haven't read Eugenics And Other Evils by Chesterton, huh?

We live in the information age, sonny. Ignorance is no veil to hide behind - and neither are petty and childish retorts like 'crank', 'anti-semite' or 'conspiracy theorists'. So lose that beard of yours and that smug grin (BTW, not to hurt your ego, but you don't look all that great), quit being so gullible, because I have a newsflash for you, if you keep sticking your head in the sand, you're gonna get hurt real bad too, bubba - by your own masters. The only thing you're doing is discrediting Wikipedia even further by engaging in clear deception.

And if it serves your power trip, go ahead, ban me again. Do what thou wilt. Do your worst, 'bubba'. Show me your power!!!! (ROFLMAO) Your Internet is gonna get shut down soon, bubba",0

False, my site tenstringguitar.INFO is neither intended to promote a website nor is it a link to a blog. This site promotes scholarly information about the 10-string guitar as envisioned by Narciso Yepes. So 's claims against me/my site are simply dishonest. (Not unexpected.) Along the same vein, 's claim that Janet Marlow's site does not fail any criteria of """"links to be avoided"""" is also false. According to criterion no. 2 """"Any site that misleads the reader by use of factually inaccurate material or unverifiable research"""" must be avoided on wikipedia. Yet  supports this site knowing fully that it is involved in the spread of misinformation.

Compare the claims made by Marlow  with the verifiable statements made by Yepes . 's claims that these are saying the same thing are clearly mistaken or dishonest. That is, Marlow claims """"there are four missing sympathetic resonances on the six string guitar ... C, Bb, Ab, and Gb"""" which have less sustain """"than the others"""". While Yepes states that """"On the six-string guitar only four notes of the scale have natural resonances or overtones, E, A, B, an D"""" and that the other EIGHT sympathetic resonances are missing. 

What  is doing here is not scholarship, it is not honest and it is discrediting wikipedia, but I need hardly say it because it is abundantly clear to readers. He gets away with it simply because he is an administrator.

I'm not alone believing this was not a case of outing, and making unproven allegations of misconduct, in this case outing, is also a form of personal attack designed to undermine the other editor, and Offliner has been warned in the past not to file such vexatious claims. Offliner is a veteran of filing complaints on WP:AE, and if this comes under WP:DIGWUREN (and Kuril Islands dispute seems to fall outside of the scope of that case being Eastern Europe), he should know that board would have been the more appropriate place to lodge that complaint, but perhaps he wouldn't have achieved the same result.

Which viewpoint does the reader believe?  Is the """"Big Chin"""" a sign of a fake or not?

We've already discussed the Big Chin to death.  It was one of many allegations of photo manipulation dismissed by the HSCA. You want to mention it as if 1) it was never debunked 2) it's the most important thing ever 3) it is proof of conspiracy.    

Gamaliel, none of the three things you just wrote make any logical sense. 1)Some believe the chin is not a fabrication. So what? This doesn't mean these true believers have """"debunked"""" something. Its their opinion. The policy of this web site is to provide all opinions, and certainly not to hide the evidence. When are you going to understand this rule? 2) How important is it? It is relevant to Oswald's contention that some one was framing him. Whether that is the """"most important thing ever' is up to the reader. 3) Whether it is proof of a conspiracy is also up to the reader. 

Gamaliel, your frantic attempts to delete and hide any information that you disagree with is directly contrary to the web site rules. Why do you continue to do it?
 

Don't forget, there were two Oswald's. Lee Oswald and Harvey Oswald. One worked for the CIA and was the real triggerman, I forget which... But wait a minute, the fatal shot really came from the grassy knoll, from an anti-Castro Cuban, who wanted payback, for no air-support for Brigade 2506, during the Bay of Pigs disaster... No wait a minute Oswald was a paid hitman for the mafia...... oh well It's 3:37 in the AM, all this conspiracy stuff is making me loopy. Goodnight.
 

Gamaliel, is this person above who calls himself """"Mytwocents"""" your alter ego, and put in for comic relief?

 

Web site rules of inclusion of all significant viewpoints

The evidence of the fabricated photograph is a significant viewpoint that was discussed in the HSCA report. Some experts believe it shows fabricationsome don't. Under the rules of this web site all significant viewpoints should be presented. 

Claiming that someone else disagrees with a significant viewpoint on a subject is not a ground for excluding it from the article. 

Arguing it is not the """"most important thing ever"""" is not a ground for excluding the view point that the photographs are fabrications. 

Arguing that evidence that the photographs were fabricated is evidence of a conspiracy,  is not a ground for excluding the evidence.

Gentlemen. These are basic web site rules.

 

Leave this article in a readable state
Don't leave  after every goddamn sentence in a paragraph.  Use one tag; .  Free free to argue about content, but make sure the current content is at least readable.  I have just fixed a couple of paragraphs; I'm about to go after any others.

Control my anger?  What are you talking about?  I'm not in a position to verify either way - I just want to make sure that the article is readable for the users.

This article is not neutral

Surely it's not the job of Wikipedia contributors to decide whether or not Oswald worked alone, was part of a conspiracy or had anything to do with the assassination at all.  It seems to me that the only way of rendering a neutral article is to state that Oswald was arrested and held on suspicion of Kennedy's murder, but was killed before he could be tried.  It can then be provably stated that the Warren Commission, in its Report, concluded that Oswald was guilty and had worked alone, but that there have since been many efforts and arguments that attempt to disprove this conclusion.  

It's not our business to decide what really happened, which is what some people here are trying to do.  We are here to report on and check verifiable facts, not persuade peop",0

  . I agree with Slrubenstein above. I have long argued that my position, Endler's position (position 1 high up in this discussion page) is a current scientific one and very closely linked with Darwin's.
Excatly, it is A current one. Not THE current one. making that THE definition is WP:NOR.  
  
It confuses because the old definitions are incorrect.  
Kim, I do not see how you can say this unless you agree with Henry Ford that """"history is bunk.""""  Most people are interested in history, and there are even scientists who are interested in the history of their science.  That it confuses you does not mean (as I think is now evident) that it will confuse most readers of this encyclopedia.  They understand that things change.  They also understand that trends have beginnings.  It is simply meaningless to say """"the old definition is incorrect.""""  If you do not understand why, I urge you to read up on the philosophy of science - definitions are more or less useful.  It was that old definition that led to a line of inquiry that has led evolutionary scientists to more precise and more useful understandings of the process.  If anything, as educators we should show readers how scientists start with one formulation of natural selection and then refine it.  
You know, the fact that you reject Darwin's definition of natural selection does not mean natural selection and the theory of evolution are wrong.  On the contrary, it simply means that science has a history, that scientists debate and refine concepts which necessarily change over time.  Do you think this is a trivial point?  In the United States, at least, you are dead wrong.  If you are not from the US let me tell you, there is a huge """"creationist"""" movement which has, on numerous ocassions, had the theory of evolution banned from high schools.  And you should know that one """"argument"""" they make is that Darwin was - well, as you say, """"incorrect.""""  """"See!"""" they exclaim, """"even scientists say Darwin was wrong!  We should no longer teach evolution!""""  Obviously, they misunderstand the way science works.  They do not understand that scientists refine and develop theories without necessarily rejecting them.  I think scientists have an obligation to educate people about this.  Showing how scientists accept an idea, and then change its definition or conceptualization by refining it without repudiating it is the best way to accomplish this.    |  Talk 
You confuse hiding Darwin versus focusses on current usage first and add darwin's definitions in the history section.  
Okay, but with all due respect, you confuse starting with Darwin for focussing on Darwin.  They aren't the same.  There are two reasons for starting with Darwin: one, it is a reasonable starting point, two, whatever differences there are between you, Axel, Marco and others, or among different scientists who have published on natural selection, all can agree that Darwin introduced the idea.  Why not just say @@@Natural selection''', as first introduced by Darwin, refered to ....  Since Darwin, evolutionary scientists have revised his definition based on new findings in genetics and molecular biology...?    |  Talk

I made a lot of mistakes at first, apologized and moved on. I have studied this maze called Wiki, learned and grown a lot, yet she is still accusing me of the """"same old, same old"""" from two years ago. (See Karel's talk page.) Seaphoto, FeralDruid and AFriedman and others, have been a tremendous help, even when they were upset with me, as I know you have been.  BlackKite was a big help but I understand he got disgusted and left. As a """"newbie"""" I was viciously attacked and stayed away for several months.  Right now,  I cannot figure out many of the procedures for complaints i.e. 3RR, without some assistance, I tried tonight. I have taught at University, I was Valedictorian of my college class and am continually talked down to as if I were an idiot child.  I sincerely endeavor to write honestly, with NPOV and no weaselly or peacock remarks. I strive for the TRUTH.  I am asking for help here.
TMI, perhaps. I am deeply in mourning for my sister. While my little sister was dying, SRQ cruelly mocked me. (See my talk page, Feb.22.) My  sister died on the 24th.

I just do not understand why this has been allowed to continue for almost two years.

"Dear Macrakis: I was the one who gave that exact solution in the first place. The golden ratio naturally appears in the 5th roots of unity; if you plot the roots in the complex plane, they form the vertices of a pentagon. This then explains why you can express a lot of trigonometric angles pi*n/5 in terms of the golden ratio. For example, cos 18 = (b/4)sqrt[2] = 5^(1/4)/2 sqrt[φ].  When you solve a quintic equation, naturally the fifth roots of unity are involved, hence why the radical solution of the quintic x^5-5x+12 = 0 can be expressed in terms of the golden ratio.  I hope it is clearer now.",0

 Judy has some experience in that field, but it's not her specialty. From her bio (on her tripod page): B.S. (Civil Engineering, 1981) (Structural Engineering), M.S (Engineering Mechanics, 1983), and, Ph.D. (Materials Engineering Science, 1992) Virginia Polytechnic. """"Her dissertation involved the development of an experimental method to measure thermal stresses in bimaterial joints. She has taught courses including Experimental Stress Analysis, Engineering Mechanics, Mechanics of Materials (Strength of Materials), Strength of Materials Testing. From 1999 to 2006 Dr. Wood has been an assistant professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina. Before moving to Clemson she spent three years as a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Virginia Tech. Dr. Wood is currently writing a book with Morgan Reynolds on the physical evidence explaining the events on 9/11. One of Dr. Wood’s research interests is biomimicry, or applying the mechanical structures of biological materials to engineering design using engineering materials. Other recent research has investigated the deformation behavior of materials and structures with complex geometries and complex material properties, such as fiber-reinforced composite materials and biological materials. Dr. Wood is an expert in the use of moiré interferometry, a full-field optical method that is used in stress analysis. Dr. Wood has over 60 technical publications in refereed journals, conference proceedings, and edited monographs and special technical reports. Dr. Wood started to question the events of 9/11 on that same day when what she saw and heard on television was contradictory and appeared to violate the laws of physics. Since that day she has used her knowledge of engineering mechanics to prove that the collapse of the World Trade Center twin towers could not have happened as the American public was told.

Speedy deletion of Lucinda Scala Quinn
 A tag has been placed on Lucinda Scala Quinn requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. —  (talk)  """,0

The comprehensive study shows the city of Detroit is in good shape and the Detroit Free Press reported it. The city of Detroit's home owner vacancy rate is 2.9%, in line with the national average.  The Detroit Free Press termed it a major population shift which is accurate. Many cities experienced change with suburbanization and freeways. The region is more populous and probably more prosperous than the 1950s. The city has seen multi $ billions in revitalization and it continues, the city serves an entertainment hub, has state of the art facilities, state of the art schools, a major university, casino resorts, a world class corporate center, a wealth of very well kept historic and national landmarks and restorations,  modern freeways, etc., is a partner on regional boards which did not exist in the past.

 Please delete user/disc pages; warn jayron/redpen/mufka 
Hello stephen,
If you could please delete my page and page history, I'd be much obliged.

I requested speedy deletion on 1Apr for reason 1.6. jayron deleted it, then acted  as if s/he did me a favour. I feel jayron shouldnt have been the one to delete it initially as s/he  and I have negatively interacted in the past. Followups from jayron included an unneccesary block; followed by telling me to get a yahoo email so that I may contact wiki admins! 

Wiki is all about anon editing  as such I didnt and wont get an email account in order to communicate as it is not required.

Since then jayron,redpen, mufka have been repeatedly editing my page. I blank my page they restore it. This has been happening since April, so for 3months now.  I bet if I changed their pages they'd posting threats of  """"i'll report you"""" and/or """"you will be banned"""". It is quite easy for me to get a new ip address but I dont think Ive done anything wrong, so  I wont change my ip address. 

If my pages needed to be restored /reverted, I definitely think those three arent the ones who should do it as they/I have  a convoluted history.

If you could please delete my page and page history, I'd be much obliged.
If you could contact jayron, redpen, & mufka & ask that any problems they have they let an admin or arbitrator know, instread of making changes or posting to me.

"Amanda: If you want to see controversial, try the articles dealing with the bible! But anyway, the way to go about editing is to begin by creating totally new sections to del with areas of the main subject that so far aren't represented in the article. Adding is far less likely to step on toes than subtracting. Other editors will judge the quality of your work and you'll gain acceptance as one of the team. Then when you've established your credibility, try re-organising existing material - amalgamate material that deals with the same subject but might appear in different sections, shorten paragraphs and improve syntax, and so on - but always trying not to delete more than is essential, and trying also to retain wikilinks. Finally, suggest deletion of any material you think is irrelevant or otherwise doesn't belong - this is where you'll probably find you have to compromise the most. As I said befoer, I have no books and no access to books, and so can't help you with drafting, but I do want to see Leo improved and I'll certainly help with editing.",0

"""I am coming at this as an outsider. Here are my observations:

An article like this can show many different theories and still remain POV. The idea isn't to exclude information (such as some theories), but to provide as much information as possible (such as adding more theories). WegianWarrior explains it well: """"Wikipedia isn't about whats valid or not, its about what can be verified. It's a verfiable fact that these claims are made by a number of conspiracy theorists."""" And Blueboar's statement (""""If a source discusses directly the theories that are the topic of this article, it does belong ... no matter what its viewpoint on the theory"""") is valid and useful in this discussion.

Ukufwakfgr, your incivility diminishes greatly the legitimacy of any argument you make. It would be more effective if you left out the abrasive language and cries of flamebaiting and focused only on how to improve the article. By providing a list of what needs to be fixed, removed and added (without being abrasive), other editors will be much more likely to work with you. For example, if you think parts need further toning-down, quote the current sentence as it appears in the article and then provided what you think would be a better way to say it. You're going to have to play nice or not play at all.

Lastly to all, please review Staying cool when the editing gets hot and Civility. Even if you feel you are on the correct side of an issue here, sarcasm and curtness aren't going to help. Insults and abrasive language is not congruent to the way things work around here.

The Tangut did not speak Chinese, they spoke their own language. The official name of their land in their own language has been written about by Ksenia Kepping and is available on a link from the Tangut Language page. In no case was Xia there autonym. It was something like Minyag which is waht they are called in Tibetan. 

In general I have a big chip on my sholder about Sinologists becomming confucian literati. The Yuan, and Qing were no more Chinese than I am. To use Chinese names for these political entities is to take for granted the medieval Chinese worldview. While now it is indeed true that the PRC owns a big chunk of Asia how much of it is actually historically China?

The Jurchen's, Kitans, Tangut, Mongols, Tibetans, Nanchao, Azha (Tüyühün) were their own countries with their own languages and customs. Tangut history is relevant to Chinese history in the way that French history is relevant to English history, but also vice versa. 

To have a thing on the article saying 'this article is part of the section Chinese History' reinforces the view that the Tangut's don't deserve their own history. 

There is a sociological fact about Western academia that Sinology is big and well funded, while Tangutology, Nanchaology, Kitanology etc. are all virtually nonexistant. But this is a fact about us, and not about the history of Central/East Asia.",0

 Flagship is singular 

Many states have two (or more) excellent state universities; often, one may exceed the other on one or another measure of excellence.  But a state with two excellent universities has that - not two flagships.  """"Flagship"""" is a singular term - a good reference for the word generally can be found here.  In this context, """"flagship"""" means, as the introduction says, """"the leading comprehensive public research university in a given U.S. state"""".  (The only sort of exception that makes sense in this context is a system like New York's, where the state university system resembles a system of franchises more than anything else.)  With this in mind I've edited the list to remove some schools that are plainly not a state's """"flagship"""".  I left a state's entry alone if I wasn't sure, and so some double-entries do remain; someone who knows those schools better should fix those.

"From Depleted Uranium in Urine of Soldiers by the WISE Uranium Project:

Is DU more hazardous than natural uranium, since it contains contaminants such as uranium-236, plutonium-239, etc.?

No. Depleted uranium used for bullets has been found to contain trace amounts of artificial radionuclides, such as uranium-236, neptunium-237, and plutonium-239. The presence of these radionuclides can be explained by contamination from recycling of spent fuel introduced in the manufacturing process; for details, see [Diehl 2002]. The radiation dose from exposure to such contaminated DU is only a fraction of a  percent higher than from pure DU - and thus still is lower than from natural uranium; for details, see [Diehl 2001].",0
"Hi Neuromancer,

You will never get anywhere with the likes of Keepcalmandcarryon, Mastcell, Nunh-huh, etc. Going into the archives of some of the articles here on AIDS and HIV, I found that some of these people have been working, full-time it seems, on keeping these pages biased for years, and that they don't allow any edits which provide alternative information to the orthodox theory that HIV=AIDS, or anyone attached to these theories. They can be illogical, bullying, they will name-call, they will call any persons with honest questions denialists, and they will use any and every strategy no matter how ugly to keep these pages the way they want them to read. They don't allow edits they don't like to stay up for more than 30 minutes, and their tactic is to bully and threaten people until they give up. Of course people do give up, because they become exhausted and worn down as nothing they try to correct will stay up. Interestingly enough, some of these people also police pages on subjects such as Aspartame and alternative medicine. It's frightening how the AIDS orthodoxy doesn't want the public to know the facts. Most horrifying is the effect on AIDS patients themselves, who have the right to know everything there is to know and to make their own choices. I'd be interested to know your uncle's history, whether he was taking AIDS medications, what AIDS-related disease he actually died from, etc. AIDS has turned into a fear campaign - they give you a death sentence, and tell patients that if they stop the drugs that they will die.

We should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be.  This is just another way of bringing us down.  I am proud of being Central American and being someone who inhabited this land long before the White people made contact with us.  If we have been living here for the longest time, should it not be us who decides who we want to be? 

-Tito A. Martĩnez
This is a lovely essay, but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling.  Central America happens to be located in North America, so Central Americans are North Americans - it's a geographical thing, not a cultural thing. Perhaps you're thinking of Latin America and Anglo America?  

Actually, Tito can """"undeclare himself"""". If you'll check the Spanish Wikipedia articles on Central America and North America, you will see that Spanish language defines North America's southern-most country as Mexico. 
:es:Norteamérica redirects to es:América del Norte, which lists the lists the following political units in north to south order:
Greenland
Canada
United States
Mexico
Note that Central America is not on this list!

WilyD is also right, as far as English language goes. """"North America"""" includes Mexico and Central America. 

I think America (terminology) should provide a better explanation than it currently does. A section on English vs. Spanish terminology would help. (I don't speak Spanish, but I studied French in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning. Maybe I'll recruit some bilingual Wikipedians to help me write this. -)  

Okay, but I'll claim the fatal flaw here is this:  América del Norte is a spanish term that is different from the english term North America.  Tito may not be a norteamericano - (although I don't think he declares himself here either - doesn't spanish have an equivilent to L'academie?) - but he's still north american.  

Actually, I don't think """"North American"""" is an identity that applies to Latin Americans. His country (if it's in Central America) is a part of the North American continent, but the cultural division is what he's concerned about. Want to help me update America (terminology)?  

I think America (terminology) reflects correct english usage.  Maybe Use of the word American is a better place to move these kind of complaints (although I'm actively involved in that article, and know it'll get shot down as original research).  Roughly speaking, there aren't political continents - Wikipedia has articles on Anglo America (not that I'm convinced the term exists) in contrast",0
"USS NAUTILUS SSN-571 Collision with USS ESSEX CVS-9, April 1967 

I was a junior officer serving in ESSEX in 1967 as a CICWO. At the time of the collision I was soundly asleep in the junior officer bunkroom tucked under the flight deck in the forward section of the ship (We were standing Port and Starboard watches under Condition 1 AS, a modifified form of anti-submarine battle stations) when a loud noise was heard and a brief shudder passed through ESSEX, a 29k ton anti-submarine aircraft carrier. ESSEX went promptly to general quarters which is standard operating procedure for protecting a naval ship in the case of a collision of unknown proportions or a fire not under control as the crew immediately mans their battle ststions, including manning damage control parties, and sets Condition Zebra which secures all water-tight hatches throughout the ship.

ESSEX, her task group comprised of several destroyer and destroyer escorts, and NAUTILUS were conducting exercises in the Virginia Capes Operations Area (VACAPESOPAREA. ESSEX was being replenished underway by a fleet oiler and both ships were being screened by the escorts. The wind was backing and the UNREP ships were altering ROMEO CORPEN (replenishment course) five degrees to port to put the relative wind 355 degree relative to their ship's head. NAUTILUS successfully penetrated the screen and was simulating torpedo attacks when she apparently miscalculated either her submerged depth and/or the course of the mainbody. NAUTILUS's conning tower struck ESSEX which draws 29 to 30 feet depending on how she is loaded, on the forward port quarter of her bow-mounted SONAR. NAUTILUS was believed to roll to starboard and to pass under ESSEX keel rerighting herself as she executed an emergency surfacing procedure in he vicinity of ESSEX elevator on her starboard side, some 500-600 feet from her bow. 

NAUTILUS appeared as though the forward leading corner of her sail area had been bitten cleanly off. Injuries were minor to two NAUTILOS crewman and to a Sonarman First Class in ESSEX. NAUTILUS did not suffer any apparent damage to her nuclear reactor or powerplant. No leaks of radioactive material were reported as testimony to her thorough construction. ESSEX's bow mounted sonar was badly dented/deformed but the ship's water-tight integrity was never breached, and she transited to the Boston Naval Shipyard for repairs and deployed in late May 1967 for an EASTLANT NATO Anti-submarine exercise (ASWEX).",0

 Your comment in the Serbian-Americans talk page 

I was checking that talk page to see if anyone had maybe listed new data to a question I had posed a few months ago and I saw your comment there. I thought it was interesting.

I've never before seen someone else write about an """"American ethnicity"""" the same way I have thought about it. I know that the Southeast has the greatest number of people declaring their ethnicity as American, but I think this ethnic label would apply to the majority of racially White Americans and not just those in the Southeast. The Americans (outside of the South) that descended from pre-20 c. immigrants from the UK, Ireland, and Germany seem to have substantially = meshed together into a """"White ethnic group"""", not just racially, but ethnically as well.

The only cultural differences between ethnic Whites of the North (where 19c. immigrants mostly settled) and those of the South is that the South still experiences religion and social conservatism as very influential forces on daily life. Where for the more recent ethnic Whites, this is not the case (e.g. in the North). So, the distinctive cultural aspects of the South have not been adopted by the ethnic Whites of the North even with several centuries having passed. I do not want to make false generalizations, however this is my sense of the average situation in those regions based on my travels and time spent living here. 

The areas where distinct ethnic identity has been conserved is in the major cities. The city-centred ethnic groups in the US have preserved a substantial part of their culture in absence of preserving their language (for the most part). A few well-known examples would be the Irish- and Italian-Americans of the Northeast. So long as their numbers are high enough to have a large enough community - cultural traditions endure. What I am getting at is that so long as a Ukrainian-American stays in a major city s/he has no reason to be forced into completely adopting a new ethnicity. S/he won't have to abandon the culture of his/her community. If s/he were to move to an area in the Southeast, then it would be a completely different story. 

I'd like to give you a further illustration - the Poles of Chicago. Most arrived somewhere between the 1850s and 1940s or so. Many have had families there for well over a century. There has been very limited migration out of Chicagoland for this period and the Polish community there has remained extremely strong. So there is not much past observation that would suggest that cities are only an entry point from which ethnic communities later break-down as they go their own ways. 

I've written all of this to demonstrate how the """"ethnic Americans"""" and people who ethnically (not racially, but ethnically) identify as """"White"""" are distinct ethnically from the more recent (post-1850) European ethnic communities in the major cities. I find it all very interesting. The only problem that sometimes arises is when individuals do not make the distinction between an """"Ameican""""/""""US citizen"""" and an """"ethnic American"""" and in so doing sometimes end up labeling certain individuals as being un-American. These people, that do not make the distinction, show frustration when a person does not abandon his/her culture and adopt their own. This is of course on an individual-by-individual basis and I would not generalize this in any way to any region or sub-region.

I've seen ethnic hostilities projected towards myself or family/friends from people of all sorts of backgrounds. I've seen it demonstrated by Southerners, New Yorkers, and even Jews in South Florida. By the way, most of the time my ethnicity (and that of family/friends) would have been indeterminable by those people. I'm saying this because I don't want to suggest that any particular regional group of Americans is more racist/discriminant than another region. I've spent a lot of time in South Florida and the racist attitudes that come from some of the people there have been really surprising at times especially when you take into account that many of those racists that I have come across would themselves been the target of racism less than 50 years ago. Its all unfortunate and these types of racist, discriminatory, and nationalistic attitudes are probably present in most countries. 

The good part about our differences is that ethnic Americans and newer Americans have no trouble in cooperating with one another when it comes to maximizing profit. This is not the case in say many areas of the former Yugoslavia or in the areas where ex-Yugoslavs have settled throughout the Western world.

Sorry for the lack of brevity. Your comment was interesting and I wanted to expand on it. Also, I want you to know that none of the above is meant to be offensive towards any group or the US or the US as a whole. Usually when I do",0

 Re: Ridiculous bands listed as supergroups 
I completely agree with this sentiment. Theres something wrong when there are 10+ groups listed as supergroups from 2005-2006. A band that forms with members that have been in previous bands does not automatically make it a supergroup. The last few bands listed dont belong in this article.


 I don't think it should matter whether the previous bands are household names, but I DO think they should be removed from the article if they weren't formed with promotion from previous bands. For example, several of the 2000s bands are promoted as such: Velvet Revolver was promoted as """"Stone Temple Pilots meets Guns n' Roses"""", Audioslave was promoted as """"Soundgarden meets RATM"""", Army of Anyone is being promoted as """"Filter meets STP"""", etc. In other words, bands with promotion like The Raconteurs being """"Jack White with a band"""" aren't supergroups, because they're widely known as Jack White's side project, and NOT """"White Stripes meets The Greenhornes"""".

Whatever it is, it's pretty thin soup, if you'll pardon the pun.  I'd give you CSNY, ELP, Travelling Wilburys, and the Bloomfield-Kooper-Stills session, but the rest are pretty much bands (some great maybe, never even heard of Sky), that sold a lot of records.  

 Ridiculous Bands listed as Supergroups 
It seems that people are using this page to promote their own bands, or own obscure tastes, which they find """"super."""" I agree with the aforementioned, and will weed out some of the lesser-known acts, and those featuring lesser-known musicians. Feel free to restore this page, if you believe that I'm wrong. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) 23:02, December 14, 2004  (UTC)

I believe the text at the top of the page does a pretty good job of explaining the definition (or lack thereof) of the term, and its use as hype.  I think a better tactic than removing information entirely would be to move the """"ridiculous"""" groups, or those who are termed supergroups merely because of membership, not achievement, to a separate heading.  Keep """"Renowned Supergroups"""" at the top, if you like, while putting in an objective criteria for membership in this group (number of albums sold, perhaps?).  Add another heading or two for """"Other Supergroups""""; maybe even """"Failed Supergroups"""", and move the rest of the entries on the list there.

I sympathise with your desire to tidy this up, but removing information completely is seldom the answer.  \talk 23:31, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

There, I've broken it up with the groups you left on the page as """"renowned""""  expect others to move bands in and out of that section.   I'm not entirely happy with the result; I think perhaps a better structure would be to divide the list by decade  I think it might provide a clearer view of which groups have stood the test of time.  What do you think?  \talk 00:07, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)

If none of the members have pages in Wikipedia (I'm looking at you, Misery Index), then it probably isn't a supergroup.

Wow. When I last modified this page, it wasn't absurd. The average person when they end a relationship or employment will go on and find another relationship or job. This page is a tracking of famous musicians and all the new jobs they've started with each other. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  ([[User talk:1",0

My experiences came up on the talk page but once I understood Wikipedia I didn't post anything on the article related to my personal experiences. That was like the 2nd day almost two months ago.

All of my references are verifiable.There's nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation.  I didn't put my experiences in the Judge Edward Nottingham article either although he was my judge.

I went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue. For instance, I wrote to the ABA and asked for their input, and in fact, asked them to work on the article. I also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses, citing references from a lawyers point of view.  Those references were deleted by someone, I can't remember who and don't know why. At this point, the only reference that I posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and I know for sure that is a valid transcript.  The guy who runs the blog is a 3rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers.   Even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration I had references for. I read in the Wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts.

I don't believe that I did any original research. All I did is search the Internet for references for the article.  I really didn't know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before I started working on this article. I had already been thinking about forms based filing but I started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ECF, which date back to 2004.  Also, when I was younger I worked as a systems analyst.

I did get the info on the Laws and Liberties of MA years ago, but Wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway.  Same as the U.N. covenantcan't really hide that.   I didn't add a and b together to prove a point, at least not consciously. Like today, I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the 5th Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone, which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand, who was in the fifth circuit. And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words """"pro se"""" in the 40s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se (No, there was not).  What I found in the 40s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but Judge Learned Hand seemed pro se friendly.

I believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is """"soap boxing"""". I do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business. I've been an entrepreneur. 

I didn't know about the Federal Judicial Center until I started working on this article. That book on appellate procedure I found looking for references for this article. The manual on complex litigation I found looking for references for this article.

Arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself.  One thing I started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation. I ordered the book Slave Nation at the library but I haven't got it yet. But now when I look at pro se law in the different states I think free state, slave state, border state. Also, there were issues related to Indians in some of the western states. The labor union movement had a lot to do with it too, I think. So did the history of workmen's comp, which is of course related to unions.  """,0

So his summaries weren't """"AS"""" antagonistic.  So whichever person is a bit more antagonistic gets the warning.  Good to know.
